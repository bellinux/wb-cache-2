40|$|Romania {{has known}} in the last 20 years a <b>deindustrialisation</b> <b>process</b> (like other CEECs) firstly caused by a {{profound}} system crisis. And for the same 20 years, Romania seems like is running away {{from the idea of}} industrial policy. But {{there is nothing wrong with}} having an industrial policy. The EU has one, and is also promoting it through the Europe 2020 Strategy. industrialisation, private/public investment, macroeconomic public policy...|$|E
40|$|Transport systems {{solutions}} are being intensively employed for {{the satisfaction of}} an ever growing in both quality and sophistication demand, while pressures for greater efficiency and sustainability follow suit. Systems dynamics in the transport industry are hence meant to balance elements of market, society and environment altogether. The traditional segmentation of transport modes within strictly defined markets {{has been replaced by}} competition among the modes over same market segments, while societal and environmental aspects are increasingly equally addressed in transport policies. Demand decoupling for transport follows hence a “Systems to Systems ” reasoning, where all aforementioned aspects interact. Evidently, these complex systems portray the extent of evolution resulting from an impressive trade growth, with the latter being stimulated by structural changes occurring in the global economies. From an international trade point of view, transport systems respond to and link the <b>deindustrialisation</b> <b>process</b> of the developed world and the industrialisation process of the developing. The slow process of structural change may however conceal its inevitable impact on the transport industry...|$|E
40|$|Territorial {{cohesion}} {{is a means}} {{through which}} diversity is transformed into an advantage. Therefore, territorial cohesion creates bonds between economic efficiency, social cohesion and ecological balance. Turda and Câmpia Turzii, both industrial cities, seem hardly {{to adapt to the}} <b>deindustrialisation</b> <b>process</b> due to the small distance to Cluj-Napoca in which is concentrated more than 60 % of the county’s population, more than 80 % of turnover and over 90 % of investments. Distance, division and concentration are currently the enemies for a balanced territorial development determined by the negative competitiveness between large and small cities. This situation creates a hypertrophy of the urban network of Cluj County. Analysing the development degree and the bonds between the main components, they reflect a less viable space with large socio-economic disparities, yet with high territorial potential. The access to means of transportation, the diversity of natural attractions and resources, and being located nearby a large city of international importance are assets that should be valued and transformed into advantages. In this case, economy is the one that sets a certain developing direction for the other components, by influencing labour force quality, migratory growth fluctuations, quality of the environment, and use of natural resources...|$|E
50|$|Deindustrialization or <b>deindustrialisation</b> is a <b>process</b> {{of social}} and {{economic}} change caused by the removal or reduction of industrial capacity or activity in a country or region, especially heavy industry or manufacturing industry. It is the opposite of industrialization.|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} century urban tourism has assumed an {{increasing}} and central role in restructuring the economy of neglected urban centres. As a consequence of this, especially in these recent times, {{a wide range of}} issues have arisen, related to the concepts of sustainability, authenticity and place-identity. Considering these concerns, the present paper aims to investigate this worldwide phenomenon as a key point for the regeneration of historical areas in contemporary cities. There are different reasons for explaining the dereliction of urban areas. It may originate from <b>deindustrialisation</b> <b>processes,</b> from never-repaired wartime damages or by inadequate conservation and preservation policies. Common needs of these areas are: the reconstruction of their image and the replacement of their negative perception to boost the city with physical interventions, economic assistance and social co-operation. The UK and the USA, pioneering countries in the promotion of these activities, offer several practices and interesting case studies for discussions and comparisons. The analysis and the critical evaluation of their current tourism policies could be used in support of the re-enhancement of areas where the development of touristic strategies is still unresolved, such as in the historical centre of Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy). In this particular context, tourism and cultural activities should have an important role in the city, not only from a social and economic point of view, but also to promote its inherited historical aspects. Furthermore, the extensive post-war urban ruins in this area should be strategic tools for the development of the economic and social life, as well as of sustainable urban tourism, considered as a nodal point in the planning and regeneration process...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to compare}} the trajectories of {{selected}} newly industrialising countries in terms of structural change. Using an exploratory method of data analysis, the comparative closeness of the economies is studied over time. The results show that industrialisation is a necessary, albeit insufficient, ingredient for catch-up. The successful growth performances of Asian countries {{are associated with a}} successful industrialisation process accompanied by high export and investment shares. Latin American country performances are less successful, despite initially high industrial shares. Comparing trajcetories with southern European experiences reveals cases of premature <b>deindustrialisation</b> and tertiarisation <b>processes.</b> Copyright The Author 2011.

40|$|Mining {{heritage}} {{is often used}} as a powerful tool in maintaining {{a sense of place}} and national identity, and Sweden is not different in this respect. Another important motive for the revival of the mining past is the opportunity for the economic revitalisation of the space marked by the <b>deindustrialisation</b> <b>process.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate how mining {{heritage is}} interpreted and used for the goals of tourism destination development based on the five provinces in the middle part of Sweden that are called Bergslagen. The first decade of the 2000 s was characterised by the prevailing top-down approach to the regeneration process of the mining landscape of Bergslagen; the process was led by public institutions that were mainly concerned with preserving the cultural heritage left over from the mining era. This resulted in the absence of a diverse and innovative thinking in terms of the touristic development of these destinations. Municipalities in the region ended up with multiple mining sites trying to attract visitors with similar types of experiences based on the limited representations of the regional mining heritage. Enhancing communication between the managers of the mining sites and closer collaboration with other tourism sites in the same region would improve visitation. Additionally, alternative interpretations of the heritage might allow for a wider representation of local people, as well as an awareness of the local or regional heritage of Bergslagen...|$|E
40|$|Norway has, {{particularly}} in the last decade, experienced a trend of relatively rapid deindustrialisation; according to Statistics Norway, as many as 32, 000 jobs in manufacturing have been lost between 2000 and 2004. In this report we ask {{to what extent the}} Norwegian manufacturing industry has shown a tendency to concentrate in particular regions, and, similarly, if there has been a tendency for some regions to specialise in any particular industries. The analysis is based on data from the Manufacturing Time-series database, consisting of plant level data for all Norwegian manufacturing firms from 1972 - 2003, provided by Statistics Norway. The analysis shows {{that there has been a}} substantial reorganisation of the location pattern of manufacturing industries within Norway in this period. A tendency of decreasing specialisation and general convergence in the economic regions of Norway is observed, and, similarly, we have observed an on average steadily decreasing concentration level in the 25 manufacturing industries studied. The <b>deindustrialisation</b> <b>process</b> has by many been feared to lead to increasing concentration in central regions, but these fears may be somewhat subdued by our results as the concentration level on average has decreased. Some characteristics of specialised regions and concentrated industries have emerged from the analysis: A typical specialised economic region is not particularly central, it has a coastline and it is specialised in factor-intensive industries. A concentrated industry, on the other hand, is generally concentrated in more central economic regions, and in regions with a coastline...|$|E
40|$|The {{necessity}} {{of a regional}} development policy at the nowadays’ European Union level has become vital {{since the beginning of}} the enlargement process in 1973 when to those six founding states (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Netherlands) subjoined Great Britain, Ireland and Denmark. In 1957 when European Economic Community was founded, the EU- 6 recorded a similar development level, the regional problems being isolated only in Southern part of Italy. Although on Italy request, the Treaty ascertained the existence of some inequities between prosperity levels of different regions, article 130 was one of the fundamental motives of creating the European Investment Bank, which may be considered one of the regional policy instruments. The enlargement process increased regional problems, major disparities regarding the economic development level being recorded between EU- 6 regions and regions of the new member states (North part of England and North part of Ireland). Rural areas from Denmark and Ireland recorded a precarious development compared with similar areas from member states, and mining regions of Great Britain were confronted with industrial re-conversion problems. These kinds of problems existed even inside member states so that carboniferous regions Lorena (France), Ruhr (Germany), South part of Belgium were strongly affected by the <b>deindustrialisation</b> <b>process.</b> These situations led to the creation of the European Regional Development Fund in 1975 and its main objective at that moment was promoting innovation and infrastructure development in order to adjust the existing discrepancies at the Community level. European Financial instruments, European Regional Development Fund, economic development...|$|E
40|$|At {{the heart}} of urban {{dynamics}} {{over the past few}} decades, the reconversion of riverside and port spaces in cities of the western world is associated with the deindustrialisation of these sites, often situated near historic city centres. This contemporary situation puts industrial heritage conversion at the centre of thinking which goes beyond the mere conservation of the original value of the buildings to question the future of cities, in relation to the notion of sustainability. In New York, after thirty years of neglect, the old railway viaduct known as the “High Line” has been transformed into an elevated, linear urban parkway. The project must be reframed within the Hudson Riverpark operation, an impressive requalification of the Manhattan riverside, also associated with the older Riverside Park. The High Line is a vestige of the first Industrial Revolution, a suggestive, hybrid creation of a flexible morphology mingling infrastructure and building. Its reconversion has succeeded in reactivating growth in {{an important part of the}} Meatpacking district. The operation brings together local authorities, the New York city administration and landowning companies. In the wake of the regeneration of the east bank of Manhattan, its reconversion does not follow the dominant model of waterfront regeneration, pioneered in the United States since the 1960 s. Through its prism, different political, economic and social relationships can be identified (arrival of Michael Bloomberg as mayor, the “railway banking” procedure, the ‘Friends of the High Line’ association), creating a new approach which has already become a reference. From Chicago to Philadelphia, and not forgetting Rotterdam, many cities now envisage the rehabilitation of vast urban sectors in the same way, by converting their railway viaducts in the manner of the High Line. The importance of this operation allows us to consider <b>deindustrialisation</b> as a <b>process</b> capable of engendering a change in the urban territory through an approach at different scales and crossing over existing boarders...|$|R
40|$|Within {{only about}} two years the presumably {{greatest}} experiment of the modern economic history ran into a crisis; namely the integration of a free-market system which ranks a top position in the western world, with the relatively most developped planned economy of the former East Block. In part the faced difficulties are doubtlessly due to the underestimation of the complex nature of changeover and of the adaptation processes. However, an important part also plays the coincidence of political, economical and technological processes which {{in the middle of}} the most critical reunification phases decisively changed the locational conditions in Germany: progressive economical and in part also political integration of Europe, namely the "double opening" to the West and to the East through the domestic EU market and the change of system in the reform states, change of the competition conditions on the worldwide factor and sales markets ("New Industrial Division of Labor") as well as fundamental innovations in technology and organisation. In the presented paper it is tried to assess the repercussions that the German integration and the in line therewith running and at least in part "contraproductive" European and worldwide processes have on the regional development of the old and new states. This is underlined by the hypothesis that the regional development in the reunified Germany substantially depends on the destiny of the industry as the still by far most important regions' "export basis". As reference basis for the considerations on the regional development in Germany the author first presents a theoretical concept for the industrial structures of states and regions and/or for their fundamental change patterns. This is taken as basis for analyses of the change in locational and production conditions for the most important lead branches of the West-German industry as well as of the <b>deindustrialisation</b> <b>process</b> in the East. As further great influence factors of the regional development consideration has to be given to forseeable concept changes of the regional economic policy as well as to the regional repercussions of the progressive European integration. Finally all, on these arguments based principles of future regional development are outlined...|$|E
