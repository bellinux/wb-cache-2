5|$|Though {{the book}} is on its face an {{adventure}} story, a major theme <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a love of education; through this, Milo applies what he has learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love the life that previously bored him. Critics have compared its appeal to that of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and to L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.|$|E
5|$|When {{tissue is}} {{deficient}} or mutilated {{by the loss}} of teeth, implants are placed and allowed to osseointegrate, then the gingiva is surgically moved around the healing abutments. The down-side of a two-stage technique <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> additional surgery and compromise of circulation to the tissue due to repeated surgeries. The choice of one or two-stages, now centers around how best to reconstruct the soft tissues around lost teeth.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{dispersal}} of seeds, or anemochory, {{is one of}} the more primitive means of dispersal. Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer (genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.|$|E

50|$|A {{point of}} {{agreement}} with Deeley <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> larger locomotives to haul heavier trains, but this policy {{failed to get}} past the company's board because of the capital expenditure required (particularly on replacing weak under-bridges).|$|R

25|$|Uninterruptible power {{supplies}} (UPS), where supercapacitors have replaced much larger banks of electrolytic capacitors.

50|$|However, {{irrespective}} of the local factors, the paramount consideration in setting up all these cantonments <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> military camps in various strategic locations of India to establish, maintain and consolidate the rule of a foreign power.|$|R
30|$|By multivariate analysis, factors {{associated}} with hospital mortality <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> mechanical ventilation [OR 2.94 (1.58 – 5.49), p =  0.001], noninvasive ventilation [OR 2.55 (1.26 – 5.19), p =  0.01] and vasopressors [OR 2.65 (1.38 – 5.12), p =  0.003].|$|R
25|$|One of {{the motives}} for {{creating}} a federated Australia <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a common immigration policy. There was much resistance to Chinese immigration {{and the use of}} indentured workers from New Caledonia to work in the Queensland sugar industry.|$|R
25|$|Tibetan Buddhism {{preserves}} the Vajrayana teachings of eighth-century India. Tantric Buddhism is largely concerned with ritual and meditative practices. A central feature of Buddhist Tantra is deity yoga which includes visualization and identification with an enlightened yidam or meditation deity {{and its associated}} mandala. Another element of Tantra <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> ritual initiation or empowerment (abhiṣeka) by a Guru or Lama. Some Tantras like the Guhyasamāja Tantra features new forms of antinomian ritual practice {{such as the use}} taboo substances like alcohol, sexual yoga, and charnel ground practices which evoke wrathful deities.|$|E
25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of the {{transmission electron microscope}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> extremely thin sections of the specimens, typically about 100 nanometers. Creating these thin sections for biological and materials specimens is technically very challenging. Semiconductor thin sections can be made using a focused ion beam. Biological tissue specimens are chemically fixed, dehydrated and embedded in a polymer resin to stabilize them sufficiently to allow ultrathin sectioning. Sections of biological specimens, organic polymers and similar materials may require staining with heavy atom labels {{in order to achieve}} the required image contrast.|$|E
25|$|For {{very large}} heat sinks, {{there is no}} {{substitute}} for the threaded standoff and compression spring attachment method. A threaded standoff is essentially a hollow metal tube with internal threads. One end is secured with a screw through a hole in the PCB. The other end accepts a screw which compresses the spring, completing the assembly. A typical heat sink assembly uses two to four standoffs, which tends to make this the most costly heat sink attachment design. Another disadvantage <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> holes in the PCB.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion The {{prognostic}} {{factors of}} in-hospital death <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> invasive mechanical ventilation, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> vasopressors and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> renal replacement therapy {{in patients with}} hematologic malignancy admitted to ICU. The trend of organ failures {{in the first days}} of ownership also determines the outcome of these patients in ICU.|$|R

50|$|Another {{important}} issue <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a Croat television station within the country. The other constituent nations already have this, {{but it has}} so far <b>been</b> denied to <b>the</b> Croats.

25|$|Powerful {{developments}} in the multidisciplinary field of tissue engineering have yielded a novel set of tissue replacement parts and implementation strategies. Scientific advances in biomaterials, stem cells, growth and differentiation factors, and biomimetic environments have created unique opportunities to fabricate tissues in the laboratory from combinations of engineered extracellular matrices ("scaffolds"), cells, and biologically active molecules. Among the major challenges now facing tissue engineering <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> more complex functionality, as well as both functional and biomechanical stability and vascularization in laboratory-grown tissues destined for transplantation. The continued success of tissue engineering, and the eventual development of true human replacement parts, will grow from the convergence of engineering and basic research advances in tissue, matrix, growth factor, stem cell, and developmental biology, as well as materials science and bio informatics.|$|E
25|$|Pre-combustion CO2 removal is {{much easier}} than CO2 removal from flue gas in {{post-combustion}} capture due to the high concentration of CO2 after the water-gas-shift reaction and the high pressure of the syngas. During pre-combustion in IGCC, the partial pressure of CO2 is nearly 1000 times higher than in post-combustion flue gas. Due to the high concentration of CO2 pre-combustion, physical solvents, such as Selexol and Rectisol, are preferred {{for the removal of}} CO2 vs that of chemical solvents. Physical solvents work by absorbing the acid gases without the need of a chemical reaction as in traditional amine based solvents. The solvent can then be regenerated, and the CO2 desorbed, by reducing the pressure. The biggest obstacle with physical solvents <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the syngas to be cooled before separation and reheated afterwards for combustion. This requires energy and decreases overall plant efficiency.|$|E

[...] Milo repeatedly meets characters to whom words {{are more important than}} their meaning. [...] The Whether Man, for all his talk, is unable to provide Milo with the information or guidance the boy wants, while Officer Shrift's investigation of the overturning of the Word Market contains the forms of law, without justice. The denizens around Digitopolis are little better; the twelve-faced Dodecahedron, named for what he is, turns the logic of his naming on its head when he asks if everyone with one face is called Milo.

40|$|<b>The</b> Workshop <b>was</b> {{successful}} in achieving its main objective of identifying {{a large number}} of technical issues relating to the design of two-phase systems for space applications. The principal concern expressed <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> verified analytical tools that will allow an engineer to confidently design a system to a known degree of accuracy. New and improved materials, for such applications as thermal storage and as heat transfer fluids, were also identified as major needs. In addition to these research efforts, a number of specific hardware needs were identified which will require development. These include heat pumps, low weight radiators, advanced heat pipes, stability enhancement devices, high heat flux evaporators, and liquid/vapor separators. Also identified <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a centralized source of reliable, up-to-date information on two-phase flow in a space environment...|$|R
500|$|In a socioevolutionary approach, Durkheim {{described}} {{the evolution of}} societies from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity (one rising from mutual need). As the societies become more complex, evolving from mechanical to organic solidarity, the division of labour is counteracting and replacing collective consciousness. In the simpler societies, people are connected to others due to personal ties and traditions; in the larger, modern society they are connected due to increased reliance on others with regard to them performing their specialized tasks needed for the modern, highly complex society to survive. In mechanical solidarity, people are self-sufficient, there is little integration and thus there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> use of force and repression to keep society together. Also, in such societies, people have much fewer options in life. In organic solidarity, people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialisation and cooperation is extensive. Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based first on population growth and increasing population density, second on increasing [...] "morality density" [...] (development of more complex social interactions) and thirdly, on the increasing specialisation in workplace. One of the ways mechanical and organic societies differ is the function of law: in mechanical society the law is focused on its punitive aspect, and aims to reinforce the cohesion of the community, often by making the punishment public and extreme; whereas in the organic society the law focuses on repairing the damage done and is more focused on individuals than the community.|$|E
