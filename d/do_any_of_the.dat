25|$|Race kallaura, Moore. Of {{this form}} I have seen {{only a few}} specimens. Judging by the types, which {{are now in the}} {{collection}} of the British Museum, it differs less from the typical form than <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other races. As in N. soma, the markings are small and narrow; the subbasal band of the hindwing is, however, attenuated at each end, and not of even width, underside: ground colour very much paler and somewhat ochraceous, the anterior and posterior sets of spots of the discal series closer together respectively; the postdiscal band on the hindwing equal in width to the subbasal band. Recorded only so far from Travancore.|$|E
25|$|Of these proposals, one {{created by}} 17-year-old Robert G. Heft in 1958 {{as a school}} project {{received}} the most publicity. His mother was a seamstress, but refused to <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work for him. He originally received a B– for the project. After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered. Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the Union in 1959. According to Heft, his teacher did keep to their agreement and changed his grade to an A for the project. The 49- and 50-star flags were each flown {{for the first time}} at Fort McHenry on Independence Day, in 1959 and 1960 respectively.|$|E

She said:I did 80% of the beats on Vespertine and it took me three years to work on that album, because it was all microbeats — it was like doing a huge embroidery piece. Matmos came {{in the last two weeks}} and added percussion on top of the songs, but they didn't <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main parts, and they are credited everywhere as having done the whole album.

500|$|Broderick's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed Dirty Dancing). Much {{of it had}} to be {{scrapped}} {{though as}} Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors' backyards. [...] "I was pretty sore", Broderick said. [...] "I got well enough to do {{what you see in the}} parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we had all this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up". Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed. [...] "It just happened that this was an actual parade, which we put our float into—unbeknownst to anybody, all the people on the reviewing stand. Nobody knew what it was, including the governor." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I have to go in, lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the field}} at the {{beginning}} of a play are two teams of 12 (unlike 11 in American football). The team in possession of the ball is the offence and the team defending is referred to as the defence. Play begins with a backwards pass through the legs (the snap) by a member of the offensive team, to another member of the offensive team. This is usually the quarterback or punter, but a [...] "direct snap" [...] to a running back is also not uncommon.

[...] She was soon interviewed by Lin Sampson for Playboy and reinforced her disagreement with the defence witnesses. In the favourable article, Sampson described the rage against Allan as [...] "the first public showing of {{what would become the}} new South African psychosis". Sunday Times defence witnesses were said to be irate that their shared publisher, Times Media, published the article. The newspaper proceeded to publish an extract of the interview to promote its sister magazine sales.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Taft was a {{powerful}} figure in local and state political and legal circles, and {{he was known as}} a loyal Republican who never threatened to bolt the party.

2500|$|For Luke, the Holy Spirit is {{the driving}} force behind the spread of the Christian message, and he places more {{emphasis}} on it than <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other evangelists. The Spirit is [...] "poured out" [...] at Pentecost, on the first Samaritan and Gentile believers, and on disciples who had been baptised only by John the Baptist, each time as a sign of God's approval. The Holy Spirit represents God's power (At his ascension, Jesus tells his followers, [...] "You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you"): through it the disciples are given speech to convert thousands in Jerusalem, forming the first church (the term is used for the first time in Acts 5).|$|E
2500|$|There are differing {{explanations}} for the apparent collapse of the police force in Mosul. The Guardian quoted an anonymous US diplomat saying [...] "Mosul basically collapsed after he [...] left." [...] Former diplomat Peter Galbraith criticized Petraeus's command of the 101st, saying his achievements have been exaggerated and his reputation is inflated. He wrote for The New York Review of Books that [...] "Petraeus ignored warnings from America's Kurdish allies that he was appointing the wrong people to key positions in Mosul's local government and police." [...] On the other hand, in the book Fiasco, The Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks wrote that [...] "Mosul was quiet while he (Petraeus) was there, and likely would have remained so had his successor had as many troops as he had—and as much understanding of counterinsurgency techniques." [...] Ricks {{went on to say}} that [...] "the population-oriented approach Petraeus took in Mosul in 2003 would be the one the entire U.S. Army in Iraq was trying to adopt in 2006." [...] Time columnist Joe Klein largely agreed with Ricks, writing that the Stryker brigade that replaced the 101st [...] "didn't <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local governance that Petraeus had done". Moving away from counterinsurgency principles, [...] "they were occupiers, not builders." [...] The New York Times reporter Michael Gordon and retired General Bernard Trainor echoed Ricks and Klein, including in their book Cobra II a quote that Petraeus [...] "did it right and won over Mosul".|$|E
2500|$|Both {{popular and}} {{professional}} research articles in cosmology often {{use the term}} [...] "universe" [...] to mean [...] "observable universe". This can be justified {{on the grounds that}} we can never know anything by direct experimentation about any part of the Universe that is causally disconnected from the Earth, although many credible theories require a total universe much larger than the observable universe. No evidence exists to suggest that the boundary of the observable universe constitutes a boundary on the Universe as a whole, nor <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainstream cosmological models propose that the Universe has any physical boundary in the first place, though some models propose it could be finite but unbounded, like a higher-dimensional analogue of the 2D surface of a sphere that is finite in area but has no edge. It is plausible that the galaxies within our observable universe represent only a minuscule fraction of the galaxies in the Universe. According to the theory of cosmic inflation initially introduced by its founder, Alan Guth (and by D. Kazanas [...] ), if it is assumed that inflation began about 10−37 seconds after the Big Bang, then with the plausible assumption that the size of the Universe before the inflation occurred was approximately equal to the speed of light times its age, that would suggest that at present the entire universe's size is at least 3x1023 times the radius of the observable universe. [...] There are also lower estimates claiming that the entire universe is in excess of 250 times larger than the observable universe and also higher estimates implying that the universe is at least 101010122 times larger than the observable universe.|$|E
