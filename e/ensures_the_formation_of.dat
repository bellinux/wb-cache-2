40|$|SummaryThe {{formation}} of macromolecular complexes within the crowded environment of cells often requires aid from assembly chaperones. PRMT 5 and SMN complexes mediate this {{task for the}} assembly of the common core of pre-mRNA processing small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). Core formation is initiated by the PRMT 5 -complex subunit pICln, which pre-arranges the core proteins into spatial positions occupied in the assembled snRNP. The SMN complex then accepts these pICln-bound proteins and unites them with small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Here, we have analyzed how newly synthesized snRNP proteins are channeled into the assembly pathway to evade mis-assembly. We show that they initially remain bound to the ribosome near the polypeptide exit tunnel and dissociate upon association with pICln. Coincident with its release activity, pICln <b>ensures</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> cognate heterooligomers and their chaperoned guidance into the assembly pathway.
