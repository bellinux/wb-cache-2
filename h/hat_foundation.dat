Inspired by the story, she teamed with Ericsdottir in 2010 to form an NGO named the Golden <b>Hat</b> <b>Foundation.</b> The organisation aims to create autism awareness and was named after a poem written by Thorsteinsson. As the brand ambassador of the luxury brands Lancôme and Longines, Winslet partnered with these companies to raise awareness and funds for the foundation.

40|$|Open {{approaches}} to operational work in organizations (e. g., crowdsourcing and open source development) {{have been of}} particular interest to information systems (IS) researchers. Recently, organizations, including IBM, Red <b>Hat</b> and Wikimedia <b>Foundation,</b> have also embraced openness principles for strategic work (e. g., planning, forming and implementing strategy). Little is known about such “open strategy” and, within it, the (critical) role of information technology (IT). Definitions and conceptualizations of open strategy in the literature are vague and inconsistent. In the study reported in this paper, we have reviewed the emerging literature on open strategy. By analysing the characteristics most commonly attributed to open strategy, we propose a consolidated definition of open strategy. Furthermore, we develop an open strategy process model and use it to re-analyse four open strategy case studies. This analysis contributes to our conceptual understanding of open strategy and of what is required for open strategy to work in practice...|$|R

In diesem Beitrag werde ich einige Überlegungen und methodologische Reflexionen präsentieren, die aus dem Euroqual-Workshop "Archives and Life-History Research" erwachsen sind, der vom 21. bis zum 23. September 2009 in Madrid veranstaltet wurde. Im Besonderen geht es mir um ein Phänomen, das ich als Sensitivität für Archivierung und biografische Forschung bezeichnen möchte. Es ist essenziell wichtig mit Blick auf Forschungsqualität, Forschungsökonomie und auf ein Verständnis von Forschung als einem bewahrenswerten Gut. In diesem Zusammenhang werde ich einige Beispiele aus europäischen Ländern hinzuziehen,um die besondere Situation in Spanien zu verdeutlichen. URN: [URL] This FQS {{issue on}} {{archives}} and biographical methods {{is a special}} occasion to inform about a European initiative for the promotion and exchange of experiences of qualitative research in the social sciences. The whole project {{was designed as a}} a four-year (2006 - 2010) European Science Foundation program known by the acronym EUROQUAL. This article intends to provide some ideas and methodological reflections arising from the Madrid EUROQUAL -Workshop on Archives and Life-History Research (21 - 23 September 2009). The key point concerns what I suggest to name archival and biographical research "sensitivity. " It {{has to do with the}} issues of research quality, research economy and the conception of social research as patrimony. Approaches in the European landscape also serve to highlight the contrasting situation in Spain. URN: [URL] Este número especial de FQS, sobre archivos y métodos biográficos, es una ocasión especial para informar y debatir acerca de una iniciativa europea de promoción e intercambio de experiencias de investigación cualitativa en ciencias sociales.

En este artículo se pretende aportar algunas ideas y reflexiones metodológicas surgidas en el Taller sobre Archivos e Investigación de Historias de Vida celebrado en Madrid (21 - 23 Septiembre 2009).   El meollo de la cuestión puede resumirse con la expresión sensibilidad investigadora de archivo y biográfica. Tiene que ver con los aspectos de calidad y economía de la investigación, así como con la concepción de la investigación social en tanto patrimonio.
