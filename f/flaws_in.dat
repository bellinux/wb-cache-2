5|$|Davies {{also notes}} two <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> Rhys's achievement. One was the {{personal}} {{nature of his}} accord with Henry II, which meant {{that it did not}} survive Henry's death. The other was his inability to control his sons and to force the other sons to accept Gruffydd as his successor.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} deals with current affairs (primarily the Great Recession). It confronts <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> {{government}} action {{to end the}} global recession, also touching on the political situation in Israel and climate change. A Flash Flood of Colour demonstrated Enter Shikari's continued fusion of electronic and rock music influences. The album's cover depicts an inverted social hierarchy.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews, with critics praising it {{as a fine}} example in the adventure gaming genre. While most critics agreed the game addressed many <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> The Sleeping Dragon, it has also received some criticism, particularly for its rushed ending and at times poor controls.|$|E
5|$|Acid2 {{is a test}} page {{published}} and promoted by the Web Standards Project to expose web page rendering <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> web browsers and other applications that render HTML. Named after the acid test for gold, it {{was developed in the}} spirit of Acid1, a relatively narrow test of compliance with the Cascading Style Sheets 1.0 (CSS1) standard, and was released on 13 April 2005. As with Acid1, an application passes the test if the way it displays the test page matches a reference image.|$|E

In interviews and technical papers he has stated that <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> most major programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, Delphi, and Smalltalk) drove the fundamentals of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which, in turn, drove {{the design of the}} C# language itself.|$|E

5|$|In December 2004, a University of California, Los Angeles {{study by}} former fellows of a {{conservative}} think tank gave The New York Times a score of 73.7 on a 100-point scale, with 0 being most conservative and 100 being most liberal, making it the second-most liberal major newspaper in the study after The Wall Street Journal (85.1). The validity of the study has been questioned, however. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America pointed out potential conflicts of interest with the author's funding, and political scientists, such as Brendan Nyhan, cited <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> the study's methodology.|$|E
5|$|Initially, many {{physicists}} {{hoped that}} by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, {{it might be}} possible to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise, a phenomenon known as chirality. Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Knight {{doubts that}} Clarence13X {{set out to}} build a {{movement}} or a culture, but after his death, the movement expanded and gained converts across the United States. Five Percenters have celebrated Clarence13X's birthday as a holiday, and minimized the descriptions of his <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> their accounts of his life. Numerous apocryphal stories from his life have circulated among the group; some accounts have claimed that he gambled only {{as a means to}} reach others with his teachings. He did not leave behind a record of his teachings, and the group had few formalized tenets {{at the time of his}} death. In the following decades, the group's doctrine became more complicated.|$|E

Jefferson also displaced two district judgesRay Greene and Jacob Readciting technical <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> their appointments. Further, District Judge John Pickering was impeached {{and removed}} from office on a party-line vote. The following day, the House impeached Justice Samuel Chase, but six Democratic-Republicans crossed party lines in the Senate to prevent his conviction by a single vote.|$|E
5|$|On 12 February 2003, Dechaineux was {{operating}} near her maximum safe diving depth {{off the coast}} of Western Australia when a seawater hose burst. The high-pressure seawater flooded the lower engine room before the hose was sealed off: it was estimated that if the inflow had continued for another twenty seconds, the weight of the water would have prevented Dechaineux from returning to the surface. The RAN recalled the Collins-class submarines to base after the incident; after engineers were unable to determine any <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> the pipes that could have caused the incident, the maximum safe diving depth of the class was reduced.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{peculiar}} fact {{associated with the}} episode was a letter by Senator Hillary Clinton and Representative John M. McHugh addressed to show character Josh Lyman, concerning the closing of an upstate New York army base. Josh {{points out that the}} deep-snow training base of Fort Drum is relatively useless in a time when most wars take place in desert terrain. Clinton and McHugh wrote a tongue-in-cheek response pointing out <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> Lyman’s reasoning.|$|E

5|$|Quadrophenia was {{released}} {{to a positive}} reception in both the UK and the US, but the resulting tour was marred with problems with backing tapes replacing the additional instruments on the album, and the stage piece was retired in early 1974. It was revived in 1996 with a larger ensemble, and a further tour occurred in 2012. The album made {{a positive impact on}} the mod revival movement of the late 1970s, and the resulting film adaptation, released in 1979, was successful. The album has been reissued on compact disc several times, and seen a number of remixes that corrected some perceived <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> the original.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass escapes {{the plant}} in a gas mask and meets up with Leo, whom he finds {{unconscious}} in his car nearby. With little time left to prevent more ammonids returning in meteorites, he and Leo are forced to use the Quatermass II to attempt to destroy the asteroid, despite the known <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> the rocket's design and its liability to explode. They return to the Rocket Group, but British Paratroopers led by Johnny Dillon {{take control of the}} firing base.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} in Cambridge Water Co made an immediate {{change to the}} law, {{for the first time}} requiring foreseeability of harm to be considered in cases brought under Rylands v Fletcher and the general tort of nuisance. It was also significant in implying that Rylands was not an independent tort, something later concluded in the Transco case. Goff's judgment has been criticised on several points by academics, who highlight <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> wording which leave parts of the judgment ambiguous and a selective assessment of Rylands that ignores outside influences.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} Jens Wehner {{notes that}} the German-language version of the book was immensely popular in Germany, but contained serious <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> terms of presentation of historical realities. These included the uncritical borrowing from the Nazi propaganda elements of the Fliegerasse ("aces") and stereotypes about the Soviet Union. According to Wehner, the latter could {{be traced to the}} prevailing attitudes during the Cold War. Further, the political and social consequences of World War II were completely ignored.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} gained {{legal aid}} {{to launch the}} judicial review and argued that there were <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> the planning process. The review took place on 18–19 December 2012 in Manchester {{to decide whether the}} council's planning process was legal. The judge reserved his decision for a month, but decided to reject RURA's claim to quash the planning permission. The final legal action from RURA came to an end after an unsuccessful challenge was made to the Court of Appeal in March 2013.|$|E
5|$|The tests {{conducted}} {{in preparation for}} the parade revealed a number of <b>flaws</b> <b>in</b> the design including poor directional stability, a cramped cockpit without heating or ventilation, poor access to the engine, inadequate fuel capacity, compounded by the lack of a fuel gauge, and poor elevator control forces. Five aircraft were modified to correct these issues before resuming the factory's testing in late 1946. The modifications were not entirely successful and the lateral stability was now too great and the elevator forces remained too weak. Engine problems, however, plagued the tests as the first prototype alone required four engine changes.|$|E
