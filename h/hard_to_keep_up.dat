5|$|Parry's {{opportunity}} to study music {{came in the form}} of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had the good fortune to become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony made him want to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.|$|E

In 1954 he formed a partnership with Francis Sams, specializing in corporate law. Over the next decade, he established himself as one of Miami's most prominent attorneys. In 1966, the Miami News called him [...] "Dade's knight" [...] and wrote of him that [...] "the name Dan Paul comes up in so many civic controversies that it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with him".

500|$|For the Daenerys {{scene at}} the {{beginning}} of the episode where the three dragons burn part of the Masters' fleet, Sapochnik credited VFX supervisor Joe Bauer and producer Steve Kullback for post-production work: [...] "For this sequence David and Dan said that what they wanted to see was a 'demonstration' of what's to come. So I tried to approach it in the most elegant, epic, big-movie way I could." [...] The director tried to design the shots with relative realism, inspired by footage of World War II Supermarine Spitfires in action. He based the dragon shots on wildlife footage, allowing them to break the frame: [...] "These things should be so big and fast it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with them." [...] To insert Emilia Clarke (as Daenerys Targaryen) into the scene, she rode a [...] "multi-directional, computer-controlled hydraulic gimbal device shaped like the upper shoulders of the dragon"; Clarke was filmed separately in Belfast, Northern Ireland.|$|E

[...] She ended with: [...] "It's convoluted. Frankly {{no one should}} {{have to think that}} <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the Joes." [...] Another negative review came from Variety Magazines Justin Chang, who ridiculed the movie's large-scale destruction of foreign cities, writing: [...] "Audiences who thrilled to the sight of Paris under biochemical attack in Cobra will be pleased to watch London endure an even more horrific fate here, although the sequence is tossed off in quick, almost ho-hum fashion, with no time to dwell on anything so exquisitely crass as the spectacle of the Eiffel Tower collapsing." [...] He summarized the movie as [...] "a more straight-faced brand of idiocy than its cheerfully dumb 2009 predecessor." ...|$|E

Holy Soap later said [...] "If there's one thing that Ruby seems to have inherited from Charlie, it's her sometimes questionable taste in men." [...] When Ruby impressed everyone with her singing voice, the Daily Record said [...] "there is actually a rather pleasant storyline involving Ruby". They described the week Ruby slept with Romeo as an eventful one for her and opined she was on [...] "cloud nine". Debbie Schipp writing for Adelaide's Sunday Mail brands Ruby [...] "a low-down boyfriend-stealer" [...] for her affair with Romeo. Caroline Fitton writing for Daily Mail observed Ruby as being [...] "self-absorbed". TV Week said the [...] "impulsive teen" [...] waited until Romeo dropped his guard and [...] "moved in for the kill", but had her [...] "head in the clouds". They correctly predicted it would end [...] "messy". They also showed Ruby little sympathy when she told Indigo about her affair and lost her friends. They said: [...] "The salient lesson here is: don't cop off with your best mate's boyfriend, so you're just gonna have to ride this one out, Rubes." [...] Peter Dyke writing for the Daily Star said Ruby is a [...] "randy schoolgirl" [...] and said that her romance with Casey was merely a [...] "passionate rebound romp". Whilst Erin Miller of TV Week said: [...] "Phew, it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with Ruby's romantic escapades lately!"

2500|$|The {{hardships of}} postwar Bulgaria made the family emigrate to Paris in December 1952. At first {{they stayed in}} the Lion d'Argent hotel near Les Halles, where Georges found a job, then {{for the next four}} years they stayed in a single room at the Angleterre Hotel. Young Sylvie had to work <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> at school and blend in with her schoolmates. She spent two years {{learning}} French. In 1960, her family moved to an apartment in Michel Bizot Avenue. Thanks to the influence of her music producer brother Eddie, music became teenage Sylvie's main interest. Her most influential genres were Jazz and, out of spite toward her strict high school, Rock 'n' Roll. Her favourite artists [...] included Brenda Lee, Bill Haley, and Elvis Presley.|$|E

2500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from most contemporary music critics. Scott Shetler from [...] "Pop Crush" [...] gave the song 8 out of 10 stars, and {{wrote that the}} song [...] "is more understated {{than some of the}} group’s previous work, but it feels like a potential summer hit." [...] Bill Lamb, writer of About.com, gave to the song 3 stars out of 5, praising the [...] "catchy hook" [...] and the [...] "upbeat, happy melody", but criticized the track, calling it a [...] "bland hit factory pop" [...] and [...] "faceless". He ended up the review, stating that [...] "it's certainly catchy, but it is all rather bland and empty as well." [...] The Idolator Staff agreed, writing that [...] "On the one hand, it’s a totally serviceable dance track, and Sabi’s vocals are much stronger here than in her weak, cringe-inducing rap on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful", but on the other hand, we’ve heard this synth hook before from other artists and frankly, it sounds like Cobra Starship may be trying too <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with the Euro dance trend while totally abandoning their old sound."

2500|$|Critics' {{reviews of}} This Addiction have {{generally}} complimented the album's production and Dan Andriano's contributions, while criticizing Matt Skiba's vocals and lyrical themes. Both Drew Beringer of AbsolutePunk and Scott Heisel of Alternative Press {{noted that the}} production effectively blends hints of the band's early sound with the more polished rock style of their later years, with Beringer remarking that it [...] "captures the vibe of the album nicely" [...] and Heisel commenting that it [...] "still sounds like a slick, polished Alkaline Trio album, mainly because the band have evolved {{to a point where}} they want their sound to come off as slick and polished." [...] Both praised Andriano's writing and singing, with Beringer noting that he [...] "only leads on three tracks, but sounds fantastic in each, especially in album closer, 'Fine'." [...] Heisel stated that [...] "His three cuts (including the spectacular [...] "Off the Map") are sufficiently poppy without being dumbed down." [...] Skiba's vocals received more criticism: Beringer stated that [...] "some of [...] weakest material shows up here" [...] and that he [...] "sounds awesome on the title track and 'The American Scream', [...] falls flat on blunders like 'Draculina' and 'Piss and Vinegar. Heisel criticised Skiba for [...] " [...] back too frequently on his well-worn lyrical themes of drugs (the title track) and death ('The American Scream'). It's moments like these where it feels like he's trying too <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> appearances with his band's more fairweather fans." [...] Corey Apar of Allmusic felt similarly, saying that [...] "it would have been nice to hear [...] more, especially since Skiba's lyrics leave much to be desired." [...] Michael French of Punknews.org shared this sentiment, saying that Skiba's lyrics [...] "aren't necessarily bad, but they've been significantly dumbed down; Matt once turned cliché into clever and cunning commentary--now they just lack personality and the clichés are just, well...cliché." ...|$|E

60|$|This last {{cause is}} important. It cannot be removed by any {{economic}} readjustment. If every family {{were provided with}} 10,000 pounds a year tomorrow, women would still refuse {{more and more to}} continue bearing children until they are exhausted whilst numbers of others are bearing no children at all. Even if every woman bearing and rearing a valuable child received a handsome series of payments, thereby making motherhood a real profession as it ought to be, the number of women able or willing to give more of their lives to gestation and nursing than three or four children would cost them might not be very large if the advance in social organization and conscience indicated by such payments involved also the opening up of other means of livelihood to women. And it must be remembered that urban civilization itself, insofar as it is a method of evolution (and when it is not this, it is simply a nuisance), is a sterilizing process as far as numbers go. It is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> the supply of elephants than of sparrows and rabbits; and for the same reason it will be <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> the supply of highly cultivated men and women than it now is of agricultural laborers. Bees get out of this difficulty by a special system of feeding which enables a queen bee to produce 4,000 eggs a day whilst the other females lose their sex altogether and become workers supporting the males in luxury and idleness until the queen has found her mate, when the queen kills him and the quondam females kill all the rest (such at least are the accounts given by romantic naturalists of the matter).|$|R

50|$|Note that Rindler {{observers}} {{with smaller}} constant x coordinate are accelerating <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up.</b> This may seem surprising because in Newtonian physics, observers who maintain constant relative distance must {{share the same}} acceleration. But in relativistic physics, {{we see that the}} trailing endpoint of a rod which is accelerated by some external force (parallel to its symmetry axis) must accelerate a bit harder than the leading endpoint, or else it must ultimately break. This is a manifestation of Lorentz contraction. As the rod accelerates its velocity increases and its length decreases. Since it is getting shorter, the back end must accelerate harder than the front. Another {{way to look at it}} is: the back end must achieve the same change in velocity in a shorter period of time. This leads to a differential equation showing, that at some distance, the acceleration of the trailing end diverges, resulting in the Rindler horizon.|$|R
