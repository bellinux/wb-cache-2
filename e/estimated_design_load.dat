40|$|Numerical {{analysis}} to evaluate slamming is today accurate but rather time consuming. The industry lacks a practical method to predict slamming on appendages {{in a simple}} manner since the simulation cost is too high. This paper examines a numerical method simulated in OpenFOAM, with use of the interDyMFoam utility and the volume of fluid method (VOF). The method is verified through recreation of two drop test experiments along with a fin equipped hull. The hull is compared to the <b>estimated</b> <b>design</b> <b>load</b> proposed by ABS whilst the experiments are compared to the experimental data along with similar research executed with alternative methods. It {{was found that the}} investigated method predicts the slamming load of the experiments with an accuracy of ± 20 %. A result that can be reduced to ± 5 − 10 % with use of a finer mesh. The slamming duration is not captured with decent accuracy and future research to improve the surface definition is needed to improve the overall accuracy...|$|E

In this paper, image analysis techniques are utilised to estimate the amount of material within the flights of a rotating drum and to determine the optimum loading condition. Multiple photographs of the cross-sectional area of both flight borne and airborne solids within the dryer at different loading conditions are processed.

The modules contain specialized equipment for use in particle physics experiments. The design review of the D-Zero Central Calorimeter Module Assembly evaluated all major structural elements for adequacy for their <b>design</b> <b>loads.</b> They were evaluated in accordance with applicable specifications from Reference 1. The allowable stresses of the Specifications provide an approximate safety factor of 2. 0 or more on failure and 1. 67 on serviceability of the structure. This margin is typical of buildings, bridges, and other large structures executed in steel. To the extent that calculated stresses are less than the allowable stresses, the margin is proportionately greater. For additional conservatism to account for inherent uncertainties in <b>estimating</b> <b>design</b> <b>loads,</b> an arbitrary load factor of 1. 25 was also applied. <b>Design</b> <b>loads</b> were calculated for deadwe 1 ghted plus thermal expansion, neglecting the effects of friction, and for deadweight only, considering postulated effects of friction. All of the major structural elements {{were found to be}} provisionally acceptable for their intended service and the predicted <b>design</b> <b>loads.</b> The provisions are as follows: (1) That the connect pins be fabricated of Inconel 718 or functional equivalent, instead of the originally specified Type 304 stainless steel; and (2) That conditions on bearing surfaces be modified to effectively reduce the potential coefficient of friction.

The borehole jack (BHJ) is an ISO approved tool for assessing the in-situ confined compressive strength of ice. On request from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), a BHJ was made by M-Tech and delivered to the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) in 2010. This work presents a technical description of the UNIS-BHJ as well as calibration instructions and experimental setup. A classification system of stress &# 150; time curves has been developed with focus on post-peak stress behavior. Three field campaigns have been conducted, two in Van Mijenfjorden (first-year level ice) {{and one in the}} Barents Sea (young and rafted ice) in March and April 2012. The new classification system proved convenient when used for classifying the results of these experiments. An advantage is that the system is applicable for all BHJs, hence allowing comparisons of different works to be made regardless of the BHJ used. Investigations of the spatial variation of borehole (BH) strength were also done. Sampling areas of sizes 100 by 100 m and 10 by 10 meters were established in Van Mijenfjorden, where both concluded mean BH strength of 16. 8 MPa with STD of the larger area 1. 9 MPa and the smaller 0. 3 MPa.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the extreme values of {{tension in the}} mooring lines on Hywind Demo is investigated. Hywind Demo is a {{floating}} wind turbine developed by Statoil ASA. The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate the application of the environmental contour line method on the wind turbine. The environmental contour line method will be compared to a full long term analysis of the extreme response. It is expected that a full long term analysis will give a good <b>estimates</b> of the <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> and can be used to calibrate the contour line method. Since the long term analysis is very time demanding for complex non-linear systems it will be very beneficial if good <b>estimates</b> of <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> can be found with the environmental contour line method, which is a simplified less time demanding approach. Both methods requires a rather refined formulation of the environment in case of a joint probability model. An existing environmental model has been adapted to fit measurements from the Hywind Demo location. Numerous 3 hour time domain simulations has been executed as part of the long term analysis. From each time domain simulations extreme values of the response are collected and response surfaces are fitted for the extreme values and the Gumbel coefficients. Based on the response surfaces the <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> can be calculated based on a long term formulation and on the inverse first order reliability method. The environmental model is used to form contour surfaces corresponding to given return periods. By evaluation of the extreme values on the contour surface a design point can be defined for each case. The short term variation is examined in detail at the design point to identify a proper percentile level in the short term distribution corresponding to the <b>design</b> <b>load.</b> It is found that the long term formulation and the first order reliability method gives agreeing results. In addition it is found that the short term variation is small for the tension extrema in the mooring lines. This implies that the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> could be properly estimated by the median value in the short term extreme distribution at the design point. On the other hand by inspecting the mooring line tension's dependence on the wind parameter an inconsistency is found. Consequently important principles of the contour line method are violated. This inconsistency is blamed on the active control system regulating the rotor speed of the turbine. It is based on this concluded that the contour line method is unsuitable for application on Hywind Demo and that it should be used with care on other structures where control systems or for other reasons the load history is not strictly increasing. ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis {{has been the}} {{development}} of a new method for load modelling of buildings in mixed energy distribution systems. The method <b>estimates</b> <b>design</b> <b>load</b> profiles, yearly load profiles, load duration profiles and annual expected energy demand for a specified planning area, all divided into heat and electricity purposes. The heat load demand includes end-uses such as space heating, ventilation heating and hot tap water, while electricity load demand includes end-uses such as lighting, pumps, fans, and electrical appliances. The model has been based on statistical analyses of simultaneous hourly district heat and electricity consumption data for a number of buildings. Consumption data have been collected from TEV Fjernvarme and BKK Varme, two district heating companies in Trondheim and Bergen respectively. The heat load model has been based on piece-wise linear regression analyses to estimate the change-point temperature for temperaturedependent heat consumption. Linear regression analyses have been performed on the temperature-dependent consumption for all hours of the day for two different day types, weekdays and weekends/holidays. The normal distribution has been used on the temperature-independent consumption, which is mainly hot tap water. Expected values and standard deviations for all buildings analysed have been calculated for both temperature-dependent and temperature-independent consumption. The electricity load model has been based on continuous probability distributions, such as normal distribution, lognormal distribution and Student’s t distribution. The last distribution has shown the best fit for all hours and day types in most cases. Expected values and standard deviations for all buildings analysed have been calculated for winter, spring/fall and summer seasons. Generalised relative load profiles have been developed for various building categories based on the heat and electricity load model. Single family houses and apartment blocks, office buildings, educational buildings, hospital buildings, and hotels and restaurants are the building categories that have been analysed. Specific heat and electricity load and energy indicators, given in [W/m 2] and [kWh/m 2], have also been developed for all building categories. The specific load indicators have been used to restore the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> profiles from relative to real values in order to find the maximum heat and electricity demand for a specified planning area. The specific energy indicators have been used to convert the normalised yearly load profiles, and consequently, the normalised load duration profiles into real values. A method for load aggregation for a specified planning area has also been developed based on the sum of independent variables from the same distribution. 95 % quantile analysis based on the Student’s t distribution has been applied to incorporate the uncertainty in the load profiles developed. The installed capacity, and thereby the investment costs for the energy production unit(s) and distribution system(s), are decided by the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> profiles and load duration profiles. The system’s operation costs are given by the yearly load profiles and annual expected energy demand. A theoretical case study has been performed to illustrate how to apply the generalised relative load profiles, along with the specific load and energy indicators, for the purpose of planning for mixed energy distribution systems.

In wind engineering, a major issue at the present time is to formulate a rational method of <b>estimating</b> <b>design</b> wind <b>loads</b> in different parts of the country, the building code in current use is not consistent- with published estimates 13; of extremes, which in turn are at best only, in broad qualitative agreement with each other. A thorough re-examination is therefore called for. The mean winds appear well-understood, and are dominated by the monsoons and the presence of the remnants of the Findlater jet that blows across the Arabian Sea. The country is generally characterised by a relatively high extreme/mean ratio, posing difficult problems for the windmill designer. A variety of statistical data needed for wind energy applications is now available, including duration curves, 13; probability distributions etc., the need here is now for detailed microsurveys. The variation of monthly means over the year can be compactly described in terms of two empirically defined orthogonal modes, corresponding roughly to the south-west and north-east monsoons.

40|$|A general {{formulation}} {{is presented}} {{for the analysis}} of arching in soils {{as an extension of the}} conventional shear plane approach, in which the slip surfaces within the soil mass are considered as vertical planes. Such an assumption results in a low <b>estimate</b> of the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> on the yielding buried structure because of a considerable separation between the assumed vertical slip surfaces and the actual curved slip surfaces. The arching theory presented in this paper overcomes this limitation of the conventional theory by assuming inclined slip surfaces close to the actual slip surfaces. Based on this concept, an analytical expression for the vertical stress on the yielding structure is derived; a special case of this general expression reduces to the conventional expression. The variation of the vertical stress on the yielding structure with depth has been presented graphically along with a comparison with the conventional vertical shear plane approach. It is observed that the amount of arching increases with increase in the ratio of depth to width of the yielding structure as reported in the literature...|$|R

In addition, reliability analysis in combination with NLFEA results and safety assessments provide an insight into consistency of the safety assessments recommendations related to targeted safety. However, various complications arise regarding the appropriate constitutive model {{to be used in}} analysis, estimation and inclusion of modelling uncertainty in results from nonlinear finite element analysis, unavailability of a suitable function that defines the response of a structure when subjected to a certain load etc. In this additional thesis, a case study is performed to study the combination of structural safety assessment and reliability analysis using nonlinear finite element analysis. A wall specimen experimented by Lefas et. al is selected for the study [1]. Solution strategy is adopted based on the recommendations ofDutch guidelines with some deviations [2]. The nonlinear finite element analyses are performed inDIANA 10. 1. Since only one solution strategy was used during the analysis of a single wall specimen, the modelling uncertainty parameters were estimated using results from previous studies[3]. The modelling uncertainty parameters were estimated to be, µm Æ 1. 21 and Vµ Æ 6. 88 %. These parameters infer that the results obained from different solution strategies were close to each other but still had a considerable bias with respect to the structural capacity obtained from the experimental values. The NLFEA underestimated the capacity as compared to experimental results. Only 79. 3 % of the experimental capacity was realized from NLFEA. Three different safety format methods suggested in [2] and a new safety format method by Schlune et al. [4] are used in NLFEA to <b>estimate</b> the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> capacity. The effect of inclusion of estimated model uncertainty parameters on <b>design</b> <b>load</b> capacity is observed too. The results of safety assessments indicated that the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> <b>estimated</b> by using ECOV and Schlune et al. safety format are comparatively higher than using Partial Safety Factor and Global Resistance Factor, but still conservative with respect to the experimental results. The reliability of the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> <b>estimated</b> by using different safety assessment methods is checked using response surface method and first order reliability methods. A response surface method together with FORM is used to obtain a quadratic limit state function that closely represents the response of the structural wall subjected to the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> value. The limit state function thus obtained is then used for FORM analysis, Importance sampling and/or Monte Carlo simulations to observe if the intended safety level is achieved. The study of acheived reliability index indicated that the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> values <b>estimated</b> by using three safety formats recommended in [2] are conservative, whereas the one estimated by using Schlune et al. format was found to be non-conservative. The additional thesis was carried out with various approximations and limitations. All limitations and approximations are explained in detail and justified where necessary and possible. The results and discussions of this additional thesis are dependent only on a single solution strategy adopted in a single wall specimen and in a single failure mode. Therefore, the results should instead be interpreted as an indication of need of further and extensive research and studies required in the field of reliability analysis and safety assessment using nonlinear finite element analysis.

In this paper <b>design</b> <b>load</b> experiments carried out in a horizontal, pilot scale flighted rotary dryer at different experimental conditions are described.

The study examined both free flowing and cohesive solids with cohesion being controlled through the addition of low volatility fluid to the solids (dynamic angle of repose ranged from 44. 7 ° to 62. 3 °).

40|$|In {{order to}} design a {{drilling}} riser, {{it is essential to}} know the long-term extreme loads on the riser when it is exposed to a harsh environmental condition. Multiplying the long-term extreme response by a safety factor, the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> on the riser is obtained and the riser can be designed to withstand the <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> in it`s whole service life. While the drilling operation is performed for a short period, there is the probability that the drilling riser is exposed to a 1 -year, 10 -year, 100 -year or even a 10000 -year in that short period. On the other hand, there are some environmental limitation for drilling operation that are provided by the riser`s and drilling vessel`s manufactures. In general, estimating the long-term extreme response of the offshore structures can be conducted by various methods depending {{on the nature of the}} structure and the loads under consideration. The loads on the risers are of nonlinear nature even if the risers are exposed to the harmonic loads. This is due to the quadratic term of the wave particle velocity in the Morison equation that is coupled with nonlinear structural behavior. Therefore, the long-term extreme response of the drilling risers cannot be estimated correctly by deterministic design wave and design storm methods. The best and the most exact method is performing a full long-term analysis of structure in order to <b>estimate</b> the <b>design</b> <b>loads.</b> This method is the recommended method for obtaining the <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> for the final design. The full long-term analysis presents no problem for linear response problems, but may to some extent be inconvenient for nonlinear response problems that requires time domain simulations and/or model tests in order to establish the short-term distribution of the 3 -hour extreme response. The full long-term analysis is the recommended method for the final design. However, this method is very time consuming and in some cases very expensive to conduct; when model tests are required. Correspondingly, in the preliminary design, it was decided to use a short-term approach to estimate the long-term extremes. The contour line method provides this possibility to estimate the long-term extremes from the short-term distribution of the response under consideration. However, the estimated responses from the contour line methods are approximately 10 % smaller than the true value. In order to conduct the contour line method, literature studies with respect to the following items are performed and the results are presented in this report: 1. Short-term and long-term modelling of the waves 2. Different types of the structures with respect to their linearity 3. Methods for estimating the extreme response on the structures 4. different methods for investigating the uncertainty associated with establishing the short-term distribution of the response under consideration 5.

40|$|AbstractThe {{nonlinear}} wave impact {{forces on}} marine structures {{can lead to}} severe damage even collapse of the structures. The seawater intake caisson of the desalination plant located at Agatti Island, UT of Lakshadweep, India experienced high wave breaking forces resulting in the strengthening of the structure. When a wave breaks directly on the intake structure, the resulting impact wave force is severe and wave pressure distribution on the intake structure depends on the nonlinear wave transformation over finite water depth. A clear understanding of these impact wave forces on the caisson is required to optimize the design of similar structures in future. Hence, an attempt is made to undertake full scale investigations in field to measure the dynamic wave pressures on the caisson and compare the results with the existing theoretical and numerical methods. These measurements are intended to validate the existing formula for <b>estimating</b> <b>design</b> wave <b>load</b> and to construct a numerical model for the real field condition, which is required for design of similar structures in other islands of UT Lakshadweep. This paper treats a full scale measurement of pressure fields on a vertical wall under wave impacts which also present complete experimental setup at filed and results of investigations carried out to estimate the wave forces on the vertical wall of seawater intake caisson. Pressure measurements and derived force calculations on the vertical wall of seawater intake caisson were compared with the existing formula of Goda (1974). The time series of the variations in the dynamic pressure over the vertical wall indicates that the caisson experienced a maximum force during extreme wave action. The analysis indicates that formula of Goda overestimates the force on the caisson by about 30 % during pre-monsoon for highest significant wave height of 1. 44 m and wave period of 12 sec and underestimates the force by about 55 % during monsoon for highest significant wave height of 2. 76 m and wave period of 15 sec.

In the case of limit states design, the resulting factored load is then called a <b>Design</b> <b>load.</b> Note {{that in this case}} of Limit states design, we would refer to the factor as a load factor rather than a safety factor to try to eliminate possible confusion between Limit states design and the older Allowable stress design.|$|R

This difference occurred since the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> values for m-k method {{are based on}} regression values reduced by 10 % {{and the use of}} γ [...] vs [...] of 1.25. Hence, there is significant difference between actual failure <b>load</b> and <b>design</b> <b>load.</b> As a result m-k method proved to be more conservative than PSC method.|$|R
40|$|Design {{pressures}} {{given in}} wind loading standards {{are based on}} wind tunnel studies conducted during the 1970 s to 90 s on rectangular hip and gable roofs. However, most contemporary houses have complex hip-roof geometries {{with a range of}} plan footprints. Wind tunnel model studies were carried out on representative one- and two-storey houses to determine cladding design and truss hold-down loads. These loads were compared to <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> determined from wind loading standards AS/NZS 1170. 2 and AS 4055. AS 4055 gave conservative <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> in most situations, and AS/NZS 1170. 2 underestimated the loads near the windward edges and ridge on the roof. AS/NZS 1170. 2 does give satisfactory <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> for wall cladding and truss hold down...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to review current approaches for the specification of <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> for rime ice and to propose improvements based on an analysis of field data provided by Hydro-Quebec. Hydro-Quebec established an experimental site on Mont Belair in 1994 {{for the purpose of}} obtaining much more detailed data on ice accretion in real time for both glaze ice and rime ice. In this study, rime ice events were identified, analyzed and characterized in terms of their recurrence, severity and relationship to winds. IEC- 60826 (2000) recommended procedures are used to calculate design rime ice and wind-on-ice loadsusing the ice load map of CSA C 22. 3 No. 1 - 01. The Extreme Type I (Gumbel) distribution is chosen for rime ice in the calculation of <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> based on a reliability-based method. <b>Design</b> rime ice <b>loads</b> derived from the two procedures show that the rime <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> based on short term data at Mont Belair are compatible with IEC- 60826 (2000) provisions...|$|R
