5|$|Grin {{announced}} in May 2001 {{that it was}} working on an arcade version of Ballistics for distribution by Triotech. The game's gameplay had to be reworked to suit an arcade environment, and support was added for multiplayer games with up to eight linked cabinets. Triotech designed a unique reclined seating cabinet for the game, {{the aim of the}} design was to offer the player a more comfortable and immersive experience. The inspiration for the design came to Triotech co-founder, Ernest Yale; who whilst putting <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> on the desk, realised how comfortable the playing position was. Ballistics was released for arcades in January 2002.|$|E
25|$|Noble {{likes to}} have {{spontaneous}} material related to each specific show, and therefore encourages heckling and has increasingly indulged in the audience giving him gifts during shows. At a gig at the Edinburgh Playhouse during Noble's 2005 Randomist tour, {{a member of the}} audience put <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> on the stage, and later removed his shoes {{and put them on the}} stage instead. It is now traditional for the entire front row of an Edinburgh audience to place their shoes upon the stage during the interval, which causes Noble much amusement when he returns.|$|E
25|$|Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch, a mulatto exhibiting psychopathic tendencies, head to South Carolina {{to observe}} the {{implementation}} of Reconstruction policies firsthand. During the election, in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor, blacks are observed stuffing the ballot boxes, while many Whites are denied the vote. The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on stereotypically African American fare such as fried chicken.|$|E

5000|$|... "It was {{a little}} bit reckless, he stuck <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>up</b> into Clayton's face, but I don't think it {{warranted}} a red card. If we had won the game on the back of that red card, I {{think it would have been}} slightly unjust." ...|$|R
500|$|Next was {{the main}} event, which saw John Cena defend the WWE Championship against Umaga. During the match, Cena {{attempted}} and failed to perform the FU various times. Cena would keep attacking Umaga by throwing Umaga's head into the steel ring post, which was followed up by a [...] Five Knuckle Shuffle. When Cena failed to execute a FU, Umaga would take control. Umaga charged at Cena, who was positioned in a corner, but Cena would put <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> to superkick Umaga in the face. This move allowed Cena to quickly roll-up Umaga for the win. Cena had ended Umaga's undefeated streak and retained his WWE Championship.|$|E
2500|$|The {{defensive}} wrestler could counter such attempts for a takedown, or when once {{taken down}} {{try to escape}} his opponent's control or reverse control altogether. In a last-ditch attempt to foil a fall, the defensive wrestler could also [...] "bridge" [...] out of his opponent's control (that is, pry his head, his back, and both of <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> from the mat and then turn toward his stomach). Overall, a collegiate wrestler in his techniques would most likely emphasize physical control and dominance over the opponent on the mat.|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave it 3 stars out of5, and {{commented that}} the [...] "irreverently funny" [...] film had [...] "a vibe so casual you half expect star Seth Rogen to amble off screen and put <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> on {{the seat next to}} you," [...] and praising {{director}} Gondry's [...] "sense of humor and acute visual skill" [...] even while calling the movie [...] "cheerfully unfocused". Rogen proclaimed the film was a [...] "nightmare", chalking it up to studio executives paying little attention to the most expensive portions of the film and its inflated budget.|$|E
60|$|So {{he rocked}} on <b>his</b> wings, <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{gathered}} <b>up</b> under him, and waited.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Stiles looked shocked, and, time pressing, Mr. Burton, {{breathing}} so {{hard that}} it impeded his utterance, purchased a first-class ticket and conducted him to the carriage. Mr. Stiles took a seat by the window and lolling back put <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>up</b> on the cushions opposite. A large bell rang and the carriage-doors were slammed.|$|R
60|$|The {{little man}} on <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> buttoned <b>up</b> {{and ready to}} go, was no taller than the seated Ossipon. He {{levelled}} his spectacles at the latter’s face point-blank.|$|R
2500|$|Ryan P. Doom {{explains}} how the violence devolves {{as the film}} progresses. [...] "The savagery of American violence," [...] he says, [...] "begins with Chigurh's introduction: a quick one-two punch of strangulation and a bloody cattle gun. The strangulation in particular demonstrates {{the level of the}} Coens' capability to create realistic carnage-to allow the audience to understand the horror that violence delivers.....Chigurh kills a total of 12 (possibly more) people, and, curiously enough, the violence devolves as the film progresses. During {{the first half of the}} film, the Coens never shy from unleashing Chigurh ... The devolution of violence starts with Chigurh's shootout with Moss in the motel. Aside from the truck owner who is shot in the head after Moss flags him down, both the motel clerk and Wells's death occur offscreen. Wells's death in particular demonstrates that murder means nothing. Calm beyond comfort, the camera pans away when Chigurh shoots Wells with a silenced shotgun as the phone rings. He answers. It is Moss, and while they talk, blood oozes across the room toward Chigurh's feet. Not moving, he places <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> on the bed and continues the conversation as the blood continues to spread across the floor. By the time he keeps his promise of visiting Carla Jean, the resolution and the violence appear incomplete. Though we're not shown Carla Jean's death, when Chigurh exits and checks the bottom of his socks [...] for blood, it's a clear indication that his brand of violence has struck again." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Awfully {{imprudent}} of Williams," [...] said Morgan, putting <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> {{against the}} wall, [...] "to strike a Kentucky lady. Seems to me I've heard they were scrappers." ...|$|E

60|$|With that he {{heaved a}} great sigh, and then, {{as if he}} had {{discharged}} his duty to the past, put <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> on the sofa and enjoyed Amy's letter luxuriously.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I don't {{care about}} lying down, thank you, Sir; I only sleep {{for want of}} {{something}} to do;' but {{though he did not}} put <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up,</b> he was feeling far too languid not to relax his bolt-upright attitude, and lean back on his pillows.|$|E

He is wearing a large straw hat and a woven serape. He is also wearing light-colored pants and a light-colored shirt. He has a thick mustache. The cracked adobe wall of a building is in the background, while a cobblestone street can be seen near the man's feet...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{see a man}} in despair,' {{he gasped}} out. 'I have lost all my friends. Nemours, de la Rochefoucauld, Clinchamp, d'Aubepine, are mortally wounded;' and, {{throwing}} down his sword, he began tearing his hair with his hands, and moving <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> and down in an agony of grief.|$|E
60|$|Anderson {{leaped to}} get {{one hand on the}} car door, the other on Nash. He almost pulled the driver out of his seat.

60|$|Frank {{retired to}} the easy-chair, {{that he might}} sleep if the tale should prove too childish for him.

6000|$|... 'I thank Him {{at least}} for having taken her,' said Leonard, resting {{his head on the}} mantel-shelf beneath his mother's picture, while his little dog sat at <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> looking <b>up</b> at him, cowed and wistful.|$|R
6000|$|At another desk {{the eye is}} {{relieved}} {{by the sight of}} an ordinary man, attired with unscrupulous plainness, sitting with <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up,</b> eating apples, with his obnoxious hat {{on the back of his}} head. That man is no other than Colonel Tecumseh (once [...] "Parleyvoo") Pickens, the vice-president of the company.|$|E
60|$|The man sat huddled {{up in his}} chair, {{with his}} head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> {{on the corner of}} the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.|$|E
60|$|The King {{looked around}} for {{something}} to throw at General Blug, but as nothing was handy he began to consider that perhaps the man was right {{and he had been}} talking foolishly. So he merely threw himself into his glittering throne and tipped his crown over his ear and curled <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> under him and glared wickedly at Blug.|$|E
60|$|Nance {{entered the}} yard {{somewhat}} dazzled. Sam, the tall ostler, was polishing a curb-chain wit sand; the lantern at <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> letting <b>up</b> spouts of candle-light {{through the holes}} with which its conical roof was peppered.|$|R
