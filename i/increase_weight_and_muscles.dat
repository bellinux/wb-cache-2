40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the factors predicting a range of body change strategies among adolescent males over an 8 -month time period. This is the first published longitudinal study of body change strategies to <b>increase</b> <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscles</b> among males. The 5 body change strategies {{in the present study were}} eating and exercise to lose weight, increase weight, increase muscles, bingeing, and use of food supplements. The extent to which Body Mass Index (BMI) and these body change strategies predicted each other over an 8 -month period was evaluated. The role of pressure from parents and peers to lose weight, increase weight, or increase muscles was also evaluated. After controlling for the Time 1 level of each variable, only bingeing, and use of food supplements were predicted by other Time 1 body change variables. Bingeing at Time 1, and a combination of all of the other variables predicted bingeing at Time 2; use of food supplements and bingeing at Time 1 predicted the use of food supplements at Time 2. Perceived pressure from parents and peers to lose weight at Time 1 predicted strategies to lose weight at Time 2; perceived pressure from parents and peers to increase weight at Time 1 predicted strategies to increase weight at Time 2; and perceived pressure to lose weight, increase weight, and increase muscles at Time 1 predicted the use of food supplements at Time 2. These results indicate that extreme body change strategies are predicted by the adoption of more normative body change strategies at an earlier point in time, and that a range of body change strategies among adolescent males are affected by perceived pressures from parents and peers...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the body image and body change strategies of adolescents from Fiji, Tonga and Australia. Participants were 628 Fijians, 463 Indo-Fijians, 598 Tongans and 535 European Australians. Adolescents completed measures of height, weight, body dissatisfaction, strategies to lose <b>weight,</b> <b>increase</b> <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>increase</b> <b>muscles.</b> The results demonstrated that overweight adolescents were more dissatisfied with their bodies than those who were normal <b>weight.</b> Overweight Fijians <b>and</b> Tongans were more satisfied with their body than Indo-Fijian or Australian adolescents.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{concerned}} {{with the impact of}} pubertal development, relationships with peers and perceived pressure from the media on body dissatisfaction and body change behaviors among adolescent boys and girls. In particular, the study investigated the underresearched area of strategies to <b>increase</b> <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle.</b> The exploration of body change strategies among adolescent boys has been a neglected area of research. Methods: Respondents were 1185 adolescents (527 males, 598 females) who were enrolled in Grades 7 and 9. Participants completed measures of pubertal development, media and peer influence, body dissatisfaction and strategies to lose <b>weight,</b> <b>increase</b> <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> to <b>increase</b> <b>muscle.</b> Results: The findings demonstrated that girls were more likely than boys to adopt strategies to lose weight, whereas boys were more likely to adopt strategies to increase muscle tone (but not weight). For boys in both Years 7 and 9, the main predictors of body change strategies were puberty and, to a lesser extent, perceived popularity with peers. The major influences for Years 7 and 9 girls were puberty and the media, but these mainly focused on weight loss. For Year 9 girls, perceived popularity with opposite-sex peers also predicted body dissatisfaction and strategies to increase muscle tone. Conclusion: The implications of these findings for understanding factors related to a range of body change strategies for adolescent boys and girls are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the nature of body image and body change strategies, {{as well as the}} sociocultural influences on these variables, among a group of 1, 266 adolescents (622 males, 644 females). In particular, it investigated <b>weight</b> gain <b>and</b> <b>increased</b> <b>muscle,</b> as well as weight loss. It was found that females were less satisfied with their bodies and were more likely to adopt strategies to lose weight, whereas males were more likely to adopt strategies to <b>increase</b> <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> tone. Respondents with higher body mass index (BMI) evidenced greater body dissatisfaction <b>and</b> more <b>weight</b> loss strategies, but there were no differences between BMI groups in weight gain or strategies to <b>increase</b> <b>muscles.</b> <b>Weight</b> gain <b>and</b> strategies to increase muscles {{were more likely to be}} undertaken by older adolescents, but there were no grade level differences in weight loss. Media influences to alter weight, as well as feedback from mother, father, and both male and female peers, were greater for females. There were few grade level or BMI differences in regard to any of the sociocultural influences. The importance of these findings in terms of providing a better understanding of factors which may lead to a disturbed body image and body change disorders, particularly among adolescent boys, is discussed. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the initial}} work, {{a decade ago}} that the {{combination}} of C-reactive protein and albumin, the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), had independent prognostic value in patients with cancer, there have been more than 60 studies (> 30, 000 patients) that have examined and validated the use of the GPS or the modified GPS (mGPS) in a variety of cancer scenarios. The present review provides a concise overview of these studies and comments on the current and future clinical utility of this simple objective systemic inflammation-based score. The GPS/mGPS had independent prognostic value in (a) unselected cohorts (4 studies, > 19, 400 patients) (b) operable disease (28 studies, > 8, 000 patients) (c) chemo/radiotherapy (11 studies, > 1500 patients) (d) inoperable disease (11 studies, > 2, 000 patients). Association studies (15 studies, > 2, 000 patients) pointed to an increased GPS/mGPS being associated with <b>increased</b> <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> loss, poor performance status, increased comorbidity, increased pro-inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines and complications on treatment. These studies have originated from 13 different countries, in particular the UK and Japan. A chronic systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by the GPS/mGPS, is clearly implicated in the prognosis of patients with cancer in a variety of clinical scenarios. The GPS/mGPS is the most extensively validated of the systemic inflammation-based prognostic scores and therefore may be used in the routine clinical assessment of patients with cancer. It not only identifies patients at risk but also provides a well defined therapeutic target for future clinical trials. It remains to be determined whether the GPS has prognostic value in other disease states...|$|R

40|$|Sulphated polysaccharides {{exhibit a}} range of {{activities}} which promote health and growth benefits to aquaculture species. One class of sulphated polysaccharides derived from marine algae is fucoidan, which is suggested to exhibit an affinity to the negative muscle growth inhibitory protein myostatin. Addition of fucoidan to the diet of fish therefore may lead to enhancements in growth through inactivation of the myostatin protein. To examine the growth enhancing potential of this sulphated polysaccharide, fucoidan extracts from Undaria pinnatifida {{were added to the}} diet of juvenile barramundi, Lates calcarifer. The fucoidan extract was of 86 % purity and included in two treatment diets at 5 gkg(- 1) (0. 5 %) and 10 g kg(- 1) (1 %) respectively. Fish were fed the diet for 52 days. At the end of the feeding trial, barramundi fed with the 1 % fucoidan inclusion diet exhibited enhanced growth with significantly <b>increased</b> lengths, <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> fibre area (hypertrophy) when compared to the 0. 5 % fucoidan inclusion diet and the non-fucoidan control diet.

40|$|Malnutrition in {{patients}} with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is associated with cachexia, sarcopenia, <b>and</b> <b>weight</b> loss, <b>and</b> may result in poorer pulmonary function, decreased exercise capacity, and increased risk of exacerbations. Providing nutritional supplementation is an important therapeutic intervention, particularly for severely ill COPD patients with malnutrition. Higher calorie intake through nutritional supplementation significantly <b>increases</b> body <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> strength, <b>and</b> improves quality of life in malnourished COPD patients. Difficulties may be experienced by these COPD patients, who are struggling to breathe and eliminate CO 2 from the lungs, resulting in dyspnea, hypercapnia, hypoxia, and respiratory acidosis, which exacerbates muscle loss through oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. To overcome these problems, nutritional supplements should aim to reduce metabolic CO 2 production, lower respiratory quotient, and improve lung function. Several studies have shown that high-fat supplements produce less CO 2 and have lower respiratory quotient value than high-carbohydrate supplements. In addition, high-fat supplements may be the most efficient means of providing a low-volume, calorie-dense supplement to COPD patients, and may be most beneficial to patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation where hypercapnia and malnutrition are most pronounced. Further studies are required to investigate the optimal nutritional supplements for COPD patients according to their disease severity...|$|R
40|$|It {{is thought}} that {{perception}} of effort during physical tasks is the conscious awareness of the central motor command sent to the active muscles. The {{aim of this study}} was to directly test this hypothesis by experimentally varying perception of effort and measuring movement-related cortical potential (MRCP). Sixteen healthy, recreationally active men made unilateral dynamic elbow flexions to lift a light (20 % one repetition maximum, 1 RM) and a heavier (35 % 1 RM) weight with a fatigued arm and a nonfatigued arm while rating of perceived effort (RPE), biceps brachii electromyogram (EMG), and MRCP were recorded. RPE, EMG amplitude, and MRCP amplitude at Cz during <b>weight</b> raising <b>increased</b> with <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> with <b>muscle</b> fatigue.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{quantitative study}} of the morphological variations of extrafusal motor end-plates of normal cat hindlimb muscles as seen in teased silver impregnated preparations was undertaken. The principal aim {{was to examine the}} hypothesis that end-plates undergo growth and degeneration in a process of cyclic degeneration and renewal ('replacement'). A new classification of the morphological complexity of end-plates was devised <b>and</b> the three <b>muscles</b> studied (peroneus brevis, peroneus digiti quinti and soleus) show characteristic variations in the proportions of complex endings, and in the size relationships of end-plates <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> fibres. These variations are not related to differences in the proportions of muscle fibres of the three principal histochemical types. The existence of growth and degeneration of end-plates was confirmed, but no new end-plates are formed. Hence the 'replacement' hypothesis is regarded as untenable. Instead, it is suggested that growth leads to the formation of end-plates of greater complexity ('elaboration'), and degeneration to the loss of muscle fibres commonly observed in ageing mammals. The examination of muscles from cats aged 6 - l 8 years supports this concept because there is a striking increase in the proportions of complex end-plates and the number of muscle fibres is reduced. By analogy with the formation of end-plates, it is suggested that 'elaboration' during ageing is a response to the increasing functional demands indicated by the <b>increased</b> body <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> fibre diameters. An attempt to test the effects of use and disuse in kittens was unsuccessful. However, surgically-induced hypertrophy of soleus in a young adult cat resulted in an increased proportion of larger, more complex end-plates with more numerous, longer axon terminals. This strongly suggests that 'elaboration' is indeed a response to functional demand. The observations are discussed in relation to current views of the neuromuscular system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Skeletal <b>muscle</b> growth <b>and</b> {{development}} from embryo to adult {{consists of a}} series of carefully regulated changes in gene expression. Understanding these developmental changes in agriculturally important species is essential to the production of high quality meat products. For example, consumer demand for lean, inexpensive meat products has driven the turkey industry to unprecedented production through intensive genetic selection. However, achievements of <b>increased</b> body <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> mass have been countered by an increased incidence of myopathies and meat quality defects. In a previous study, we developed and validated a turkey skeletal muscle-specific microarray as a tool for functional genomics studies. The goals of the current study were to utilize this microarray to elucidate functional pathways of genes responsible for key events in turkey skeletal <b>muscle</b> development <b>and</b> to compare differences in gene expression between two genetic lines of turkeys. To achieve these goals, skeletal muscle samples were collected at three critical stages in muscle development: 18 d embryo (hyperplasia), 1 d post-hatch (shift from myoblast-mediated growth to satellite cell-modulated growth by hypertrophy), and 16 wk (market age) from two genetic lines: a randombred control line (RBC 2) maintained without selection pressure, and a line (F) selected from the RBC 2 line for increased 16 wk body weight. Array hybridizations were performed in two experiments: Experiment 1 directly compared the developmental stages within genetic line, while Experiment 2 directly compared the two lines within each developmental stage. Results A total of 3474 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate; FDR Conclusions The current study identified gene pathways and uncovered novel genes important in turkey <b>muscle</b> growth <b>and</b> development.

40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) impairs muscle protein {{metabolism}} leading to <b>muscle</b> atrophy, <b>and</b> exercise can counteract this muscle wasting. Here we evaluated how resistance exercise (<b>muscle</b> overload) <b>and</b> endurance training (treadmill running) affect CKD-induced abnormalities in <b>muscle</b> protein metabolism <b>and</b> progenitor cell function using mouse plantaris muscle. Both exercise models blunted {{the increase in}} disease-induced <b>muscle</b> proteolysis <b>and</b> improved phosphorylation of Akt and the forkhead transcription factor FoxO 1. Muscle overloading, but not treadmill running, corrected protein synthesis and levels of mediators of protein synthesis such as phosphorylated mTOR and p 70 S 6 K in the muscles of mice with CKD. In these mice, muscle overload, but not treadmill, running, increased muscle progenitor cell number and activity {{as measured by the}} amounts of MyoD, myogenin, <b>and</b> eMyHC mRNAs. <b>Muscle</b> overload not only <b>increased</b> plantaris <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> reduced <b>muscle</b> proteolysis but also corrected intracellular signals regulating protein and progenitor cell function in mice with CKD.

40|$|Abstract Background Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a widely-used {{system for}} protein expression. We {{previously}} showed that heat-killed whole recombinant yeast vaccine expressing mammalian myostatin can modulate myostatin function in mice, resulting in <b>increase</b> of body <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> composition in these animals. Foreign DNA introduced into yeast cells can be lost soon unless cells are continuously cultured in selection media, which usually contain antibiotics. For cost and safety concerns, {{it is essential}} to optimize conditions to produce quality food and pharmaceutical products. Results We developed a simple but effective method to engineer a yeast strain stably expressing mammalian myostatin. This method utilized high-copy-number integration of myostatin gene into the ribosomal DNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the final step, antibiotic selection marker was removed using the Cre-LoxP system to minimize any possible side-effects for animals. The resulting yeast strain can be maintained in rich culture media and stably express mammalian myostatin for two years. Oral administration of the recombinant yeast was able to induce immune response to myostatin and modulated the body weight of mice. Conclusions Establishment of such yeast strain is a step further toward transformation of yeast cells into edible vaccine to improve meat production in farm animals and treat human muscle-wasting diseases in the future. </p...|$|R
40|$|MDC 1 A, {{the second}} most {{prevalent}} form of congenital muscular dystrophy, results from laminin-α 2 chain deficiency. This disease is characterized by extensive muscle wasting that results in extremely weak skeletal muscles. A large percentage of children with MDC 1 A are faced with respiratory as well as ambulatory difficulties. We investigated the effects of overexpressing insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) as a potential therapeutic target for the disease in the Lama 2 Dy-w mouse, a model that closely resembles human MDC 1 A. IGF- 1 transgenic Lama 2 Dy-w mice showed <b>increased</b> survivability, body <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>weight.</b> In addition, these mice showed better ability to stand up on their hind limbs: a typical exploratory behavior seen in healthy mice. Histology and immunohistochemistry analyses revealed increased regenerative capacity and proliferation in IGF- 1 transgenic Lama 2 Dy-w muscles. Western blot analysis showed increased phosphorylation of Akt and ERK 1 / 2, both known to enhance myogenesis. Additionally, we saw increases in {{the expression of the}} regeneration markers MyoD, myogenin and embryonic myosin (myosin heavy chain 3, MYH 3). We conclude that overexpression of IGF- 1 in Lama 2 Dy-w mice increases lifespan and improves their overall wellbeing mainly through the restoration of impaired muscle regeneration, as fibrosis or inflammation was not impacted by IGF- 1 in this disease model.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years {{considerable}} progress regarding the knowledge of the human genome map has been achieved. As a result, attempts to use gene therapy in patients’ management are more and more often undertaken. The aim of gene therapy is to replace defective genes in vivo and/or to promote the long-term endogenous synthesis of deficient protein. In vitro studies improve the production of human recombinant proteins, such as insulin (INS), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) and erythropoietin (EPO), which could have therapeutic application. Unfortunately, genetic methods developed for therapeutic purposes are increasingly being used in competitive sports. Some new substances (e. g., antibodies against myostatin or myostatin blockers) might be used in gene doping in athletes. The use of these substances may cause an <b>increase</b> of body <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> mass <b>and</b> a significant improvement of muscle strength. Although it is proven that uncontrolled manipulation of genetic material and/or the introduction of recombinant proteins may be associated with health risks, athletes are increasingly turning to banned gene doping. At the same time, anti-doping research is undertaken in many laboratories around the world to try to develop and refine ever newer techniques for gene doping detection in sport. Thanks to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and other sports organizations there is a hope for real protection of athletes from adverse health effects of gene doping, which at the same time gives a chance to sustain the idea of fair play in sport...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis were three-fold. Firstly, to identify whether reduced muscle growth in twin compared to singleton lambs during late pregnancy and early post-natal life {{was associated with}} changes in the concentration of intracellular free amino acids (FAA) that {{may play a role}} in the regulation of pathways involved in muscle growth. Secondly, to evaluate if supplementation with a specific amino acid improved muscle growth in twin fetuses/lambs, and thirdly to examine the role of mTOR signalling. The first objective was investigated by examining the differences in muscle FAA concentrations between singleton and twin fetuses in late pregnancy from either heavy or light ewes, under a maintenance or ad libitum feeding regimen. Twin fetuses had lower intracellular FAA concentrations of arginine (Arg), leucine, valine, glutamine, while muscle mass was positively associated only with Arg concentration. A further study characterised the FAA concentrations of singleton and twin well-fed lambs at 140 days pregnancy and at weaning. High levels of Arg and glutamine were associated with muscle growth during pregnancy; however several FAA appeared to be associated with muscle growth to weaning. Objective 2 was tested by examining the effects of maternal Arg administration on fetal <b>muscle</b> growth <b>and</b> mTOR signalling. Well-fed twin-bearing ewes, received either an intravenous bolus of Arg or saline solution 3 times daily from 100 days of pregnancy to parturition. Female lambs from supplemented ewes had <b>increased</b> birth <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> mass at market <b>weight,</b> associated with <b>increased</b> ribosome number and mTOR abundance at P 140 and increased ribosome number at weaning, compared to control females. An additional experiment supplemented twin-born lambs with Arg via fortification of colostrum and milk replacer from birth to 28 days or from birth to 70 days of life. Supplementation increased body growth between 7 and 21 days of life. Only supplemented females expressed higher muscle weight at 70 days, compared with control females. Collectively, these results indicate that singleton <b>and</b> twin <b>muscle</b> differs in Arg concentration, and the use of Arg during pregnancy and early neonatal life improves muscle growth in females. This action potentially occurs through mTOR signalling, and ameliorates reduced females weight in at birth and growth from birth to weaning...|$|R
40|$|Overall, {{this thesis}} was {{designed}} to explore the nature of adolescent boys 2 ̆ 7 body image, the effects of body image on body change strategies and psychological adjustment, and {{the factors that influence}} body image. The first study examined body image in 362 adolescent boys. Body image was considered in terms of attitudes to different body parts and attributes, including, lower, middle and upper body, as well as <b>weight,</b> shape <b>and</b> <b>muscles.</b> The relationships between Body Mass Index (BMI), body image, sociocultural messages, psychological adjustment and body change strategies, including strategies to decrease <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>increase</b> <b>muscles</b> using food <b>and</b> exercise, drive for thinness, bulimic attitudes and behaviour, excessive exercise, food supplements to lose <b>weight,</b> <b>increase</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> steroids, were also investigated. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the role of body image, sociocultural messages and psychological adjustment to predict satisfaction with different body attributes and body change strategies. The findings from study one {{led to the development of}} a program aimed at preventing the development of unhealthy attitudes and behaviours among adolescent boys. Study two involved the implementation and evaluation of this prevention program. One hundred and twenty one boys participated in the program. The program was based on social-cognitive theory, and included a focus on accepting differences and the development of self-esteem.

40|$|Acute {{traumatic}} {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) is marked by the enhanced production of local cytokines and pro-inflammatory substances that induce gliosis and prevent reinnervation. The transplantation of stem cells is a promising treatment strategy for SCI. In order to facilitate functional recovery, we employed stem cell therapy alone or in combination with curcumin, a naturally-occurring anti-inflammatory component of turmeric (Curcuma longa), which potently inhibits NF-kB. Spinal cord contusion following laminectomy (T 9 – 10) was performed using a weight drop apparatus (10 g over a 12. 5 or 25 mm distance, representing moderate or severe SCI, respectively) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Neural stem cells (NSC) were isolated from subventricular zone (SVZ) and transplanted {{at the site of}} injury with or without curcumin treatment. Functional recovery was assessed by BBB score <b>and</b> body <b>weight</b> gain measured up to 6 weeks following SCI. At the conclusion of the study, the mass of soleus muscle was correlated with BBB score <b>and</b> body <b>weight.</b> Stem cell therapy improved recovery from moderate SCI, however, it had a limited effect on recovery after severe SCI. Curcumin stimulated NSC proliferation in vitro, and in combination with stem cell therapy, induced profound recovery from severe SCI as evidenced by improved functional locomotor recovery, <b>increased</b> body <b>weight,</b> <b>and</b> soleus <b>muscle</b> mass. These findings demonstrate that curcumin in conjunction with stem cell therapy synergistically improves recovery from severe SCI.

Four different broiler genotypes, one unselected since the 19502 ̆ 7 s (HER) representing the old meat-type bird and three current strains (Ross 308, Ross 708, and a test product (TY)) were studied. Differences in growth, morphometry, and response in performance and processing yield to different nutrient levels were studied. Experiment 1 evaluated growth and morphometric analysis. Birds of each strain were killed weekly from day 7 to day 56, necropsied and cut up parts and organs weighed. Measurement of small intestine segments was also done. Results show that current strains have significantly <b>increased</b> body <b>weight</b> (BW) <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> accretion, especially breast meat. Jejunum and ileum segments are longer in the current genotypes but shorter when related to body <b>weight.</b> Heart <b>and</b> gizzard relative <b>weight</b> has reduced <b>and</b> tibia breaking strength has increased as a side effect of selection. Experiment 2 evaluated performance and processing yield at four different energy levels. Results show that the HER bird is able to regulate feed intake (FI) in order to regulate energy intake. Increasing energy levels did not affect its performance. The Ross 308 bird is not able to modify FI in order to regulate energy intake. Also, Ross 308 responded to increasing levels of energy by increasing BW while Ross 708 and TY did not. Current genotypes increased caloric conversion ratio with higher levels of energy.

40|$|Changbai Mountain Ginseng (CMG, Panax ginseng C. A. Mey) is a {{traditional}} medicine commonly found in Northeast China and grows at elevations of 2000 m or higher in the Changbai Mountain Range. CMG, {{considered to be a}} “buried treasure medicine”, is priced higher than other types of ginseng. However, few studies have demonstrated the effects of CMG supplementation on exercise performance, physical fatigue, and the biochemical profile. The major compound of CMG extract was characterized by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Male ICR mice were divided into 3 groups, the vehicle, CMG- 1 X and CMG- 5 X groups (n = 8 per group), and respectively administered 0, 5, or 25 mg/kg/day of CMG extract orally for four weeks. HPLC-ESI-MS/MS results showed that the major compound in CMG extract is ginsenoside Ro. CMG extract significantly <b>increased</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> relative <b>muscle</b> <b>weight</b> (%). CMG extract supplementation dose-dependently increased grip strength (p < 0. 0001) and endurance swimming time, decreased levels of serum lactate (p < 0. 0001), ammonia (p < 0. 0001), creatine kinase (CK, p = 0. 0002), and blood urea nitrogen (p < 0. 0001), and economized glucose levels (p < 0. 0001) after acute exercise challenge. The glycogen in the gastrocnemius muscle was significantly increased with CMG extract treatment. Biochemical profile results showed that creatinine and triacylglycerol significantly decreased and total protein and glucose increased with CMG treatment. This is the first report that CMG extract supplementation increases muscle mass, improves exercise performance and energy utilization, and decreases fatigue-associated parameters in vivo.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effectiveness of zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH) to enhance growth performance and carcass characteristics in calf-fed Holstein steers. In Exp. 1, Holstein steers (n = 2, 311) were fed in a large-pen trial in 2 phases at a commercial feed yard in the desert Southwest. In Exp. 2, a total of 359 steers were fed in a small-pen university study. In Exp. 1 and 2, cattle were implanted with a combination trenbolone acetate-estradiol implant approximately 120 d before slaughter. Cattle were fed ZH for 0, 20, 30, or 40 d before slaughter at a rate of 8. 3 mg/kg (DM basis). A 3 -d withdrawal was maintained immediately before slaughter. Cattle within an experiment were fed to a common number of days on feed. During the last 120 d before slaughter, ADG was not enhanced by feeding ZH for 20 d (P = 0. 33 in Exp. 1, and P = 0. 79 in Exp. 2). Gain-to-feed conversion was increased by feeding ZH for all durations in Exp. 1 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Feeding ZH increased HCW by 9. 3 (Exp. 2) to 11. 6 (Exp. 1) kg at 20 d compared with the control groups. Across both experiments, dressing percent was increased for all durations of feeding ZH (P 3 ̆c 0. 05).

40|$|The study {{examined}} the impact of body mass index (BMI), negative affect, self-esteem, and sociocultural influences {{in the development of}} <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> concerns among preadolescent boys. Body dissatisfaction, importance placed on <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscles,</b> <b>weight</b> loss strategies, <b>and</b> strategies to increase muscles were evaluated. Participants were 237 boys aged between 8 and 11 years who were tested at three assessment periods 8 months apart. The main predictor of boys’ body change strategies was their perceived pressures to modify <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscles</b> from parents, peers, and the media. The other main predictor of boys’ body change strategies and the sole predictor of body dissatisfaction was BMI. Self-esteem and negative affect were found to be weak and generally nonsignificant predictors of boys’ body image concerns and body change strategies. Additional studies that examine the risk and protective factors associated with boys’ <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> concerns are needed to assist in the development of prevention programs for preadolescent boys...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect that}} a 14 -day {{treatment}} program of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) {{combined with the}} glutamine antimetabolite, acivicin, and anabolic hormone, insulin, has on carcass <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> sparing was investigated in tumor-bearing rats. Although TPN resulted in <b>increased</b> carcass <b>weight</b> gain as compared to chow-fed tumor-bearing rats, no savings in gastrocnemius muscle could be demonstrated. The combination of TPN with daily insulin treatment elicited significant increases in both carcass <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> savings, with no alteration in tumor growth. Although combining acivicin with TPN halted tumor growth <b>and</b> <b>increased</b> carcass <b>weight,</b> the change in carcass weight was less than that observed with the insulin-TPN combination. No muscle savings were observed in the acivicin-TPN-treated rats. Yet when acivicin and insulin were combined with TPN, tumor growth was stopped, carcass <b>weight</b> was gained, <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> mass was saved. Therefore, these experiments {{suggest that it is}} possible to add lean body tissue and stabilize tumor growth in rats that receive TPN through anabolic hormone treatment combined with an inhibitor of tumor metabolism...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{factors that influence}} body image and strategies to either lose <b>weight</b> or <b>increase</b> muscle among children. Participants were 237 boys and 270 girls. Body mass index (BMI), body dissatisfaction, cognitions and behaviors to both lose <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>increase</b> <b>muscles,</b> as well as self-esteem and positive and negative affect, were evaluated. Self-esteem was associated with body satisfaction, positive affect predicted strategies to lose <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>increase</b> <b>muscles,</b> <b>and</b> negative affect predicted body dissatisfaction and cognitions to lose <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> <b>increase</b> <b>muscles.</b> Boys {{were more likely to}} focus on changing muscles.
