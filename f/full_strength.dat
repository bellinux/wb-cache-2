5|$|As a British {{withdrawal}} from France {{at the earliest}} opportunity had been the original intent, the brigade boarded ships bound for Italy eleven days after landing. The operation had cost the brigade 362 casualties, but this did not hinder their next mission in Greece two months later. Only 126 replacements were required to bring the brigade back up to <b>full</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a <b>full</b> <b>strength</b> Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance for all players to gain a psychological advantage over their opponents for the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Within four days, 2,300 men had {{answered}} Ellsworth's call. A selection {{of only the}} most desirable men cut that number to 1,100, which was considered a regiment's <b>full</b> <b>strength.</b> When the state {{could not afford to}} supply the new troops, fundraisers were successful in raising $60,000 for the regiment, enough to provide uniforms, several different models of Sharps rifles, and provisions.|$|E
5|$|A {{technical}} foul {{requires that the}} defenceman who fouled a player on the opposing team {{be placed in the}} penalty box for 30 seconds. As with a personal foul, until the penalty time expires, no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The player (or a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once the time in the penalty box is over and the team is thus once again at <b>full</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E

5|$|After being {{promoted}} to colonel on 2 December 1839, Luís Alves {{was sent by}} the Reactionary cabinet to the province of Maranhão to quell a rebellion which {{became known as the}} Balaiada.

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the Lowestoft raid, Admiral Reinhard Scheer began planning another foray into the North Sea. He had initially intended to launch the operation in mid-May, but the mine damage to Seydlitz had proved difficult to repair, and Scheer was unwilling {{to embark on a}} major raid without his battlecruiser forces at <b>full</b> <b>strength.</b> At noon on 28 May, the repairs to Seydlitz were finally completed, and the ship returned to the I Scouting Group.|$|E
5|$|Due to his weak {{performances}} in the opening matches, Harvey was omitted for the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a <b>full</b> <b>strength</b> Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team {{and went on to}} win by an innings. The omission signified that Harvey was on the outer with regards to Test selection.|$|E

5|$|During 1964–65 the {{regiment}} provided {{most of the}} men for 1 Troop, A Squadron, 4th/19th Prince of Wales Light Horse, which was subsequently equipped with the new M113A1 Armoured Personnel Carrier and was deployed on active service to South Vietnam in May 1965. In October 1967 the Australian government announced it would increase the size of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) at Nui Dat in Phuoc Tuy Province from two to three infantry battalions, while additional supporting arms, including a tank squadron would also be added to the force. As such in February 1968, C Squadron was sent to Vietnam, with a total strength of 20 Centurion tanks which would work closely with the M113s of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment. However, two of the four tank troops were initially held back until the Centurions had proved themselves capable of operating in the conditions. The tank squadron reached <b>full</b> <b>strength</b> on 5 September 1968. Meanwhile, in May {{the regiment}} had again reached <b>full</b> <b>strength,</b> with A Squadron re-raised {{in order to meet the}} ongoing operational commitment.|$|E
5|$|Facilities {{and weather}} {{conditions}} at Kibret {{proved to be}} unsuitable for airborne operations, so the brigade moved to RAF Ramat David in Palestine to continue their training. The brigade came to <b>full</b> <b>strength</b> in May 1943, and in June was sent to Tripoli, where it joined the 1st Airborne Division. Also assigned to the division were the 1st and 2nd Parachute Brigades and the glider infantry of the 1st Airlanding Brigade.|$|E
5|$|In January 1952, the 24th Infantry Division, which {{suffered}} over 10,000 {{casualties in}} 18 months of fighting, was redesignated as the Far East Theater reserve {{and pulled out}} of Korea. It returned to Japan to rebuild. The 34th Infantry Regiment was reconstituted, and the division returned to <b>full</b> <b>strength</b> during the next year, having been replaced in Korea by the 40th Infantry Division of the California Army National Guard. In July 1953, the division returned to Korea to restore order in prisoner of war camps. It arrived {{two weeks before the}} end of the war.|$|E

The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a <b>full</b> <b>strength</b> Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team, with Johnston omitted. It was {{a chance for the}} Australian bowlers to gain a psychological advantage, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrichthree of England's first four batsmenall playing. Australia won by an innings to give an indication of their strength.|$|E
5|$|Meckiff's most {{prominent}} showing in his debut season {{was in the}} Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales during the Christmas period of 1956. At the time, the two states were by far the strongest in Australia; in the past decade, the teams had 18 of the 20 top-two Shield placings between them, and New South Wales {{were in the process}} of winning nine consecutive titles. The arch-rivals were at <b>full</b> <b>strength</b> as no international matches were held during the season.|$|E

Towards evening, the Covenanters and Parliamentarians themselves launched a surprise attack. After a confused fight lasting two hours, Parliamentarian cavalry under Oliver Cromwell routed the Royalist cavalry from the field and, with Leven's infantry, annihilated the remaining Royalist infantry.|$|E

The paper shows that for frames of modest span (around 10 m), sized using a rigid joint and <b>full</b> joint <b>strength</b> assumption, that the frames are unsafe under gravity load and do not satisfy the ultimate limit state. Designers should therefore take the semi-rigidity and partial strength of the joints when analysing such frames, particularly when stressed skin action is also used in the design...|$|R
60|$|With {{the year}} 1860 a new period, and one far more {{responsible}} and eventful, began. After working {{for four years}} under Bishop Selwyn's superintendence, Coleridge Patteson was gradually passing into a sphere of more independent action; and, though his loyal allegiance to his Primate was even more of the heart than of the letter, his time of training was over; he was left to act more on his own judgment; and things were ripening for his becoming himself a Bishop. He had nearly completed his thirty-third year, and was in his <b>fullest</b> <b>strength,</b> mental and bodily; and, as has been seen, the idea had already through Bishop Selwyn's letters become familiar to his family, though he himself had shrunk from entertaining it.|$|R
5|$|Once given {{freedom of}} action, Manstein {{intended}} to utilise his forces {{to make a}} series of counterstrokes into the flanks of the Soviet armoured formations, {{with the goal of}} destroying them while retaking Kharkov and Kursk. The II SS Panzer Corps had arrived from France in January 1943, refitted and up to near <b>full</b> <b>strength.</b> Armoured units from the 1st Panzer Army of Army Group A had pulled out of the Caucasus and further strengthened Manstein's forces.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army began {{training}} paratroops in December 1942 as {{an offshoot}} of the training of Independent Companies. The 1st Parachute Battalion was subsequently formed in March 1943.
