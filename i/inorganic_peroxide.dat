Due to its limited genome size, many genes conserved in other bacteria are missing inM. genitalium. Genes encoding catalase and superoxide dismutase are absent, and how this pathogen overcomes oxidative stress remains poorly understood. In this study, we characterizedMG_ 427, a homolog of the conserved osmC, which encodes hy-droperoxide peroxidase, shown to protect bacteria against oxidative stress. We found that recombinant MG_ 427 protein re-duced organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>peroxide</b> substrates. Also, we showed that a deletion mutant of MG_ 427 was highly sensitive to kill-ing by tert-butyl hydroperoxide and H 2 O 2 compared to the sensitivity of the wild type.

Examination of the expression pattern of MG_ 427 during osmotic shock, oxidative stress, and other stress conditions revealed its lack of induction, distinguishingMG_ 427 from other previously characterized osmC genes.

40|$|Stress induced {{premature}} senescence (SIPS) in mammalian {{cells is}} an accelerated ageing response and experimentally obtained on treatment of cells with {{high concentrations of}} H(2) O(2), albeit at sub-lethal doses, because H(2) O(2) gets depleted by abundant cellular catalase. In the present study diperoxovanadate (DPV) was used {{as it is known}} to be stable at physiological pH, to be catalase-resistant and to substitute for H(2) O(2) in its activities at concentrations order of magnitudes lower. On treating NIH 3 T 3 cells with DPV, SIPS-like morphology was observed along with an immediate response of rounding of the cells by disruption of actin cytoskeleton and transient G 2 /M arrest. DPV could bring about growth arrest and senescence associated features at 25 mu M dose, which were not seen with similar doses of either H(2) O(2) or vanadate. A minimal dose of 150 mu M of H(2) O(2) was required to induce similar affects as 25 mu M DPV. Increase in senescent associated markers such as p 21, HMGA 2 and PAI- 1 was more prominent in DPV treated cells compared to similar dose of H(2) O(2). DPV-treated cells showed marked relocalization of Cyclin D 1 from nucleus to cytoplasm.

Whereas this peroxiredoxin is restricted to the kinetoplast area in promastigotes, it covers the entire mitochondrion in amastigotes, accompanied by dramatically increased expression. A similar change in the expression pattern was observed during the growth of Leishmania from the early to the late logarithmic phase.

Despite the abundance of oxidants at the site of infection, enzymes responsible for the detoxification of ROS have never been characterized in mycoplasmas. Here we characterize a homolog of the ohr (organic hydroperoxide resistance) family from Mycoplasma gallisepticum (encoding MGA 1142). Unlike previously characterized ohr genes, the mga 1142 gene is not upregulated in response to oxidative stress but displays a novel pattern of expression.

Terminal modification of the prepolymers, by substituting a wide range of carbonylcontaining groups for the thiol protons, has {{led to the creation of}} photopolymerisable oligomers with certain of the desirable properties mentioned above. UV irradiation of all the modified polysulfides, which exist as viscous oils, resulted in the development of a solid elastomeric material with considerable powers of adhesion. The acylation process involves the addition of a slight excess of an acyl halide to the prepolymer in solution, followed by the addition of an amine to neutralise the HCI formed. This procedure has been adapted to react di- and polyfunctional termini with LPs to produce block copolymer polysulfides. When exposed to UV irradiation, the oligomers slowly photocrosslink, forming an insoluble elastomer. The increase in degree of polymerisation has been successfully monitored by 1 H NMR spectroscopy; this was achieved by irradiating the oligomers in NMR tubes containing a thin capillary tube containing a deuterium-lock solvent. These new materials were characterised by IR, 1 H and 13 C NMR, GPC, viscometry and, particularly electrospray and FAB-mass spectrometry.

In plants, Gpxs are encoded by a multigene family of five to eight members that are distributed in different tissues with distinct subcellular locations [2]. In a previous study, we characterized six Gpx genes in the model legume Lotus japonicus. In this work, we investigated in detail two isoforms (LjGpx 1 and LjGpx 3) that are highly expressed in the nodules. Biochemical characterization of the purified recombinant proteins showed that both enzymes catalyze the Trx-dependent (but not glutathione-dependent) reduction of <b>inorganic</b> and organic <b>peroxides.</b> Enzymatic constants indicated a high affinity and catalytic efficiency of both proteins for phospholipid hydroperoxides.

In situ RNA hybridization revealed that the LjGpx 1 and LjGpx 3 mRNAs are particularly abundant in the infected zone of Lotus nodules. Besides, significant amounts of LjGpx 3 mRNA could be detected in the nodule cortex and in the vascular bundles.

They are an important class of oxidative enzymes which are found in nature, where they perform diverse physiological functions. Apart from the white rot fungi, actinomycetes are the only other known source of extracellular peroxidases. In this study, the production of extracellular peroxidase in wild type actinomycete strains was investigated, for the purpose of large-scale production and finding suitable applications. The adjustment of environmental parameters (medium components, pH, temperature and inducers) to optimise extracellular peroxidase production in five different strains was carried out. Five Streptomyces strains isolated from various natural habitats were initially selected for optimisation of their peroxidase production. Streptomyces sp. strain BSII# 1 and Streptomyces sp. strain GSIII# 1 exhibited the highest peroxidase activities (1. 30 ± 0. 04 U ml- 1 and 0. 757 ± 0. 01 U ml- 1, respectively) in a complex production medium at 37 °C and pH 8. 0 in both cases. Maximum enzyme production for Streptomyces strain BSII# 1 was obtained in the presence of 0. 1 mM veratryl alcohol or pyrogallol, while 0. 1 mM guaiacol induced the highest peroxidase production in Streptomyces sp. strain GSIII# 1. As the highest peroxidase producer, Streptomyces sp. strain BSII# 1 was selected for further studies. The strain was first characterised by a polyphasic approach, and was shown to belong to the genus Streptomyces using various chemotaxonomic, genotypic and phenotypic tests. Production of peroxidase was scaled up to larger volumes in different bioreactor formats. The airlift configuration was optimal for peroxidase production, with Streptomyces sp. strain BSII# 1 achieving maximum production (4. 76 ± 0. 46 U ml- 1) in the 3 l culture volume within 60 hrs of incubation. A protocol for the purification of the peroxidase was developed, which involved sequential steps of acid and acetone precipitation, as well as ultrafiltration. A purification factor of at least 46 -fold was achieved using this method and the protein was further analysed by LC-MS. The protein was shown to be a 46 kDa protein, and further biochemical characterisation showed that the peroxidase had a narrower spectrum of substrates as compared to reports on other peroxidases derived from actinomycetes. With 2, 4 -dichlorophenol as the substrate, the Km and Vmax for this enzyme were 0. 893 mM and 1. 081 μmol min- 1, respectively. The purified peroxidase was also capable of catalysing coupling reactions between several phenolic monomer pairs. Overall, the peroxidase from Streptomyces sp. strain BSII# 1 could feasibly be produced in larger scales and there remains further room to investigate other potential applications for this enzyme...|$|R
