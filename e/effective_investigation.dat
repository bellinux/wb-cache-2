In its decision the Chamber concluded that Republika Srpska's failure to make accessible and to disclose information requested by the applicants about their missing relatives constituted a violation of its positive obligations to secure respect for their rights to private and family life, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention. Also, it held that Republika Srpska's failure to inform the applicants about the truth of the fate and whereabouts of their missing relatives, including conducting a meaningful and <b>effective</b> <b>investigation</b> into the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, violated their rights to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment, as guaranteed by Article 3 of the European Convention. Finally, the Chamber concluded that in failing to fulfill its obligations owed to the applicants under the European Convention, the Republika Srpska had discriminated against the applicants due to their Bosniak origin.|$|E

2500|$|There was a broad public {{perception}} that BART Police were not conducting an <b>effective</b> <b>investigation.</b> Efforts by BART officers to confiscate witnesses' cellphones during the incident created controversy. The shooting stirred outrage among {{political leaders and}} legal observers; Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson, Oakland City Councilmember Desley Brooks (Eastmont-Seminary), and Berkeley Copwatch labeled the shooting an execution. [...] Local columnists criticized such language as [...] "inflammatory" [...] and [...] "the exact opposite {{of the kind of}} sane leadership we need and expect from our elected officials." [...] The fact that the jury contained no African-Americans also served as a point of tension.|$|E

Bontade’s close ally, Salvatore Inzerillo, was killed three weeks later with the same Kalashnikov. The Corleonesi {{slaughtered}} the ruling families of the Palermo Mafia {{to take control of}} the organisation while waging a parallel war against Italian authorities and law enforcement to intimidate and prevent <b>effective</b> <b>investigations</b> and prosecutions.

2500|$|On 20 December 2011, the European Court of Human Rights {{published}} its judgement in the case, ordering Russia {{to pay the}} 64 applicants a {{total of}} 1.3 million euros in compensation. The court also found that Russia had violated Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights when handling the hostage crisis, [...] "with inadequate planning and conduct of the rescue operation", and with the [...] "authorities’ failure to conduct an <b>effective</b> <b>investigation</b> into the rescue operation", although the Court found {{that there had been}} [...] "no violation of Article 2 of the Convention on account of the decision by the authorities to resolve the hostage crisis by force and to use the gas." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{provided}} {{for in the}} Magna Carta, [...] "no freeman shall be taken, imprisoned [...] except by the lawful judgment of his peers and by {{the law of the}} land." [...] The right is protected in three ways: the writ of habeas corpus requires a person under arrest to be brought before a judge or into court, the tort of false imprisonment and the offence of kidnapping. Where an individual is lawfully arrested on the basis of an arrest warrant, the length of his detention is prescribed by statute; the detainee's rights and the powers of the police during the period of detention are also regulated under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The police have no general power to detain a person for questioning without making an arrest unless this is for the purpose of the exercise of another police power {{such as the use of}} a search warrant. Arrests without a warrant are possible if the person is committing or about to commit an offence and the arresting officer has reasonable grounds to believe that arrest is necessary in order to ascertain the person's details, to prevent them from causing injury, damage or further offences, to protect a child or other vulnerable person, to allow prompt and <b>effective</b> <b>investigation</b> of the offence or the person's conduct or to prevent the investigation being hindered by the person's disappearance.|$|E
2500|$|A former UN interpreter, Hasan Nuhanović and {{the family}} of Rizo Mustafić, an {{electrician}} {{who worked for the}} UN Battalion at Srebrenica, have filed a criminal complaint requesting that genocide charges be brought against three Dutch military officials: commander Thom Karremans, his deputy Rob Franken and second in command Berend Oosterveen, because Nuhanović's family members were forced out of UN compound (his father and brother were killed subsequently), as well as Mustafić who is still missing. The public prosecutor in The Netherlands has decided to open an investigation pursuant to the criminal complaint. On 7 March 2013 Dutch authorities decided not to prosecute, while Nuhanović indicated that he would appeal that decision. The families lodged a complaint about the public prosecutor’s decision with the Military Chamber of the Court of Appeal of Arnhem-Leeuwarden, but on 29 April 2015 the Court of Appeal dismissed the complaint, finding that prosecutions were unlikely to lead to a conviction. Against the decision by the Court of Appeal the families submitted an application to the European Court of Human Rights complaining that the Court of Appeal had failed to order the criminal prosecution of the three Netherlands servicemen, or at least a criminal investigation into their involvement in the deaths of their relatives. On 30 August 2016 the European Court of Human Rights declared the application as inadmissible for being manifestly ill-founded, concluding that [...] "it cannot be said that the domestic authorities have failed to discharge the procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to conduct an <b>effective</b> <b>investigation</b> ... which was capable of leading to the establishment of the facts, ... and of identifying and – if appropriate – punishing those responsible”.|$|E

50|$|However, Greece {{has been}} criticised for {{its lack of}} {{upholding}} minority victims rights and its failure in remedying human rights in cases of hate crime. In order to file a complaint, the current law requires the payment of a fee, dissuading victims of hate crime from reporting offences. This deficiency is exacerbated {{by the lack of}} protection for undocumented migrants experiencing hate crime. Demonstrating the limited victim status of migrants and minority groups members is the inadequacy of support where such groups are victims of police abuse. Greece has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights 11 times for the misuse of weapons by police and the subsequent absence of <b>effective</b> <b>investigations.</b> Migrants or members of minority groups were victims in ten of these incidents.|$|R
