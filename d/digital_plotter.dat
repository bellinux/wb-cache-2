40|$|The {{practice}} of burning large acreages of forest {{lands in the}} West for the reduction of fuel hazards is currently accepted by certain land management agencies. Although these prescribed burns frequently accomplish their objectives, {{little attention has been}} given to the possible effects these have on watershed conditions. In Arizona, where the demand for water is increasing each year, and where large burning programs are in effect, the influences of burning on water infiltration into the soil is of particular importance. Literature on burning and infiltration relationships is inconclusive. Detrimental and beneficial effects to soils and infiltration capacities have been reported. During the summer of 1963, four sites were selected in the ponderosa pine region of east central Arizona. This study area was located five miles east of McNary on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, where a large prescribed burning program has been underway since 1948. In July, a light burn and a heavy burn treatment, which approximated prescribed burning and wildfire conditions, respectively, were conducted on each of the four sites. Temperatures during treatments were measured with fusion pyrometers. Surface soil temperatures for the light burns did not exceed 200 °F. Maximum temperatures at the soil surface for heavy burns ranged from 350 °F. to 550 °F. An infiltrometer plot, one by four feet in size, was installed {{in the center of each}} treatment area (unburned control, light burn, and heavy burn) on each site. A modified North Fork infiltrometer with constant head tank was utilized to conduct infiltration measurements. The twelve infiltrometer plots remained in place for 25 months, through two overwintering periods. Two infiltration runs were conducted on each plot in late summer,. 1963, and three series of runs were made in both the summers of 1964 and 1965. Infiltration curves were plotted for each run from runoff data programmed into a computer and incremental <b>digital</b> <b>plotter.</b> Infiltration capacity values were obtained directly from these curves. Light and heavy burns produced highly significant decreases in infiltration capacities immediately following burning. No statistically significant differences due to burning were detected between the burning treatments and controls during the second and third summers. It was concluded that the burning programs conducted in late fall on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, when followed by an overwintering period with freezing and thawing conditions, cause no appreciable effect on watershed conditions. Additional results showed that nearly all the 96 infiltration curves plotted exhibited a pronounced dip after five to fifteen minutes of water application. Soil wettability or a resistance to wetting is felt to be an important factor in causing this depression; however, the extent and practical significance of this new phenomenon is uncertain. Increases in soil pH, carbon, and total nitrogen percentages for the surface two inches of soil were detected immediately following light and heavy burning treatments. These increases were still evident two years after treatment but to a lesser extent. A statistically significant increase in the bulk density of the surface one inch of soil, which was found immediately after burning, was not found after one overwintering period. Changes in the physical and chemical properties of the silt loam soils in the study area following burning were considered to be negligible...|$|E

40|$|Erosion rate {{evaluation}} and slope morphology evolution in badland areas represent very important scientific and practical problems. In this work detailed geomorphological investigation {{has been carried}} out in some areas of Southern Tuscany (Italy) characterized by very rapid morphological evolution. The Pliocene marine claystones outcropping in this area have been uplifted during the Quaternary up to 750 meters above sea-level, and they are now undergoing particularly intense erosion, leading to considerable badland formation. Detailed geomorphological field surveys have been made and some slopes, chosen as sample-areas, have been monitored. These slopes represent experimental field laboratories, where short-term evolution and seasonal change of landforms generated by fluvial and hillslope processes have been accurately studied, and where the erosion rate is directly measurable. Morphographic and morphometric analyses carried out in special measurement stations evidence that the values of erosion rate on the slopes range from 5 to 7. 5 cm/year. Slope features, because of intense landslide and sheetwash action, changed from rectilinear to concave-convex, to convex becoming rectilinear again in the winter 2000 – winter 2005 short period,.

40|$|The present work {{is part of}} a wider {{research}} project conducted {{over the past two decades}} by the Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra of the University of Rome “La Sapienza”, with aim of studing the recent geomorphological evolution and morphodynamic aspects of some areas in central and southern Apennines. The goal of the present research is (1) to analyse in detail what are the main erosion processes acting on hillslopes, and (2) to estimate their relative rates. This paper presents the results of geomorphological investigation related to the Radicofani area characterized by intense morphogenetic processes and morphological change recorded in the past 50 years. The examined area, situated in the Tuscan Preapennine, near Siena, extends for about 100 km² around the town of Radicofani close to the watershed of Orcia and Paglia rivers. The Pliocene marine claystones outcropping in this area have been uplifted during the Quaternary to several hundreds of meters up sea-level, and they are now suffering particularly intense erosion, lending to considerable badland formation. The tectonic history for this area is representative of the general history of orogenesis in the northern Apennines. Cretaceous to early Oligocene deposition occurred in a compressive foreland as the Tuscan and Ligurian Thrust sheets verged eastward in a large, subaqueous accretionary wedge. Emergence of the wedge in the Miocene was accompanied by extensional faults and formation of local graben. These graben filled with marine and terrestrial deposits. More recently, in the Quaternary, there has be regional arching of the Apennines, perhaps locally influenced by volcanism, to raise Pliocene marine deposits far above sea level. These deposits upl now outcrop at 750 meters above sea-level and show, in some cases, a clear stratification with strike about N-S and dip direction about E-ENE, a few degrees steep; in the western part of the area, the stratification is nearly horizontal or it has a western dip direction. Jointing follows a few preferential directions that seem to condition the main valley downcutting and the intense denudational processes. The analysis of landforms, surface deposits and morphogenetic processes of the study area was carried out through a detailed field survey, and compiled on a Geomorphological Map at a scale of 1 : 10. 000 (enclosed). The survey was systematically carried out for sixteen years (1988 - 2004). It allowed to gather detailed information about active morphological dynamics and evidence that the area is characterised by intense short-term morphological changes. In order to cast these data in a long-term context, an aerial-photograph interpretation analysis was made using the aerial photos of the GAI flight of 1954 and the EIRA flight of 1976; thus geomorphological characteristic of the study area was reconstructed for those years. The comparison of these situations with the one illustrating the present landscape, quantifies the morphological evolution of the area in the last 50 years. The geomorphological study has been completed by morphodinamic analysis: direct and indirect measurements have been carried out in order to have quantitative information on the erosion rate in the examined area. For direct measurements of the erosion simple metallic instruments have been used, placed in two chosen sample-areas with a badland sharp morphology. These areas represent a natural laboratory, where short-term evolution and seasonal change of landforms generated by fluvial and hillslope processes could be accurately studied, and where erosion rate could be directly measured. The metallic instruments (stakes and disks) have been placed in significant zones, but poorly accessible in order to avoid tampering. They have been used as datum points for accurate and continuous measuring, to collect a large series of data. Direct measurements have been integrated with indirect measurements carried out on the basis of the aerophotographic analysis. For a sample-area, digital elevation models (DEM), obtained using a <b>digital</b> video <b>plotter</b> (DVP, Leica) and the aerial phothographs of EIRA flight (1976) and Tuscany Region flight (1994), have been constructed. The comparison between 1976 and 1994 DEM allows to obtain a “difference map”, showing the variation of topographic surface in nineteen years and then to calculate the mean erosion rate in the chosen area. Results of geomorphological analysis evidence that important denudation processes are active in most of the studied area. Erosive processes due to channelized flow (which are responsible for the several deep valley downcutting), to sheetwash (responsible for the frequent badland and “biancana” morphologies), and to gravity (cause of continuous and frequent mass movements, both superficial and deep, active also on gentle slopes) seem to be the particularly intense. The 1988 - 2004 field survey has proved that processes and landforms in the sample area are involved in continuous and rapid short-term changes. The comparison of the 1954 and 1976 landscapes with the 2004 one, evidence many macroscopic morphological differences. The “biancana” areas have been reduced, by the bulldozer working over the last 50 years (especially during the 60 s and in the 70 s). These areas now occupy only 30 % of their previous 1954 surface. “Calanchi” badlands have been less affected by human activity, because of their greater steepness, while have been mainly modified by natural causes. “Calanchi” badlands intensely shaped by runoff waters in 1954, with a characteristic network of deep incisions, steep slopes and sharp ridge-lines, seem to have today a less sharp morphology, due to an increasing impact of gravitative movements on the morphosculptural evolution. Data obtained from direct field measurements of denudational processes evidence that the mean values of erosion rate due to sheetwash range from 1, 5 - 2 cm/year on “biancana” badland areas to 2 - 3 cm/year on “calanchi” badland slopes. For these slopes analyses show that the value of erosion rate increase up to 6 – 7 cm/year as a consequence of very intense mass movements. Indirect measurements confirm direct ones, shoving mean erosion rate values of about 5, 5 cm/year in the above mentioned nineteen years term.
