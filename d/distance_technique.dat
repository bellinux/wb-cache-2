The photographer sets the focus to a fixed point particular to the lens focal length, and the chosen aperture, {{and in the case of}} digital cameras their crop factor. Thus everything from a specific distance (that will typically be close to the camera), all the way to infinity, will be acceptably sharp.

In this study we investigated the effects of a change in embryo transfer technique on the variability in success rates among physicians. METHODS: Retrospectively 4439 transfer cycles in which two differ-ent embryo transfer techniques were applied by seven physicians were studied. In the ®rst 2210 cycles, transfers were performed using the `clinical touch ' method. In the following 2229 cycles, the so-called ®xed <b>distance</b> <b>technique</b> was used. RESULTS: With the clinical touch method pregnancy rates differed greatly among providers, whereas after the introduction of the ®xed <b>distance</b> <b>technique</b> these differences disappeared. Furthermore, the overall clinical pregnancy rate increased from 33. 6 to 40. 4 % per transfer. Using smoothing spline curves we failed to detect a sud-den rise in pregnancy rates at the time the transfer method was changed. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the ®xed <b>distance</b> <b>technique</b> greatly reduced the variation in pregnancy rates among physicians. The overall increase in pregnancy rates after the introduction is likely {{to be related to the}} change in technique although de®nite proof is dif-®cult. Both observations are suggested to be attributable to the atraumatic character of the ®xed <b>distance</b> <b>technique.</b> Key words: embryo transfer technique/IVF±embryo transfer/physician/pregnancy rat...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Advancement in Artificial Intelligence has {{lead to the}} {{developments}} of various “smart ” devices. Character recognition device is one of such smart devices that acquire partial human intelligence {{with the ability to}} capture and recognize various characters in different languages. Firstly multiscale neural training with modifications in the input training vectors is adopted in this paper to acquire its advantage in training higher resolution character images. Secondly selective thresholding using minimum <b>distance</b> <b>technique</b> is proposed to be used to increase the level of accuracy of character recognition. A simulator program (a GUI) is designed {{in such a way that}} the characters can be located on any spot on the blank paper in which the characters are written. The results show that such methods with moderate level of training epochs can produce accuracies of at least 85 % and more for handwritten upper case English characters and numerals.
