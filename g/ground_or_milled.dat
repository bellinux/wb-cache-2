50|$|Another, {{more common}} and {{ironically}} more safe method of preparing a sugar-based rocket propellant is dry heating. First, the potassium nitrate is <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> <b>milled</b> {{to a fine}} powder, and then thoroughly mixed with powdered sugar which is then heated. This method does not actually melt the potassium nitrate, as the melting temperature of KNO3 is 613 degrees Fahrenheit (323 degrees Celsius), but it melts the sugar and coats the grains of KNO3 with the melted sugar. The melting process must be performed using a heat-spreader, {{so as to avoid}} creating autoignition hot-spots.|$|E

40|$|Besides welding, high {{temperature}} vacuum repair-brazing is already established for nickel-based alloy turbine blades in the aerospace and power plant industries. After the worn turbine blade has been decoated to its substrate material, the filler metal is deposited as a paste, (melt-spin) foil or tape which also {{consists of a}} nickel-based alloy. Following this, the hot-gas corrosion protective coating (e. g. NiCoCrAlY) is applied using thermal spraying. The brazed turbine blade is <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> <b>milled</b> to size and subsequently aluminized to further increase its corrosion resistance. Using {{the current state of}} technology, a turbine blade can undergo approximately 3 to 4 repair cycles. In the present study, the development of a two-stage hybrid technology for repairing turbine blades is considered which incorporates, on the one hand, a process technology and manufacturing aspects and, on the other hand, considers material-technological mechanisms. During the first stage of this hybrid technology, the filler metal together with the hot-gas corrosion protective coating is applied using thermal spraying. The subsequent second stage combines the brazing and aluminizing processes. The technology developed here brings technical and economic advantages whilst enabling the current state-of-the-art's corresponding process chain for repairing turbine blades to be shortened...|$|E
40|$|This Reference Document on best {{available}} techniques in the cement and lime industries reflects an information exchange carried out according to Article 16 (2) of Council Directive 96 / 61 /EC. The document has {{to be seen in}} the light of the preface which describes the objectives of the document and its use. This BREF document has two parts, one for the cement industry and one for the lime industry, which each have 7 chapters according to the general outline. Cement industry Cement is a basic material for building and civil engineering construction. Output from the cement industry is directly related to the state of the construction business in general and therefore tracks the overall economic situation closely. The production of cement in the European Union stood at 172 million tonnes in 1995, equivalent to about 12 % of world production. After mining, grinding and homogenisation of raw materials; the first step in cement manufacture is calcination of calcium carbonate followed by burning the resulting calcium oxide together with silica, alumina, and ferrous oxide at high temperatures to form clinker. The clinker is then <b>ground</b> <b>or</b> <b>milled</b> together with gypsum and other constituents to produce cement. Naturally occurring calcareous deposits such as limestone, marl or chalk provide the source for calcium carbonate. Silica, iron oxide and alumina are found in various ores and minerals, such as sand, shale, clay and iron ore. Power station ash, blast furnace slag, and other process residues can also be used as partial replacements for the natural raw materials. To produce 1 tonne of clinker the typical average consumption of raw materials in the EU is 1. 57 tonnes. Most of the balance is lost from the process as carbon dioxide emission to air in the calcination reaction (CaCO 3 → CaO + CO 2). The cement industry is an energy intensive industry with energy typically accounting for 30 - 40 % of production costs (i. e. excluding capital costs). Various fuels can be used to provide the heat required for the process. In 1995 the most commonly used fuels were petcoke (39 %) and coal (36 %) followed by different types of waste (10 %), fuel oil (7 %), lignite (6 %) and ga...|$|E
40|$|Issue: There {{are several}} {{processes}} {{that can be}} used to produce ground rubber crumb. Two of the most common are ambient grinding using various types of grinding mills and cryogenic grinding of rubber by chilling with liquid nitrogen. This section will review the attributes and properties of crumb rubber produced by both methods. Best Practice: Vulcanized scrap rubber is first reduced to a 2 ” x 2 ” or 1 ” x 1 ” chip. This can then be further reduced using ambient <b>ground</b> <b>mills,</b> <b>or</b> frozen and “smashed, ” <b>or</b> <b>ground</b> into fine particles while frozen using cryogenic grinding. This best practice will compare the two methods. The ambient process often uses a conventional high powered rubber cracker mill set with a close nip and vulcanized rubber is sheared and ground into a small particle. It is common to produce 10 to 30 mesh material using this relatively inexpensive method to produce relatively large crumb. Several cracker mills are often used in series. Typical yields are 2, 000 - 2, 200 pounds per hour for 10 - 20 mesh and 1200 pounds per hour for 30 - 40 mesh. The finer the desired particle, the longer the rubber is let run on <b>or</b> in the <b>mill.</b> In addition multiple grinds can be used to reduce the particle size. The lower practical limit for the process is the production of 40 mesh material. Any fiber and extraneous material must be removed using an air separation or an air table. Metal is used using a magnetic separator. The resulting material is fairl...|$|R
