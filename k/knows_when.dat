25|$|The {{sandwich}} {{is named}} after The Great Gatsby, a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nobody really <b>knows</b> <b>when</b> or how the concept came about (even though many falsely laid {{claim to be the}} originators because of its popularity) except that it originated in various factories in and around in the 70s. It is believed that the workers from factories in and around Cape Town would share lunches and thus created sandwiches from whatever they had for lunch that day. As the French loaf allowed for extra filling space, they would prefer to use these over traditional bread slices that way it could also be easier shared amongst co-workers. A Gatsby is thus better enjoyed when shared and best served in its largest form.|$|E
25|$|Henry Augustus Pilsbry suggested, in 1946, that Orthalicus reses reses {{arrived in}} Florida from Central America and the Caribbean {{shortly after the}} {{emergence}} of the Florida peninsula in the late Pleistocene. Snails that were sealed in place on floating tropical trees may have been cast ashore on the Florida peninsula by high winds and hurricanes. This form of dispersal has been suggested for both Orthalicus and Liguus, but the exact origin of these species is still in question. In 1972, Craig suggested that populations of Orthalicus arrived directly across the Gulf of Mexico from Central America, but the mode of transportation and whether dispersal occurred as a single event or multiple events was not known. No one <b>knows</b> <b>when</b> Orthalicus reses reses arrived in the Lower Keys.|$|E

25|$|The series {{begins by}} {{introducing}} unconventional newcomer Franky, to whom secretly insecure popular girl Mini takes a dislike; Mini ingratiates Franky into her group only to disown her. Franky {{is on the}} verge of breakdown, her adoptive father's air revolver in hand, when mysterious stranger Matty convinces her of her self-worth. Mini's sweet friend Grace establishes new friendships with Franky and the school's other outsiders, metalhead Rich and farmhand Alo. In episode two, 'Rich', Grace finds herself drawn to Rich. She attempts to help him win over an elusive girl, and eventually he gets past his shyness to realise his attraction to her too. After Mini's fashion show in 'Mini', the two agree to begin dating. Mini, however, feels pressured to have sex with boyfriend Nick, who does not know she is a virgin. Mini's cruelty to Grace and her new friends backfires when her fashion show goes completely awry. When she realises that her best friend Liv has slept with Nick, she forces herself to have sex with him, which is disappointing.

[...] Smythe disagreed that a new flag would help to unify the country. Smythe switched his support to John Diefenbaker. Smythe wrote over 300 letters to Members of Parliament. In 1965, he unsuccessfully lobbied for the Red Ensign to be flown at the Gardens instead of the new Flag of Canada. Harold Ballard ordered the new flag flown because calls were more than three to one in favour of the new flag.|$|E
500|$|The game's pre-rendered {{backgrounds}} were credited {{for their}} rich details and dismal art style. According to IGN editor Doug Perry, [...] "Crashed cars, rubbish and rubble, totally destroyed city streets, and scattered broken glass and debris, all {{are housed in}} a suburban area that truly looks devastated in the worst possible way." [...] GameSpot felt that the 3D modeling of Jill Valentine was greatly improved {{when compared to the}} [...] "blocky" [...] models in the original game. The music and sound effects received similar praise, with GamePro remarking that the game [...] "keeps the action hot by hiding what you shouldn't see, but telling you about it through the audio." [...] The introduction of the Nemesis creature was highly praised.

Ugly Americans <b>knows</b> <b>when</b> to play this card; at all other junctures, it's got the right instinct when it shows us yet more madness." [...] Harrison praised the battle scene between the wizards and the demons, calling it [...] "one of the best single sequences in the series so far". In contrast, The Standard-Times critic Kevin McDonough was more critical regarding the episode, noting that it [...] "tries a tad too hard". McDonough commented: [...] "The efforts to meld 1980s summer-camp fantasy comedies with the Harry Potter movies are more odd than amusing. Then again, that pretty much sums up Ugly Americans itself." ...|$|E

[...] Dread Central gave it 3 out of 5 knives, saying [...] "there is almost nothing but solid b-level action until the credits roll."

500|$|Further delays on the Creek Turnpike project {{appeared}} {{inevitable in}} October 1990, {{as a new}} area meeting the federal definition of a wetland was discovered {{in the path of}} the turnpike. OTA officials did not bring the area to USACE's attention because they did not believe it met the criteria to be considered a wetland. Frustration mounted after the find; rumors surfaced that OTA was considering canceling the Creek Turnpike and shifting the remaining funds to turnpike projects in the Oklahoma City area. In an interview after an OTA meeting, chairman John Kilpatrick was quoted as saying [...] "God only <b>knows</b> <b>when</b> [...] be completed," [...] describing the project as a [...] "total disaster" [...] and commenting [...] "If we had it all to do over again, we wouldn't do that project." [...] OTA was concerned about the financial impact of USACE's delay in issuing the required permits; each day after the planned opening date that the project ran late added $20,000 (approximately $ in [...] dollars) to the total cost of the project.

Kevin McDonough of the Illinois Daily Journal criticized some of the writing, but summed it up as [...] "an ambitious cartoon" [...] for both younger and older audiences.

[...] The actress called her role [...] "the best role I've ever had," [...] adding [...] "when I'm doing action scenes like flying in helicopters, the hardest thing is to keep a serious face as all I want to do is scream for joy." [...] She researched for her role by taking advice from a female officer in a similar high-ranking position as Grant is.
