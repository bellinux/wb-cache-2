25|$|By {{the fourteenth}} century grander houses and castles were {{sophisticated}} affairs: expensively tiled, often featuring murals and glass windows, these buildings were often designed {{as a set of}} apartments to allow greater privacy. Fashionable brick began to be used {{in some parts of the}} country, copying French tastes. Architecture that emulated the older <b>defensive</b> <b>designs</b> remained popular. Less is known about the houses of peasants during this period, although many peasants appear to have lived in relatively substantial, timber-framed long-houses; the quality of these houses improved in the prosperous years following the Black Death, often being built by professional craftsmen.|$|R
50|$|In 1851, the Lin Ben Yuan family clan {{moved to}} Banqiao. The same year they {{constructed}} the Three-Courtyard Mansion (三落大厝) {{to serve as}} the family's residence. At the time, immigrants from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou were at arms with each another. Due to its wealth and power, the Lin Ben Yuan family became the main leaders of the Zhangzhou immigrants, and the mansion became their erstwhile headquarters. Because of this, the mansion incorporated a number of <b>defensive</b> <b>designs,</b> and several hundred militiamen were stationed there to stand guard. This lasted until the start of the Japanese occupation of Taiwan in 1895.|$|R
5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by trench works and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were specified by the Air Ministry and <b>defensive</b> <b>designs</b> were unique to airfields—these would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so the degree of protection was less and there was more emphasis on all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas without creating impediments to the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the pop-up Picket Hamilton fort—a light pillbox that could be lowered to ground level when the airfield was in use.|$|R
50|$|In modern English usage, the {{informal}} term idiot proof or foolproof describes designs which cannot be misused either inherently, or {{by use of}} <b>defensive</b> <b>design</b> principles.

50|$|Střekov Castle {{is divided}} into two {{sections}} connected by an arched bridge spanning a natural moat—an unusual style for the 14th century, when it was first built. The castle’s semiround bastions, inspired by French architecture, are possibly the first example of that type of <b>defensive</b> <b>design</b> in Bohemia. The connecting round tower, a smaller tower guarding the castle entrance, and an irregular oblong section of the castle date back to the very earliest period of construction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many IT {{departments}} use remote administration {{products to}} configure, monitor, {{and maintain the}} systems they manage. These tools can be beneficial in the right hands, {{but they can also}} be devastating if attackers exploit them to seize control of machines. As a case study, we analyze the security of a remote administration product called Absolute Manage. We find that the system’s communication protocol suffers from serious design flaws and fails to provide adequate integrity, confidentiality, or authentication. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to issue unauthorized commands on client systems and execute arbitrary code with administrator privileges. These blatant vulnerabilities suggest that remote administration tools require increased scrutiny from the security community. We recommend that developers adopt <b>defensive</b> <b>designs</b> that limit the damage attackers can cause if they gain control. ...|$|R

50|$|Over {{the next}} 20 years {{the island was}} {{dramatically}} altered, {{and one of the}} country's finest forts was built. Dedicated in 1847, Fort Warren's <b>defensive</b> <b>design</b> was virtually obsolete upon completion. However, the fort served as a training ground, patrol point, and Civil War prison that gained a favorable reputation for the humane treatment of its Confederate prisoners. After 100 years of military use, the fort was decommissioned in 1947 and acquired by the Metropolitan District Commission for historic preservation and recreation in 1958.|$|E
5000|$|Despite its obvious <b>defensive</b> <b>design,</b> {{there is}} no record of the fort house being {{attacked}} by Indians. [...] A story persists in the county that Cherokee Indians once camped on the far bank of Copper Creek, but that is unlikely since the far bank is a cliff. The fort house is on a natural crossing on Copper Creek that is still used today. Older residents remember when cars would ford the creek at this spot; at least two bridges, including the current one, have been built here. Unused bridge pilings still exist in the creek.|$|E

Hockey can also be an emotional, intense game and is classified as a collision sport by the American Academy of Pediatrics because of the intentional body contact, or bodychecking. 2 Unlike body contact, which may be an incidental part of the game, bodychecking is defined as an individual <b>defensive</b> tactic <b>designed</b> to legally separate the puck carrier from the puck. Using this tactic, a defensive player is allowed to delib-erately and forcefully “hit ” another player who is carrying the puck. Body contact, on the other hand, is an individual <b>defensive</b> tactic <b>designed</b> to legally block or impede the progress of a puck carrier. 3 Using this tactic, a defensiv...|$|R

50|$|<b>Defensive</b> <b>design</b> is the {{practice}} of planning for contingencies in the design stage of a project or undertaking. Essentially, it is {{the practice}} of anticipating all possible ways that an end-user could misuse a device, and designing the device {{so as to make}} such misuse impossible, or to minimize the negative consequences. For example, if it is important that a plug is inserted into a socket in a particular orientation, the socket and plug should be designed so that it is physically impossible to insert the plug incorrectly. Power sockets are often keyed in such a manner, to prevent the transposition of live and neutral.|$|E

50|$|The {{manor house}} was {{designed}} to be easily defended during a turbulent period in Welsh and British history and {{is considered one of the}} finest surviving examples of a semi-fortified manor in Wales. Its first owner, Dafydd ap Richard, is known to have been lord of the manor in 1549. The original <b>defensive</b> <b>design</b> incorporated a single entrance, four-foot thick walls enclosing spiral stone staircases for access between floors and stout wooden doors with iron bolts; there may originally have been up to fourteen staircases, one for each room. When the doors were securely closed, the Manor was effectively divided in two, ensuring that the inner east wing provided a self-contained place of refuge in case of attack.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{domestic}} architecture {{had continued}} to develop, with the Normans, having first occupied the older Anglo-Saxon dwellings, rapidly beginning to build larger buildings in stone and timber.

Wealthier town-houses were also built using stone, and incorporated business and domestic arrangements into a single functional design. By the 14th century grander houses and castles were sophisticated affairs: expensively tiled, often featuring murals and glass windows, these buildings were often designed as a set of apartments to allow greater privacy.
