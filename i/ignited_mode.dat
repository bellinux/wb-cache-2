A Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine was used under Spark Ignition and Homogeneous Charge Compression <b>Ignited</b> <b>modes.</b> An ignition quality tester was utilized in the Compression Ignition mode. One of the promising properties of GEM blends, which are derived using the iso-stoichiometric blending rule, is that they maintain a constant octane number, {{which has led to}} the introduction of methanol as a drop-in fuel to supplement bio-derived ethanol. A constant RON/HCCI fuel number/derived Research octane number property was observed in all three combustion modes for high RON fuels, but for low RON fuels, the iso-stoichiometric blending rule for constant octane number {{did not appear to be}} valid.

50|$|The {{operation}} of the HC in the electron collection mode is called the plasma contacting (or <b>ignited)</b> operating <b>mode.</b> The “ignited mode” is so termed because it indicates that multi-ampere current levels {{can be achieved by}} using the voltage drop at the plasma contactor. This accelerates space plasma electrons which ionize neutral expellant flow from the contactor. If electron collection currents are high and/or ambient electron densities are low, the sheath at which electron current collection is sustained simply expands or shrinks until the required current is collected.|$|R

Use of an auxiliary electrode {{in conjunction with a}} noble gas in the interelectrode space should permit more efficient ion generation for space charge neutralization. The characeristics of a thermionic triode utilizing a ring electrode and a dispenser cathode emitter have been studied as a function of xenon pressure, cesium reservoir temperature, spacing, electrode temperature and pulse parameters (i. e., potential, duration and repetition rate) applied to the auxiliary electrode.

40|$|A {{theory of}} the plasmatron was developed. Also, {{a wide range of}} {{measurements}} were obtained with two versatile, research devices. To gain insight into plasmatron performance, the experimental results are compared with calculations based on the theoretical model of plasmatron operation. Results are presented which show that the plasma arc drop of the conventional arc (<b>ignited)</b> <b>mode</b> converter can be suppressed by use of an auxiliary ion source. The improved performance, however, is presently limited to low current densities because of voltage losses due to plasma resistance. This resistance loss could be suppressed by an increase in the plasma electron temperature or a decrease in spacing. Plasmatron performance characteristics for both argon and cesium are reported. The argon plasmatron has superior performance. Results are also presented for magnetic cutoff effects and for current distributing effects. These are shown to be important factors for the design of practical devices...|$|E
40|$|Thermionic {{research}} has been conducted to investigate a hybrid-mode thermionic converter as a candidate for reducing the barrier index. The hybrid-mode thermionic converter is designed to operate in a combination <b>ignited</b> <b>mode</b> and unignited mode by using a series of parallel grooves in the emitter. The emitter material is molybdenum and the non-grooved land area is thinly coated with rhenium metal. When the emitter is exposed to cesium vapor, as it is during the converter operation, the rhenium-coated land area achieves a lower work function than the grooved molybdenum surface by as much as 0. 5 eV. The low work function land area provides a major portion of electron emission, and the high work function grooved area provides cesium ions required for efficient transport of electrons generated in adjacent land areas to the collector. Experimental results obtained from two different converters and a numerical analysis of converter characteristics are presented in this paper...|$|E

A long plasma filament (> 100 mm) is generated inside the tube in argon with methane admixture. Depending on the quantity of admixture in argon, the negative {{as well as the}} positive corona discharges are <b>ignited.</b> Both <b>modes</b> of plasma are characterized using optical emission spectroscopy. For this purpose, nitrogen is admixed with argon and its emission is used for the determination of gas temperature, electron velocity distribution function, and electron density at various places along the axis of the tube. The formation of active species, like C, C 2, CH, etc. during the dissociation of methane, is observed through their characteristic emission. The rate of methane dissociation is determined at various places along the axis of the tube during both modes of discharge.

50|$|The surface {{property}} of primary {{interest is the}} work function, which is the barrier that limits electron emission current from the surface and essentially is the heat of vaporization of electrons from the surface.

In the <b>ignited</b> (or “arc”) <b>mode</b> the plasma is maintained via ionization internally by hot plasma electrons (~ 3300 K); in the unignited mode the plasma is maintained via injection of externally produced positive ions into a cold plasma; in the hybrid mode the plasma is maintained by ions from a hot-plasma interelectrode region transferred into a cold-plasma interelectrode region.|$|R
40|$|The bare work {{functions}} of etched and unetched plasma-sprayed tungsten {{were found to}} be 4. 8 and 4. 5 eV, respectively. The electron emission of plasma-sprayed tungsten, both etched and unetched, was measured over a wide range of temperatures in a cesium atmosphere. Work functions were derived from the saturation current densities. In the <b>ignited</b> <b>mode,</b> current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were measured. The influence of the emitter, collector, and cesium reservoir temperatures on the I-V characteristics was investigated. Barrier indexes of 2. 06 and 2. 30 eV were found for etched and unetched tungsten emitters, respectively. At an emitter temperature of 1400 ¿°C, {{in the case of an}} unetched tungsten emitter a power density of 1. 5 W/cm 2 was found, while for an etched tungsten emitter it was 4. 5 W/cm 2. This increased power density could be attributed to a lower collector work function. The lower cesiated collector work function resulted from the evaporation of oxygen, as WO 3, from the etched tungsten emitter...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} {{weight of a}} thermionic nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) system depends on the collector temperature because of changes in power density, efficiency and the temperature of heat rejection. Increasing the collector temperature above the value for maximum converter performance decreases both the efficiency and the power density of the converters, but the {{specific weight}} of the total system is decreased because of the reduction in radiator weight due to the increased heat rejection temperature. The effect of collector temperature {{on the performance of}} thermionic converters was investigated. The behavior of conventional <b>ignited</b> <b>mode</b> converters as well as advanced converters with lower collector work functions; the specific mass of an 'uninsulated' NEP system design was then evaluated as a function of collector temperature. The uninsulated design uses the electrical resistance of the heat pipes between the converters and the reactor to provide electrical insolation, eliminating the need for ceramic insulators at emitter temperature and providing other design advantages. The results indicate that an optimum collector temperature, which minimizes system weight, exists at a temperature above the optimum temperature for converter performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{hybrid mode}} {{operation}} for {{the reduction of}} plasma drops is being investigated. This report discusses the results obtained from two molybdenum emitter converters. One converter had a molybdenum collector {{and the other a}} nickel collector. The molybdenum collector converter was operated in a hybrid mode (at an interelectrode distance of 1. 7 mm) and produced a minimum barrier index of 1. 96 eV at an emitter temperature of 1500 K. The arc drop was calculated to be 0. 14 eV, using the published results for a molybdenum collector. On the other hand, the nickel collector converter was operated in a conventional <b>ignited</b> <b>mode</b> (at an interelectrode distance of 0. 5 mm) and produced a minimum barrier index of 2. 1 eV at an emitter temperature of 1700 K. It is tentatively concluded that a large-gap operation of the hybrid mode converter permits the diffusion of cesium ions to a distance in the order of one millimeter for an effective neutralization of electron space charge. By employing a low work function collector (1. 55 eV) in a hybrid mode converter with an arc drop of 0. 14 eV, it appears that a barrier index as low as 1. 69 eV could be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{including}} plasma potential profile measurements made on {{a simple}} hollow cathode plasma contactor operating in the electron collection and emission modes are described. The <b>ignited</b> electron collection <b>mode</b> of contactor operation is identified, shown to improve contactor performance and found to be facilitated by increasing {{the size of the}} contactor anode. Potential profile data are compared to the predictions of a simple theoretical model that describes space-charge-current limitations imposed by the formation of a double sheath and found to agree with each other to within about + or - 25 percent. Because electrons, which are the dominant charge carriers, tend to be emitted from the hollow cathode in the emission mode and collected by the anode in the collection mode it is suggested that operation at high electrodynamic tether currents will probably require switching the point of tether connection to the contactor between its cathode and anode when the direction of tether current is reversed...|$|R
40|$|At {{the turn}} of the ninth century, the Virgin Mary was under assault from {{multiple}} fronts. Adherents to an alternative Christology called Felicianism agitated complex problems within the Christian church concerning the contribution of the Virgin Mary to Christ 2 ̆ 7 s birth, at least according to Carolingian church officials and the pope who opposed their Christology. At the same time, another form of Christianity in the Byzantine East grew in popularity. Known as Paulicianism, this “heresy” called into question Mary 2 ̆ 7 s status as Theotokos, or the bearer of God. This dissertation examines the impact of these controversies on Carolingian thought and cultural creation during the late eighth and early ninth centuries to see how they transformed the cult of the Virgin Mary. ^ Heterodoxy <b>ignited</b> new <b>modes</b> of investigation into the nature of Mary’s contribution to Christ in the womb, the importance of Mary’s lineage, and the relationship of Mary to royal devotion. One of the more striking aspects of the new cultural creation that emerged from heterodoxy was the need to discuss more openly the moment of Christ’s conception in Mary 2 ̆ 7 s womb, as this was the primary division between Felician thought and Carolingian “orthodox” thought. In order to satisfactorily address this division, defenders of orthodoxy utilized contemporary theories of human reproduction to articulate their argument, all the while debating the nature of Mary’s contribution to the creation of Christ. Another aspect of Mary that Carolingian scholars explored was Mary’s crucial role in the fulfillment of divine prophecy, specifically her link between Jesus and the Christ as a descendent of King David. In promoting Mary’s Davidic heritage, those in Carolingian Europe responding to Felicianism drew from apocryphal literature to justify their own orthodoxy. These intellectual endeavors designed to rationalize the importance of Mary to Christianity were coupled with cultural efforts to elevate the status of the cult of the Virgin Mary. Those cultural efforts came from the court of Charlemagne, who actively supported the intellectual pursuits of his court with a number of public measures. Charlemagne, King of the Franks and Emperor of the Roman West, dedicated a group of his most important churches to the Virgin Mary, acquired Marian relics to enrich the altars of those churches, and enacted legislation designed to secure her place in churches throughout his empire. ^ Charlemagne shaped this new vision of Mary, but he did not accomplish it alone. Many modern historians are familiar with the anti-Felician work of Alcuin of York and Paulinus of Aquileia, both of whom served as intellectual luminaries at Charlemagne’s court. Few have placed Benedict of Aniane in this company. This dissertation broadens our understanding of the Carolingian response to the Felician movement by mining Benedict as a new resource through his little known Munimenta verae fidei, or Fortifications of the True Faith. I argue that his compilation of both original and borrowed texts presented a response to Felician thought and served as a bulwark in defense of the “orthodox” Christianity constructed by Charlemagne, Alcuin, Paulinus, and Pope Hadrian. Carolingian orthodoxy developed and matured through conflict with heterodoxy, as Benedict demonstrated in his own work. This study challenges the perception that limits Benedict of Aniane’s career to monastic reform and provides a new context for interpreting the Munimenta verae fidei and its anti-Felician themes. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{theory of}} the plasma {{contacting}} process is described and experimental results obtained using three different hollow cathode-based plasma contactors are presented. The existence of a sheath across which {{the bulk of the}} voltage drop associated with the contacting process occurs is demonstrated. Test results are shown to agree with a model of a spherical, space-charge-limited double sheath. The concept of <b>ignited</b> <b>mode</b> contactor operation is discussed, which is shown to enhance contactor efficiency when it is collecting electrons. An investigation of the potentials in the plasma plumes downstream of contactors operating at typical conditions is presented. Results of tests performed on hollow cathodes operating at high interelectrode pressures (up to about 1000 Torr) on ammonia are presented and criteria that are necessary to ensure that the cathode will operate properly in this regime are presented. These results suggest that high pressure hollow cathode operation is difficult to achieve and that special care must be taken to assure that the electron emission region remains diffuse and attached to the low work function insert. Experiments conducted to verify results obtained previously using a ring cusp ion source equipped with a moveable anode are described and test results are reported. A theoretical study of hollow cathode operation at high electron emission currents is presented. Preliminary experiments using the constrained sheath optics concept to achieve ion extraction under conditions of high beam current density, low net accelerating voltage and well columniated beamlet formation are discussed...|$|E

The phenomenology of cesium-oxygen thermionic converters was elucidated in these programs, and the factors that had prevented the achievement of stable, enhanced cesium-oxygen converter performance for the previous thirty years were identified.

These observations were {{made during the}} second cooperative high altitude rocket gun experiment (CHARGE- 2) which was an electrically tethered mother/daughter payload system. The current collection enhancement was observed at the daughter payload located 100 to 400 m away from the mother which was firing an energetic electron beam. The authors interpret these results {{in terms of an}} electrical discharge forming in close proximity to the daughter during the short periods of gas emission. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} enhance the electron current collection capability of positively charged vehicles by means of deliberate neutral gas releases into an otherwise undisturbed space plasma. These results can also be compared with recent laboratory observations of hollow cathode plasma contactors operating in the <b>ignited</b> <b>mode.</b> Experimental observations of current collection enhancements due to cold nitrogen gas control jet emissions from a highly charged, isolated daughter payload in the nighttime ionosphere were made. These observations were derived from the second cooperative high altitude rocket gun experiment (CHARGE- 2) which was an electrically tethered mother-daughter payload system. The rocket flew from White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) in December, 1985. The rocket achieved an altitude of 261 km and carried a 1 keV electron beam emitting up to 48 mA of current (Myers, et al., 1989 a). The mother payload, carried the electron beam source, while the daughter acted as a remote current collection and observation platform and reached a distance of 426 m away from the main payload.

40|$|The {{current work}} {{addresses}} {{the use of}} producer gas, a bio-derived gaseous alternative fuel, in engines designed for natural gas, derived from diesel engine frames. Impact {{of the use of}} producer gas on the general engine performance with specific focus on turbo-charging is addressed. The operation of a particular engine frame with diesel, natural gas and producer gas indicates that the peak load achieved is highest with diesel fuel (in compression ignition mode) followed by natural gas and producer gas (both in spark ignite mode). Detailed analysis of the engine power de-rating on fuelling with natural gas and producer gas indicates that the change in compression ratio (migration from compression to spark <b>ignited</b> <b>mode),</b> difference in mixture calorific value and turbocharger mismatch are the primary contributing factors. The largest de-rating occurs due to turbocharger mismatch. Turbocharger selection and optimization is identified as the strategy to recover the non-thermodynamic power loss, identified as the recovery potential (the loss due to mixture calorific value and turbocharger mismatch) on operating the engine with a fuel different from the base fuel. A turbocharged after-cooled six cylinder, 5. 9 l, 90 kWe (diesel rating) engine (12. 2 bar BMEP) is available commercially as a naturally aspirated natural gas engine delivering a peak load of 44. 0 kWe (6. 0 bar BMEP). The engine delivers a load of 27. 3 kWe with producer gas under naturally aspirated mode. On charge boosting the engine with a turbocharger similar in configuration to the diesel engine turbocharger, the peak load delivered with producer gas is 36 kWe (4. 8 bar BMEP) indicating a de-rating of about 60 % over the baseline diesel mode. Estimation of knock limited peak load for producer gas-fuelled operation on the engine frame using a Wiebe function-based zero-dimensional code indicates a knock limited peak load of 76 kWe, indicating the potential to recover about 40 kWe. As a part of the recovery strategy, optimizing the ignition timing for maximum brake torque based on both spark sweep tests and established combustion descriptors and engine-turbocharger matching for producer gas-fuelled operation resulted in a knock limited peak load of 72. 8 kWe (9. 9 bar BMEP) at a compressor pressure ratio of 2. 30. The de-rating of about 17. 0 kWe compared to diesel rating is attributed to the reduction in compression ratio. With load recovery, the specific biomass consumption reduces from 1. 2 kg/kWh to 1. 0 kg/kWh, an improvement of over 16 % while the engine thermal efficiency increases from 28 % to 32 %. The thermodynamic analysis of the compressor and the turbine indicates an isentropic efficiency of 74. 5 % and 73 %, respectively...|$|E
