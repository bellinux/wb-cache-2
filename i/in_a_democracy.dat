5|$|Calhoun's {{ideas on}} the {{concurrent}} majority are illustrated in A Disquisition on Government. The Disquisition is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion. It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democracy.</b>|$|E

Anne Phillips wrote in her review for The News-Gazette that the book is a concise and well-written description of the conflicts the country faces when grappling with the notions of freedom of expression, free speech, and freedom of the press. Writing for The Christian Science Monitor, Chuck Leddy noted that the author helps readers understand the importance of freedom of speech <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democracy,</b> especially during a period of military conflict when there is increased controversy over the appropriateness of dissent and open dialogue.|$|E

25|$|Russell was {{a highly}} {{respected}} senatorial colleague and skilled legislator. Russell chaired the Senate investigation into the firing of General Douglas MacArthur.

25|$|The Supreme Court {{balances}} several {{pressures to}} maintain its roles in national government. It seeks to be a co-equal branch of government, but its decrees must be enforceable. The Court seeks to minimize situations where it asserts itself superior to either President or Congress, but federal officers must be held accountable. The Supreme Court assumes power to declare acts of Congress as unconstitutional but it self-limits its passing on constitutional questions. But the Court's guidance on basic problems of life and governance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democracy</b> is most effective when American political life reinforce its rulings.|$|E
25|$|The Assembly {{suspended}} the quintet {{by a vote}} of 140 to 6, with one Democrat supporting the Socialists. Civil libertarians and concerned citizens raised their voices to aid the suspended Socialists, and protest percolated throughout the press. The principal argument was that majority parties expelling elected members of minority parties from their councils set a dangerous precedent <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democracy.</b> The battle culminated in a highly publicized trial in the Assembly, which dominated the body's activity from its opening on January 20, 1920, until its conclusion on March 11. Socialist Party leader and former 1917 New York City mayoral candidate Morris Hillquit served as chief counsel for the suspended Socialists, aided by party founder, and future Socialist vice presidential candidate, Seymour Stedman.|$|E

25|$|Peter Singer, in Democracy and Disobedience, {{argues that}} {{compulsory}} voting could negate {{the obligation of}} a voter to support {{the outcome of the}} election, since voluntary participation in elections is deemed {{to be one of the}} sources of the obligation to obey the law <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democracy.</b> In 1996 Albert Langer was jailed for three weeks on contempt charges in relation to a constitutional challenge on a legal way not to vote for either of the major parties. Chong, Davidson and Fry, writing in the journal of the right wing think tank the CIS, argue that Australian compulsory voting is disreputable, paternalistic, disadvantages smaller political parties, and allows major parties to target marginal seats and make some savings in pork-barrelling because of this targeting. Chong et al. also argue that denial is a significant aspect of the debate about compulsory voting.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} of centuries of social injustice through the caste system (see below, {{in the next}} Section) is not accepted by those who {{point out that the}} caste system, although differently known and practised in different societies, is a tribal hangover from the past, which had some merit in that it ensured, or 'reserved', specified jobs to be done castes which had a preference to do so. They have no sanction in the Vedas (the Upanishads Section) in which only speak of four broad 'Varnas' or divisions according to the temperament of people and of inter-Varna switch, or mobility, based on individual efforts when he/she happens to be borne to a man of a particular Varna. This process, called 'Samskara' is, approximately, conscious individual refinement. In a true sense, therefore, the talk of deliberate subjugation of or discrimination of upper castes against lower castes has no basis, even though distortions of the principle has happened historically, without sanction of the Vedas. Hence reservation, the anti-reservationists seem to say, is just a mask for demanding reservations under the cloak of casteism over-riding merit and blissfully ignoring that Vedas do not sanction this. At any rate, after several decades of Varna reservation for the lowest social strata comprising certain classes constitutionally enshrined as 'scheduled castes' and 'scheduled tribes', and otherwise open competition to all people irrespective of any criteria other than merit and aptitude, there is no justification for the political parties to demand extend reservation of educational admission and job opportunities to more classes ('other backward castes'). It is pointed out that more opportunities in keeping with the uncontrolled growth in population, in all spheres of economic activity as well as education, will be the only right answer and not reservation. However, since proportional representation is the basis of modern democracy as it is practised, these anti-reservationists point out, this, in India, has led to its most abominable abuse, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democracy</b> which is of and by Indians but against their own interests, since a disunited country oblivious of equality of opportunity because of prohibitive reservation levels, can never compete successfully in the global context, nor achieve much in its own management of internal economy.(Already due to politicisation of trade unions, India's labour productivity remains among the lowest in the world, as a UK study had pointed out a few years ago.) The abuse of political power to demand reservation for all other than the so-called 'forward ' communities is, according to the contesters, just a vote bank politics to woo the majority represented by the beneficiary communities to cast their votes in their favour. Since, however, there are no opponents among political parties to educational and job reservations, in view of their universal vote bank politics, such reservation in themselves cannot favour any particular parties at the elections.|$|E

The Emperor was inspired by the villain Ming the Merciless from the Flash Gordon comic books.

Lucas said, [...] "The whole point of the movies, the underlying element that makes the movies work, is that you, whether you go backwards or forwards, you start out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democracy,</b> and democracy turns into a dictatorship, and then the rebels make it back into a democracy." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 26, 2004, Ojeda Ríos {{issued a}} post-election {{statement}} and after classifying {{the process as}} one that arises from [...] "illusions" [...] that promote [...] "division", diverted his attention {{to a series of}} editorials published by Claridad analyzing the political environment of Puerto Rico, in particular one published {{during the first week of}} November where the newspaper stated its availability to all sectors within the movement. He argued against the individualization of the independence movement, citing that years of epithets and personalisms in the independentist speech had not advanced the cause. To control any damage caused by these, Ojeda Ríos proposed that the debates between factions should be held in private, allowing a dispassionate and conciliatory approach to the solution of these problems. He clarified that the EPB did believe in organizing general elections, but only when [...] "regulated by strict democratic rules", which they don't perceive in the events held under the territorial clause. Ojeda Ríos also opposed participating <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democracy</b> that supports military incursions in independent states.
