5|$|A large {{population}} spreads across the Hawaiian Islands every winter, {{ranging from the}} island of Hawaii {{in the south to}} Kure Atoll in the north. These animals feed in areas ranging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of California to the Bering Sea. Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century and might have gained a dominance over North Pacific right whales, as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cavalry}} {{breakthrough}} on the coast, the XXI Corps would advance {{to capture the}} headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm together with sections of the lateral railway line in the Judean Hills between Tulkarm and Nablus, a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway, which supplied the two Ottoman Armies, including the important railway junction at Messudieh in the Judean Hills. The infantry divisions were to continue their attack by swinging north–east, pivoting on their right to push the defenders back out of their trenches away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> and back into the Judean Hills towards Messudieh.|$|E
5|$|As {{the ridge}} pushed the storm away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast,</b> weaker wind shear and warm sea-surface {{temperatures}} allowed Kiko to gradually intensify. The storm {{reached its peak}} intensity of 70mph (110km/h) 991mbar (hPa; 29.28inHg) late on October 20 while located around 175mi (280km) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. As it moved away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast,</b> an eye began to form. Shortly thereafter, shear increased and began to separate the low from the deep convection. By the afternoon of October21, the storm was poorly organized and the center was partially exposed. At this time, the weakening system had winds sustained at 50mph (85km/h). Early on October22, a brief burst in showers and thunderstorms allowed the storm to maintain its intensity. That evening, Kiko was downgraded to a tropical depression as strong wind shear removed convection from the storm's center and exposed the low. As the depression moved over a dryer and more hostile area, two inhibiting factors for development of tropical cyclones, it slowly weakened. It lost almost all convection and degenerated to a remnant low-pressure area on October23, and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory that night. The remnant low moved west before dissipating on October27 over open waters.|$|E

5|$|Darius' initial {{response}} was defensive: he immediately stockaded the river bank with stakes to impede the enemy's crossing. A core vanguard of traitorous Greek mercenaries and Persian royal guard was established; as was usual for Persian kings, Darius positioned {{himself in the}} centre of this vanguard, in order that he might effectively dispatch commands to any part of his large army. A group of Persian light infantry was soon sent to the foothills, as it was suspected that Alexander would make an approach from the right, away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast.</b> A mass of cavalry commanded by Nabarsanes occupied the Persian right.|$|E

5|$|During the season, the Météo-France office (MFR) on Réunion island issued {{warnings}} {{in tropical}} cyclones within the basin. The agency estimated intensity through the Dvorak technique, and warned on tropical cyclones {{in the region}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> of Africa to 90°E, south of the equator to 30°S. At the time, the cyclone year was from August1 to July31 of the subsequent year. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which is a joint United States Navy– United States Air Force task force, also issued tropical cyclone warnings for the southwestern Indian Ocean in an unofficial capacity.|$|E
5|$|Farther {{north in}} Rhode Island, 10,000people fled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast.</b> Despite {{evacuation}} orders, {{nearly half of}} the residents in Narragansett, Rhode Island, refused to leave their homes and as a result martial law was implemented to get people to leave. The Red Cross reported that about 2,300 people evacuated Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and thousands of tourists left the area. About 70flights to and from Boston's Logan International Airport were canceled. Flood warnings were raised across western portions of the state.|$|E
5|$|Haas' early third {{millennium}} dates {{suggest that the}} development of coastal and inland sites occurred in parallel. But, from 2500 to 2000 BC, during the period of greatest expansion, the population and development decisively shifted toward the inland sites. All development apparently occurred at large interior sites such as Caral, though they remained dependent on fish and shellfish <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast.</b> The peak in dates is in keeping with Shady's dates at Caral, which show habitation from 2627 BC to 2020 BC. That coastal and inland sites developed in tandem remains disputed, however (see next section).|$|E

Guatemala was placed under a warning on October 24. In addition, new flash flood and mudslide warnings were raised for Guatemala and the Mexican state of Chiapas on October 24 and 25, respectively. All warnings and watches were discontinued later on October 25 as Miriam turned away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast.</b>|$|E
