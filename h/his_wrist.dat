60|$|A {{blinding}} flash {{went over}} his brain, his body jolted. His heart had burst into flame. His consciousness was gone into <b>his</b> <b>wrists,</b> into <b>his</b> hands.

5|$|This {{incident}} {{was used as}} evidence for Boycott's selfish attitude for many years after. His highest score was 142 not out in the second innings of the Fourth Test at Sydney, in a 299-run victory. The Fifth Test was drawn, Boycott making 12 and 76*, and in the Sixth Test he was run out for 58. Boycott initially refused to leave the ground in disbelief, and eventually walked off to jeering from the crowd. He made 119 in the second innings but injured his arm against fast bowler Garth McKenzie in a following one day match and missed the final Test, when England retained the Ashes. He later maintained that the injury permanently affected <b>his</b> <b>wrist,</b> and that he carried a squash ball in a sock in his pocket, which he could squeeze to keep <b>his</b> <b>wrist</b> strong. He ended the series with 657 Test runs at 93.85.|$|E

5|$|Nash's {{performance}} in junior cricket led Victorian district cricket club Fitzroy to sign {{him for the}} 1927/28 season. Nash made his first grade debut for Fitzroy as a seventeen-year-old and spent {{two and a half}} seasons at Fitzroy, earning plaudits for his performances and, until he broke <b>his</b> <b>wrist</b> in a fielding mishap, there were suggestions that he was close to Victorian selection.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, {{and he was able to}} return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his left wrist after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his ulnar nerve and three tendons. He was sitting on the table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, <b>his</b> <b>wrist</b> was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from <b>his</b> <b>wrist</b> and repair the nerve and tendon damage. He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later. Again he played in 56 games, and increased his win total to 28.|$|E

5|$|The British No. 1 {{sustained}} {{tendon damage}} {{during his first}} round match at the German Open in Hamburg.

5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} associated with this, including {{the possibility of the}} Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from <b>his</b> <b>wrist</b> while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out of the wagon, grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E

5|$|James played wide {{receiver}} for St. Vincent-St. Mary's football team and was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.
