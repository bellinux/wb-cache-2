It was otherwise identical to the 1984 design, except for the two 64 <b>kilobit</b> × 4 bit DRAM chips that replaced the original eight 64 <b>kilobit</b> × 1 bit ICs. After {{the release of the}} Commodore 64C, MOS Technology began to reconfigure the original C64's chipset to use HMOS production technology. The main benefit of using HMOS was that it required less voltage to drive the IC, which consequently generates less heat. This enhanced the overall reliability of the SID and VIC-II. The new chipset was renumbered to 85xx to reflect the change to HMOS. In 1987, Commodore released a 64C variant with a highly redesigned motherboard commonly known as a [...] "short board". The new board used the new HMOS chipset, featuring a new 64-pin PLA chip. The new [...] "SuperPLA", as it was dubbed, integrated many discrete components and transistor–transistor logic (TTL) chips. In the last revision of the 64C motherboard, the 2114 color RAM was integrated into the SuperPLA.|$|E
