Symptoms can include contact dermatitis, intense itching, rhinoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchial asthma, sweating, and anaphylaxis. Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions, possibly {{due to the}} <b>denaturing</b> of the proteins from cooking.|$|E

25|$|<b>Denaturing</b> {{conditions}} {{are necessary for}} proper estimation of molecular weight of RNA. RNA is able to form more intramolecular interactions than DNA which may result in change of its electrophoretic mobility. Urea, DMSO and glyoxal are the most often used <b>denaturing</b> agents to disrupt RNA structure. Originally, highly toxic methylmercury hydroxide was often used in <b>denaturing</b> RNA electrophoresis, {{but it may be}} method of choice for some samples.|$|E

25|$|Unlike <b>denaturing</b> methods, native gel {{electrophoresis}} {{does not use}} a charged <b>denaturing</b> agent. The molecules being separated (usually proteins or nucleic acids) therefore differ not only in molecular mass and intrinsic charge, but also the cross-sectional area, and thus experience different electrophoretic forces dependent on {{the shape of the}} overall structure. For proteins, since they remain in the native state they may be visualised not only by general protein staining reagents but also by specific enzyme-linked staining.|$|E

25|$|Ethanol is used {{in medical}} wipes and most common {{antibacterial}} hand sanitizer gels as an antiseptic. Ethanol kills organisms by <b>denaturing</b> their proteins and dissolving their lipids and is effective against most bacteria and fungi, and many viruses. However, ethanol is ineffective against bacterial spores.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{steps for}} {{large-scale}} production of ethanol are: microbial (yeast) fermentation of sugars, distillation, dehydration (requirements vary, see Ethanol fuel mixtures, below), and <b>denaturing</b> (optional). Prior to fermentation, some crops require saccharification or hydrolysis of carbohydrates such as cellulose and starch into sugars. Saccharification of cellulose is called cellulolysis (see cellulosic ethanol). Enzymes {{are used to}} convert starch into sugar.|$|E
25|$|Pyro{{sequencing of}} {{bisulfite}} treated DNA. This is sequencing of an amplicon {{made by a}} normal forward primer but a biotinylated reverse primer to PCR the gene of choice. The Pyrosequencer then analyses the sample by <b>denaturing</b> the DNA and adding one nucleotide {{at a time to}} the mix according to a sequence given by the user. If there is a mis-match, it is recorded and the percentage of DNA for which the mis-match is present is noted. This gives the user a percentage methylation per CpG island.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{companies}} that offer alternatives to paint-based antifouling, using ultrasonic transducers mounted in {{or around the}} hull of small to medium-sized boats. Research has shown these systems can help reduce fouling, by initiating bursts of ultrasonic waves through the hull medium to the surrounding water, killing or <b>denaturing</b> the algae and other micro-organisms that form {{the beginning of the}} fouling sequence. The systems cannot work on wooden-hulled boats, or boats with a soft-cored composite material, such as wood or foam. The systems have been loosely based on technology proven to control algae blooms.|$|E
25|$|For proteins, SDS-PAGE {{is usually}} the first choice as an assay of purity due to its {{reliability}} and ease. The presence of SDS and the <b>denaturing</b> step make proteins separate, approximately based on size, but aberrant migration of some proteins may occur. Different proteins may also stain differently, which interferes with quantification by staining. PAGE may {{also be used as}} a preparative technique for the purification of proteins. For example, quantitative preparative native continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (QPNC-PAGE) is a method for separating native metalloproteins in complex biological matrices.|$|E
25|$|Many {{membrane}} proteins are glycoproteins {{and can be}} purified by lectin affinity chromatography. Detergent-solubilized proteins can {{be allowed}} to bind to a chromatography resin that has been modified to have a covalently attached lectin. Proteins that do not bind to the lectin are washed away and then specifically bound glycoproteins can be eluted by adding {{a high concentration of}} a sugar that competes with the bound glycoproteins at the lectin binding site. Some lectins have high affinity binding to oligosaccharides of glycoproteins that is hard to compete with sugars, and bound glycoproteins need to be released by <b>denaturing</b> the lectin.|$|E
40|$|Two {{problems}} can arise {{when working with}} small quantities of DNA in polypropylene tubes: first, significant amounts of DNA can become lost by sticking to the tube walls; second, short DNA fragments tend to <b>denature</b> when binding to polypropylene. In addition, DNA also tends to <b>denature</b> upon dehydration. We have found that {{a simple way to}} solve these problems is by using polyallomer tubes instead of polypropylene and by avoiding certain salts, such as sodium acetate, when drying DNA...|$|R
50|$|The {{computational}} model itself calculates the probability {{profile of a}} given base-pair sequence of DNA to <b>denature,</b> {{as well as the}} energy profile of sequence. It is through this energy profile that the technique derives its name: base pairs at lower energies are less stable (destabilized) than those of higher energies and more likely to <b>denature.</b> Stress related to the linking number (specifically its twist component) of the DNA causes the destabilization of the double helix (duplex); hence, Stress-Induced Duplex Destabilization.|$|R

25|$|Formaldehyde {{preserves}} or fixes tissue or cells by {{a mixture}} of reversible (short exposure time and low temperatures) and irreversible (long exposure time and higher temperatures) cross-linking of primary amino groups in proteins with other nearby nitrogen atoms in protein or DNA through a -CH2- linkage. This is exploited in ChIP-on-chip or ChIP-sequencing genomics experiments, where DNA-binding proteins are cross-linked to their cognate binding sites on the chromosome and analyzed to determine what genes are regulated by the proteins. Formaldehyde is also used as a <b>denaturing</b> agent in RNA gel electrophoresis, preventing RNA from forming secondary structures. A solution of 4% formaldehyde fixes pathology tissue specimens at about one mm per hour at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|For the {{analysis}} of the functioning of proteins in a cell, the knowledge of their cooperation is essential. Most often proteins act together in complexes to be fully functional. The analysis of this sub organelle organisation of the cell requires techniques conserving the native state of the protein complexes. In native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native PAGE), proteins remain in their native state and are separated in the electric field following their mass and the mass of their complexes respectively. To obtain a separation by size and not by net charge, as in IEF, an additional charge is transferred to the proteins by the use of Coomassie Brilliant Blue or lithium dodecyl sulfate. After completion of the first dimension the complexes are destroyed by applying the <b>denaturing</b> SDS-PAGE in the second dimension, where the proteins of which the complexes are composed of are separated by their mass.|$|E
25|$|Organic cofactors {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} (typically a molecular mass less than 1000 Da) {{that can be}} either loosely or tightly bound to the enzyme and directly participate in the reaction. In the latter case, when {{it is difficult to}} remove without <b>denaturing</b> the enzyme, it can be called a prosthetic group. It is important to emphasize that there is no sharp division between loosely and tightly bound cofactors. Indeed, many such as NAD+ can be tightly bound in some enzymes, while it is loosely bound in others. Another example is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is tightly bound in transketolase or pyruvate decarboxylase, while it is less tightly bound in pyruvate dehydrogenase. Other coenzymes, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), biotin, and lipoamide, for instance, are covalently bound. Tightly bound cofactors are, in general, regenerated during the same reaction cycle, while loosely bound cofactors can be regenerated in a subsequent reaction catalyzed by a different enzyme. In the latter case, the cofactor can also be considered a substrate or cosubstrate.|$|E

50|$|The {{baking process}} causes the batter {{to expand and}} go from a liquid to a solid foam. The {{proteins}} will not start to <b>denature</b> until the temperature reaches around 158 °F. During this rise in temperature the air bubbles will either expand, coalesce, or break. An egg white foam will continue to expand uniformly until the internal temperature reaches 176 - 185 °F. Based on the ideal gas law, as the temperature increases, {{the volume of the}} air bubbles will expand. The temperature will continue to rise, causing the cake to expand at different rates and egg white proteins will gradually <b>denature.</b> Some of the egg white proteins will start to <b>denature</b> and coagulate at around 135 °F. This establishes the setting of the foam structure. By the time the temperature reaches 180 °F, all of the egg white proteins will have set in place.|$|R
