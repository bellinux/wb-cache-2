5|$|In Europe, Boletus pinophilus {{is found}} in Britain, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> common in Scotland, and in France, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> common in the south. The bolete is {{considered}} vulnerable in the Czech Republic. It is sold commercially in Finland.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} traditions are upheld and {{recognised}} by choristers. Club members snap their fingers instead of clapping at each other's achievements (i.e. {{a good performance}} on a solo) because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> difficult to clap with one's music in the other hand. The club hosts a banquet every spring where awards are presented.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium's {{chemical}} {{behavior is}} largely {{a result of its}} small atomic and ionic radii. It thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are covalent. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> chemically similar to aluminium than its close neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio.|$|E
5|$|Crucible {{steel is}} steel {{that has been}} melted in a {{crucible}} rather than having been forged, {{with the result that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> homogeneous. Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s. Blister steel (made as above) was melted in a crucible or in a furnace, and cast (usually) into ingots.|$|E
5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church would have an inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In her opinion, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> likely that the church was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E

5|$|Entoloma sinuatum {{is fairly}} common and {{widespread}} across North America {{as far south}} as Arizona. It also occurs throughout Europe and the British Isles including Ireland, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> common in southern and central parts of Europe than the northwest. In Asia, it has been recorded in the Black Sea region, and Adıyaman Province in Turkey, Iran, and northern Yunnan in China.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common serious {{neurological}} disorders affecting about 39 million people as of 2015. It affects 1% of the population by age 20 and 3% of the population by age 75. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> common in males than females with the overall difference being small. Most of those with the disorder (80%) are in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} same phases, their self-assembled {{structures}} are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> difficult to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.|$|E

5|$|His {{collection}} is vast and diverse, and includes Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Indian pieces {{dating from the}} 10th century. One example is a Quranic page of North African origin written with gold lettering in the Kufic script – <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> than 1,000 years old. Prince Sadruddin's Persian roots are well represented in calligraphic as well as pictoral specimens reflecting a range of periods and dynastic patrons. Also included are several examples of Ottoman callgraphies, manuscripts and paintings.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> {{common to}} find Ediacaran fossils under sandy beds {{deposited}} by storms or high-energy bottom-scraping ocean currents known as turbidites. Soft-bodied organisms today rarely fossilize during such events, but {{the presence of}} widespread microbial mats probably aided preservation by stabilising their impressions in the sediment below.|$|E
5|$|In Europe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> {{common in}} {{northern}} than south Europe, {{and it has}} not been reported from south and west Europe. In addition to being common in Scandinavian countries, it has been collected in Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Russia, Slovakia, and Korea.

5|$|In other areas, such as formal analysis, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> {{convenient}} to work {{directly with the}} power series themselves. Thus one may define a solution of a differential equation as a power series which, one hopes to prove, is the Taylor series of the desired solution.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
5|$|It is a bird of open sclerophyll forests, {{eucalypt}} and acacia woodlands and scrublands, with sparse or no understory, or low {{cover with}} shrubs such as Triodia, Lomandra or Hibbertia. It is less common in mallee scrub. In arid areas and northern Australia, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> restricted to woodland alongside rivers and billabongs. It {{has become more}} common in southwest Western Australia with land clearing, though has become rare around Darwin on account of urban development.|$|E

40|$|Phyteurna spica turn L. (Campanulaceae) is a {{rare species}} in Britain {{occurring}} in low numbers in a small area of East Sussex (v. c. 14). <b>Its</b> history has <b>been</b> investigated, and herbarium records and Flora accounts examined, to determine whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> formerly <b>more</b> widespread and abundant in Britain. It appears that P. spicaturn has always been confined to East Sussex, but that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> widespread within this vice-county in the past.

5|$|Moorman {{suggests}} that Lucy may represent Wordsworth's romantic interest Mary Hutchinson, but wonders {{why she would}} be represented as one who died. It is possible that Wordsworth was thinking of Margaret Hutchinson, Mary's sister who had died.
