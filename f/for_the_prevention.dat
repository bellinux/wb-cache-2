5|$|During Sanger's 1916 {{speaking}} tour, she promoted {{birth control}} clinics {{based on the}} Dutch model she had observed during her 1914 trip to Europe. Although she inspired many local communities to create birth control leagues, no clinics were established. Sanger therefore resolved to create a birth control clinic in New York that would provide free contraceptive services to women. New York state law prohibited the distribution of contraceptives or even contraceptive information, but Sanger hoped to exploit {{a provision in the}} law which permitted doctors to prescribe contraceptives <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prevention</b> of disease. On October 16, 1916, she opened the Brownsville clinic in Brooklyn; it was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day.Engelman, p. 79–80. A few days after opening, an undercover policewoman purchased a cervical cap at the clinic, and Sanger was arrested. Refusing to walk, Sanger and a co-worker were dragged out of the clinic by police officers.Engelman, p. 83. The clinic was shut down, and it was not until 1923 that another birth control clinic was opened in the United States.|$|E
5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination. Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer. Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prevention</b> of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E
5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prevention</b> of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his idea {{about making a}} film on child sexual abuse. Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in Kids Can Say No! Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film about water safety, and said that he wanted to make Kids Can Say No! to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.|$|E
