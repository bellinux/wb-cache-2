25|$|As {{a result}} of the success of Don't Censor Me, Audio Adrenaline went on tour opening for DC Talk on the <b>Free</b> <b>at</b> <b>Last</b> Tour and Newsboys' Going Public Tour. However, on {{interviews}} the band expressed their interest to grow beyond the shadow of their musical counterparts.|$|E
25|$|The group's musical style evolved {{significantly}} {{throughout its}} career. Its first two releases, DC Talk and Nu Thang, {{were of the}} hip hop genre. DC Talk's third album, <b>Free</b> <b>at</b> <b>Last,</b> also mainly took influence from the hip hop style, although the group's music began taking on a rock sound. The trio's last two albums, Jesus Freak and Supernatural, were predominantly pop rock.|$|E
25|$|These events {{allowed the}} Chaldeans to once more attempt to assert themselves. While the Assyrian king was {{otherwise}} occupied defending his Iranian colonies from the Scythians and Cimmerians and driving the Egyptians from Canaan, Marduk-apla-iddina II (the Biblical Merodach-Baladan) of Bit-Yâkin, allied {{himself with the}} powerful Elamite kingdom and the native Babylonians, briefly seizing control of Babylon between 721 and 710 BC. With the Scythians and Cimmerians vanquished, the Medes and Persians pledging loyalty, and the Egyptians defeated and ejected from southern Canaan, Sargon II was <b>free</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> {{to deal with the}} Chaldeans, Babylonians and Elamites. He attacked and deposed Marduk-apla-iddina II in 710 BC, also defeating his Elamite allies in the process. After defeat by the Assyrians, Merodach-Baladan fled to his protectors in Elam.|$|E

60|$|But {{this is the}} idlest of dreams; for I did {{understand}} {{perfectly well}} {{at the time that}} the moment the breath left the body of the Magnificent Capataz, the Man of the People, <b>freed</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> from the toils of love and wealth, there was nothing more for me to do in Sulaco.|$|R

25|$|The murderer is {{revealed}} to be Lady Westholme who, previous to her marriage, had been incarcerated in the prison in which the victim was once a warden. It was to Lady Westholme, and not to Sarah, that Mrs. Boynton had addressed that peculiar threat; the temptation to acquire a new subject to torture had been too great for her to resist. Disguised as an Arab servant she had committed the murder and then relied upon the suggestibility of Miss Pierce to lay two pieces of misdirection that had concealed {{her role in the}} murder. Lady Westholme, eavesdropping in an adjoining room, overhears that her criminal history is about to be revealed to the world and commits suicide. The family, <b>free</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> take up happier lives: Sarah marries Raymond; Carol marries Jefferson; and Ginevra takes up a successful career as a stage actress – she also marries Dr. Gerard.|$|E
500|$|Waldron's 1969 album <b>Free</b> <b>at</b> <b>Last</b> was {{the first}} release on the ECM label. This {{recording}} {{was an example of}} Waldron playing, in his words, [...] "rhythmically instead of soloing on chord changes". Two years later, another Waldron recording session {{was the first}} for another label that became firmly established – Enja Records. In the early 1970s, he collaborated with the German avant-rock band Embryo on two albums, Steig Aus! and Rocksession. Waldron also wrote the score for the 1972 French film George Who? ...|$|E
500|$|In 1997, the Labour Party under Tony Blair won the election. Despite later calling Labour under Tony Blair [...] "the {{idea of a}} Conservative {{group who}} had taken over Labour" [...] and saying [...] " [...] {{set up a new}} {{political}} party, New Labour", Benn's political diaries <b>Free</b> <b>at</b> <b>Last</b> show that Benn was initially somewhat sympathetic to Blair, welcoming a change of government. Benn supported the introduction of the national minimum wage, and welcomed the progress towards peace and security in Northern Ireland (particularly under Mo Mowlam). He was supportive of the extra public money given to public services in the New Labour years but believed it to be under the guise of privatisation. Overall, his concluding judgement on New Labour is highly critical; he describes its evolution as a way of retaining office by abandoning socialism and distancing the party from the trade union movement, adopting a presidentialist style of politics, overriding the concept of the collective ministerial responsibility by reducing the power of the Cabinet, eliminated any effective influence from the annual conference of the Labour Party and [...] "hinged its foreign policy on support for one of the worst presidents in US history".|$|E

5000|$|In 1905 Thâalbi {{published}} L'esprit libéral du Coran ("the liberal {{spirit of}} the Quran") with César Benattar (who had been his defense lawyer) and el-Hadi Sebai. It was pro-French, in contrast with Sabil al-Rashid and his later writings. It claimed that through a literal, rational, scientific, liberal, and faithful interpretation of the Quran and hadiths the Muslim people will recover their past intellectual greatness, and with the civilizing influence of the French, the descendants of those that proclaimed {{the principles of the}} French Revolution, Muslims minds, <b>freed</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> of all superstitions and prejudices, will be able to one day contribute, in collaboration with their Protectors, to the global civilization.|$|R
5000|$|Historian Clarence B. Carson noted:At {{this moment}} in time {{from the early days}} of the New Deal, it is {{difficult}} to recapture, even in imagination, the heady enthusiasm among a goodly number of intellectuals for a government planned economy. So far as can now be told, they believed that a bright new day was dawning, that national planning would result in an organically integrated economy in which everyone would joyfully work for the common good, and that American society would be <b>freed</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> from those antagonisms arising, as General Hugh Johnson put it, from [...] "the murderous doctrine of savage and wolfish individualism, looking to dog-eat-dog and devil take the hindmost." ...|$|R
2500|$|DC Talk (stylized as dc Talk) is a Christian rap {{and rock}} trio. The group was formed at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1987 by Toby McKeehan, Michael Tait, and Kevin Max Smith. They {{released}} five major studio albums together: DC Talk (1989), Nu Thang (1990), <b>Free</b> <b>at</b> <b>Last</b> (1992), Jesus Freak (1995), and Supernatural (1998).

2500|$|In November 1992, {{the group}} {{released}} an album that would forever change {{the landscape of}} Christian music, <b>Free</b> <b>at</b> <b>Last,</b> which was certified as platinum by the RIAA in 1995. In 2001, CCM ranked [...] "Free at Last" [...] as the 9th best album in Christian music. The album included [...] "The Hardway"; a cover version of the Bill Withers song [...] "Lean on Me"; and a remake of [...] "Jesus Is Just Alright", originally recorded by the Art Reynolds Singers. It stayed at the No.1 spot on the Billboard CCM sales chart for 34 weeks. DC Talk {{became one of the}} first contemporary Christian groups to perform on late-night television when, on November 12, 1993, the band performed [...] "Jesus Is Still Alright" [...] on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. <b>Free</b> <b>at</b> <b>Last</b> also garnered the group's first Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album in 1994. The success of the album is attributed to the group moving away from a strictly rap sound to a blend of hip hop and pop. The album also prompted the filming of a documentary film with the same name.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2002, DC Talk {{recorded}} and released a single about the September 11, 2001 attacks titled [...] "Let's Roll". A 10th Anniversary Edition of <b>Free</b> <b>at</b> <b>Last,</b> which includes {{all of the}} songs from the original album (including interludes), a 2002 remake of [...] "The Hardway", {{as well as a}} commentary at the end was released.

[...] "While I bring but words to my love, they be the forerunner of deeds, I hope, that will give {{her back to me}} forever. I feared that you might destroy yourself, Tara of Helium, to escape the dishonor that O-Tar would do you, and so I came to give you new hope and to beg that you live for me through {{whatever}} may transpire, in the knowledge that there is yet a way and that if all goes well we shall be <b>freed</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> Look for me in the throne room of O-Tar the night that he would wed you. And now, how may we dispose of this fellow?" [...] He pointed to the dead eunuch upon the floor.|$|R
500|$|Jefferson's married {{daughter}} Martha Randolph informally {{freed the}} elderly Hemings by giving her [...] "her time." [...] As the historian Edmund S. Morgan has noted, [...] "Hemings herself was withheld from auction and <b>freed</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> by Jefferson's daughter, Martha Jefferson Randolph, who was, of course, her niece." [...] This informal freedom allowed Hemings {{to live in}} Virginia with her two youngest sons in nearby Charlottesville for the next nine years until her death. In the Albemarle County 1833 census, all three were recorded as free persons of color. Jefferson inherited {{a great amount of}} wealth at a young age, but was bankrupt by the time he died. His entire estate, including the people he enslaved, were sold to repay his debts. Hemings lived to see a grandchild born in a house that her sons owned.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Free</b> <b>at</b> <b>Last?</b> is {{an exhibit}} {{based on a}} {{collection}} of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania slavery manumissions discovered in 2007 by staff in the Allegheny County Recorder of Deeds Office that document the widespread existence of slavery in Western Pennsylvania up until the US Civil War period. [...] Staged at the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh, the exhibit focused on the original documentation coupled with interpretative panels and other artifacts {{to tell the story}} of African American slaves in Western Pennsylvania between 1792-1857. Shortly after the close of the exhibit in April 2009, the University Library System, University of Pittsburgh built a virtual exhibit with particular attention focused on the manumission documents.|$|E
2500|$|Toby formed DC Talk with Michael Tait in 1987, at Liberty University. He and Tait {{released}} Christian Rhymes to a Rhythm in 1988, {{while they}} recruited classmate, Kevin Max Smith. The three {{set out on}} tour after they released their first album in 1989, DC Talk. In 1990, they released their first gold album, Nu Thang. After the Nu Thang tour, they recorded their first platinum album, <b>Free</b> <b>at</b> <b>Last.</b> The <b>Free</b> <b>at</b> <b>Last</b> Tour was a success. They were invited to play on The Jay Leno Show and The Arsenio Hall Show, getting mainstream attention. They released their first single for their next album, which immediately became a hit single. The album, Jesus Freak, which they released in 1995, went multi-platinum {{and led to the}} extremely popular Jesus Freak World Tour. They eventually released the tour CD, Welcome to the Freakshow. In 1996, [...] "Between You and Me" [...] reached No. 29 on the Hot 100. The tour ended in success in time for Supernatural, which would be their last album. The album would sell platinum. They then went solo in 2001. The band has not toured together since 2001 (except for one show in Redmond, Washington, in 2005, and when TobyMac made surprise guest appearances at Winter Jam in 2010 in Nashville and in 2011 in Greensboro, North Carolina, and sang [...] "Jesus Freak" [...] with Michael Tait). However, DC Talk has recorded several songs together since their hiatus: [...] "Let's Roll" [...] in 2002 (a song about the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001), [...] "Atmosphere (Remix)" [...] on TobyMac's 2004 album Welcome to Diverse City, [...] "The Cross", a track on Kevin Max's 2007 album The Blood, and [...] "Love Feels Like", a track on TobyMac's 2015 album This Is Not a Test. The last album with the group was Solo.|$|E
2500|$|During the <b>Free</b> <b>at</b> <b>Last</b> tour, {{the band}} was {{followed}} around by camera crews to film a documentary. The documentary {{was going to be}} released as a theatrical film, , and was heavily promoted on Lightmusic TV, a Christian music video show. After months of teaser trailers, they abruptly stopped. A trailer included in the enhanced CD single of [...] "Jesus Freak" [...] advertised a September 17, 1995 theatrical release date for the film. It was never released to theaters, as it could not find a distributor. Eight years after the film was to be released theatrically, the movie was finally released on DVD in unfinished form. Some of the footage used for the movie was shown in the video for the song [...] "The Hardway". In 1994, they released one more Christmas single which was their remix version of the classic, [...] "We Three Kings" [...] which was on the album [...] "Joyful Christmas" [...] featuring many other Christian artists.|$|E
