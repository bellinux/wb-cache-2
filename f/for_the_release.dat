40|$|Abstract>> In this study, {{solutions}} for a liquid pool spreading model with continuous and instantaneous release are discussed {{based on the}} model used in the FERC's report. The effects of <b>the</b> <b>release</b> time on <b>the</b> liquid pool volume and radius are investigated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> continuous <b>release.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> continuous <b>release</b> with <b>the</b> frictional resistance force in the liquid pool spreading model, the vaporization time decreases as <b>the</b> <b>release</b> time increases. On <b>the</b> other hand, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> continuous <b>release</b> without <b>the</b> frictional resistance force in the liquid pool spreading model, the vaporization time increases as <b>the</b> <b>release</b> time increases. These phenomena are deeply related to the pool radius. In addition, {{the effects of the}} initial pool radius <b>for</b> <b>the</b> instantaneous <b>release</b> in <b>the</b> liquid pool spreading model are discussed. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> case with the frictional resistance force in the liquid pool spreading model, as reducing <b>release</b> time in <b>the</b> model with the frictional resistance force <b>for</b> <b>the</b> continuous <b>release,</b> <b>the</b> solution <b>for</b> a continuous release approaches to that for an instantaneous <b>release.</b> On <b>the</b> contrary to this, the pool volume and radius <b>for</b> <b>the</b> instantaneous <b>release</b> without <b>the</b> frictional resistance force are totally different from those <b>for</b> <b>the</b> continuous <b>release</b> without <b>the</b> frictional resistance force...|$|R
