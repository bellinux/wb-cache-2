5|$|The AW101's {{navigation}} system includes a <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> and inertial {{navigation system}}, VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR), {{instrument landing system}} (ILS), TACAN, and automatic direction finding. The Mk1 and Mk3 are equipped with a Doppler velocity system (DVS) which provides relative ground velocities; the DVS is also linked into the AFCS {{as part of the}} autostabilisation system. For safety, the aircraft is equipped with obstacle and terrain avoidance warning systems, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), and both voice and flight data recorders.|$|E
25|$|Locationless/Reverse caches {{are similar}} to a {{scavenger}} hunt. A description is given for something to find, such as a one-room schoolhouse, and the finder locates {{an example of this}} object. The finder records the location using their <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> and often takes a picture at the location showing the named object and his or her <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver.</b> Typically others are not allowed to log that same location as a find.|$|E
25|$|<b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> {{position}} is computed {{based on data}} received from the satellites. Errors depend on geometric dilution of precision and the sources listed in the table below.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} {{calculated by}} a <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> requires the current time, {{the position of}} the satellite and the measured delay of the received signal. The position accuracy is primarily dependent on the satellite position and signal delay.|$|E
25|$|A link from a <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> to the OPERA {{master clock}} was loose, which {{increased}} the delay through the fiber. The glitch's effect was {{to decrease the}} reported flight time of the neutrinos by 73ns, making them seem faster than light.|$|E
25|$|The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force {{ordered a}} utility {{variant of the}} UH-60L {{designated}} UH-60JA in 1995. The JGSDF began receiving the UH-60JA in 1997. It features improved avionics, including FLIR, Color weather radar, <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver,</b> a Night Vision Goggle compatible cockpit and wire cutter. The JGSDF plans to acquire 70.|$|E
25|$|SA {{errors are}} {{actually}} pseudorandom, {{generated by a}} cryptographic algorithm from a classified seed key available only to authorized users (the U.S. military, its allies {{and a few other}} users, mostly government) with a special military <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver.</b> Mere possession of the receiver is insufficient; it still needs the tightly controlled daily key.|$|E
25|$|Paperless geocaching means hunting a geocache {{without a}} {{physical}} printout of the cache description. Traditionally, {{this means that}} the seeker has an electronic means of viewing the cache information in the field, such as pre-downloading the information to a PDA or other electronic device. Various applications are able to directly upload and read GPX files without further conversion. Newer GPS devices released by Garmin, DeLorme and Magellan have the ability to read GPX files directly, thus eliminating the need for a PDA. Other methods include viewing real-time information on a portable computer with internet access or with a web-enabled smart phone. The latest advancement of this practice involves installing dedicated applications on a smart phone with a built-in <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver.</b> Seekers can search for and download caches in their immediate vicinity directly to the application and use the on-board <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> to find the cache.|$|E
25|$|DARPS, Differential, Absolute and Relative Positioning System. Commonly used on shuttle tankers while loading from a FPSO. Both {{will have}} a <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver.</b> As the errors are {{the same for the}} both of them, the signal {{does not need to be}} corrected. The {{position}} from the FPSO is transmitted to the shuttle tanker, so a range and bearing can be calculated and fed into the DP system.|$|E
25|$|Virtual caches are {{coordinates}} for a location, {{which has}} some other described object. Validation for finding a virtual cache generally requires one to email the cache hider with {{information such as}} a date or a name on a plaque, or to post a picture of oneself at the site with <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> in hand. New virtual caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak, but they remain supported by other sites.|$|E
25|$|When visible GPS {{satellites}} {{are close}} {{together in the}} sky (i.e., small angular separation), the DOP values are high; when far apart, the DOP values are low. Conceptually, satellites that are close together cannot provide {{as much information as}} satellites that are widely separated. Low DOP values represent a better GPS positional accuracy due to the wider angular separation between the satellites used to calculate <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> position. HDOP, VDOP, PDOP and TDOP are respectively Horizontal, Vertical, Position (3-D) and Time Dilution of Precision.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1990s and 2000s, SABCA {{performed}} {{a number of}} upgrades on the Belgian aircraft to the Alpha Jet 1B+ configuration; improvements made included {{the addition of a}} laser-gyro inertial navigation system, a <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver,</b> a HUD in the front cockpit and a HUD repeater in the rear, a video recorder and other more minor improvements. In 2000, the initial Alpha Jet 1B+ was re-delivered to the Belgian Air Force; the Alpha Jet fleet is reportedly expected to remain in Belgian service until at least 2018.|$|E
25|$|Some {{wireless}} carriers such as Nextel {{have decided}} GPS {{was the best}} way to provide the mandated location data for wireless Enhanced 9-1-1. Newer Nextel radios have embedded GPS receivers which are polled if 9-1-1 is dialed. The 9-1-1 center is provided with latitude and longitude from the radio's <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver.</b> In centers with computer assisted dispatch, the system may assign an address to the call based on these coordinates or may project an icon depicting the caller's location onto a map of the area.|$|E
25|$|The <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> can {{immediately}} {{apply the}} fast type of correction data, {{which includes the}} corrected satellite position and clock data, and determines its current location using normal GPS calculations. Once an approximate position fix is obtained the receiver begins to use the slow corrections to improve its accuracy. Among the slow correction data is the ionospheric delay. As the GPS signal travels from the satellite to the receiver, it passes through the ionosphere. The receiver calculates the location where the signal pierced the ionosphere and, if it has received an ionospheric delay value for that location, corrects for the error the ionosphere created.|$|E
25|$|Before it {{was turned}} off on May 2, 2000, typical SA errors were about 50m (164ft) {{horizontally}} and about 100m (328ft) vertically. Because SA affects every <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> in a given area almost equally, a fixed station with an accurately known position can measure the SA error values and transmit them to the local GPS receivers so they may correct their position fixes. This is called Differential GPS or DGPS. DGPS also corrects for several other important sources of GPS errors, particularly ionospheric delay, so {{it continues to be}} widely used even though SA has been turned off. The ineffectiveness of SA in the face of widely available DGPS was a common argument for turning off SA, and this was finally done by order of President Clinton in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Large private telelocation or AVL systems send {{data from}} GPS {{receivers}} in vehicles to a dispatch center over their private, user-owned radio backbone. These systems {{are used for}} businesses like parcel delivery and ambulances. Smaller systems which don't justify building a separate radio system use cellular or PCS data services to communicate location data from vehicles to their dispatching center. Location data is periodically polled from each vehicle in a fleet by a central controller or computer. In the simplest systems, data from the <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> is displayed on a map allowing humans to determine the location of each vehicle. More complex systems feed the data into a computer assisted dispatch system which automates the process. For example, the computer assisted dispatch system may check {{the location of a}} call for service and then pick a list of the four closest ambulances. This narrows the dispatcher's choice from the entire fleet to an easier choice of four vehicles.|$|E
500|$|As for guidance, {{the basic}} version {{combines}} {{data from a}} Global Positioning System (<b>GPS)</b> <b>receiver</b> and an inertial navigation system (INS) unit through Kalman filtering, achieving a [...] circular error probability (CEP). This [...] "decametric" [...] all-weather variant is complemented by a [...] "metric" [...] day/night fair weather version which adds infrared homing (IIR) guidance that matches the target area with a target model stored in its memory for a [...] CEP.|$|E
500|$|The B-1's main {{computer}} is the IBM AP-101, {{which is also}} used on the Space Shuttle orbiter and the B-52 bomber. [...] The {{computer is}} programmed with the JOVIAL programming language. [...] The Lancer's offensive avionics include the Westinghouse (now Northrop Grumman) AN/APQ-164 forward-looking offensive passive electronically scanned array radar set with electronic beam steering (and a fixed antenna pointed downward for reduced radar observability), synthetic aperture radar, ground moving target indication (GMTI), and terrain-following radar modes, Doppler navigation, radar altimeter, and an inertial navigation suite. The B-1B Block D upgrade added a Global Positioning System (<b>GPS)</b> <b>receiver</b> beginning in 1995.|$|E
500|$|Radar systems {{measure the}} {{distance}} to a target {{by the time it}} takes a radio-wave pulse to return to the radar antenna after being reflected by the target: {{the distance to}} the target is half the round-trip transit time multiplied by the speed of light. A Global Positioning System (<b>GPS)</b> <b>receiver</b> measures its distance to GPS satellites based on how long it takes for a radio signal to arrive from each satellite, and from these distances calculates the receiver's position. Because light travels about [...] (...) in one second, these measurements of small fractions of a second must be very precise. The Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment, radar astronomy and the Deep Space Network determine distances to the Moon, planets and spacecraft, respectively, by measuring round-trip transit times.|$|E

Because of the uplift at South Sister, USGS planned to increase monitoring of the Three Sisters and their vicinity by installing a global positioning system (<b>GPS)</b> <b>receiver,</b> sampling airborne and ground-based gases, and adding seismometers. USGS completed campaign GPS surveys at South Sister in 2001, in addition to annual InSAR radar observations from 1992 to 2001, and they followed up with campaign GPS and tilt-leveling surveys in August 2004. As of 2009, semi-permanent GPS networks have been deployed every year at the Three Sisters complex, continually showing that inflation persists at South Sister.|$|E
2500|$|The Exif format has {{standard}} tags for location information. [...] many {{cameras and}} mobile phones have a built-in <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> that stores the location {{information in the}} Exif header when a picture is taken. Some other cameras have a separate <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> that fits into the flash connector or hot shoe. Recorded GPS data can also be added to any digital photograph on a computer, either by correlating the time stamps of the photographs with a GPS record from a hand-held <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> or manually by using a map or mapping software. The process of adding geographic information to a photograph is known as geotagging. Photo-sharing communities like Panoramio, locr or Flickr equally allow their users to upload geocoded pictures or to add geolocation information online.|$|E
2500|$|RLS uses two TADIRCM sensors, an INU, and {{a smaller}} field-of-view single-color (FLIR) camera on each tower. [...] The INU, which {{contains}} a <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver,</b> allows the electro-optical sensors to align to the azimuth and elevation of any detected threat signature.|$|E
2500|$|Geocaching [...] is {{an outdoor}} {{recreational}} activity, {{in which participants}} use a Global Positioning System (<b>GPS)</b> <b>receiver</b> or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers, called [...] "geocaches" [...] or [...] "caches", at specific locations marked by coordinates all over the world.|$|E
2500|$|... the Pebble {{app store}} had over 1,000 applications. These include {{notifications}} for emails, calls, text messages and social media activity; stock prices; activity tracking (movement, sleep, estimates of calories burned); remote controls for smartphones, cameras and home appliances; turn-by-turn directions (using the <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> in a smartphone or tablet); display of RSS or JSON feeds; {{and hundreds of}} custom watch faces.|$|E
2500|$|Some mobile {{transmitter}} hunters use equipment based on exploiting {{the principle of}} Doppler shift. [...] At least four antennas are mounted in a precise geometric pattern, often {{on the roof of}} a vehicle. [...] Specialty electronics computes the amount of Doppler shift present in the received signals and determines a probable direction from which the signal originates. [...] The direction is commonly displayed using LEDs oriented in a circle or a straight line. [...] Advanced units can use a compass or <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> to compute a direction relative to the instant motion of the vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{potential}} for both natural and man-made noise, numerous techniques continue to be developed {{to deal with the}} interference. The first is to not rely on GPS as a sole source. According to John Ruley, [...] "IFR pilots should have a fallback plan in case of a GPS malfunction". Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is a feature included in some receivers, designed to provide a warning to the user if jamming or another problem is detected. The U.S. military has also deployed since 2004 their Selective Availability / Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) in the Defense Advanced <b>GPS</b> <b>Receiver</b> (DAGR). In demonstration videos the DAGR was shown to detect jamming and maintain its lock on the encrypted GPS signals during interference which caused civilian receivers to lose lock.|$|E
2500|$|USA - Unconventional Stellar Aspect (1990-22/NRL) - Sponsored by Naval Research Lab, Space Science Division, the USA {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} observe bright x-ray sources, mostly binary star systems, including a black hole, a neutron star, or a white dwarf, orbiting with a more typical star. In neutron stars, gravity has compressed matter down to densities larger than {{those found in the}} nucleus of an atom. In all of these types of binary systems, extraordinarily strong, relativistic gravitational forces and enormous magnetic fields act in concert to produce dramatic phenomena not observable from Earth-based laboratories. [...] In addition to providing valuable new information for astrophysicists and particle physicists, USA has been designed to make significant contributions to applied science, environmental science, and engineering research. It will use x-ray sources to test new approaches to satellite navigation and to conduct the first tomographic survey of Earth's atmosphere. It will also test new concepts for making spacecraft computers more reliable, an approach called fault-tolerant computing. [...] Finally, a unique feature of USA is that photon events are time tagged by reference to an onboard <b>GPS</b> <b>receiver</b> allowing precise absolute time and location determination. [...] USA operated from May 1, 1999, through November 16, 2000.|$|E
