Hydrothermal scheduling is performed {{in order to}} find the optimum allocation of hydro energy so that the annual operating cost of a mixed hydro-thermal system is minimized. In the present work the hydrothermal scheduling problem is decomposed into three subproblems: maintenance of thermal units, dispatch of thermal units, and dispatch of <b>hydro</b> <b>units.</b> The algorithm takes into consideration the stochastic nature of the water inflows to the reservoir and the forced outage rates of the thermal units. Maintenance scheduling is performed based on the levelized risk criterion, dispatch of the thermal units is determined based on probabilistic techniques, while the dispatch of the <b>hydro</b> <b>units</b> is formulated as a constrained optimization problem.

5000|$|<b>Hydro</b> <b>units,</b> that {{generate}} energy by harvesting water potential energy, are often organized into systems of connected reservoirs called hydro valleys. Because water released by an upstream reservoir reaches the downstream one (after some time), and therefore becomes available to generate energy there, {{decisions on the}} optimal production must be taken for all units simultaneously, which makes the problem rather hard even if no (or little) thermal production is involved, even more so if the complete electrical system is considered. Furthermore, <b>hydro</b> <b>units</b> often include pumped-storage units, where energy can be spent to pump water back uphill; {{this is the only}} current technology capable of storing enough (potential) energy to be significant at the typical level of the UC problem. <b>Hydro</b> <b>units</b> are as well subject to complex technical constraints. Furthermore, the amount of energy generated by turbining some amount of water is not constant, but it depends on the water head which in turn depends on the previous decisions; the relationship is nonlinear and nonconvex, making the problem particularly difficult to solve.|$|R

A stochastic mixed integer linear model is used, which maximizes the joint profit of wind and hydro units, where conditional value at risk (CVaR) is used for model risk.

40|$|<b>Hydro</b> <b>unit</b> {{commitment}} {{is the problem}} of maximizing water use efficiency while minimizing start-up costs in the daily operation of multiple hydro plants, subject to constraints on short-term reservoir operation, and long-term goals. A low-rank rounding heuristic is presented for the semidefinite relaxation of the mixed-integer quadratic-constrained formulation of this problem. In addition to limits on reservoir and generator operation, transmission constraints are represented by an approximate AC power flow model. In our proposed method, the mathematical program is equivalently formulated as a QCQP problem solved by convex relaxation based on semidefinite programming, followed by a MILP solution of undefined unit commitment schedules. Finally, a rank reduction procedure is applied.

40|$|The {{constant}} current controllers at high voltage direct current (HVDC) rectifier stations {{and the outer}} loops which set the reference to the current controller have potential to introduce negative damping on the nearby generating units. It is therefore vital to investigate the torsional interaction behavior between turbine-generator (TG) units and the HVDC systems over a frequency range of interest. In this paper, subsynchronous torsional interaction (SSTI) phenomenon for hydroelectric TG units with small generator-to-turbine inertia (GTI) ratios interconnected to an HVDC system has been investigated. The sensitivity of different system parameters, such as generating capacity and loading, DC power flow, AC network strength and current controller gains, towards electrical damping contribution is also examined. <b>Hydro</b> <b>units</b> with different shaft systems are examined for SSTI proneness by conducting perturbation analysis.
