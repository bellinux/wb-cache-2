5|$|In 1913, {{at the age}} of five, Fingleton's {{father was}} elected into state {{parliament}} {{as a representative of the}} centre left, labour-union oriented Australian Labor Party, and the family moved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> house. It was here that Fingleton learned to play street cricket. Fingleton was educated at the Roman Catholic St Francis's School, in the inner city suburb of Paddington before moving to Waverley College. There he began a lifelong association with prose.|$|E

5|$|After {{landfall}} {{the storm}} rapidly weakened, and about eight hours after moving ashore, Ernesto deteriorated to tropical depression status. Interacting with a pre-existing frontal zone that extended eastward through Virginia, Ernesto quickly lost its tropical characteristics, and late on September 1 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. It re-intensified to a gale over the Mid-Atlantic states, only to weaken to an extratropical depression near Pennsylvania. With a large {{high pressure area}} to its east, the remnants turned to the north-northwest, reaching southern Ontario on September 3. After turning northeastward, the extratropical remnants of Ernesto were absorbed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> storm over Quebec on September 4.|$|E
5|$|Considering the {{response}} to be unsatisfactory, de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country. He wanted to give France, {{in the event of}} an East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> NATO–Warsaw Pact war. In February 1959, France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command, and later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil. This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control of the air force bases that it had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967.|$|E
5|$|Designed as the {{commercial}} heart of San Marco, the square had declined seriously by the 1970s, with many businesses closing. The original, compass-themed fountain was demolished. In the 1990s the City of Jacksonville undertook a major renovation and streetscaping project, which included restoring the fountain with three lion statues {{inspired by the}} Piazza San Marco. Since then, the square has become a popular commercial destination with many shops, restaurants and bars. In 2013 the square underwent another renovation project that rerouted the streets and expanded the small park in the center, named Balis Park, <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> pedestrian green space.|$|E

5|$|Following Toronto's first-round exit, McGrady {{became a}} free agent, signing a six-year, $67.5 million {{contract}} with the Orlando Magic. He elected to join the Magic {{in part because he}} disliked his secondary role playing behind Vince Carter, in part so that he could return home to Florida, and in part to play with their other newly acquired free agent, Grant Hill. Hill would go on to play in only 47 games total throughout his tenure with the team, forcing McGrady <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> leadership and scoring role than anticipated.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{left his}} {{headquarters}} at Keynsham Abbey and moved towards Bath, which {{had also been}} occupied by royalist troops, making entry into the city impossible. Monmouth camped in Philips Norton (now Norton St Philip), where his forces were attacked on 27 June by the leading elements of Feversham's forces, which had now combined <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> force, but were still awaiting their artillery. The Duke of Grafton led some cavalry, dragoons, and 500 musketeers into the village, where they were surrounded by the rebels and had to hack through hedges to escape. They were rescued by Churchill and withdrew with approximately twenty casualties on each side; however, each side believed that the other had taken greater losses.|$|E
5|$|Subtropical Storm Nicole was {{the first}} {{subtropical}} storm to receive a name using the standard hurricane name list that did not become a tropical cyclone. The fourteenth tropical or subtropical storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Nicole developed on October 10 near Bermuda from the interaction of an upper level trough and a cold front. The storm turned to the northeast, and after attempting to transition into a tropical cyclone, it dissipated as it was absorbed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> extratropical storm.|$|E

5|$|The arms contain tension sensors so the octopus {{knows whether}} its arms are {{stretched}} out, {{but this is}} not sufficient for the brain to determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a mental image of the overall shape of the object it is handling. It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor proprioceptive sense, and it only knows what exact motions were made by observing the arms visually.|$|E
5|$|With the {{prospect}} of no operational aircraft being available to fulfill the RAF's strike role, BAC decided to revamp the AFVG design, eliminating the carrier capabilities that were no longer necessary, <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger,</b> more strike-oriented variable geometry aircraft. Holding contracts were issued to BAC to support the project, which had been re-designated as the United Kingdom Variable Geometry (UKVG) aircraft. In November 1967, BAC issued a brochure on the UKVG proposal; various proposals would be issued to cover {{the use of multiple}} different engines. The quick production of a demonstrator aircraft, powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce/MAN Turbo RB153 turbofan engines, was also mooted.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1890s {{the station}} {{entrance}} had been incorporated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> building. In 1922, a new entrance and canopy {{was designed for}} the Bridge Street entrance by Charles Holden and, in 1924, he designed a plainly rendered replacement elevation for the eastern entrance on to the Embankment. These were {{the first of many}} projects by the architect for the London Electric Railway (the main forerunner of London Transport and Transport for London). The station platforms were also refurbished with new wall tiling in the green, blue, black and white tiling scheme used later by Holden on many stations of the period and still visible at neighbouring St James's Park station. In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} Pokémon {{are capable of}} {{evolving}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> and more powerful creature. The change is accompanied by stat changes, generally a modest increase, and access to {{a wider variety of}} attacks. There are multiple ways to trigger an evolution including reaching a particular level, using a special stone, or learning a specific attack. For example, at level 16 Bulbasaur is capable of evolving into Ivysaur. Most notably, the Normal-type Eevee is capable of evolving into eight different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Vaporeon (Water), Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). In Generation VI, a new mechanic called Mega Evolution—as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called Primal Reversion—was introduced into the game. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion last only for the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon reverting to its normal form at the end. Forty-eight Pokémon are capable of undergoing Mega Evolution or Primal Reversion as of the release of Sun and Moon. In contrast, some species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown, and Lycanroc undergo form changes that may provide stat buffs or changes and type alterations but are not considered new species.|$|E
5|$|Monica E. Geller is {{a fictional}} character, {{one of the}} six main {{characters}} who appeared in the American sitcom Friends. Created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and portrayed by actress Courteney Cox, Monica appears in each of the show's 236 episodes, from its premiere on September 24, 1994 to its finale on May 6, 2004. A chef known for her cleanliness, competitiveness and obsessive-compulsive nature, Monica is the younger sister of Ross and best friend of Rachel, the latter of whom she invites to live with her after Rachel forsakes her own wedding. The two characters spend several years living together as roommates until Monica begins a romantic relationship with long-time neighbor and friend Chandler, whom she marries. Unable to conceive children on their own, the couple eventually adopts twins and moves out of their apartment <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> house in the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The company {{introduced}} its first broiled chicken sandwich, the BK Broiler, in 1990. The sandwich included a dill-ranch mayonnaise and was {{served on a}}n oat-bran roll. In 1998, BK reformulated the BK Broiler <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger,</b> more male-oriented sandwich: a larger chicken patty with mayonnaise served on a Whopper bun. In 2002, BK changed {{the name of the}} sandwich to Chicken Whopper and added a smaller Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich. The company replaced the Chicken Whopper line with another broiled sandwich line in 2003, the BK Baguette line. The chicken sandwich, served on a fresh cooked baguette roll, and came in several varieties, all of which were topped with a series of ingredients that were low in fat. They were sold in the United States at one time, but are now sold only in the European market. The failed Baguette line was replaced in North America with the current grilled chicken iteration, the TenderGrill sandwich.|$|E

5|$|The {{manager and}} {{investigator}} summoned Collins {{for an interview}} and questioned her. Collins asked {{for the presence of}} a union representative several times but was refused by the manager each time. Upon questioning, Collins explained that she had put four pieces of chicken (which cost $1 total) <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> box (one which could hold $2.98 of chicken) because the store had run out of the four-piece sized boxes. To check Collins's story, the investigator left to ask the coworker who had reported her. The coworker confirmed that the store had run out of $1 size boxes and admitted she did not know how much chicken Collins had placed in the larger box. The investigator returned to the interview, apologized to Collins, and prepared to let her go.|$|E
5|$|The temple is a {{powerful}} symbol of Cambodia, and {{is a source of}} great national pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with France, the United States and its neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat {{has been a part of}} Cambodian national flags since the introduction of the first version circa 1863. From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride sui generis but had been inscribed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937. Angkor Wat's aesthetics were also on display in the plaster cast museum of Louis Delaporte called musée Indo-chinois which existed in the Parisian Trocadero Palace from c.1880 to the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|There have {{previously}} been attempts at pre-season friendlies between the reigning league and cup champions. For instance, the 2002 pre-season match between Rosenborg and Viking was played between the reigning league and cup champions, {{although it had}} no official status. Superfinalen was the first attempt to make an official tournament. Such a super cup is common between the domestic league and cup winners in many European countries, such as the English Charity Shield. Superfinalen also introduced philanthropy into such a match: the game was to be baked <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> television event which would include concerts and entertainment {{in an attempt to}} generate revenue for charity. The matchday profits from the inaugural season were, along with the television fundraising, given to UNICEF, who used the revenue to fund part of a school project in Africa, which had been fronted by Ole Gunnar Solskjær.|$|E
