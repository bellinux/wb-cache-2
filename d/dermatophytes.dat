25|$|The cuticle is {{the first}} region of the hair that is {{attacked}} in an A. fulvescens infection. This attack resembles that of true <b>dermatophytes</b> in that some lateral hyphae give rise to fronded mycelium. However, some hyphae also give rise to appressoria, or flattened hyphal pressing organs, which are characteristic of non-keratinophilic fungi. <b>Dermatophytes</b> digest the hair cuticle rapidly, unlike A.fulvescens, which breaks the cuticle down so slowly that the scales are still visible for weeks after the hair has been infected.|$|E
25|$|Nails can dry out, {{just like}} skin. They can also peel, break, and be infected. Toe infections, for instance, {{can be caused}} or {{exacerbated}} by dirty socks, specific types of aggressive exercise (long-distance running), tight footwear, and walking unprotected in an unclean environment. Common organisms causing nail infections include yeasts and molds (particularly <b>dermatophytes).</b>|$|E
25|$|Keratinophilic fungal {{species that}} {{fall under the}} genus Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, or Microsporum, are {{pathogenic}} to humans and other animals, and {{are referred to as}} <b>dermatophytes</b> {{on the basis of their}} ability to cause dermatophytosis in these hosts. However, infections in these hosts caused by soil-derived keratinophilic saprotrophs like A.fulvescens are very seldom and only a few cases have been documented in the literature. The first documented case of A.fulvescens causing tinea corporis was in 1970 when the fungus was repeatedly isolated from a 4 x 5cm red patch on the inner right thigh of a 21-year-old white male. This case showcases the clinical importance of non-dermatophyte keratinophilic fungi such as A.fulvescens as a result of the ability to cause dermatophytosis in the form of tinea corporis in humans. While visually, the case of tinea corporis was indistinguishable from those caused by true <b>dermatophytes,</b> the infection did not respond well to typical treatment. This observation is crucial for correct diagnosis and treatment of the skin lesion and highlights the necessity of awareness for atypical opportunistic human pathogenic fungi.|$|E

25|$|The cortex is the third, {{and last}} {{region of the}} hair to be {{attacked}} by A.fulvescens. Appressoria penetrate through to the cortex to produce cells of various sizes, giving the cortex a swollen morphology. This swollen mass of cells can proliferate in all directions to {{give rise to a}} large mass of mycelium that protrudes backwards out of the hair. <b>Dermatophytes</b> are seen to behave in a similar manner, however, instead of a bulging mass, the mycelium grows in a more organized fashion, as a single collapsed column.|$|E
2500|$|Growth of the {{cortical}} mycelium {{can be at}} any {{angle to}} the hair in an attack from A.fulvescens, while true <b>dermatophytes</b> have the characteristic of growing along the hair in parallel. A.fulvescens can attack at any point along the hair and often causes a marked swelling upon entry sites. The mycelium penetrates the hair by exerting a high amount {{of pressure on the}} hair cells and is always closely pressed to the cavity walls. A.fulvescens cannot digest keratin from a distance, as seen in <b>dermatophytes,</b> but rather seems to require direct contact with the keratin-rich substrate. The digestion of keratin by A.fulvescens happens in two stages, the first of which involves the denaturation of keratin. The second stage involves the actual digestion of keratin by A.fulvescens, which then grows into the remaining space. [...] An infected hair is completely replaced by the mycelium of A.fulvescens within 6–8 weeks.|$|E

40|$|Spectrum of <b>dermatophyte</b> {{infections in}} Botswana Background: <b>Dermatophyte</b> infections {{are a common}} cause of {{superficial}} fungal infection in different geographical locations of the world.

Aim: To find out the causative <b>dermatophyte</b> species responsible for the various clinical types of <b>dermatophyte</b> infection. Results: Trichophyton violaceum {{was found to be}} the predominant species, being the causative organism responsible for all the clinical types. Conclusion: T. violaceum was found to be the most common species responsible for most of the clinical forms of dermatophytosis (96; 80 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tinea pedis and tinea manuum in {{children}} are more common than previously recognized. Clinical presentations of <b>dermatophyte</b> infections may vary {{in children}} and {{may be difficult to}} diagnose. OBJECTIVE: To show the necessity of potassium hydroxide preparations and/or fungal cultures in assessing suspicious cases of cellulitis in children who may have <b>dermatophyte</b> infections. PATIENTS: We describe 4 children with inflammatory tinea pedis or tinea manuum who were initially misdiagnosed as having bacterial cellulitis. INTERVENTION: A potassium hydroxide examination was performed on 3 patients. Fungal cultures were performed on 2 patients. RESULTS: Inflammatory/bullous <b>dermatophyte</b> infections were detected by potassium hydroxide examination in all 4 patients and all 4 children successfully responded to topical antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate that inflammatory tinnea pedis/manuum can masquerade as cellulitis in children.
