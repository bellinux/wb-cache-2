30|$|Finally, one {{important}} clarification: 2010 CFPS {{did not ask}} about the <b>education</b> <b>level</b> of the first spouse; thus, no information was gathered about the <b>education</b> <b>level</b> of a female spouse who had not completed an individual questionnaire nor about the <b>education</b> <b>level</b> of those already divorced or widowed. In the panel survey in 2012, CFPS supplemented this question, allowing us to draw the missing values from the new responses.

According to a representative of Standard Chartered, which invested US$75 million in Saudi Binladin Group, Saudi Arabia is going to spend over US$400 billion (SR1.5 trillion) on infrastructure {{over the next few}} years. According to reports by Citi Investment Research & Analysis, $220 billion worth of development, accounting for 36% of all construction spending in the MENA region, will be directly or indirectly beneficial to Jeddah Tower. Jeddah Tower and City themselves are intended to set an example of green development, using modern technology and having a low carbon footprint relative to the number of people they will support. However, there is also an increasing problem of poor <b>education</b> <b>levels</b> in Arab countries {{due to a lack of}} spending in research and education, which it is argued should be invested in rather than building skyscrapers, and that the tower is nothing more than a symbol of hubris. It has even been likened to the Tower of Babel.|$|E

The {{relationships}} between the educational level and job satisfaction were tested with hypotheses; H 0 : There isn't a relationship between <b>education</b> <b>level</b> and job satisfaction. H 1 : There is a relationship between <b>education</b> <b>level</b> and job satisfaction. To measure job satisfaction, a questionnaire comprising a slightly modified form of a popular job satisfaction questionnaire was used. The study was conducted on a total of 600 workers, working in 30 four and five stars hotels. All of the questionnaires were picked up because the questionnaires were administered individually by the students of tourism department. 69 percent of the responses were taken from graduated and vocational school students of higher education, 31 percent from primary and secondary schools. Consequently, a positive relationship was found between job satisfaction and <b>education</b> <b>level.</b> The results suggest that managers should find new methods to increase <b>education</b> <b>level</b> of their staff and develop work context parallel to <b>education</b> <b>level...</b>|$|R

30|$|Three broad {{approaches}} {{have been used}} in the literature to measure the incidence of under-/over-education. One approach, which is typically based on survey data, uses the workers’ self assessment about the minimum <b>education</b> <b>level</b> needed for the job they perform or their understanding of the average <b>education</b> <b>level</b> for a particular job and whether they possess that or not (e.g., see Sicherman [1991]; Dolton and Vignoles [2000]). A second approach, developed by Verdugo and Verdugo ([1989]), uses the mean <b>education</b> <b>level</b> required across a range of occupations. Under this approach an individual is considered over- or under-educated if his <b>education</b> <b>level</b> is, respectively, one standard deviation above or below the mean <b>education</b> <b>level</b> required for that particular job. A third way to analyse the level of over-/under-education is the “objective” measure based on methods used by different countries/labour organizations to assess the average required education for a particular job (e.g., Rumberger [1987] and Green et al.|$|R

(2004) mentions that most of the workers do not know about their rights, such as matters about wages and supposed working conditions, thus they have no skill set to fight for their labour rights through collective bargain (such as strike or work to rule).

Portuguese economic growth in the period 1960–1973 created an opportunity for real integration with the developed economies of Western Europe.
