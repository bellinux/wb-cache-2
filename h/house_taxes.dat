60|$|After the church, the school, and the newspaper, {{the most}} {{important}} civilising institution is the market. Sá Leone is favourably situated for collecting the interior trade, and yet seven-tenths of the revenue is derived from articles passing through the Loko and Rokel rivers; the rest is levied from wines, spirits, and tobacco, and {{in the form of}} preposterous harbour-dues. The export duties are light, but the exports do not seem to have increased as rapidly as they should have done during the last twenty years; this, too, despite missions into the interior and the hospitable reception of native chiefs and their messengers. There are no assessed or <b>house</b> <b>taxes.</b> The revenue and expenditure of the past five years have averaged, respectively, 63,869l. and 59,283l., leaving a surplus of 4,586l., which might profitably be expended upon roads. But the liabilities of the colony early in 1881 still amounted to 50,637l., being the balance of a debt resulting principally from the harbour-works.|$|E
40|$|Owner-occupied housing {{benefits}} from several forms of tax preference in the United States. The non-taxation of implicit rental value, deductibility of mortgage interest and property taxes, and capital gains preferences are all specific forms of <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> preferences. The {{purpose of this}} dissertation is threefold: (1) to investigate the relationship theoretically as well as empirically between homeowner tax preferences, in particular, nominal mortgage interest and property <b>tax</b> deductions, and <b>housing</b> demand, (2) to examine empirically the vertical equity consequence of removing <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> deductions, (3) to develop an interval estimate {{of the change in}} Suits Indices between the current federal income tax and an alternative income <b>tax</b> that excludes <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> deductions to test the significance of the estimated vertical equity effect of eliminating <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> deductions. ^ In this dissertation, I develop a theoretical model for housing demand to analyze the impact of <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> deductions on the demand for housing. A comparative static result is derived and it indicates that the <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> deductions have an ambiguous effect on housing demand. A deterministic simulation of the effect of <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> deductions on <b>housing</b> demand is performed using time series data for the period 1974 - 1993. Simulation results reveal that <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> deductions have positive influences on housing demand. ^ I also simulate the effect of <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> deductions on net per capita single family housing expenditure utilizing a linear expenditure system for housing demand. Simulation results reveal a direct relationship between <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> deductions and <b>housing</b> demand. ^ I am able to assess both the non-revenue and revenue neutral vertical equity effects of removing <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> deductions. Results in both cases show that eliminating <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> deductions increases the vertical equity of the tax system. ^ I then test the significance of the estimated vertical equity effect using both the bootstrap-t and percentile methods. The results reveal that the estimated vertical equity effect is statistically significant. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing on urban form in an economy in which high- and low-income households choose between city and suburban communities. Because <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> policies differentially affect the relative after-tax price of housing for high- and low-income households, and because the extent of capitalization of <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> policies can differ across city and suburban communities, our analysis finds that <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> policies can affect not only the density of the metropolitan area but also can influence where rich and poor households choose to live. We also show that the impacts of <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> policies differ depending on whether land use constraints such as suburban large lot zoning exist. If there are no land use constraints present, increasing a subsidy to home ownership that is positively correlated with the income of the owner tends to lead to the decentralization of both rich and poor, although there are conditions under which the ric [...] ...|$|R

Simulation results imply that the choice of <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> tools depends {{on the kind of}} shock that housing market faces. In the situation where the housing price volatility is caused by the population growth shock, the flow tax can reduce the volatility of housing price while the stock tax makes no difference to it. If the shock is resulting from the interest rate, the policy maker should not impose any kind of the <b>housing</b> <b>taxes.</b> Furthermore, the effect of one kind of the <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> can be strengthened by that of the other type of <b>housing</b> <b>tax...</b>|$|R

40|$|Condominium {{conversions}} {{became a}} major factor in housing markets durig the 1970 s. The analysis presented in this paper suggests that rental housing investors are in high marginal tax brackets and use rental <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> losses to shelter other income. These characteristics imply that rental <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> benefits are an important determinant of rental <b>housing</b> investment. The <b>Tax</b> Reform Act of 1969 and 1976 reduced rental <b>housing</b> <b>tax</b> benefits and may have provided an important stimulus for the condominium conversions of the 1970 s. Tax and survey data confirm the predicted characteristics of rental-housing investors. Estimates of rental flows in Chicago from 1962 to 1977 indicate that the Tax Reform Act of 1969 and 1976 were possible causes of condominium conversions during the 1970 s.
