A four-box energy diagram, {{in which the}} mean and <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> are defined by the thickness-weighted mean velocity and the deviation from it, respectively, shows that the layer-thickness form drag reduces the mean <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> and endows the eddy field with an energy cascade. The energy equations are derived using an identity (called the "pile-up rule'') between cumulative sums of the Eulerian mean quantity and the thickness-weighted mean quantity in each vertical column.

With the pile-up rule, the total <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> based on the Eulerian mean can be rewritten in a thickness-weighted form. The four-box energy diagram in the present study should be consistent with energy diagrams of layer models, the temporal-residual-mean theory, and Iwasaki's atmospheric theory.

This paper examines how the <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> in midlatitude baroclinic zones responds to changes in radiative forcing in simulations with an idealized moist general circulation model.

For this particular purpose, observations obtained from near-surface drifters have been used: they represent a very useful data set to analyse the eddy field because of their ability to catch a large number of scales of motion while providing a quasi-synoptic coverage of the investigated area.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the EGITTO/EGYPT program, the spatial structure and the temporal variability of the surface circulation in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean Sea was studied by means of satellite-tracked drifters. A total of 97 drifters drogued to 15 -m nominal depth were released between September 2005 and March 2007, either regularly along ship-of-opportunity routes (Sicily Channel) or within specific structures during dedicated campaigns (Levantine sub-basin). After editing and low-pass filtering, the drifter trajectories were used to estimate pseudo-Eulerian statistics: mean current, variance ellipses, mean and <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies.</b> A statistical analysis was also performed dividing the dataset in two extended seasons (winter and summer). This study completes previous ones in the Sicily Channel and in the Ionian. Several veins are evidenced, together with a seasonal variability inducing a reversal of the circulation {{in the southern part of}} the Ionian. However, in this latter area, data are too scarce and the dynamics too complex to achieve a circulation pattern yet. Eastward, the general circulation is described as a counterclockwise flow along the Libyo-Egyptian and Middle East slopes. Part of this flow is deflected toward the open sea by the anticyclones generated alongslope by the Libyo-Egyptian current (Libyan and Egyptian eddies), by the wind (Ierapetra) or by the topography (over the Eratosthenes Seamount and off Latakia). The entrainment of this flow around successive eddies (paddle-wheels effect) results in an open sea eastward transport of Atlantic water. When the Libyan eddies (anticyclonic) are close to the slope, the westward current is stronger than the mean eastward current and the circulation is temporally and locally reversed. The strong variability induced by the eddies and the meteorological conditions hinder evenly covering all the study area.

The drifters had large drogues centered at 15 m, and the resulting drifter trajectory data set has been analyzed in terms of its Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics. The CTZ drifter results show that the California Current can be characterized in summer and fall as a meandering coherent jet which on average flows southward to at least 30 ºN, {{the southern end of the}} study domain. From 39 ºN south to about 33 ºN, the typical core velocities are of O(300 km) and the current meanders have alongshore wavelengths of O(100 – 200 km) and onshore-offshore amplitude of O(100 – 200 km). The lateral movement of this jet leads to large <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> and large <b>eddy</b> diffusivities, especially north of 36 ºN. The initial onshore-offshore component of diffusivity is always greater than the alongshore component in the study domain, but at the southern end, the eddy diffusivity is more isotropic, with scalar single particle diffusivity (Kxx + Kyy) of O(8 x 107 cm 2 s- 1). The eddy diffusivity increases with increasing eddy energy. Finally, a simple volume budget for the 1988 filament observed near 37 ºN off Point Arena suggests that subduction can occur in a filament at an average rate of O(10 m d- 1) some 200 km offshore, thus allowing the cold water initially in the filament core to sink below the warmer ambient water by the time the surface velocity core has turned back onshore.

The multiyear altimetry data reveal that the eastward-flowing STCC is a highly variable zonal current, whose area-averaged <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> level (338 cm 2 s 22) reaches half the <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> level of the Kuroshio Extension. The <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> of the STCC has a well-defined annual cycle with a maximum in April/May and a minimum in December/January.

No such distinct annual cycle of the <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> is found in any other zonal current of the North Pacific Ocean. Using a 2 -layer reduced-gravity model representing the vertically sheared STCC–North Equatorial Current (NEC) system, it is shown that the seasonal modulation of the STCC’s eddy field is a manifestation in the intensity of baroclinic instability. In spring the STCC–NEC system has a large vertical velocity shear and a weak vertical stratification, subjecting it to strong baroclinic instability. In fall, reduction in the vertical velocity shear between the STCC and its underlying NEC, and intensification of the upper-layer stratification weakens the baroclinic instability. In comparison with the STCC of 198 – 258 N, the altimetry data reveal that the westward-flowing NEC existing between 108 and 158 N has a relatively low <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> level, despite being a stronger vertically sheared zonal current than the STCC. That the NEC is less eddy energetic is shown to be due to both its presence in a low-latitude band and its unidirectional flow.

Inshore of its velocity core are found waters of predominantly Arabian Sea, Red Sea, and equatorial Indian Ocean origin, while offshore waters are generally from the Atlantic Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the southeast Indian Ocean. For the most part, the inshore waters approach the Agulhas Current through the Mozambique Channel, while those offshore are circulated within the southern Indian Ocean subtropical gyre before joining the current. These disparate water masses remain distinct during their 1000 -km journeys along the South African continental slope, despite the convergence, extreme velocity shears, and high <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> found within the Agulhas Current. Both potential vorticity conservation and kinematic arguments are discussed as potential inhibitors of along-isopycnal mixing. It is concluded that a high cross-stream gradient of potential vorticity is the dominant mechanism for watermass separation near the surface, while the kinematic steering of water particles by the current is dominant at intermediate depths, where cross-stream potential vorticity is homogeneous. Hence, three lateral mixing regimes for the Agulhas Current are suggested. The surface and thermocline waters are always inhibited from mixing, by the presence of both a strong, cross-frontal potential vorticity gradient and kinematic steering. At intermediate depths mixing is inhibited by steering alone, and thus in this regime periodic mixing is expected during meander events (such as Natal pulses), when the steering level will rise and allow cross-frontal exchange. Below the steering level in the deep waters, there is a regime of free lateral mixing. The deep waters of the Agulhas Current are homogeneous in the cross-stream sense, being from the same North Atlantic source, and their salinity steadily (and rather rapidly) decreases to the north. Here, it is suggested that mixing must be dominated by vertical processes and a large vertical mixing coefficient of order 10 cm 2 s− 1 is estimated...|$|R

In the Levantine, the surface circulation describes an eastward flow along the Libyan and Egyptian slopes (the Libyo-Egyptian Current: LEC) that continues in a cyclonic circuit along the Middle East and Turkish slopes. This general alongslope circuit can be perturbed locally and temporally by the numerous anticyclonic eddies that co-exist in the Levantine, mainly created by the instability of the LEC in the south (Libyo-Egyptian Eddies: LEEs), but also by the wind (Ierapetra and Pelops), and by the topography (over the Eratosthenes Seamount and off Latakia). The most frequent perturbation is the entrainment of part of the flow seaward: the LEEs close to the slope can interact with the LEC, which then spreads more or less around them, so that a series of contiguous LEEs (paddle-wheel effect) can possibly result in an eastward offshore transport (the so-called Mid Mediterranean Jet). Additionally, when LEEs are close enough to the slope, most of the surface flow is spread seaward.

As the conventional barotropic governor appears insufficient to explain the entire response in the comprehensive GCM, the nondivergent barotropicmodel on the sphere is used to demonstrate an additionalmechanism for the effect of surface drag on eddy momentum fluxes and <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy.</b> Analysis of the pseudomomentum budget shows that increased drag modifies the background meridional vorticity gradient, which allows for enhanced eddy momentum flux convergence and decreased <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> {{in the presence of}} a constant eddy source. This additional feedback may explain the changes in eddy momentum fluxes observed in the com-prehensive GCM and was likely present in previous work on the barotropic governor. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Both {{seafloor}} bathymetry and eddy kinetic en-ergy at {{the ocean}} surface can be estimated by making use of satellite altimeters. Comparing the two quantities shows that in regions of the ocean deeper than about 4800 m, surface <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> is greater over smooth abyssal plains than over rough bathymetry, while {{the opposite is true}} in shallower waters. Thus in the deep ocean, bottom rough-ness may dissipate <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy.</b> A simple model indicates that the dissipation rate increases as root-mean-squared bottom roughness increases from 0 to 250 m and decreases to negative values (implying eddy generation) for higher roughness...|$|E
40|$|Data on oceanic-current {{variability}} were {{extracted from}} Geosat altimeter observations for 44 17 -day repeat cycles, using the Sandwell and Zhang (1989) technique {{to process the}} altimeter data and to produce a sea-surface-slope profile having an estimated accuracy of 0. 2 microrad. These were used to generate a series of global <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> maps, each averaged over 3 months, together with their mean. It {{was found that the}} maximum mean <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> per unit mass exceeds 2000 sq cm/sq sec for most of the western boundary currents; for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, however, this value reaches only 500 sq cm/sq sec...|$|E
40|$|Ocean tides, and the atmospherically forced oceanic general {{circulation}} {{and its associated}} mesoscale eddy field, have long been run separately in high-resolution global models. They are now being simulated concurrently in a high-resolution version of the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). The incorporation of horizontally varying stratification {{with the addition of}} atmospheric forcing yields internal tides (internal waves of tidal frequency) in high-latitude, low-stratification regions that are qualitatively different from those in earlier global internal tide models, in which atmospheric forcing and horizontally variable stratification were absent. The internal tides in the new concurrent HYCOM simulations compare well with those measured in along-track satellite altimeter data. The new concurrent simulations demonstrate that the wavenumber spectrum of sea surface height—a measure of the energy contained in different length scales—is dominated in some locations by internal tides and in others by mesoscale <b>eddies.</b> Tidal <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> in the new concurrent simulations compare well with those in current-meter observations, as long as sufficient spatial averaging is performed. The new concurrent simulations are being used in the planning of future-generation satellite altimeters, in the provision of boundary conditions for coastal ocean models, and in studies of ocean mixing...|$|R
40|$|The greater Agulhas Current System, is {{considered}} to be the largest western boundary current in the Southern Hemisphere, with only the Gulf Stream, and possibly the Kuroshio, considered to be larger globally (Bryden et al., 2005). The Current System is a crucial factor for determining the mean state and variability of the regional marine environment, resources and ecosystems in the region, regional weather, as well as the global climate on a broad range of temporal and spatial scales. Due to an absence of a coherent in situ and satellite-based observing system in the area, modelling and data assimilation techniques are utilised. These both further the quantitative understanding of the ocean dynamics as well as providing better forecasts of this complicated western boundary current system. In this study, we compare two assimilation experiments using the Ensemble Optimal Interpolation (EnOI) data assimilation scheme in a regional implementation of the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). In the first experiment, we assimilate along-track satellite sea level anomaly (SLA) data only, and in the second experiment we assimilate both along-track sea level anomaly (SLA) as well as satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data. The objectives of the study are to investigate the impacts of assimilating SST along with SLA into the regional HYCOM model, with the hopes of improving the model performance. The long term aim of this experiment is to develop a regional ocean prediction system. The additional assimilation of SST along with SLA into the HYCOM model, has improved upon the representation of the SST field across the region by reducing the error. However, with regards to velocity, surface <b>eddy</b> <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> (EKE), as well as subsurface velocities, the updated SST model shows less improvement. A velocity bias {{can be seen as the}} reason for underperformance in these aspects. The model still struggles to recreate subsurface water masses, underestimating salinity in the upper 500 m; assimilating T/S profiles in the future could improve on this. The assimilation of SST has improved upon the SST-SSH correlation in the model, as well as the spatial distribution and accuracy. The assimilation of SST along with SLA has had many positive impacts, with unfortunately, a few negatives. The shortcomings of the numerical model will have to be improved upon and additional assimilation variables should be tested in further studies, to provide a solid forecasting system...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} sea-ice on {{various aspects of}} the Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropical climate is examined. Two {{simulations}} using the LMD GCM are performed: a control run with the observed sea-ice distribution and an anomaly run in which all SH sea-ice is replaced by open ocean. When sea-ice is removed, the mean sea level pressure displays anomalies predominantly negatives near the Antarctic coast. In general, the meridional temperature gradient is reduced over most of the Southern Ocean, the polar jet is weaker and the sea level pressure rises equatorward of the control ice edge. The high frequency filtered standard deviation of both the sea level pressure and the 300 -hPa geopotential height decreases over the southern Pacific and southwestern Atlantic oceans, especially {{to the north of the}} ice edge (as prescribed in the control). In contrast, over the Indian Ocean the perturbed simulation exhibits less variability equatorward of about 50 °S and increased variability to the south. The zonal averages of the zonal and <b>eddy</b> potential and <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> were evaluated. The effect of removing sea-ice is to diminish the available potential energy of the mean zonal flow, the available potential energy of the perturbations, the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> of the growing disturbances and the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> of the mean zonal flow over most of the Southern Ocean. The zonally averaged intensity of the subpolar trough and the rate of the baroclinic energy conversions are also weaker...|$|R
