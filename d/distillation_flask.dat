2500|$|The {{condenser}} {{known as}} the Liebig type, a most basic circulating fluid-cooled design, was invented by several investigators working independently; however, the earliest laboratory condenser was invented in 1771 by the Swedish-German chemist Christian Weigel (1748–1831). [...] Weigel’s condenser consisted of two coaxial tin tubes, which were joined at their lower ends and open at their upper ends. [...] Cold water entered, via an inlet, {{the lower end of}} this jacket and spilled out of the jacket’s open upper end. [...] A glass tube carrying vapors from a <b>distillation</b> <b>flask</b> passed through the inner tin tube, not in contact with the cooling water.

5000|$|Alternate set-ups may use a multi-outlet <b>distillation</b> {{receiver}} <b>flask</b> (referred to as a [...] "cow" [...] or [...] "pig") {{to connect}} {{three or four}} receiving flasks to the condenser. By turning the cow or pig, the distillates can be channeled into any chosen receiver. Because the receiver {{does not have to}} be removed and replaced during the distillation process, this type of apparatus is useful when distilling under an inert atmosphere for air-sensitive chemicals or at reduced pressure. A Perkin triangle is an alternative apparatus often used in these situations because it allows isolation of the receiver from the rest of the system, but does require removing and reattaching a single receiver for each fraction.|$|R

Five grams of each plant material (fresh leaves and fresh branches) were used, submerged in 50  mL cyclohexane in a round bottom glass flask with capacity 250  mL, which was coupled to a condenser with a Dean Stark apparatus (<b>distillation</b> trap). The <b>flask</b> was heated (100 [*]±[*] 5 °C) {{with the help of}} a heating blanket. After 2  hours, the water volume present in the plant material was quantified.

40|$|Background: Chamomile is {{medicinal}} and hygienic plants {{which have}} anti -inflammatory and anti-spasmodic characteristics. Its secondary metabolites (and etc.) were varied by biodiversity and environmental effect. There is little {{information about the}} wild chamomile in natural habitats of the Bushehr province. In this study, different chamomile species were selected for essential oil content and active substances. Material and methods: In this field study, several samples of chamomile from different natural habitats were collected and screened for extraction of essential oil and secondary metabolites. The essential oil and methanolic extract were prepared by water <b>distillation</b> liquid and <b>flask</b> reflux condenser stirrer, respectively these were determined by the United States and Iran pharmacopeia methods. Essential oil and methanolic extract were analyzed by GC/Mass and HPLC devices, respectively. Results: Four species, Anthemis pseudocotula, Anthemis austro-iranica, Matricaria recotita and Matricaria aurea were indicated based on screening methods. Matricaria species was observed to have essential oil and beneficiary secondary metabolites, but were not observed {{to be present in}} Anthemis species. Results of the chemical analysis showed that, Matricaria species contained Essential oil (0. 6 %), Apigenin 7 -Glycoside (0. 62 %), Chamazulen (5. 5 %) and other substances such as derivatives of Bisabolole, Bisaboleneand Farenzene. Conclusion: Two species of wild chamomiles, Matricaria recotita and Matricaria aurea, were found in Bushehr province containing significant amount of essential oil and secondary metabolites such as Chamazulen, -αBisabolole and Apigenin. Thus these species can be cultivated for commercial proposes...|$|R

50|$|The solvent {{is heated}} to reflux. The solvent vapour travels up a {{distillation}} arm, and floods {{into the chamber}} housing the thimble of solid. The condenser ensures that any solvent vapour cools, and drips {{back down into the}} chamber housing the solid material. The chamber containing the solid material slowly fills with warm solvent. Some of the desired compound dissolves in the warm solvent. When the Soxhlet chamber is almost full, the chamber is emptied by the siphon. The solvent is returned to the <b>distillation</b> <b>flask.</b> The thimble ensures that the rapid motion of the solvent does not transport any solid material to the still pot. This cycle may be allowed to repeat many times, over hours or days.|$|E

The toxins were able to contaminate the distilled water when spray from the boiling water in the <b>distillation</b> <b>flask</b> reached the receiving flask. Seibert invented a new spray-catching trap to prevent contamination during the distillation process. [...] She published her pyrogen-free process in the American Journal of Physiology.

She was further recognized in 1962 with the John Elliot Memorial Award from the American Association of Blood Banks for her work on pyrogens.|$|E

30|$|ME from NS {{seed oil}} was {{basically}} extracted {{as reported in}} our previous experiment (Ahmad and Beg 2013 a). In brief, 10  g of NS seed oil was added to 100 ml of pure methanol and then stirred for 100  min at ambient temperature. Then this was kept at 45 °C till the methanolic layer has evaporated completely. On the other hand, a procedure of steam distillation {{was used for the}} extraction of VO from NS seed oil. The procedure for VO extraction was employed essentially in the same method as used by Kanter et al. (2006) with minor modification. First of all, 12  g of NS seed oil was taken in a <b>distillation</b> <b>flask,</b> and then 400  ml of distilled water was added to it. The temperature of distillation unit was set to boiling point. Then 150  ml of the distillate containing VO was carefully collected in a dark glass bottle. For extraction of VO from the distillate, 50  ml of diethyl ether was added to it, and anhydrous sodium sulphate was used to remove moisture present in the sample. Thus diethyl ether extract containing VO was evaporated by keeping it at 40 °C. The resulting ME and VO residues were flushed with nitrogen and kept in dark colored bottles at 4 °C.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{influence}} of combined treatments of the extrusion process and the addition of a natural source of tannins (tea and or gambier wastes) of the total gas and methane production in soybean flour. The materials used in this study were soybean meal, tea waste, gambier, cow rumen fluid, alcohol, CO 2, McDougall solution, 15 % H 2 SO 4, 0, 5 N NaOH, 0, 5 N HCl, 1 % PP indicator and distilled water. The instruments used were analytical scales, test tubes, oven, extruder machine, waterbath, centrifuge, vacuum flaks, CO 2 gas cylinder, 100 ml syringes glass equipped with silicone hoses and clips to be closed and opened, vaccuntainer, erlenmeyergas chromatography, special flute tube and <b>distillation</b> <b>flask,</b> glass beaker, Erlenmeyer, incubator, pipettes, measuring instruments, magnetic stirrer, peristaltic pump to drain the rumen fluid and heater. This study used completely randomized design in 2 x 3 factorials and 3 replicates by a-factor (a 0 = no extruided and a 1 = extruded) and b-factor(b 0 = no tannins, b 1 = tea waste tannins, b 2 = gambier tannin). The parameters observed including total gas and methane production, the data were taseted by usisng analysis of varience and followed by the Duncan test. The results indicate that there is no interaction between the extrusion and the addition of tannins to total gas production, while the production of methane gas does not indicate any influence (p < 0. 05). It is concluded that the extrusion and protection with natural tannins of soybean flour have impacted on decreased in the production of total gas and methane productio...|$|E
