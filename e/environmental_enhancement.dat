40|$|Transportation {{corridors}} {{are designed}} to transfer motorists from one area to another in the safest and most efficient way possible. Unfortunately, in Indiana scenic and <b>environmental</b> <b>enhancements,</b> often, were not a priority in the past. The main problem, therefore, is that travelers of most Indiana highways have been deprived of inspiring scenic opportunities and cultural enlightenment, thus {{there is a need}} to educate those involved in the design and implementation process to take heed of the advantages these enhancements and amenities can provide. This study examines the SR 67 South transportation corridor from 1 - 69 at Daleville, Indiana, to Delaware CR 500 South, and proposes an overall transportation corridor concept that could be implemented. This study, also, investigates current Indiana Department of Transportation policies and practices involving scenic and <b>environmental</b> <b>enhancements</b> in transportation corridors, while specifically evaluating the department's assessment of the suggestions offered in "The Gateways of Delaware County" study (in which SR 67 was incorporated). In the end, this study provides significant insight into the "posture" of those directly involved in the design and implementation process of transportation corridors; however, augmenting that posture to the advantages and importance of scenic and <b>environmental</b> <b>enhancements</b> will remain a struggle, especially during these economically challenging times.

40|$|Teaching and Learning Department Capstone ProjectThis paper {{reviews and}} synthesizes the {{relevant}} {{literature of the}} Writing Workshop (Clippard & Nicalse, 2009; Calkins, 1994), genre theory (Bahktin, 1979), and the efficacy of teaching multi-genre writing (Chapman, 1999; Paine & Johnson-Sheehan, 2011; Purcell-Gates, Duke, & Martineua, 2007) to improve the writing abilities of secondary students. Based on these research findings, a curricular implementation of a daily writing assignment is recommended, especially for English instructors needing resources for teaching struggling writers. More specifically, multi-genre writing is a learner-centered writing curriculum {{because of the way}} it relies and builds on the identity (Ivanic, 1998) of each learner. While drawing upon the dispositions of these learners, they gradually become more sophisticated writers as each one builds versatility (Dean, 2008; Paine & Johnson-Sheehan, 2011; Purcell-Gates, Duke, & Martineau, 2007) in their writing. Finally, <b>environmental</b> <b>enhancements</b> are presented and formative assessments (with an emphasis on revision instruction) are recommended for this multi-genre writing curriculum.

40|$|Visual perceptual {{problems}} {{are common in}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD) and often affect {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs). PD patients with non-tremor symptoms at disease onset (i. e., rigidity, bradykinesia, gait disturbance or postural instability) have more diffuse neurobiological abnormalities and report worse non-motor symptoms and functional changes than patients whose initial symptom is tremor, but the relation of motor symptom subtype to perceptual deficits remains unstudied. We assessed visual ADLs with the Visual Activities Questionnaire in 25 non-demented patients with PD, 13 with tremor as the initial symptom and 12 with an initial symptom other than tremor, as well as in 23 healthy control participants (NC). As expected, the non-tremor patients, but not the tremor patients, reported more impairment in visual ADLs than the NC group, including in light/dark adaptation, acuity/spatial vision, depth perception, peripheral vision and visual processing speed. Non-tremor patients were significantly worse than tremor patients overall and on light/dark adaptation and depth perception. <b>Environmental</b> <b>enhancements</b> especially targeted to patients with the non-tremor PD subtype may help to ameliorate their functional disability...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{concept that}} {{navigation}} infrastructure {{can serve as}} valuable habitat is not novel. However, the concept of designing navigation infrastructure with the specific intent of accomplishing both the engineering goal and specific environmental goals is, in most instances, a new idea for many planners and designers. The inclusion of <b>environmental</b> <b>enhancements</b> in navigation infrastructure represents both opportunities and challenges for project managers. The purpose of this document is to present {{an overview of the}} advantages, while addressing some of the implementation challenges, as seen by the current planning and engineering contingents. This study sought to (1) identify existing and potential navigation project features that were designed with the express intent of enhancing environmental benefit; (2) identify laws, regulations, and policies (formulation boundaries) that both support and hinder such design features; (3) identify opportunities for increasing environmental benefits for navigation projects within existing formulation boundaries; (4) propose potential changes to formulation boundaries that would further increase opportunities for environmental benefits; and (5) identify potential areas where research may increase the opportunity to integrate environmental features into future projects.
