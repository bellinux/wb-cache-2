However, according to recent studies, public investment expenditure generates less effect in the short term, due to the lags associated with the achievement of new project, but a larger long-term impact by stimulating potential GDP through increase of the capital stock and of total factor productivity. In this study I have aimed to analyze the influence of public capital spending on economic growth and to explain how it could generate sustainable recovery of the Romanian economy.

The information in the report takes into account, to the fullest extent possible, all Government decisions made before the issue of the writs for the election and all other circumstances that may have a material effect on the economic and fiscal outlook.

5000|$|Since {{the take}} {{over by the}} government, TASMAC has seen an annual revenue of growth of around 20 percent every year. The {{turnover}} in 1983 (the year of incorporation) was 183 Crore Rupees. In 2002-03 before the take over of retail vending, the turnover was 3499.75 Crore Rupees, out of which the government got a tax revenue of 2,828.09 Crore Rupees. After the take over of retail vending, the tax revenue shot up to 3,639 Crore Rupees in the <b>financial</b> <b>year</b> 2003-04. The tax revenue has two components - excise tax and sales tax each constituting roughly 50% of the total. A {{large part of the}} tax revenue is accounted as profit for the state since it is both the wholesale and retail vendor and the difference in the prices goes directly to the state exchequer. In the <b>following</b> four <b>financial</b> <b>years</b> revenue increased to 4872, 6087, 7300 and 8822 Crore Rs respectively. In 2005-06, the 23-year-old record for alcohol sales revenue in the state was broken. The 10,000 Crore (100 Billion) Rupees mark was reached in the <b>financial</b> <b>year</b> 2008-09, when the revenue was 10,601.5 Crore Rupees. For the <b>financial</b> <b>years</b> 2009-10 and 2010-11 it stood at 12,491 and 14,965 Crores respectively. Besides the tax revenue, the company also makes money by selling annual licenses to run bars in its retail outlets. The steady growth in revenue is accounted for by the periodical increase in retail prices and by increasing alcohol consumption in the state. Hard liquors like whiskey, rum, wine, brandy and vodka account for about 80% of the sales and beer accounts for the remaining 20%.|$|R
