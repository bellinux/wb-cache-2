5|$|Phase-contrast X-ray <b>imaging</b> (Fig.26) {{refers to}} a variety of {{techniques}} that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. (For an elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast x-ray <b>imaging</b> (introduction). For a more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast X-ray <b>imaging.)</b> It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures {{in a wide range of}} biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast <b>imaging,</b> all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, talbot interferometry, moiré-based far-field interferometry, refraction-enhanced <b>imaging,</b> and x-ray interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray <b>imaging,</b> making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, x-ray optics, or high resolution x-ray detectors.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To asses the {{incidence}} of vertigo which occurs as {{a symptom of a}} neurological emergency. Material and Method: Emergency Room (ER) admissions with vertigo in a state hospital have been evaluated. Patients who have been consulted to a neurologist were included in the study. Demographical variables and the routine ER examination with cranial <b>imagings</b> of the necessary patients were investigated. Results: Three thousand five hundred and fiftyeight patients who were admitted with vertigo were analysed. Four hundred and nine of these patients were consulted to a neurologist. Eightysix of them underwent brain Computerized Tomography. Only 11 of the 86 <b>imagings</b> showed a lesion consistent with neurological emergency. Discussion: Vertigo is a very common symptom in ER. Considering the vast etiology of vertigo, besides being a symptom of severe neurological disorders it may even represent a somatiform disorder. The easiest and the least costing steps of ER examination like monitoring of blood glucose level, complete blood count, arterial blood pressure with neurological examination would prevent overuse of hospital sources and avoid consultation burden of neurologists...|$|R

25|$|Different <b>imaging</b> {{modalities}} {{are commonly}} used for diagnosis.

25|$|This {{process is}} {{distinct}} {{from the use of}} <b>imaging</b> to delineate targets and organs in the planning process of radiation therapy. However, there is clearly a connection between the <b>imaging</b> processes as IGRT relies directly on the <b>imaging</b> modalities from planning as the reference coordinates for localizing the patient. The variety of medical <b>imaging</b> technologies used in planning includes x-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance <b>imaging</b> (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) among others. The precision of IGRT is significantly improved when N-localizer technology is used in conjunction with these medical <b>imaging</b> technologies.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CSF {{enhancement}} on MR images after intravenous admin-istration of gadolinium chelate, which mimics subarachnoid hemorrhage, {{has been}} reported. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether CSF enhancement can be seen on serial MR images following administration of contrast material in patients with transthyretin-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and to assess other ancillary MR findings. METHODS: We serially studied T 1 -weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images of the brain before, immediately after, and 3, 6, and 24 hours after contrast administration in 6 patients with genetically confirmed transthyretin-related FAP. By consen-sus, 2 radiologists assessed the presence, degree, and extent of enhancement of the CSF, leptomeninges, brain parenchyma, and other structures. Statistical analysis was performed to define the difference of the enhancement between the 2 MR <b>imagings.</b> RESULTS: In 3 / 6 patients with cysteine-for-tyrosine substitutions at position 114 (Tyr 114 Cys mutations), marked CSF enhancement was observed on the FLAIR images at 3 and 6 hours and on T 1 -weighted images at 3 hours after contrast administration. Although there was no significant difference between the 2 MR <b>imagings,</b> leptomeningeal enhancement for these...|$|R
