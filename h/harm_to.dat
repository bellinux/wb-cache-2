Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.|$|E

40|$|Lives Probably {{the most}} vexing problem {{raised by the}} {{cost-benefit}} analysis of environmental regulation is {{how to deal with}} the fact that the loss of human life generally does not occur contemporaneously with the exposure to certain contaminants. In some cases, the environmental exposure produces a harm with a latency period whereas in others it produces <b>harms</b> <b>to</b> future generations. The article underscores the extent to which the cases of latent <b>harms</b> and <b>harms</b> <b>to</b> future generations are analytically distinct, even though they have generally been treated as two manifestations of the same problem. In the case of latent <b>harms,</b> one needs <b>to</b> make intra-personal, intertemporal comparisons of utility, whereas in the case of <b>harms</b> <b>to</b> future generations what is needed is a metric against which to compare the utilities of individuals living in different generations. Thus, the appropriateness of discounting would be resolved differently in the two contexts...|$|R

5|$|Indonesia used fear of {{communism}} to garner {{varying degrees of}} support among western countries, including the United States and Australia, for its East Timor invasion and occupation.

Finally, I will arise at the conclusion that humans have moral obligations to refrain from consuming factory farmed goods...|$|R

5|$|Violence {{against women}} may take many forms, {{including}} physical, sexual, emotional and psychological and may occur throughout the life-course. Structural violence may be embedded in legislation or policy, or be systematic misogyny by organisations against groups of women.

5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit.

Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} attribute in {{this dog}} was a tempered aggressiveness {{that would provide}} the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical <b>harm</b> <b>to</b> the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting.

This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for those qualities, and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proven to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs {{on more than one occasion}} because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.|$|E

5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid <b>harm</b> <b>to</b> the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash.

Darwaza was very critical of other modern interpreters who used certain verses of the Quran to deduce and support scientific theories.

40|$|Background Although {{there is}} {{substantial}} epidemiological evidence implicating cold homes in death and morbidity, evidence for the UK on the nature and scale of the costs involved is fragmentary. Policy making {{in this area is}} thus not well-informed of the benefit of interventions which arises in the form of costs averted. Methods This pilot study presents estimates of the social cost of <b>harms</b> <b>to</b> health caused by cold homes in the City of Sheffield. All costs are monetized and are for 1 year. Different elements of social cost are distinguished as are different types of <b>harms</b> <b>to</b> health. Because all estimates are derived from readily available secondary data the estimating framework is readily transferable to any other English local authority area. Results The social cost arising from losses of well-being are shown to dominate other elements of social cost including National Health Service and Social Care costs, and the social cost arising from mental illness is shown to dominate that arising from other <b>harms</b> <b>to</b> health including death. Discussion The implications of the results for the application of fiscal rate-of-return and social cost–benefit tests are discussed. Several areas are identified in which research reported in this pilot study could be improved on and expanded...|$|R
