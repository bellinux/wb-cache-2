5|$|The {{expedition}} {{originally had}} <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> of encountering a densely populated region that would quickly submit to Spanish rule, with the natives being parcelled out in encomienda to the conquistadores, effectively as slave labour. The fierce resistance to Luis Marín's expedition quickly extinguished such hopes. However, {{within two years}} of this first reconnaissance, titles of encomienda were being issued and used as justification to seize slaves. Chamula was given to Bernal Díaz, and Zinacantan was given to Francisco de Marmolejo.|$|E

After a late-season loss to No.3-ranked Miami, however, Tech was knocked out of contention for the national title. Following the conclusion of its 10–1 season, No. 6 Tech was selected to participate in the Gator Bowl. Facing the Hokies were the No. 16 Clemson Tigers, who had finished 9–2 during the regular season.|$|E

5|$|Finland sought {{security}} guarantees {{from the}} League of Nations, {{but did not}} have <b>high</b> <b>expectations.</b> Sweden {{was one of the}} founding members of the League, and consequently framed its military policies based on the League's principles of disarmament and sanctions. In the mid-1920s the Finns established a special planning committee, called the Committee of Erich after its chairman Rafael Erich, which consisted of top politicians and officers, with the aim of exploring a possible military collaboration of Finland with other nations. The prime goal was co-operation with the Scandinavian countries, amongst which Sweden was the most important prospective partner.|$|E

Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned {{at the end of}} the 1995–96 season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the UEFA Cup, beating Bordeaux in the final. For the 1996–97 season, Trapattoni returned to win the championship. In the following season, Bayern lost the title to newly promoted 1.

5|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of Burnout 3: Takedown, UK-based development studio Criterion had been collaborating with publisher Electronic Arts (EA) on a skating video game. However, disagreements over the game's creative direction led to its cancellation and falling out between the two companies. EA later approached Criterion about reuniting and partnering on a game, and so Criterion began developing Burnout 3: Takedown in June 2004 on the condition that EA would not interfere in the creative process. Over a year later, EA acquired Criterion and the Burnout series; their <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> for Burnout 3: Takedown was influential in the acquisition. The game launched in September 2004 on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox video game consoles.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{thought that}} the {{character}} would be a perfect role for Rudd, stating that he would perform it in a British accent and had <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> for the comedy of the episode because it was being written by Enbom. However, Thomas did not release any details about Rudd's plot line in the episode before its airing. Rudd compared his character to Andrew Ridgeley and Peter O'Toole. In the scene in which Veronica meets Desmond, the film of camera angles while Kristen Bell was speaking were inadvertently destroyed, leading to these camera angles being filmed nearly six weeks later. Bell had to speak her lines without Rudd present.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the differences between college students from divorced and intact families {{with respect to their}} expectations for marriage, division of household labor, and childcare. A divorced family was defined as one in which the parents have divorced and includes those who remain single after the divorce and those where one or both parents have remarried. An intact family was defined as one in which the parents were currently married to each other and had never been divorced from each other. Participants included 102 Southern Illinois University undergraduate students enrolled in a introductory psychology course who participated for course credit. It was hypothesized that participants from divorced families would have <b>higher</b> <b>expectations</b> for an egalitarian marriage, more negative attitudes toward divorce, <b>higher</b> <b>expectations</b> for the husband 2 ̆ 7 s role in performing household labor, and <b>higher</b> <b>expectations</b> for the husband 2 ̆ 7 s role in taking care of the children than those participants from intact families. Results suggest that women have <b>higher</b> <b>expectations</b> for an egalitarian marriage and more positive attitudes toward marriage than men do, women expect to do more household tasks than men whereas men expect household tasks to be shared equally, and women from intact families expect husbands to do more childcare than what men expect to do whereas women from divorced families expect husbands to do less than what men expect to do...|$|R

The Flames signed Langkow to a new contract prior to the 2005–06 season amidst <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> as he was placed on the top line with Jarome Iginla.
