It was fine washing, and he washed fine and finer, with a keen scrutiny and delicate and fastidious touch. At last the pan seemed empty of everything but water; but with a quick semi-circular flirt that sent the water flying over the shallow rim into the stream, he disclosed a layer of black sand {{on the bottom of}} the pan. So thin was this layer that it was like a streak of paint. He examined it closely. In the midst of it was a tiny golden speck. He dribbled a little water in over the <b>depressed</b> <b>edge</b> of the pan. With a quick flirt he sent the water sluicing across the bottom, turning the grains of black sand over and over. A second tiny golden speck rewarded his effort.|$|E

500|$|Aetosaurs {{were very}} heavily armored (most {{certainly}} {{as a defense}} against predators), with large , interlocking bony plates, or osteoderms, protecting the back and sides, belly, and tail. [...] Most osteoderms are heavily pitted on their upper surfaces and smooth on their undersides. Their centers are made of cancellous or spongy bone (also called diploÃ«) and their outer portions {{are made up of}} compact bone. In life, these plates were probably covered in horn. Dorsal osteoderms, which are found on the backs of aetosaurs, are often ornamented with radial grooves. Dorsal paramedians, those found along the midline of the animal, are often wide and quadrangular with a small boss called a dorsal eminence on the dorsal surface of each plate. In aetosaurs, paramedian plates often have raised or <b>depressed</b> anterior <b>edges</b> where the plates articulate with the ones in front of them. If the anterior edge is raised, the area is called an anterior bar, while if it is depressed, the area is called an anterior lamina. In lateral plates, which are positioned {{on either side of the}} paramedian plates, the dorsal eminence is often enlarged into a prominent spike. This spike is especially noticeable in desmatosuchines such as Longosuchus and Desmatosuchus. Osteoderms are useful in diagnosing aetosaur taxa, and aetosaur species can often be identified from individual scutes based on their ornamentation pattern.|$|R

40|$|The rhombencephalic {{neural crest}} play several roles in craniofacial development. They {{give rise to}} the cranial sensory ganglia {{and much of the}} craniofacial skeleton, and are vital for {{patterning}} of the craniofacial muscles. The loss of Hoxa 1 or Hoxa 2 function affects the development of multiple neural crest-derived structures. To understand how these two genes function together in craniofacial development, an allele was generated that disrupts both of these linked genes. Some of the craniofacial defects observed in the double mutants were additive combinations of those that exist in each of the single mutants, indicating that each gene functions independently in the formation of these structures. Other defects were found only in the double mutants demonstrating overlapping or synergistic functions. We also uncovered multiple defects in the attachments and trajectories of the extrinsic tongue and hyoid muscles in Hoxa 2 mutants. Interestingly, the abnormal trajectory of two of these muscles, the styloglossus and the stylohyoideus, blocked the attachment of the hyoglossus to the greater horn of the hyoid, which in turn correlated exactly with the presence of cleft palate in Hoxa 2 mutants. We suggest that the hyoglossus, whose function is to <b>depress</b> the lateral <b>edges</b> of the tongue, when unable to make its proper attachment to the greater horn of the hyoid, forces the tongue to adopt an abnormal posture which blocks closure of the palatal shelves. Unexpectedly, in Hoxa 1 /Hoxa 2 double mutants, the penetrance of cleft palate is dramatically reduced. We show that two compensatory defects, associated with the loss of Hoxa 1 function, restore normal attachment of the hyoglossus to the greater horn thereby allowing the palatal shelves to lift and fuse above the flattened tongue...|$|R
40|$|Resume : In {{work package}} 2. 3. 1 "LNC Application Studies for 130 -seat Regional A/C" of the Clean Sky GRA LNC project, Fraunhofer proposes a {{high-lift}} wing having a leading <b>edge</b> <b>depressed</b> downwards (a. k. a. droop nose) for reducing noise radiated from the leading edge. As {{opposed to the}} precedent wing models, the current model has a droop nose extended almost over the entire wing from 18 % to 98 % span. Good aerodynamic performance (cl max = 2. 6 at 15 degree angle of attack) of this model has been estimated in CFD analysis conducted in a full-scale condition. Due to the Reynolds number effect, CFD analysis in a 1 : 6 -scaled condition has shown smaller cl max = 2. 0, smaller angle of attack and less abrupt stall behavior. The current study aimed {{to confirm that the}} same performance expected in the scaled condition is actually observed in a wind tunnel. For this purpose, a 1 : 6 -scaled half wing model was first designed and manufactured {{so that it can be}} set in three different configurations: (1) clean wing,(2) high-lift baseline having deployed TE flaps but no droop nose leading edge and (3) full high-lift with droop nose. WT tests with this model were performed in an automotive WT facility in Weissach, Germany. Flow speed was set at 40 m/s. Aerodynamic forces and moments were measured by a six-component balance at various angles of attack ranging from - 6 to 20 degrees with 2 degree step. In these tests, the model was placed upright on a platform covering a balancerig raised above the WT floor in order not to disturb the flow. In the tests with a transition tripping strip attached on the suction side near the LE, cl max of 1. 0 at AoA of 10 degree for the clean wing, cl max of 1. 7 at AoA of 8 degree for the high-lift baseline and cl max of 1. 9 at 12 degree angle of attack for the droop-nose configuration. All the configurations have less abruptstall behavior as expected. These results are in good agreement with those of the CFD analysis. In the test without the transition tripping strip, very similar results were observed in the clean wing and high-lift baseline configurations. In the droop nose configuration, however, a large cl max of 2. 5 at a very large stall angle of 20 degree was observed during the WT test. This results hould be more investigated. In addition to aerodynamic examination, aeroacoustic noise sources were also examined with an acoustic beamforming system during the WT tests. No noise sources would be detected for the clean wing. For both high-lift configurations, these were found at few points on the leading edge, at the outer flap and at one of the stay supporting the inner flap. No qualitative difference insource distribution could be found between these two configurations...|$|R
40|$|Ion {{channels}} {{play key}} roles in functions and dysfunctions of all cells. Single channel recording methods using planar (black) lipid membranes (BLM) and patch clamp techniques {{are widely used}} at present, {{but they are not}} suited for automation and miniaturization. Therefore, in order to develop electrophysiology library arrays, several groups have recently reported on wafer-based devices that can replace the more traditional glass pipettes and Teflon partitions that are employed for investigating ion channels activities in cells and artificial membrane. The supported planar lipid bilayer (SPLB) is a lipid bilayer supported on solid surfaces. Concerning the ion-channel biosensors, single ion channel recording has been succeeded in suspended membranes made by the painting method on micro-machined supports. In the case of the suspended membrane, {{it is not easy to}} make a single bilayer with a small pore diameter (several Î¼m), which is necessary for high speed recording and low noises. In the SPLBs made by vesicle fusion however, single channel recording have not yet been reported. The SPLB on the silicon based microelectrode are extremely attractive since small pore can be easily made, thus it has a potential of high stability, high sensitivity and high density of integration. It is considered that a major challenge in the production of tightly sealed bilayers to reduce leakage currents to the levels found in the suspended membrane, and most likely, this will require the reduction of the substrate surface roughness and the elimination of edge effects. The efforts to get high resistivity in the tethered supported membrane on Au surface have been done by several groups. Recently, the tethered lipid bilayers with a high electrical resistance of ~ 130 MÎ© and the subsequent detection of only a few synthetic ligand-gated ion channels incorporated in the tethered lipid bilayer, have been reported. [S. Terrettaz et al. Langmuir 19 (2003) 5567] In spite of these efforts, it is clear that a much higher resistivity (GÎ© seal) is required to realize a supported membrane biosensor which can be applied to the single ion channel recording. ããIn the present thesis, based on these backgrounds, I have developed several elementary processes to realize an ideal SPLB with GÎ© resistance on Si-based microelectrodes. I have developed the techniques to fabricate a hole (well) with a diameter of about 1 Î¼m for microelectrodes on a SiO 2 /CoSi 2 /Si substrate, while maintaining the SiO 2 surface roughness at less than 1 nm using a femtosecond laser microfabrication technique and synchrotron radiation etching. The SPLB membrane was formed on the surface of a microelectrode area by the fusion of giant unilamellar vesicles. I have characterized the stability, electrical resistance, capacitance, and current noise of the bilayers. ããAfter the deposition of Co on the Si(100) surface, the SiO 2 thin film consists of spin on glass (SOG) (400 nm thickness) and sputtered SiO 2 (200 nm thickness) was formed on the Co/Si. Then by annealing at 540 =â for 10 min, the Co/Si layer was changed to CoSi 2 keeping the SiO 2 surface roughness less than 1 nm. A 300 nm of Co layer was deposited on the SiO 2 surface by sputtering as an etching contact mask and circular patterns were made on the Co mask using the femto-second laser ablation. The SR etching of the SiO 2 layer to make the wells on the electrode was carried out at the beam line 4 A 2 of the SR facility (UVSOR) at the Institute for Molecular Science, using a mixture of SF 6 (0. 05 Torr) and O 2 (0. 002 Torr) as an etching gas. The SR etching results in a vertical wall and completely stops at the surface of the CoSi 2 /Si(100). SR was used because of its unique features such as high spatial resolution, extremely high material selectivity between CoSi 2 and SiO 2, anisotropic etching, low damage, and clean etching atmosphere. Finally the Co contact mask was removed without damaging the substrate by immersion into 0. 1 M HNO 3 aq. AFM images of the SiO 2 surface after the removal of the Co mask showed that the surface was very flat (R a = 0. 8 nm), which is essential for the formation of the defect-free SPLB on the surface. ããAg (50 nm) was deposited by electroplating on the surface of CoSi 2 which was exposed at the bottom of the etched well. Then the surface of the Ag was changed into AgCl also by electroplating. The giant unilamellar vesicles were prepared by adding a buffer solution (10 mM KCl, pH = 6. 6) to vacuum-dried films of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn- 3 -phosphor- L-Serin (POPS) (9 : 1, w/w) and agitating at RT. Mixing of negatively charged lipid POPS to neutral lipid DPPC was essentially effective to form unilamellar giant vesicles without aggregation. Formation of SPLB covering the well-type electrode by the rapture of the giant vesicle was confirmed by fluorescence microscope. When substrates are immersed in an aqueous solution of lipid vesicles, the vesicles adhere to the surface, rupture, and spread to form a bilayer on hydrophilic surfaces of SiO 2. It has been suggested that a thin water layer approximately 1 - 2 nm is trapped between the support and the headgroups of the lower leaflet of the bilayer. [Bayerl, T. M.; Bloom, M. Biophysical Journal, 58 (1990) 357] ããFluorescence microscopy images showed that the diameter of the SPLB formed on the SiO 2 /Si(100) surface by the rapture of the giant vesicles was typically about 150 ~ 300 Î¼Em, large enough to cover the electrode area (10 Î¼Em ~ 30 Î¼Em diameter). AFM images of the bilayer showed that the thickness of the SPLB membrane was 4. 5 nm, corresponding to the height of a single bilayer. The electric characteristics were measured by a patch clamp amplifier through the AgCl/Ag electrode. The resistances before and after the lipid bilayer formation were 10 Â± 3 MÎ© and 1. 2 GÎ©, respectively. This confirmed the GÎ© seal formation of SPLB on the microelectrodes. The capacitance of the bilayer measured by using a patch clamp amplifier was 10. 7 pF. These values were observed with extremely good reproducibility during our experiments for more than 5 hours. ããAlthough the resistance value fulfills the condition required for the measurement of single channel measurements, even then it is much smaller than those (> 30 GÎ©) realized in the planer or suspended membranes. This may be due to the edge leak current. Therefore, by <b>depressing</b> the <b>edge</b> leak current, much higher resistance of lipid bilayer is expected to be obtained. ããI have considered to use the hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers (SAM) as a âguard ringâ to reduce the edge leak current of SPLB. I have developed a patterning method of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) SAM by photo-lithography and UV ashing. OTS-SAM were formed on the sputtered SiO 2 surface by immersing the sample into a 1. 0 mM solution of OTS in toluene for 10 s at 22 â. Then negative resist (7 Î¼Em height) pattern was made with lithography technique. After 30 min of UV ashing, resist pattern was removed with remover. The OTS-SAM on the open area, which was not covered with the resist, were completely removed by UV ashing, while no change was observed in the OTS-SAM on the area covered with the resist. The height of the OTS-SAM was ~ 2. 5 nm and the roughness of the SiO 2 surface without OTS-SAM was R a = 0. 8 nm. SPLB was formed on this patterned OTS-SAM by rapture of giant unilamellar vesicles. AFM and fluorescence microscopy images have shown that SPLB forms bilayer on hydrophilic SiO 2 surfaces and a monolayer on OTS-SAM hydrophobic surfaces. This technique has been considered to use for the formation of tightly sealed bilayers to reduce leakage current of the SPLB...|$|R
