For  description  this  goal the logging sub-operations were detailed. The effects of the non conformity of one sub-operation on the succeeding ones were listed and analysed. Those consequences on which a money value could be atributed were specified. The methodology was applied to a case study. Quality cost were divided in three categories: evaluation cost, prevention cost, and faillure cost. It was concluded that the firm is not investing enough in <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> <b>prevention</b> causing a faillure cost of R$ 1. 541, 11 /ha, which is considered too high. The percent composition of this cost was: log spliting 40, 96 %; error in wood volume determination in the stocking yeard 37, 12 %; wood waste in the stand 9, 52 %; non separation of thin logs 8, 46 %; logs left in the fire control line 1, 49 %; miscalculation of splited wood volume 1, 53 %; wood volume remaining in the coppices 0, 51 %; presence of branches in the fire control line 0, 41 %.

By introducing the OBT treatment, the LB-OBT contact detection can be simplified from the global range to the local sub-topography using the current algorithm, which enhances the computation efficiency.
