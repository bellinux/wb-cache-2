40|$|Since 1995, {{more than}} 500 extrasolar planets have been {{discovered}} orbiting very close to their parent star, where they experience strong tidal interactions. Their orbital evolution depends on the physical mechanisms that cause tidal dissipation, and these are still not well understood. We refine {{the theory of the}} <b>equilibrium</b> <b>tide</b> in fluid bodies that are partly or entirely convective, to predict the dynamical evolution of the systems. In particular, we examine the validity of modeling the tidal dissipation by the quality factor Q, as is commonly done. We consider here the simplest case where the considered star or planet rotates uniformly, all spins are aligned, and the companion is reduced to a point-mass. The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the shape of the star or planet adiabatically along the line of centers. This generates the divergence-free velocity field of the adiabatic <b>equilibrium</b> <b>tide</b> which is decoupled from the dynamical tide. The tidal kinetic energy is dissipated into heat through turbulent friction, which is modeled here as an eddy-viscosity acting on the adiabatic tidal flow. This dissipation induces a second velocity field, the dissipative <b>equilibrium</b> <b>tide,</b> which is in quadrature with the exciting potential; it is responsible for the imaginary part of the disturbing function, which is implemented in the dynamical evolution equations, from which one derives characteristic evolution times. The rate at which the system evolves depends on the physical properties of tidal dissipation, and specifically on how the eddy viscosity varies with tidal frequency and on the thickness of the convective envelope for the fluid <b>equilibrium</b> <b>tide.</b> At low frequency, this tide retards by a constant time delay, whereas it lags by a constant angle when the tidal frequency exceeds the convective turnover rate.

40|$|The riddle {{posed by}} super-Earths {{is that they}} are not Jupiters: their core masses are large enough to trigger runaway gas accretion, yet somehow super-Earths accreted atmospheres that weigh only a few percent of their total mass. In this thesis, I {{demonstrate}} that this puzzle is solved if super-Earths formed late, in the inner cavities of transitional disks. Super-puffs present the inverse problem of being too voluminous for their small masses. I show that super-puffs most easily acquire their thick atmospheres as dust-free, rapidly cooling worlds outside 1 AU, and then migrate in just after super-Earths appear. Super-Earths and Earth-sized planets around FGKM dwarfs are evenly distributed in log orbital period down to ~ 10 days, but dwindle in number at shorter periods.

Both the break at ∼ 10 {{days and the}} slope of the occurrence rate down to ∼ 1 day {{can be attributed to the}} truncation of protoplanetary disks by their host star magnetospheres at co-rotation. We demonstrate this by deriving planet occurrence rate profiles from empirical distributions of pre-main-sequence stellar rotation periods.

50|$|It is {{unlikely}} that Venus was formed with its present slow retrograde rotation, which takes 243 days. Venus probably began with a fast prograde rotation with {{a period of several}} hours much like most of the planets in the solar system. Venus is close enough to the Sun to experience significant gravitational tidal dissipation, and also has a thick enough atmosphere to create thermally driven atmospheric tides that create a retrograde torque. Venus' present slow retrograde rotation is in equilibrium balance between gravitational tides trying to tidally lock Venus to the Sun and atmospheric tides trying to spin Venus in a retrograde direction. In addition to maintaining this present day <b>equilibrium,</b> <b>tides</b> are also sufficient to account for evolution of Venus's rotation from a primordial fast prograde direction to its present-day slow retrograde rotation. In the past various other alternative hypotheses have been proposed to explain Venus' retrograde rotation, such as collisions or it having originally formed that way. Mercury is closer to the Sun than Venus but Mercury is not tidally locked because it has entered a spin-orbit resonance due to the eccentricity of its orbit. The rotations of Earth and Mars are also affected by tidal forces with the Sun, but they have not reached an equilibrium state like Mercury and Venus because they are further out from the Sun where tidal forces are weaker. The gas giants of the solar system are too massive and too far from the Sun for tidal forces to slow down their rotations.|$|R

40|$|It is {{debated whether}} the two hot Jupiter populations [...] - those on orbits {{misaligned}} from their host star's spin axis and those well-aligned [...] - result from two migration channels or from two tidal realignment regimes. Here I demonstrate that <b>equilibrium</b> <b>tides</b> {{raised by a}} planet on its star can account for three observed spin-orbit alignment trends: the aligned orbits of hot Jupiters orbiting cool stars, the planetary mass cut-off for retrograde planets, and the stratification by planet mass of cool host stars' rotation frequencies. The first trend {{can be caused by}} strong versus weak magnetic braking (the Kraft break), rather than realignment of the star's convective envelope versus the entire star. The second trend can result from a small effective stellar moment of inertia participating in the tidal realignment in hot stars, enabling massive retrograde planets to partially realign to become prograde. The third trend is attributable to higher mass planets more effectively counteracting braking to spin up their stars. Both hot and cool star require a small effective stellar moment of inertia participating in the tidal realignment, e. g., an outer layer weakly coupled to the interior. I demonstrate via Monte Carlo that this model can match the observed trends and distributions of sky-projected misalignments and stellar rotation frequencies.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{stated that the}} <b>equilibrium</b> ocean <b>tide,</b> measured {{with respect to the}} solid surface of the Earth, has amplitude [...] ξ₂ = (1 +k₂-h₂) U₂/g [...] where U₂ is the tide potential of degree- 2, g is the acceleration of gravity at the surface and k₂, h₂, the second degree Love numbers, are scalar quantities which characterize the elastic response of the solid Earth. In fact this equation applies strictly to the "tides" in the equipotential surfaces of oceanless, spherically symmetric planets. It is found that the mass of the oceans is sufficient to disturb the potential field to which they are responding thus creating a feedback mechanism which increases the predicted tide height by about 63 %. The loading and subsequent deformation of the solid Earth by the ocean tide creates another feedback loop which decreases the tide by about 40 %. The combined effect of loading and self-attraction is a 23 % increase in the predicted tide height. In addition the irregular distribution of the oceans introduces complications in the response of the oceans to a prescribed potential and a single scalar equation no longer suffices. A set of matrices is developed to replace the scalar Love parameters and these are used to construct maps of several tides which are thought to be equilibrium. Matrices which give the perturbed potential and the gravity tide on a non-spherically symmetric Earth are also given, and the correct expression for the load gravimetric factor, about which there has been some confusion, is derived.

40|$|Abstract: In the <b>equilibrium</b> {{theory of}} <b>tides</b> by Newton, tide on the Earth is a {{phenomenon}} driven by differential gravity contributed both by the Sun and the Moon. Due to the direct link of the generic tidal effect to the oceanic tides, college students in the earth science education department are exposed to this theory through oceanography lectures as well as astronomy lectures. Common oceanography textbooks adopt a non-inertial reference frame fixed to the Earth in which the fictitious, centrifugal force appears. This has a potential risk to provide misconceptions among students in various aspects including the followings: 1) this is how Newton originally derived the <b>equilibrium</b> theory of <b>tides,</b> and 2) the tide {{is a phenomenon}} appearing only in rotating systems. We show that in astronomy, a much simpler description, which employs the inertial frame, is generally used to explain tides and thus causes less confusion. We argue that the description used in astronomy is preferable both in the viewpoints of simplicity and ease of interpretation. Moreover, on a historical basis, an inertial frame was adopted by Newton in Principia to explain tides. Thus, the description used in astronomy is consistent with Newton's original approach. We also present various astrophysical tides which do not comply {{with the concept of}} centrifugal force in general. We therefore argue that the description used in oceanography should be compensated by that in astronomy, due to its complexity, historical inconsistency and limited applicability...|$|R

40|$|Close-in, massive exoplanets raise {{significant}} tides {{in their}} stellar hosts. We compute the radial velocity (RV) signal {{due to this}} fluid motion in the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>tide</b> approximation. The predicted radial velocities in the observed sample of exoplanets exceed 1 m/s for 17 systems, with the largest predicted signal being 30 m/s for WASP- 18 b. Tidally-induced RV's are thus detectable with present methods. Both tidal fluid flow and the epicyclic motion of a slightly eccentric orbit produce an RV signal at twice the orbital frequency. If care is not taken, the tidally induced RV may, in some cases, be confused with a finite orbital eccentricity. Indeed, WASP- 18 b {{is reported to have}} an eccentric orbit with small e= 0. 009 and pericenter longitude ω=-π/ 2. Whereas such a close alignment of the orbit and line of sight to the observer requires fine tuning, this phase in the RV signal is naturally explained by the tidal velocity signature of an e= 0 orbit. Additionally, the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>tide</b> estimate for the amplitude is in rough agreement with the data. Thus the reported eccentricity for WASP- 18 b is instead likely a signature of the tidally-induced RV in the stellar host. Measurement of both the orbital and tidal velocity for non-transiting planets may allow planet mass and inclination to be separately determined solely from radial velocity data. We suggest that high precision fitting of RV data should include the tidal velocity signal in those cases where it may affect the determination of orbital parameters.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{excitation}} and damping of tides in close binary systems, {{accounting for the}} leading-order nonlinear corrections to linear tidal theory. These nonlinear corrections include two distinct physical effects: three-mode nonlinear interactions, i. e., the redistribution of energy among stellar modes of oscillation, and nonlinear excitation of stellar normal modes by the time-varying gravitational potential of the companion. This paper, {{the first in a}} series, presents the formalism for studying nonlinear tides and studies the nonlinear stability of the linear tidal flow. Although the formalism we present is applicable to binaries containing stars, planets, and/or compact objects, we focus on non-rotating solar-type stars with stellar or planetary companions. Our primary results include the following: (1) The linear tidal solution almost universally used in studies of binary evolution is unstable over much of the parameter space in which it is employed. More specifically, resonantly excited internal gravity waves in solar-type stars are nonlinearly unstable to parametric resonance for companion masses M[> over ~] 10 - 100 M[subscript ⊕] at orbital periods P ≈ 1 - 10 days. The nearly static "equilibrium" tidal distortion is, however, stable to parametric resonance except for solar binaries with P [< over ~] 2 - 5 days. (2) For companion masses larger than a few Jupiter masses, the dynamical tide causes short length scale waves to grow so rapidly that they must be treated as traveling waves, rather than standing waves. (3) We show that the global three-wave treatment of parametric instability typically used in the astrophysics literature does not yield the fastest-growing daughter modes or instability threshold in many cases. We find a form of parametric instability in which a single parent wave excites {{a very large number of}} daughter waves (N ≈ 10 [superscript 3][P/ 10 days] for a solar-type star) and drives them as a single coherent unit with growth rates that are a factor of ≈N faster than the standard three-wave parametric instability. These are local instabilities viewed through the lens of global analysis; the coherent global growth rate follows local rates in the regions where the shear is strongest. In solar-type stars, the dynamical tide is unstable to this collective version of the parametric instability for even sub-Jupiter companion masses with P [< over ~] a month. (4) Independent of the parametric instability, the dynamical and <b>equilibrium</b> <b>tides</b> excite a wide range of stellar p-modes and g-modes by nonlinear inhomogeneous forcing; this coupling appears particularly efficient at draining energy out of the dynamical tide and may be more important than either wave breaking or parametric resonance at determining the nonlinear dissipation of the dynamical tide.

40|$|The secular {{change in}} the mean motion of the moon, n, caused by the tidal {{dissipation}} in the ocean and solid earth is due primarily {{to the effect of}} the diurnal and semidiurnal tides. The long-period ocean tides produce an increase in n, but the effects are only 1 percent of the diurnal and semidiurnal ocean tides. In this investigation, expressions for these effects are obtained by developing the tidal potential in the ecliptic reference system. The computation of the amplitude of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>tide</b> and the phase corrections is also discussed. The averaged tidal deceleration of the moon's mean motion, n, from the most recent satellite ocean tide solutions is - 25. 25 +/- 0. 4 arcseconds/sq century. The value for n inferred from the satellite-determined ocean-tide solution is in good agreement with the value obtained from the analysis of 20 years of lunar laser-ranging observations...|$|E
40|$|To first approximation, {{a binary}} system conserves its angular {{momentum}} while it evolves to its state of minimum kinetic energy: circular orbit, all spins aligned, and components rotating in synchronism with the orbital motion. The pace at which this final state is achieved {{depends on the}} physical processes {{that are responsible for}} the dissipation of the tidal kinetic energy. For stars (or planets) with an outer convection zone, the dominant mechanism identified so far is the viscous dissipation acting on the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>tide.</b> For stars with an outer radiation zone, it is the radiative damping operating on the dynamical tide. After a brief presentation of the tides, I shall review these physical processes; I shall discuss the uncertainties of their present treatment, describe the latest developments, and compare the theoretical predictions with the observed properties concerning the orbital circularization of close binaries.

40|$|Tidal {{interactions}} play {{an important}} role in the evolution and ultimate fate of compact white dwarf (WD) binaries. Not only do tides affect the pre-merger state (such as temperature and rotation rate) of the WDs, but they may also determine which systems merge and which undergo stable mass transfer. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the effects of rotation on tidal angular momentum transport in binary stars, with specific calculations applied to WD stellar models. We incorporate the effect of rotation using the traditional approximation, in which the dynamically excited gravity waves within the WDs are transformed into gravito-inertial Hough waves. The Coriolis force has only a minor effect on prograde gravity waves, and previous results predicting the tidal spin-up and heating of inspiraling WDs are not significantly modified. However, rotation strongly alters retrograde gravity waves and inertial waves, with important consequences for the tidal spin-down of accreting WDs. We identify new dynamical tidal forcing terms that arise from a proper separation of the <b>equilibrium</b> and dynamical <b>tide</b> components; these new forcing terms are very important for systems near synchronous rotation. Additionally, we discuss the impact of Stokes drift currents on the wave angular momentum flux. Finally, we speculate on how tidal interactions will affect super-synchronously rotating WDs in accreting systems. Comment: 18 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|Synchronous binary asteroids {{may exist}} in a {{long-term}} stable equilibrium, where the opposing torques from mutual body tides and the binary YORP (BYORP) effect cancel. Interior of this <b>equilibrium,</b> mutual body <b>tides</b> are stronger than the BYORP effect and the mutual orbit semi-major axis expands to the equilibrium; outside of the equilibrium, the BYORP effect dominates the evolution and the system semi-major axis will contract to the equilibrium. If the observed population of small (0. 1 - 10 km diameter) synchronous binaries are in static configurations that are no longer evolving, then this would be confirmed by a null result in the observational tests for the BYORP effect. The confirmed existence of this equilibrium combined with a shape model of the secondary of the system enables the direct study of asteroid geophysics through the tidal theory. The observed synchronous asteroid population cannot exist in this equilibrium if described by the canonical "monolithic" geophysical model. The "rubble pile" geophysical model proposed by Goldreich 2009 is sufficient, however it predicts a tidal Love number directly proportional to the radius of the asteroid, while the best fit to the data predicts a tidal Love number inversely proportional to the radius. This deviation from the canonical and Goldreich 2009 models motivates future study of asteroid geophysics. Ongoing BYORP detection campaigns will determine whether these systems are in an equilibrium, and future determination of secondary shapes will allow direct determination of asteroid geophysical parameters.

40|$|This study aims {{to improve}} the polar motion theory by {{developing}} refined frequency-dependent transfer functions with the most current models for ocean tides, the Earth&# 39;s rheology, and core-mantle coupling. First, we present a power law for mantle anelasticity constrained by the Chandler period T-CW and quality factor Q(CW) and an empirical quasi-fluid rheology model with a linear dependence on frequency, which is suitable for a period as long as similar to 18. 6 years. Then we adopt the diurnal ocean tides from the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service Conventions (2010), the long-period ocean model of Dickman and Gross (2010), and the <b>equilibrium</b> ocean pole <b>tide</b> model of Desai (2002) to calculate the oceanic corrections to the Love numbers. Further, we present discussions on the geophysical and observational aspects of the Chandler period TCW and quality factor Q(CW), and provide preferred values and intervals for T-CW and Q(CW), which allow us to place some constraints on the mantle anelasticity and core-mantle coupling ratio (CW). Although (CW) is affected by uncertainties in T-CW and Q(CW), we find its real part should be around 2 %- 3 % while its imaginary part might be only a few thousandths. Finally, the frequency-dependent polar motion transfer functions T-L and T-NL are determined based on the models of frequency-dependent Love numbers and core-mantle coupling discussed above. Our transfer functions {{are related to the}} values of T-CW and Q(CW), however, our analyses demonstrate that our transfer functions are rather stable and not sensitive to perturbations in T-CW and Q(CW) ...|$|R
