40|$|Spaceflight optical {{instruments}} have two conflicting requirements. They {{need to be}} both rigid and lightweight. In addition, for interferometric far ultraviolet spectrometers, the requirements for precision positioning are more severe than for conventional spectrometers. To {{meet the challenge of}} lightweight {{optical instruments}}, a modular adjustment mechanism was developed to position two orthogonal axes of a universal three-axis gimbal support system with a positioning accuracy on the order of 10 arc seconds. The mechanism was designed as a self-contained assembly which can be removed after final alignment of a spacebound optical instrument to reduce its in-flight mass. To demonstrate the concept, a number of these assemblies were made and mounted on two of the positioning axes of a far ultraviolet spatial heterodyne interferometer. A <b>shaft</b> <b>clamp</b> was used on each positioning axis to retain the adjusted position. This paper describes the design of the mechanism and presents optical test results...|$|R

30|$|A closed {{reduction}} of the fracture was performed under image intensification in both the anteroposterior (AP) and lateral planes before application of the fixator. Patients were placed supine on an orthopaedic table and closed reduction was usually accomplished by applying traction and internal rotation to the slightly adducted injured limb. The reduction was considered anatomical if the neck-shaft angle was between 120 ° and 140 ° and the distraction at the fracture site was less than 2  mm. Minor valgus angulation (< 10 °) and a distraction of less than 5  mm were considered acceptable if an anatomical reduction could not be obtained. The fixator was applied using the AO principles and technique [5]. Two Schanz screws were inserted through stab incisions, {{from the base of}} the greater trochanter, across the fracture site into the femoral head. Another three Schanz screws were inserted at right angles into the middle half of the femoral <b>shaft.</b> <b>Clamps</b> were tightened and the final position was checked radiologically. On the first postoperative day, the patients started sitting on a bed or a chair, and from the second postoperative day, walking on a walker frame was started allowing full weight bearing as tolerated by the patient [14]. Daily care of the Schanz screws and the surrounding skin using povidone iodine solution was applied meticulously. All patients were followed up for a mean of 12  ±  4.5  months. The patients were evaluated clinically and radiologically, bi-weekly for the first month, then monthly for the next 5  months, and subsequently every 6  months. The radiological evaluation of all patients was made with AP and lateral radiographs of the proximal femur. Clinical examination included range of motion of the hip, knee and limb-length discrepancy. Operative time, units of transfused blood, duration of hospitalisation, complications, post-operative walking ability, healing time, and mortality were recorded for a minimum of 6  months.|$|R
50|$|Although clamp-type collars {{work very}} well under {{relatively}} constant loads, shock loads can cause the collar to shift its position on the shaft. This {{is due to the}} very high forces that can be created by a relatively small mass during impact, compared to a statically or gradually applied load. As an option for applications with this type of loading, an undercut can be made on the <b>shaft</b> and a <b>clamp</b> collar can be used to create a positive stop that is more resistant to shock loads.|$|R
5000|$|A tweezer clamp {{consists}} of two short lengths of metal, no more than 5 - 10 cm (2 - 4 in) in length. The two lengths are fixed together {{at one end and}} open at the other end (just like a regular tweezer). The open ends are curved slightly to improve their ability to grip the nipple. Typically, they have a small 1 cm rubber sheath over this end to protect the nipple from damage and reduce slippage. A small ring wraps around the two pieces of metal and is used to adjust the tension. The user places {{the two sides of the}} metal head either side of the nipple, then by sliding the ring along the <b>clamp</b> <b>shaft</b> towards the nipple, causes the two halves to close tighter together. Tension can thus be adjusted depending on the location of the ring [...] - [...] the closer the ring is along the shaft toward the nipple, the tighter the clamp.|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the measurement of}} temperature distribution across a metal plate and the non-contact measurement of torsion in a rotating shaft. After a thorough theoretical study {{of the origin of}} fibre Bragg gratings, methods of fabrication and erasing of gratings, methods of demodulating the signals from gratings, and methods of discriminating between strain and temperature variations in gratings, simulations and experiments were done to prove the feasibility of both temperature distribution measurement and non-contact torsion measurement. For the measurement of temperature distribution, a 450 x 450 x 1. 6 mm type 304 stainless steel plate was used. Two 4, 7 Ω 25 W resistors were used as heat sources, and five fibre Bragg gratings measured the temperature at strategic points on the plate. The measured values were interpolated appropriately and a three-dimensional representation of the temperature distribution was shown on a personal computer monitor. The measurement of torsion was first done on a non-rotating 25 mm diameter solid shaft with torque applied. Both resistive strain gauges and fibre Bragg gratings were attached to the shaft and the measurement results compared well. Up to 90 Nm of torque was applied to the shaft. The non-contact measurement of torsion on a rotating shaft was done with fibre Bragg gratings and involved the use of graded index (GRIN) lenses for transmitting optical information between the light source, the gratings, and back to the spectrum analyser through free space. A special Böhler steel with high yield strength was used, and the set-up was mounted on a lathe. The one end of the <b>shaft</b> was <b>clamped</b> in the lathe chuck, and the other was fixed to an automobile drum brake system, allowing the application of torque on the rotating shaft. Up to 97 Nm of torque was applied to the shaft rotating at 190 rpm, and the results are within 10 % of the expected values. As far as we are aware, {{this is the first time}} that torsion is measured by fibre Bragg gratings without the need to have physical contact with the shaft, i. e. slip rings, to transmit the information to and from the sensors. The experimental results of this thesis confirm that fibre Bragg grating sensors can be applied usefully in temperature distribution measurement, as well as in the measurement of torsional stress in rotating shafts...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{effect of}} impact tool {{geometry}} and soft material covering on bone fracture patterns {{plays a major}} role in fracture patterns. However, the literature is nearly void of such studies and only general correlations between the fracture pattern and the mechanism underlying the insult were reported. Purpose The aim of this study is to reveal the association between the geometry of the impact tool and the presence of soft material covering on bone fracture patterns. The Dynatup Model POE 2000 (Instron Co.) low energy pendulum impact machine was utilized to apply impact loading on fresh pig femoral bones (n = 50). The bone <b>clamp</b> <b>shaft</b> was adjusted to position the bone for three-point bending with additional bone compression simulating a situation occurring in pedestrian road traffic accidents. Five different tests using varying impact tool sizes with and without soft interface covering were carried out. Results A significant positive correlation was found between the fracture features and the impact tool’s geometry. Only bones that were damaged by a rounded impact body result in a “false” butterfly fragment; in all other cases where the impact body is flat and wide, double trapezoid fragments are observed in the area of impact. The impacted aspect is the most affected. All fracture line features were significantly greater in bones subjected to an impact by tools without soft covering. With an impact with soft covering, the impacted aspect exhibits numerous unique fracture lines and a fragmented pattern. Our study clearly shows that impact tool geometry and soft material covering markedly affect the fracture pattern...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{direction}} of the impact and the presence of axial loading on fracture patterns have not yet been established in experimental 3 -point bending studies. Purpose: To reveal the association between {{the direction of the}} force and the fracture pattern, with and without axial loading. Material and methods: A Dynatup Model POE 2000 (Instron Co.) low energy pendulum impact machine was utilized to apply impact loading on fresh pig femoral bones (n = 50). The bone <b>clamp</b> <b>shaft</b> was adjusted to position the bone for three-point bending with and without additional bone compression. Four different directions of the force were applied: anterior, posterior, lateral, and medial. Results: the impacted aspect can be distinguished from the non-impacted aspects based on the fracture pattern alone (the most fractured one); the impact point can be identified on bare bones (the area from which all oblique lines radiate and/or the presence of a chip fragment). None of our experiments (with and without compression) yielded a “true” butterfly fracture, but instead, oblique radiating lines emerged from the point of impact (also known as “false” butterfly). Impacts on the lateral and anterior aspects of the bones produce more and longer fracture lines than impacts on the contralateral side; bones subjected to an impact with axial loading are significantly more comminuted and fragmented. Under axial loading, the number of fracture lines is independent of the impact direction. Our study presents an experimental model for fracture analysis and shows that the impact direction and the presence of axial loading during impact significantly affect the fracture pattern obtained...|$|R
