50|$|An {{electric}} eye is a photodetector used for detecting obstruction {{of a light}} beam. An example is the door safety system used on garage door openers that use a light transmitter and receiver {{at the bottom of}} the door to prevent closing if there is any obstruction in the way that breaks the light beam. The device does not provide an image; only presence of light is detectable. Visible light may be used, but infrared radiation conceals the operation of the device and typically is used in modern systems. Originally, systems used lamps powered by direct current or the power line alternating current frequency, but modern photodetector systems use an <b>infrared</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> modulated at a few kilohertz, which allows the detector to reject stray light and improves the range, sensitivity and security of the device.|$|E
50|$|An {{opto-isolator}} {{contains a}} source (emitter) of light, almost always a near <b>infrared</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED), that converts electrical input signal into light, a closed optical channel (also called dielectrical channel), and a photosensor, which detects incoming light and either generates electric energy directly, or modulates electric current flowing from an external power supply. The sensor {{can be a}} photoresistor, a photodiode, a phototransistor, a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) or a triac. Because LEDs can sense light in addition to emitting it, construction of symmetrical, bidirectional opto-isolators is possible. An optocoupled solid state relay contains a photodiode opto-isolator which drives a power switch, usually a complementary pair of MOSFETs. A slotted optical switch contains a source of light and a sensor, but its optical channel is open, allowing modulation of light by external objects obstructing the path of light or reflecting light into the sensor.|$|E

Afiducial marker system uses five <b>infrared</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> with four in the same plane and the fifth outside the plane.

The static experimental results show that the system can provide attitude accuracy of 0. 06 deg and angular velocity accuracy of 0. 15 deg /s with an attitude update rate of at least 10 Hz. Finally, a yaw-axis maneuver is performed to demonstrate the system performance under dynamic conditions.

We found that the band gap changes of GaAs 1 -x-yPyBix relative to GaAs are determined mainly by the local structural changes around P and Bi atoms rather than their electronic structure differences. To obtain alloy with lower Auger recombination than GaAs bulk, we identified the necessary constraints on the compositions of P and Bi. Finally, we demonstrated that GaAs/GaAs 1 -x-yPyBix heterojunctions with potentially low Auger recombination can exhibit small lattice mismatch and large enough band offsets for strong carrier confinement.

In this work the <b>infrared</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> oblique illumination technique was used to visualize and label LCNs, allowing reconstruction and analysis of their dendritic and extensive axonal trees. We show that the majority of lamina I neurons with locally branching axons fall into the multipolar (with ventrally protruding dendrites) and flattened (dendrites limited to lamina I) somatodendritic categories. Analysis of their axons revealed that the initial myelinated part gives rise to several unmyelinated small-diameter branches that have a high number of densely packed, large varicosities and an extensive rostrocaudal (two or three segments), mediolateral, and dorsoventral (reaching laminae III–IV) distribution. The extent of the axon and the occasional presence of long, solitary branches suggest that LCNs may also form short and long propriospinal connections. We also found that the distribution of axon varicosities and terminal field locations show substantial heterogeneity and that a substantial portion of LCNs is inhibitory.

Background data: Thermography is an imaging technique in which radiation emitted by a body {{in the middle and}} far infrared spectrum is detected and associated with the temperature of the body’s surface. Materials and methods: Eighteen postmenopausal women were randomly divided into two groups: (1) the LED group, which performed the exercises on a treadmill associated with phototherapy (n = 9) and; (2) the exercise group, which performed the exercises on a treadmill without additional phototherapy (n = 9). The irradiation parameters for each women's thigh were: array of 2000 infrared LEDs (850 nm) with an area of 1, 110 cm 2, 100 mW, 39 mW/cm 2, and 108 J/cm 2 for 45 min. The submaximal constant-speed exercise on the treadmill at intensities between 85 % and 90 % maximal heart rate (HRmax) with or without phototherapy were performed during 45 min, to perform the thermographic analysis. Thermography images were captured before the exercise (t = 0), after 10, 35, and 45 min of exercising (t = 10, t = 35, and t = 45) and at 5 min post-exercising (t = 50). Results: The LED group showed an increased cutaneous thigh temperature during the exercise (from 33. 5 ± 0. 8 °C to 34. 6 ± 0. 9 °C, p = 0. 03), whereas the exercise group showed a reduced cutaneous temperature (from 33. 5 ± 0. 6 to 32. 7 ± 0. 7 °C, p = 0. 02).

This report provides details of a project to develop a functional and reliable tympanic thermal simulator prototype that could be embedded into the ear of a manikin to enable tympanic thermometers to be used during simulation encounters. Methods: A simple electrical circuit was built using (i) a standard 9 -V battery, (ii) a switch, (iii) 5 × 62 -Ω resistors in parallel for circuit stability, (iv) a 62 -Ω resistor in parallel with (v) a 1 -kΩ potentiometer to vary the <b>infrared</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (IRLED) intensity, and (vi) 2 IRLEDs. After confirming reliability of circuit performance, the IRLEDs were implanted into the ear of a manikin. Over 3 consecutive days, 3033 samples were recorded simulating a range of human body temperatures, controlled by altering current flow. Results: Initial testing of the thermal simulator prototype indicates that a range of human temperatures (34. 0 °C– 41. 9 °C) can be generated using high-intensity IRLEDs. Although, at higher applied current levels, the variation in measured temperature was larger (2. 4 °C) than at lower applied currents (0. 2 °C), reasonably precise temperatures were achieved. Conclusions: Testing and reporting initial prototype results are {{an important first step}} in developing and refining a useful product to enhance manikin capabilities associated with patient physical assessment in the simulation setting.

40|$|Two image-data-processing {{algorithms}} {{are essential}} to the successful operation of a system of electronic hardware and software that noninvasively tracks the direction of a person s gaze in real time. The system was described in High-Speed Noninvasive Eye-Tracking System (NPO- 30700) NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 31, No. 8 (August 2007), page 51. To recapitulate from the cited article: Like prior commercial noninvasive eyetracking systems, this system is based on (1) illumination of an eye by a low-power <b>infrared</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED); (2) acquisition of video images of the pupil, iris, and cornea in the reflected infrared light; (3) digitization of the images; and (4) processing the digital image data to determine the direction of gaze from the centroids of the pupil and cornea in the images. Most of the prior commercial noninvasive eyetracking systems rely on standard video cameras, which operate at frame rates of about 30 Hz. Such systems are limited to slow, full-frame operation. The video camera in the present system includes a charge-coupled-device (CCD) image detector plus electronic circuitry capable of implementing an advanced control scheme that effects readout from a small region of interest (ROI), or subwindow, of the full image. Inasmuch as the image features of interest (the cornea and pupil) typically occupy {{a small part of the}} camera frame, this ROI capability can be exploited to determine the direction of gaze at a high frame rate by reading out from the ROI that contains the cornea and pupil (but not from the rest of the image) repeatedly. One of the present algorithms exploits the ROI capability. The algorithm takes horizontal row slices and takes advantage of the symmetry of the pupil and cornea circles and of the gray-scale contrasts of the pupil and cornea with respect to other parts of the eye. The algorithm determines which horizontal image slices contain the pupil and cornea, and, on each valid slice, the end coordinates of the pupil and cornea. Information from multiple slices is then combined to robustly locate the centroids of the pupil and cornea images. The other of the two present algorithms is a modified version of an older algorithm for estimating the direction of gaze from the centroids of the pupil and cornea. The modification lies in the use of the coordinates of the centroids, rather than differences between the coordinates of the centroids, in a gaze-mapping equation. The equation locates a gaze point, defined as the intersection of the gaze axis with a surface of interest, which is typically a computer display screen (see figure). The expected advantage of the modification is to make the gaze computation less dependent on some simplifying assumptions that are sometimes not accurat...|$|E
40|$|A major {{challenge}} facing humanity is developing renewable source of energy. Following the biological blueprint {{of the natural}} photosynthesis is possible design synthetic systems for converting light into stored energy: the so called artificial antenna systems. The encapsulation of ordered chromophore molecules into one dimensional zeolite channel systems results in host-guest compounds suitable {{for the development of}} novel optical materials such as lenses, <b>infrared</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> (used in telecommunications) or dye nanostructured materials for optical data storage [1]. X-ray powder diffraction study of zeolite K-L loaded with 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2 fluorenone-dye (FL) molecules per unit cell (ZL/FL hybrid) [2], was carried out to understand the functionality of these host-guest systems from the structural point of view. These data evidenced a significant change of the unit cell parameters due to the embedding of FL into the ZL 12 -membered channels. The Rietveld refinements revealed that the maximum loading is 1. 5 FL molecules per unit cell. A strong interaction between FL carbonyl group and two extraframework potassium cations is proved by the short bond distances which make this composite very stable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dark current suppression technique {{for a light}} detector in a variable-temperature system. The light detector architecture comprises a photodiode for sensing the ambient light, a dark current diode for conducting dark current suppression, and a current subtractor that {{is embedded in the}} current amplifier with enhanced dark current cancellation. The measured dark current of the proposed light detector is lower than that of the epichlorohydrin photoresistor or cadmium sulphide photoresistor. This is advantageous in variable-temperature systems, especially for those with many <b>infrared</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes.</b> Experimental results indicate that the maximum dark current of the proposed current amplifier is approximately 135 nA at 125 °C, a near zero dark current is achieved at temperatures lower than 50 °C, and dark current and temperature exhibit an exponential relation at temperatures higher than 50 °C. The dark current of the proposed light detector is lower than 9. 23 nA and the linearity is approximately 1. 15 μA/lux at an external resistance RSS = 10 kΩ and environmental temperatures from 25 °C to 85 °C...|$|R
40|$|Yb 3 + doped LaSi 3 N 5 {{phosphors}} {{have been}} prepared by solid-state synthesis in a high temperature furnace directly coupled to a glove box. The charge transfer (CT) band of Yb 3 + in LaSi 3 N 5 was observed at an unusually low energy of 3. 1 eV. Excitation of this CT band results in f–f emission of Yb 3 + at 1. 2 eV, which could make Yb 3 + doped LaSi 3 N 5 suitable for application as a spectral conversion material for <b>infrared</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> or solar cells. Substitution of La 3 + by the smaller Y 3 + ion shifts the CT to higher energy (3. 9 eV). A clear relation between the CT energy and the Yb 3 + f–f emission intensity was found. With {{the help of a}} detailed energy level diagram that contains the position of the 4 f and 5 d levels of all divalent and trivalent ions with respect to the valence and conduction band, all hitherto observed luminescence properties of divalent and trivalent lanthanide dopants in LaSi 3 N 5 are reviewed and explained...|$|R
