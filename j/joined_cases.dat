5000|$|The {{provision}} {{underlying the}} four freedoms (and therefore also the Home Country Control) is {{the prohibition of}} discrimination based on nationality: Article 12(ex 6) of the EC Treaty. Over the course of years, this policy evolved to include prohibition on some behaviors that were non-discriminatory, {{based on the fact}} that their implementation created obstacles to trade between states. In the sphere of goods, what these “non-discriminatory” obstacles were and how they were to be removed was clarified in Cassis (C-120/78, 1979 ECR 649) and Keck (<b>Joined</b> <b>Cases</b> C-267 and 268/91, 1993 ECR I-6097) cases of the Court of Justice. In services, this was done in Säger (C-76/90, 1991 ECR I-4221), and in establishment in Gebhard (C-55/94, 1995 ECR I-4165). The power of these cases lies in making the products and services legally made in one state (Home State) available in other state (Host State), where the latter is only exceptionally able to apply its law to the said good or service.

5000|$|A MA in Switzerland {{was also}} {{considered}} {{as being a}} first MA for the calculation of the SPC duration, even though Switzerland {{is not part of}} the European Economic Area (EEA). This is because such a MA was automatically effective in Liechtenstein, which is a member of the EEA (since 1 May 1995). This was decided by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in <b>joined</b> <b>cases</b> Novartis et al. v. Comptroller-General and Ministère de l'Economie v. Millennium Pharmaceuticals. [...] The same point was also confirmed in case C-617/12 (AstraZeneca AB v Comptroller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks), in a case where the data that persuaded Swissmedic to grant the (earlier) Swiss MA was held by the European Medicines Agency to not be complete or persuasive enough to justify the grant of a MA under EU legislation (Directive 2001/83/EC).However, as answer to the decision of the ECJ the contract between Switzerland and Liechtenstein was amended. Since 1 July 2005 the automatic effect of a Swiss MA in Liechtenstein is abolished. The recognition is now delayed by a time period, which is normally 12 months.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>Joined</b> <b>Cases</b> E-3/13 and E-20/13 Fred Olsen, {{concerning}} {{the application of}} Norwegian CFC rules {{to the members of}} a family for whose benefit a trust had been established in Liechtenstein as a holding entity for shares in several companies, the Court held, first, that the right of establishment, provided for in Articles 31 to 34 EEA, is granted both to natural persons who are nationals of an EEA State and to legal entities (“companies or firms”), no matter whether they have legal personality or not, provided they have been formed in accordance with the law of an EU State or an EFTA State and have their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the territory of the Contracting Parties. Secondly, the Court also recognised that the prevention of tax avoidance may provide a justification, but only where the measures taken target wholly artificial arrangements which do not reflect economic reality. The assessment of the facts in that respect was a matter for the national court. Accordingly, such a tax measure must not be applied where it is proven, on the basis of objective factors which are ascertainable by third parties, that despite the existence of tax motives a CFC is actually established in the host EEA State and carries on genuine economic activities, which take effect (sc. somewhere) in the EEA.|$|E
