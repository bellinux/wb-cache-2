5|$|Planning of {{the park}} began in October 1997. Construction began in October 1998, and Millennium Park was opened in a {{ceremony}} on July 16, 2004, four years behind schedule. The three-day opening celebrations were attended by some 300,000 people and included an inaugural concert by the Grant Park Orchestra and Chorus. The park has received awards for its accessibility and <b>green</b> <b>design.</b> Millennium Park has free admission, and features the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, Cloud Gate, the Crown Fountain, the Lurie Garden, and various other attractions. The park is connected by the BP Pedestrian Bridge and the Nichols Bridgeway {{to other parts of}} Grant Park. Because the park sits atop a parking garage and the commuter rail Millennium Station, it is considered the world's largest rooftop garden.|$|E

40|$|<b>Green</b> {{property}} <b>design</b> {{has been}} increasingly popular {{in line with}} the promotion of sustainable development. While property design in traditional practice has contributed greatly to the improvement of living standards, the practice has been criticized for not incorporating principles of sustainable development in the property design process. This paper examines the applicability of various <b>green</b> property <b>design</b> technologies in developing cities with reference to the Chinese real estate industry. The study finds that various technologies have different degrees of applicability in different regions or cities. This understanding leads to analysis of strategies for choosing effective <b>green</b> property <b>design</b> technologies. A questionnaire survey, interviews, and four case studies are conducted. The authors observe that developers and consumers have a passion for <b>green</b> property <b>design.</b> The findings also suggest that currently <b>green</b> property <b>design</b> is primarily applied to high-class residential buildings. Limited application is found for normal residential properties...|$|R
25|$|Hearst Tower, {{located in}} Midtown Manhattan at 300 West 57th Street, {{is another example}} of the new breed of <b>green</b> <b>design</b> skyscrapers in New York City. Hearst Tower is a glass and steel {{construction}} skyscraper which rests on the base of the original 1920s Hearst Corporation Building. Hearst Tower is easily identified by the dramatic interlocking triangular glass panels designed by British architect Lord Norman Foster. Hearst Tower is also the first skyscraper in New York City to be awarded the coveted Gold LEED Certified rating by the United States Green Building Council.|$|E
25|$|Planning {{and design}} is {{currently}} underway for 500 and 700 North, ShelbyHurst's newest properties. With construction {{set to begin}} later this year, these properties will have between 100,000 and 130,000 square feet of Louisville's most prestigious office space. ShelbyHurst was designed around a four-lane boulevard through the campus bordered by bike lanes and wide attractive sidewalks. Special attention was given to enhancing green space and improving {{the life of the}} surrounding community. The <b>green</b> <b>design</b> of the entire development, combined with the convenience of a new boulevard and modern throughways, will facilitate driving, walking and biking through the campus.|$|E
25|$|The Condé Nast Building, officially Four Times Square, is {{a modern}} {{skyscraper}} in Times Square in Midtown Manhattan {{and one of the}} most important examples of <b>green</b> <b>design</b> in skyscrapers in the United States. Environmentally friendly gas-fired absorption chillers, along with a high-performing insulating and shading curtain wall, ensure that the building does not need to be heated or cooled for the majority of the year. Office furniture is made with biodegradable and non-toxic materials. The air-delivery system provides 50% more fresh air than is required by New York City Building Code, and a number of recycling chutes serve the entire building. Being the first project of its size to undertake these features in construction, the building has received an award from the American Institute of Architects, as well as AIA New York State.|$|E

25|$|The 1916 Zoning Resolution {{required}} setbacks in {{new buildings}} and restricted towers to {{a percentage of}} the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below. The Art Deco style of the Chrysler Building (1930) and Empire State Building (1931), with their tapered tops and steel spires, reflected the zoning requirements. The buildings have distinctive ornamentation, such as the eagles at the corners of the 61st floor on the Chrysler Building, and are considered some of the finest examples of the Art Deco style. A highly influential example of the international style in the United States is the Seagram Building (1957), distinctive for its façade using visible bronze-toned I-beams to evoke the building's structure. The Condé Nast Building (2000) is a prominent example of <b>green</b> <b>design</b> in American skyscrapers and has received an award from the American Institute of Architects and AIA New York State for its design.|$|E
25|$|Double cohort brought {{challenges}} to the teaching, study and residence spaces at the campus due to increase in first-year enrollment. In response, the Academic Research Centre (ARC) and Joan Foley Hall were constructed. The ARC was built in 2003 {{as an extension of}} the Bladen Building with a copper finish. It allowed for the relocation and expansion of the library to its present state and introduced the campus's first 300-seat lecture theatre, which has since held the Watts Lecture series, after formerly being held in the Meeting Place. The Doris McCarthy Gallery, also found in the ARC, exhibits works by Scarborough-born artist and campus alumni, Doris McCarthy. The Student Centre was opened in 2004 through a project that was initiated and funded by students. Constructed using 18 tonnes of recycled steel from a demolished gallery at the Royal Ontario Museum, the three-storey Student Centre earned a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification as well as a <b>Green</b> <b>Design</b> Award from the City of Toronto. The Social Sciences Building, home of the Department of Social Sciences, also opened in 2004 as the Management Wing but took its present name after the completion of the Instructional Centre in 2011, which became the new home of the Department of Management, the Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, and offices of cooperative education programs. Brick and limestone were used to create the Arts and Administration Building, completed in 2005, which holds the Office of the Registrar and the principal's office. The Science Research Building, where post-graduate research facilities and a lecture hall are located, is an extension of the Science Wing that was completed in 2008.|$|E

500|$|Construction {{of the new}} [...] Trade Center {{began in}} 2002, and was {{completed}} in 2006. The building is [...] tall (plus one underground floor), making it the 28th-tallest in New York. It is built on a smaller footprint than the original, allowing Greenwich Street to be restored from Tribeca through the World Trade Center site and south to Battery Park. The new building is bounded by Greenwich, Vesey, Washington, and Barclay streets. A small park across Greenwich Street occupies space {{that was part of}} the original building's footprint. The current building's design emphasizes safety, with a reinforced concrete core, wider stairways, and thicker fireproofing of steel columns. It also incorporates numerous <b>green</b> <b>design</b> features. The building was the first commercial office building in New York City to receive the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, where it won a gold rating. It was also one of the first projects accepted to be part of the Council's pilot program for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design – Core and Shell Development (LEED-CS).|$|E

2500|$|It was {{designed}} by the Edmonton firm of Manasc Isaac to be environmentally sustainable. Its central atrium has a curtain wall with photovoltaic cells, the largest such structure in Canada, and the second largest worldwide, {{at the time of}} the building's completion. Five percent of the building's electricity comes from that wall; it is used to heat water, some of which comes from the building's green roof and local groundwater, resulting in the building using half as much water as a comparably sized building. Heating efficiency is such that the building remains adequately warm during subzero winter days when many adjacent offices have to close. The building's <b>green</b> <b>design</b> reportedly saves CDN$80,000 in energy costs and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by [...] each year.|$|E
2500|$|A United States Permanent Resident Card (USCIS Form I-551), {{formerly}} known as Alien Registration Card or Alien Registration Receipt Card (INS Form I-151), is an identification card attesting to the permanent resident status of an alien in the United States.

2500|$|Publicly {{sponsored}} {{affordable housing}} projects use public funds or tax breaks {{in order to}} increase the stock of housing available to low income people. In addition, these projects often seek {{to improve the quality of}} the stock, in order to offer [...] "decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable living environments". [...] Green Affordable Housing projects add to those goals by lowering the lifetime cost of units and improving the quality. [...] The concept of the triple bottom line defines sustainability to include economics, social equity and the environment. Affordable housing already addresses economics and social equity. Sustainability measures obviously help the environment, but they can help the economics and social equity of housing projects as well. Housing units with a better design can improve health outcomes. With lower utility costs and improved health outcomes, the projects are more beneficial to low-income households, who are particularly exposed to poor housing quality and increases in general life costs, e.g. for utilities or medical expenses. Economically, sustainable design lowers the lifetime cost of a building. [...] Since the preservation of affordable housing is sensitive to public funding, making affordable housing greener is a logic step to reducing long-term costs and increasing stability. [...] <b>Green</b> <b>design</b> increases the economics, social equity, and environmental impact of affordable housing projects.|$|E
