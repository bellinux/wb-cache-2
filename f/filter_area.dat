50|$|Filter presses offer a {{wide range}} of application, one of its main propositions is the ability to provide a large <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> in a {{relatively}} small footmark. Surface area available {{is one of the most}} important dimensions in any filtering process, since it maximises filter flow rate and capacity. A standard size filter press offers a <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> of 216 m2, whereas a standard belt filter only offers approximately 15 m2.|$|E
50|$|The filter is {{assessed}} {{by the size of}} the drum or <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> and its possible output. Typically, the output is in the units of pounds per hour of dry solids per square foot of <b>filter</b> <b>area.</b> The size of the auxiliary parts depends on the area of the filter and the type of usage. Rotary vacuum filters are flexible in handling variety of materials therefore the estimated solids yield from 5 to 200 pounds per hour per square foot. For pre coat discharge, the solid output is approximately 2 to 40 gallons per hour per square foot.5Filtration efficiencies can also be improved in terms dryness of filter cake by significantly preventing filtrate liquid from getting stuck in the filter drum during filtration phase. Usage of multiple filters for example, running 3 filter units instead of 2 units yields a thicker cake hence, producing a clearer filtrate. This becomes beneficial in terms of production cost and also quality 6.|$|E

These units can be 'daisy-chained' together to collectively filter almost any size home pool. The cartridges are typically cleaned by removal from the filter body and hosing-off down a sewer connection. They are popular where backwashed water from a sand filter {{is not allowed to}} be discharged or goes into the aquifer.|$|E
40|$|Areal {{interpolation}} is a {{geospatial analysis}} method that allows researchers {{to estimate the}} incidence of a phenomenon in one set of areal units given data based on different areal units. One practice implemented in conjunction with areal interpolation is known as <b>filtered</b> <b>area</b> weighting, in which ancillary data is introduced to exclude specific areas from the areal units based on certain criteria, thus providing a more accurate representation of population distribution. This thesis examines the benefits that <b>filtered</b> <b>area</b> weighting can provide to population estimation using a hospital accessibility case study. The study shows that <b>filtered</b> <b>area</b> weighting does not always improve population estimation as expected, and suggests that the ancillary data and the criteria employed to exclude areas from analysis needs particular attention in future research when the <b>filtered</b> <b>area</b> weighting method is used...|$|R

40|$|The {{coexistence}} of Daphnia cucullata x galeata hybrids with the parental species D. galeata and D. cucullata was investigated by measuring areas and mesh sizes of filtering structures of these herbivorous zooplankton taxa cultivated at {{low and high}} food concentrations. The clearance rates and somatic growth rates were also determined. When reared at low food concentration, all taxa had larger <b>filtering</b> <b>areas.</b> Larger <b>filtering</b> <b>areas</b> also resulted in higher clearance rates. Differences between taxa in both <b>filtering</b> <b>area</b> and clearance rate were caused mainly by interspecific size differences. Hybrids had the largest absolute mesh sizes, and the parental species had smaller mesh sizes. Hybrids also showed heterosis in somatic growth rate at high food concentration. The observed taxon-specific differences in mesh size and somatic growth rate contribute to resource partitioning between the taxa and thus to their successful coexistence in lakes.

50|$|The {{flow rate}} {{is defined as}} the ratio of the driving force over the filter resistance. The two {{conventional}} types of depth filter designs: the rapid and slow filters operate with velocities of 5-15 m/h and 0.1-0.2 m/h respectively; whereas pressurised sand filters have design flow rates of 238 L/min14. During operation the filter rate decreases due to increasing filter resistance as particulates get lodged within the media. The rate of filtration affects the rate of clogging with high filter rates causing faster build up. Pilot tests demonstrate that the higher the filter rate the lower the <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> whilst increasing filter rate reduces the time to breakthrough, reduces the time to head loss (increases head loss) and results in shorter runs and lower optimum depths. They also demonstrate that higher filter rates can be achieved by using larger diameter media and increased media depth. High filtration rates depend on media design with the highest filtration rate design in service at 13.5gpm/ft2.|$|E
50|$|In {{stationary}} use, ceramic candles have mechanical, operational {{and manufacturing}} advantages over simple inserts and pots. Filter candle allows sturdy metal and plastic receptacles to be used, which decreases {{the likelihood of}} a sanitary failure. Since their <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> is independent {{of the size of the}} attachment joint, there is less leakage than other geometries of replaceable filter, and more-expensive, higher-quality gaskets can be used. Since they are protected by the upper receptacle, rather than forming it, they are less likely to be damaged in ordinary use. They are easier to sanitize, because the sanitary side is inside the candle. The nonsanitary part is outside, where it is easy to clean. They fit more types of receptacles and applications than simple pots, and attach to a simple hole in a receptacle. They also can be replaced without replacing the entire upper receptacle, and larger receptacles can simply use more filter candles, permitting filter manufacture to be standardized. If a filter in a multifilter receptacle is found to be broken, the filter hole can be plugged, and use can continue with fewer filters and a longer refill-time until a replacement can be obtained. Also, standardizing the filter makes it economical to keep one or a few filters on hand.|$|E
50|$|In March 2014, Neato Robotics {{released}} an expanded model dubbed BotVac developed over several years, {{with a side}} brush previously available only on the limited distribution Vorwerk Kobold models in Germany (see below). BotVacs were initially priced about 20 {{percent higher than the}} older XV models. The new model featured additional major changes re-arranging the internal construction with larger <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> and dust bin, for less frequent servicing and covering larger premises, and the battery compacted into a single compartment instead of two separate compartments in the older models. The main front brush was made longer and closer to the wall, with a new more closely fitting bump sensor construction. Along with the side brush this cleans the margin against walls much more closely than the older models, which left a two inch wide strip untouched. The longer brush covers a wider swath of floor on each pass and the unit runs much quieter. The casing was modernized with more snap-fit fastenings and fewer screws. Internal electronics were upgraded and refined, and new commercial embedded systems operating system used. The brush drive belt was covered by a cowling with a new mounting method. A major improvement in efficiency was made with a lower voltage 10-cell 12v battery but higher in Ampere-Hours capacity than the older 12-cell battery, reflecting advances in battery manufacture over years. The battery remains NiMh compared to the Lithium battery used in Germany (and avoiding all hazard concerns with Lithium Ion batteries). However, the new Botvac Connected has a lithium battery. The BotVac is sold in several packages differing in accessories included such as extra filters and different brush types, same as the previous XV models were packaged.|$|E

30|$|Filter {{material}} {{may therefore}} be modelled {{as a single}} homogeneous porous medium (which does not require fine CFD mesh resolution). Coefficients can be determined experimentally by placing a sample filter of known cross-sectional area and thickness in a constant section duct flow. For that given filter material, it is then possible to use CFD to find the optimum cross-sectional area, thickness and orientation to minimise the losses for the combined filter/duct geometry combination. Filter life {{can also be considered}} using this approach; local rate of fouling is related to local flow velocity. By maximising <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> and ensuring as uniform a flow velocity over the whole <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> as possible, filter maintenance intervals will be maximised.|$|E

Two optical sight lines exist parallel to the plasma grid, in the discharge area and in the magnetic <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> near the plasma grid. In the discharge area, the spectrum intensity from Cs+ ions is considerably increased during 20 s of the beam extraction.

A strong neutral Cs spectrum is observed in the magnetic <b>filter</b> <b>area,</b> where the electron density is lower than in the discharge area.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is presented {{for analysis of}} microplastics in environmental samples, based on selective fluorescent staining using Nile Red (NR), followed by density-based extraction and filtration.

Image-analysis allows fluorescent particles to be identified and counted. Magnified images can be recorded and tiled to cover the whole <b>filter</b> <b>area,</b> allowing particles down to a few micrometres to be detected. The solvatochromic nature of Nile Red also offers the possibility of plastic categorisation based on surface polarity characteristics of identified particles.

40|$|Filtration {{steps are}} {{ubiquitous}} in biotech processes {{due to the}} simplicity of operation, ease of scalability and the myriad of operations {{that they can be}} used for. Microfiltration, depth filtration, ultrafiltration and diafiltration {{are some of the most}} commonly used biotech unit operations. For clean feed streams, when fouling is minimal, scaling of these unit operations is performed linearly based on the <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> per unit volume of feed stream. However, for cases when considerable fouling occurs, such as the case of harvesting a therapeutic product expressed in Pichia pastoris, linear scaling may not be possible and current industrial practices involve use of 20 – 30 % excess <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> over and above the calculated <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> to account for the uncertainty in scaling. In view of the fact that filters used for harvest are likely to have a very limited lifetime, this oversizing of the filters can add considerable cost of goods for the manufacturer. Modeling offers a way out of this conundrum. In this paper, we examine feasibility of using the various proposed models for filtration of a therapeutic product expressed in Pichia pastoris at constant pressure. It is observed that none of the individual models yield a satisfactory fit of the data, thus indicating that more than one fouling mechanism is at work. Filters with smaller pores were found to undergo fouling via complete pore blocking followed by cake filtration. On the other hand, filters with larger pores were found to undergo fouling via intermediate pore blocking followed by cake filtration. The proposed approach can be used for more accurate sizing of microfilters and depth filters...|$|E

40|$|Filter strips are a widely-used {{practice}} {{for reducing the}} load of pollutants that leave agricultural fields in overland runoff. They are typically designed to intercept uniformly-distributed overland runoff with a constant width strip along a field margin. Non-uniform runoff flow, however, can reduce {{the effectiveness of a}} constant-width filter strip. In these situations, filter strip effectiveness can be improved by placing more <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> where the runoff load is greater and less where the load is smaller. To do this, quantitative relationships were developed between the pollutant trapping efficiency and the ratio of filter strip area to upslope contributing area, i. e., buffer area ratio, using the Vegetative Filter Strip Model VFSMOD. These relationships can be used to size each portion of a filter strip according {{to the size of the}} runoff load to that location. Terrain analysis and GIS are well-suited for automating this approach. Contributing area can be easily calculated for each portion of the field margin and, when coupled with additional information on soil and slope, an appropriate <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> can be determined for that portion. The process is repeated for each segment along the entire field margin and produces a variable-width filter strip that matches the non-uniform pattern of runoff load to that margin. This process is demonstrated on a 36 ha crop field in Shelby Co., Kentucky for which filter strips were designed to retain 95 % of the sediment in runoff. Field margins were divided into 4 m segments to match the grid resolution of the Digital Elevation Model. Maps were created that show the field and the associated filter strip design which facilitates field layout. This procedure can greatly improve the fit between filter size and runoff load and achieve greater water quality benefit per hectare of installation...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} in mechanical properties for aluminium casting alloys {{are in many}} casting processes not fully utilised. One reason is the defect formation in the casting process. The defects could be oxide films, introduced during mould filling, and pore formation. This investigation {{has been focused on}} how the gravity mould filling could be controlled by using filter in the ingate system and the how the pressure drop over the filter can be evaluated. In gravity casting the metal flow velocity usually reaches several metres per second. Direct observations have shown that filters improve mould filling during casting. Additionally, filters cause a pressure loss, which decreases the speed of the metal and gives a smoother filling. In this paper, mould-filling experiments were recorded directly by a video camera through a transparent ceramic glass. Two different types of ceramic filters, reticulated foam filters and extruded filters with 10, 20 and 30 pores per inch and 100 and 300 cells per square inch respectively, were investigated. The influence of active <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> and filter size on the flow reduction has also been investigated. As the casting temperature influences the viscosity of the liquid metal, the pressure loss over the filter was evaluated at various temperatures. Using parameters for calculating flow loss caused by filter can help when designing ingate systems containing filters. The filter parameters can be used in two ways, either to control the speed of the metal or to design the active <b>filter</b> <b>area</b> {{in a way that the}} melt flux is not affected. Proper parameters are also important for computer simulations of mould filling.
