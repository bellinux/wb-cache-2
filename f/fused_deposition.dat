25|$|Many, perhaps most, {{threaded}} parts {{have potential}} to be generated via additive manufacturing (3D printing), {{of which there are}} many variants, including <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> modeling, selective laser sintering, direct metal laser sintering, selective laser melting, electron beam melting, layered object manufacturing, and stereolithography. For most additive technologies, it has not been long since they emerged from the laboratory end of their historical development, but further commercialization is picking up speed. To date, most additive methods tend to produce a rough surface finish and tend to be restricted in the material properties that they can produce, and thus their earliest commercial victories have been in parts for which those restrictions were acceptable. However, the capabilities are continually growing.|$|E

Applying this method, porous Hydroxyapatite (Hap) ceramics, {{as well as the}} HAp-zirconia composites have been fabricated successfully. Porous hydroxyapatite (Hap) is expected to have desired mechanical and biological properties for biomedical applications. However, due to material processing problems, to date, this material can only be prepared by conventional techniques. <b>Fuse</b> <b>deposition</b> Machine is modified to fabricate Hap conventional support structure is not required three nozzle system is utilized for fabrication. Main nozzle is provided with heating arrangement. Two nozzles provided for transient Hap and solvent. Three stages heating with two lasers arrangement for gradual temperature change so transformation is faster. Primary result shows mechanical properties and porosity is as per bone structure. The micro structural characterizations such as phase purity and composition of porous BCP granules were performed and verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. The chemical and the microstructure information of the Fabricated Hap were investigated by FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infra-Red), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), X-ray Diffraction (XRD).

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of process parameters on shape stability and surface smoothness of cylindrical and rectangular castings produced by <b>fused</b> spinning <b>deposition</b> (FSD) method was investigated. The optimum conditions {{to control the}} shape and smoothness of side surface of the castings produced by the FSD method without water-cooling were limited to a narrow range of process parameters. The casting with a stable shape and a smooth side surface was obtained {{with the aid of}} water-cooling. The tensile strength of the castings produced by the FSD method was 1. 4 times higher than those of the specimens cast into metal-mold and sand-mold, due to a finer equiaxed grain structure of the FSD castings. Employing the combination of the deposition patterns for tube and solid castings, some practical metallic components were fabricated by the FSD method...|$|R
2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as <b>Fused</b> <b>deposition</b> modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Quantification of callose {{deposits}} is {{a useful}} measure for the activities of plant immunity and pathogen growth by fluorescence imaging. For robust scoring of differences, this normally requires many technical and biological replicates and manual or automated quantification of the callose deposits. However, previously available software tools for quantifying callose deposits from bioimages were limited, making batch processing of callose image data problematic. In particular, {{it is challenging to}} perform large-scale analysis on images with high background noise and <b>fused</b> callose <b>deposition</b> signals. RESULTS: We developed CalloseMeasurer, an easy-to-use application that quantifies callose deposition, a plant immune response triggered by potentially pathogenic microbes. Additionally, by tracking identified callose deposits between multiple images, the software can recognise patterns of how a given filamentous pathogen grows in plant leaves. The software has been evaluated with typical noisy experimental images and can be automatically executed without the need for user intervention. The automated analysis is achieved by using standard image analysis functions such as image enhancement, adaptive thresholding, and object segmentation, supplemented by several novel methods which filter background noise, split fused signals, perform edge-based detection, and construct networks and skeletons for extracting pathogen growth patterns. To efficiently batch process callose images, we implemented the algorithm in C/C++ within the AcapellaTM framework. Using the tool we can robustly score significant differences between different plant genotypes when activating the immune response. We also provide examples for measuring the in planta hyphal growth of filamentous pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: CalloseMeasurer is a new software solution for batch-processing large image data sets to quantify callose deposition in plants. We demonstrate its high accuracy and usefulness for two applications: 1) the quantification of callose deposition in different genotypes as a measure for the activity of plant immunity; and 2) the quantification and detection of spreading networks of callose deposition triggered by filamentous pathogens as a measure for growing pathogen hyphae. The software is an easy-to-use protocol which is executed within the Acapella software system without requiring any additional libraries.
