The doctors {{had not told}} Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a folic acid derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E

25|$|In late February 1854, Schumann's {{symptoms}} increased, the angelic visions sometimes {{being replaced}} by demonic visions. He warned Clara that he feared <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> her harm. On 27 February 1854, he attempted suicide by throwing himself from a bridge into the Rhine River (his elder sister Emilie had committed suicide in 1825, possibly by drowning herself). Rescued by boatmen and taken home, he asked {{to be taken to}} an asylum for the insane. He entered Dr. Franz Richarz's sanatorium in Endenich, a quarter of Bonn, and remained there until he died on 29 July 1856 at the age of 46. During his confinement, he was not allowed to see Clara, although Brahms was free to visit him. Clara finally visited him two days before his death. He appeared to recognize her, but was able to speak only a few words.|$|E
25|$|Bacha Khan {{was born}} on 6 February 1890 into a {{generally}} peaceful and prosperous Pashtun family from Utmanzai in the Peshawar Valley of British India. His father, Bahram Khan, was a land owner in the area {{commonly referred to as}} Hashtnaghar. Bacha Khan was the second son of Bahram to attend the British-run Edward's Mission School, the only fully functioning school in the region run by missionaries. At school the young Bacha Khan did well in his studies, and was inspired by his mentor Reverend Wigram to see the importance of education in service to the community. In his 10th and final year of high school, he was offered a highly prestigious commission in the Corps of Guides, a regiment of the British Indian Army. Bacha Khan refused the commission after realising that even Guides officers were still second-class citizens in their own country. He resumed his intention of university study, and Reverend Wigram offered him the opportunity to follow his brother, Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan, to study in London. An alumnus of Aligarh Muslim University, Bacha Khan eventually received the permission of his father. However, Bacha Khan's mother wasn't willing to let another son go to London, so Bacha Khan began working on his father's lands, attempting to discern what more <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> with his life.|$|E

500|$|The Narasimha-Sharabha legend {{is linked}} to gods {{assuming}} mythical animal forms to slay or subdue {{as the case may}} be. First, Vishnu assumed the form of Narasimha to slay Hiranyakashipu, an asura (demon) king, who was terrorizing the universe and devotee of Shiva. The Shiva Purana mentions: After slaying Hiranyakashipu, Narasimha’s wrath was not appeased. The world trembled, fearing what <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>do.</b> The Devas (the gods) requested Shiva to tackle Narasimha. Initially, Shiva brings forth Virabhadra, one of his terrifying forms, in order to calm Narasimha. When that failed, Shiva manifested as the human-lion-bird Sharabha. Shiva then assumed the Sharabha form. Sharabha then attacked Narasimha and seized him up until he was immobilized. He thus quelled Narasimha’s terrifying rage. Narasimha became a devotee of Shiva after being bound by Sharabha. Sharabha then decapitated and de-skinned Narasimha so Shiva could wear the hide and lion-head as a garment. The Linga Purana and Sharabha Upanishad also mention this mutilation and murder of Narasimha. After the mutilation, Vishnu assumed his normal form and retired to his abode, after duly praising Shiva. It was from here on that Shiva {{came to be known as}} [...] "Sharabeshamurti" [...] or [...] "Simhagnamurti".|$|E

She first appeared {{earlier in the}} second season, in the seventh episode, [...] "The Substitute". The role was devised for her by series co-creator Ryan Murphy, who suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing talent ahead of {{the release of the}} film Country Strong, in which Paltrow plays a country singer. Paltrow was signed to Glee for two episodes, with [...] "The Substitute" [...] originally intended to feature a love quadrangle between Holly, Will, Emma and Carl. Her initial arc was, however, reduced to a single episode. Post-broadcast, Murphy said they both hoped she would appear on Glee again in the future, depending on the right storyline. In January 2011, Paltrow confirmed that she would be reprising the role. Murphy stated that she would appear in episodes fifteen and sixteen as a sex education teacher, and would serve as a love interest for Will, though she actually appeared in episodes fifteen and seventeen. Stamos also reprised his role as Emma's husband Carl. As of March 2011, he was unsure whether he would return to Glee again, but stated that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> so to conclude Emma and Carl's storyline, explaining: [...] "I think people like me on there, but they really love Will and Emma together.

Two more chart appearances followed with [...] "Say It" [...] and [...] "Imagination", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit. His fourth chart appearance was [...] "I'll Never Smile Again", topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July.

As his success and popularity grew, Sinatra pushed Dorsey {{to allow him to}} record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded [...] "Night and Day", [...] "The Night We Called It a Day", [...] "The Song is You" [...] and [...] "Lamplighter's Serenade" [...] at a Bluebird recording session, with Axel Stordahl as arranger and conductor.

The Torchwood Series Two premiere sees Jack ask Ianto out on a date, after finding out Gwen is engaged. John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd opined {{in an interview at}} Comic-Con to fan questions that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him. John Barrowman {{said in an interview that}} Ianto [...] "brings out the [...] "human" [...] in [...] " [...] and [...] "brings out more ... empathy because he’s actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody ... makes him warm to other people ... makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto’s always made him care and that is really the heart of the show." [...] However, Stephen James Walker feels that Jack's relationship with Ianto is one-sided; Ianto seems to feel the relationship is [...] "serious and committed", but while dancing with Gwen in [...] "Something Borrowed", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a [...] "recreational activity", and considers it [...] "obvious Jack only has eyes and thoughts for Gwen". The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Ianto confides in Gwen that he knows that to Jack he is [...] "just a shag", though discloses that the relationship means more to him. In the same novel, however, he also refers to himself in front of Jack as his [...] "boyfriend". When Ianto expounds these same insecurities to Jack in the radio play [...] "The Dead Line" [...] (just prior to Children of Earth), however, Jack insists [...] "You will never be just a blip in time, Ianto Jones.

Regnare Christum volumus! We want Christ to reign!: these words aptly express his constant pastoral concern to spread among all men and women the call to share, through Christ, in the dignity of God's children.

John Henry Irons deactivates his niece Natasha's Steel armor after an argument about responsibility, then denies her pleas to be allowed to join the Everyman project.

Out of spite, she enrolls in the Everyman Project and becomes a member of Luthor's superhero team Infinity, Inc. [...] Irons learns that Luthor can deactivate Everyman Project-given abilities and that they expire naturally after approximately six months. Luthor negates the powers of one of Natasha's teammates during a battle with fatal results, and Irons uses the death of her friend to convince Natasha to question Luthor's motives. After Luthor, angered by reports that he is incompatible with the treatment, deactivates the powers {{of the majority of the}} Everyman subjects on New Year's Eve, resulting in many of them falling from the sky to their deaths, Natasha works undercover to expose Luthor. Luthor eventually learns the reports were falsified by employees out of fear for what <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> with genuine superpowers, and gives himself the powers of Superman. He discovers Natasha's spying and beats her violently using his newfound powers. Irons and the Teen Titans attack Lexcorp and bring Luthor to justice with Natasha's help.
