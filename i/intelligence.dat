Science and mathematics teachers can optimize the effect of teaching when they realized the strengths of multiple <b>intelligences</b> they posses {{and how they can}} apply them in their teaching. Thus, the primary objectives of this study are to investigate: 1) the multiple <b>intelligences</b> profile of science and mathematics secondary school teachers 2) the teaching strategies based on multiple <b>intelligences</b> that are applied by science and mathematics teachers and 3) the relationship between multiple <b>intelligences</b> profile of science and mathematics teachers with the teaching strategies based on multiple <b>intelligences</b> applied in the classroom. 174 respondents were chosen randomly from various secondary schools in peninsular Malaysia. Questionnaires were used to investigate the level of multiple <b>intelligences</b> and teaching strategies. Correlation analysis was applied to investigate the relationship between multiple <b>intelligences</b> and teaching strategies.

Test was used to get the students 2 ̆ 7 learning achievement data and questionnaire was used to get multiple <b>intelligences</b> data. The technique of analyzing the data was unbalanced two-ways Anova. The result of the research are as follows (1) Cooperative learning model TAI provides better mathematics achievement than the conventional model of learning and PBL, PBL learning model produces better performance over the conventional learning. (2) Multiple <b>intelligences</b> with mathematics logic types provide better math achievement than other types of multiple <b>intelligences</b> linguistic and interpersonal, the type of multiple <b>intelligences</b> linguistic providing academic achievement as well as the type of multiple <b>intelligences</b> interpersonal.
