50|$|The hero props seen in {{the film}} were {{constructed}} by Shawcraft Engineering while the Daleks with <b>integrally</b> <b>moulded</b> shoulder collars, which were mainly used to make up numbers in crowd scenes, were produced by the Plaster Workshops at Shepperton Studios.|$|E
50|$|Three minor Dalek {{variants}} {{appear in}} the film. Some Daleks are fitted with a two-jawed mechanical claw instead of a plunger, some have <b>integrally</b> <b>moulded</b> collars with reversed angles on the front edges and one is seen with a cutting torch instead of a telescopic arm.|$|E
50|$|The Imperial Dalek {{shares a}} skirt design with the Necros Dalek. In other respects it {{features}} many differences {{when compared with}} previous variants. It has a stepped fender incorporating a recessed bottom section and <b>integrally</b> <b>moulded</b> collars and slats with no shoulder mesh. There are circular bosses around the appendage ball joints, a hexagonal panel on the chest area, a re-modelled eye and eye discs, a mirrored eye lens with a small gold pupil, flush dome lights and a notched, funnel-like appendage instead of a plunger. The dome has a slightly larger diameter with a sharper angle where the bevelled section meets the curved upper part. The neck bin has a mirrored gold finish and is detailed with a fine circular-section gold mesh overlay, replacing the usual diamond section design. The props are painted predominantly light cream with gold hemisphere, slats, arm, 'plunger', gun, eye discs and light covers.|$|E
5000|$|Belial is {{designed}} by Masayuki Goto and Akira Okabe, {{who used a}} shark as his motif basis. As for his movements, this was instructed by the director Koichi Sakamoto. Belial's suit was simultaneously made with Ultraman Zero, based on wetsuits with the materials shaped in a three-dimensional appearance. As a result, his body pattern is three-dimensional instead of coloured. The element of wire fu is also included in Belial's actions, and thus two wires were used: up and action. Although the mask was originally <b>moulded</b> <b>integrally</b> with the head, Belial and Zero were structured out of plane. In the original plan, the mask {{was supposed to have}} a mouth-opening mechanism but this was removed to better fit the suit actor. In hopes of emphasiving the concept of [...] "evil Ultraman", his body posture and neck hunch forward.|$|R
50|$|The Zuni {{was built}} using glass-fibre/epoxy resin {{composite}} materials, with {{particular attention to}} achieving laminar flow. Using the classic pod and boom layout developed by the German glider manufacturers, the Zuni uses a modified Wortmann 67 series aerofoil section in a relatively thin double taper wing, (19% at the root to relieve bending moments, rapidly thinning to 15% 0.9m outboard, 14% at the taper intersection and 13% at the tip) which is high set on the fuselage with 1o dihedral, (reducing drag from interference of the wing fuselage junction). The <b>integrally</b> <b>moulded</b> fin supports the slightly swept all-moving T-tail, with a small degree of reflex camber and a partially mass-balanced rudder.The mono-wheel main undercarriage is manually retractable and a faired tailskid supports the rear fuselage on the ground. Water ballast is carried in integral tanks housed inside the leading edges of the wings, holding 219.8 litre (58 gal) 220 kg (484 lb). Conventional control surfaces were fitted, with pitch and roll controlled by a sidestick, and rudder by pedals. The entire trailing edge consists of flaps inboard, out to about â…” span with ailerons outboard which also drooped when the flaps were deployed.|$|E

Submitted in partial fulfilment {{of the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Integrally</b> <b>moulded</b> hinges and tension bands are important features in packaging components for plastic closures and their function is critically dependent on the flow induced micromorphology in the hinge section. Polymer characteristics and processing of the hinge also have an influence on the hinge properties obtained. This study is aimed at obtaining interrelationships between polymer characteristics, in-cavity flow, microstructure development and hinge properties, to produce hinges with enhanced functional properties. Three different virgin polypropylene (PP) grades were investigated (homopolymer PP-H, random copolymer PP-RC and impact copolymer PP-IC) and injection moulding simulation was carried out using Moldflow software. In-cavity data acquisition {{has been carried out}} for different sets of injection moulding conditions, using high performance transducers and a data acquisition system. A comparison between Moldflow simulation and practical injection moulding data suggests that, for thin wall injection moulded components the real time pressure data are in close agreement during the injection stage. During the packing stage there is some disagreement between these data, since the thickness of hinge and tension band sections are 0. 4 mm and 0. 5 mm respectively, suggesting that these dimensions are extending the capability of the software. An extensive study using a design of experiments (DoE) approach was carried out on both practical and predictive data. Injection velocity and melt temperature were the most influential factors on the component mechanical properties. From the optical micrographs it is observed that PP-RC has a finer micro-structure compared to PP-H and PP-IC and some micrographs confirm Moldflow simulation results in which hesitation effects are evident, as the flow converges into the thin hinge and tension band sections. PP-clay nanocomposites (PP-CN) were prepared using a twin screw compounder. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has shown some evidence of dispersion and exfoliation of the clay particles in the PP matrix. However, X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show a reduction in inter-layer spacing of PPCN s possibly due to clay compaction. The addition of nano-clay however has not resulted in any significant improvements in the mechanical properties of hinges and tension bands. The high degree of molecular orientation induced in the hinge and tension-band sections appears to mask any improvements attributed to the addition of nano-clay. From the reprocessed and post consumer recyclate (PCR) study conducted on hinges and tension bands, it is seen that with an increase in both the re-processing and PCR content there is a decrease in the component strength of around 14...|$|E
