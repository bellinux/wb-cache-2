60|$|And because Observations {{may be much}} easier, {{and more}} {{accurately}} made with good Telescopes, then with any other Instruments, it will not, I suppose, seem impertinent to explain a little what wayes I judge most fit and convenient for that particular. Such therefore as shall be the Observators for this purpose, should be furnished with the best Telescopes that can be had, {{the longer the better}} and more exact will their Observations be, though they are somewhat the more difficultly manag'd. These should be fitted with a Rete, or <b>divided</b> <b>Scale,</b> plac'd at such a distance within the Eye-glass, that they may be distinctly seen, which should be the measures of minutes and seconds; by this Instrument each Observator should, at certain prefixt times, observe the Moon, or other Planet, in, or very near, the Meridian; and because it may be very difficult to find two convenient stations that will happen to be just under the same Meridian, they shall, each of them, observe the way of the Planet, both for an hour before, and an hour after, it arrive at the Meridian; and by a line, or stroke, amongst the small fixed Stars, they shall denote out the way that each of them observ'd the Center of the Planet to be mov'd in for those two hours: These Observations each of them shall repeat for many dayes together, that both it may happen, that both of them may sometimes make their Observations together, and that from divers Experiments we may be the better assured of what certainty and exactness such kind of Observations are like to prove. And because many of the Stars which may happen to come within the compass of such an Iconism, or Map, may be such as are only visible through a good Telescope, whose Positions perhaps have not been noted, nor their longitudes, or latitudes, any where remarked; therefore each Observator should indeavour to insert some fixt Star, whose longitude, and latitude, is known; or with his Telescope he shall find the Position of some notable telescopical Star, inserted in his Map, to some known fixt Star, whose place in the Zodiack is well defin'd.|$|E

The gesture recognising sensor is connected to the microcontroller through one Bluetooth module and the microcontroller and mobile device is connected to the other Bluetooth module. Making use of the gesture recognition framework mobile device can make a call, receive a call, send a text message and receive and send a text mail. The recognition of the gesture is done in three axial (x, y, z) manner. For sensing, two potential technology are used which are surface Electromyography (SEMG) and Accelerometer sensor. In this paper, proposed a three axis accelerometer are being increasingly embedded into many personal electronic devices like the Apple i-phone, Apple i-pod touch, Apple i-pad and Lenovo laptop.

50|$|There are {{two main}} {{families}} of tuning systems: equal temperament and just tuning. Equal temperament scales are built by dividing an octave into intervals which are equal on a logarithmic scale, which results in perfectly evenly <b>divided</b> <b>scales,</b> but with ratios of frequencies which are irrational numbers. Just scales are built by multiplying frequencies by rational numbers, which results in simple ratios between frequencies, but with scale divisions that are uneven.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The two-scale model (TSM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} fre-quently {{employed}} approaches in scattering from multiscale sur-faces such as ocean surfaces. It consists of combining geometrical optics (GO) with the small-perturbation model (SPM) to be able to cope with both the small- and large-scale components of the surface. However, well-known shortcomings of this method are the arbitrariness of the <b>dividing</b> <b>scale</b> and the sensitivity of the scattering cross section to the choice of this parameter. We propose to replace SPM with the first-order small-slope approximation (SSA 1) to treat the small-scale roughness and derive the formulas for the corresponding TSM, referred to as GO-SSA. We show that GO-SSA is robust to the choice of the frequency cutoff and give a numerical illustration for the sea surface. Index Terms—Ocean scattering, small slope approximation (SSA), two-scale model (TSM). I...|$|R

50|$|Almost all guitars have frets, {{which are}} metal strips (usually nickel alloy or {{stainless}} steel) embedded along the fretboard and located at exact points that <b>divide</b> the <b>scale</b> length {{in accordance with}} a specific mathematical formula. The exceptions include fretless bass guitars and very rare fretless guitars. Pressing a string against a fret determines the strings' vibrating length and therefore its resultant pitch. The pitch of each consecutive fret is defined at a half-step interval on the chromatic scale. Standard classical guitars have 19 frets and electric guitars between 21 and 24 frets, although guitars have been made {{with as many as}} 27 frets. Frets are laid out to accomplish an equal tempered division of the octave. Each set of twelve frets represents an octave. The twelfth fret <b>divides</b> the <b>scale</b> length exactly into two halves, and the 24th fret position divides one of those halves in half again.|$|R
