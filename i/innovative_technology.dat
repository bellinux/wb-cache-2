40|$|AbstractThe {{discipline}} of human-computer interaction (HCI) has been vital in developing understandings of users, usability, {{and the design}} of user-centered computer systems. However, it {{does not provide a}} satisfactory explanation of user perspectives on the specialized but important domain of <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies,</b> instead focusing more on mature technologies. In particular, the success of <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> requires attention to be focused on early adopters of the technology and enthusiasts, rather than general end-users. Therefore, user acceptance should be considered more important than usability and convenience. At present, {{little is known about the}} ways in which <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> are evaluated from the point of view of user acceptance. In this paper, we propose Acceptability Engineering as an academic discipline through which theories and methods for the design of acceptable <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> can be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the article}}. The {{aim of the}} article is to define and to {{estimate}} the forming of expediency of the development strategy of financial and <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> {{in the context of}} modern economic space realities. The results of the analysis. The growing importance of the financial sector in the contemporary economic space, as well as rapid changes in it, generates a need for financial <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies.</b> Development strategy of financial and <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> is always associated with {{the current state of the}} financial system, its existent technical, technological and financial base. Therefore, the strategy of financial and <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> will be considered the system of long-term goals and means of achieving them, implemented in the financial activity. Financial <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> strategy includes two aspects: 1) management of the introduction of technical and technological innovations; 2) the process of constant changes in the financial sector according to the environment change. Thus, theessence of the development strategy of financial <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> is to target business entities (including banks) to application new and more efficient technologies, services and organizational structures. In other words, to put the problem of profitability, flexibility and adaptability increasing in the financial market. The development expediency of the financial and <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> is determined by such criteria: concordance with the amount of capital that can be directed to the financial activity; efficiency or concordance of the results and the real costs of achieving them; distinctness in terms of achieving the aim; the optimal combination of expected achievement the necessary profitability and possible risks and uncertainty in the future period; concordance of planned financial technologies with general economic conditions of the environment. Choosing the basic strategy of financial <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> should be conducted on a competition model of M. Porter, which intends to provide price leading strategy, differentiation strategy and concentration strategy. At the same time, the general strategy can be represented as a set of strategic and tactical development plans of financial <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies.</b> To implement the development strategy of financial <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> into practice it is necessary to create special group of innovation introduction. Its main aim is to provide the plan of innovations and its main functions consist of the following:development and formation mechanism of implementation the financial <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies,</b> taking into account general aspects of financial planning;organization of operational implementation groups of separate financial innovative solutions and coordination of their work;encouragement liaison with independent experts and consultants to assess the implementation of innovative financial solutions;collecting and providing of objective information on the implementation of financial and <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> to specialists and management. Conclusions and directions of further researches. An innovative type of financial development is formed in Ukraine today. The financial system is under constant change and evolution. Financial <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> significantly effect on fluctuations of these processes. Application development strategy of financial <b>innovative</b> <b>technologies</b> will promote the improvement of general financial management for all economic subjects and broaden financial space of the country as a whole, as well as accelerate the introduction of new financial, informational and telecommunication technologies. However, based on the fact that economic subjects have not identical conditions of development, it is advisable to clarify the introduction sequence of new financial technologies, in other words identification of separate functional strategies of their promotion...|$|R

25|$|Venture capitalists are {{typically}} very selective in {{deciding what to}} invest in; as a result, firms {{are looking for the}} extremely rare yet sought-after qualities such as <b>innovative</b> <b>technology,</b> potential for rapid growth, a well-developed business model, and an impressive management team. Of these qualities, funds are most interested in ventures with exceptionally high growth potential, as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame (typically 3–7 years) that venture capitalists expect.|$|E

Venture capital firms or funds invest in these early-stage companies in exchange for equity, or an ownership stake, in the companies they invest in. Venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky start-ups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful. The start-ups are usually based on an <b>innovative</b> <b>technology</b> or business model and they are usually from the high technology industries, such as information technology (IT), clean technology or biotechnology.|$|E

25|$|That the {{bodywork}} enclosing all of Chapman's <b>innovative</b> <b>technology</b> {{was similar}} in appearance to the Vanwall Grand Prix cars was no accident, as both cars had been sculpted by pioneer automotive aerodynamacist Frank Costin. As {{with many of}} Lotus's competition cars, the aluminium used to construct the bodywork was extremely thin and offered {{little in the way}} of support for the underlying chassis members. The car was extremely low and compact, with the bonnet barely reaching the same height as the tops of the front wheels, despite the smaller diameters used from the 1959 season onward. The driver sat in a slightly reclined position — nowhere near as extremely inclined as Chapman would later inflict upon his pilots but still unusual for its day — and behind the driver rose a stubby rear fin, incorporating the fuel tank.|$|E
25|$|The lion’s {{share of}} {{government}} expenditure on R goes to universities, {{as in most}} countries. This level of spending increased slightly from 58% to 61% of total government funding of R between 2008 and 2012. Among specific sectors, agriculture comes next, in {{a reflection of the}} sector’s relevance for Brazil, the second-largest foodproducing country in the world after the USA. Brazilian agricultural productivity has risen constantly since the 1970s, due to the greater use of <b>innovative</b> <b>technology</b> and processes. Industrial R comes third, followed by health and infrastructure, other sectors having shares of 1% or lower of government expenditure. With some exceptions, the distribution of government spending on R in 2012 is similar to that in 2000. After a sharp increase in industrial technology from 1.4% to 6.8% between 2000 and 2008, its share of government expenditure declined to 5.9% in 2012. The share of space science and technology (civilian) has been pursuing a downward spiral from a high of 2.3% in 2000. Defence research spending had been curtailed from 1.6% to 0.6% between 2000 and 2008 but has since rebounded to 1.0%. Research into energy has also declined from 2.1% (2000) to just 0.3% (2012). Overall, though, the allocation of government R spending seems to be relatively stable.|$|E
