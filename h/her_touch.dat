5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. As the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned <b>her</b> <b>touch</b> was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E
25|$|Catherine {{was then}} scourged and imprisoned, {{during which time}} over 200 people came to see her, {{including}} Maxentius' wife, Valeria Maximilla; all converted to Christianity and were subsequently martyred. Upon the failure of Maxentius to make Catherine yield by way of torture, he tried to win the beautiful and wise princess over by proposing marriage. The saint refused, declaring that her spouse was Jesus Christ, to whom she had consecrated her virginity. The furious emperor condemned Catherine to death on a spiked breaking wheel, but, at <b>her</b> <b>touch,</b> it shattered. Maxentius finally had her beheaded.|$|E
25|$|One day, Nettie arrives, {{explaining}} {{that she is}} tired of Alphonso's lecherous attentions and asking if she can stay. Mister agrees, but later attacks Nettie while she is walking to school. She fights back, prompting Mister to kick her out. Celie protests, but Mister swears they will never see each other again. As she leaves Mister's property, Nettie promises to write to Celie.

As an adult in Bete Noire, Shadow Boxer acts as Doctor Juris's main enforcer. He is also Black Mariah's lover, as <b>her</b> <b>touch</b> does not harm him.

500|$|Over {{half the}} poems in Shaker focus on love and doomed relationships. [...] In [...] "The Lie", for example, the speaker feels {{compelled}} to use deception to protect herself from her lover's abandonment. [...] In the brief poem [...] "Prelude to a Parting", the speaker instinctively senses the inevitable and implicit end of her relationship, especially when her lover draws away from <b>her</b> <b>touch.</b> [...] Not all the love poems in the volume focus on dishonesty or deception, but most, such as the title poem [...] "Shaker, Why Don't You Sing?", describe the inevitable loss of love.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} interpretations of the pose held by Dakshinakaali, {{including those of the}} 18th and 19th century bhakti poet-devotees such as Ramprasad Sen. Most have to do with battle imagery and tantric metaphysics. The most popular however is a devotional view. According to Rachel Fell McDermott, the poets portrayed Siva as [...] "the devotee who falls at [...] feet in devotion, or in surrender of his ego, or in hopes of gaining moksha by <b>her</b> <b>touch.</b> In fact, Siva is said to have become so enchanted by Kaali that he performed austerities to win her, and having received the treasure of her feet, held them against his heart in reverence.|$|E

5000|$|In Cantonese, the {{character}} [...] "麼", pronounced , {{has the same}} pronunciation as {{the character}} [...] "摸", which means [...] "to touch."

500|$|In 2008, rumours arose {{that she}} would retire, and be {{replaced}} by French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld. An editor at Russian GQ reportedly introduced Russian Vogue editor Aliona Doletskaya as the next editor of American Vogue. Condé Nast responded by taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times defending her record. In that same publication, Cathy Horyn later wrote that while Wintour hadn't lost <b>her</b> <b>touch,</b> the magazine had become [...] "stale and predictable," [...] as a reader had recently complained. [...] "To read Vogue {{in recent years is}} to wonder about the peculiar fascination for the 'villa in Tuscany' story," [...] Horyn added. The magazine also dealt awkwardly with the recession, she commented.|$|E
500|$|That {{year was}} {{generally}} difficult, {{as the economy}} worsened. After ruffling feathers at the Milan shows in February, the April issue's cover image of LeBron James and Gisele Bündchen brought criticism for its evocation of racial stereotypes. The next month a lavish Karl Lagerfeld gown she wore to the Met's Costume Institute Gala was called [...] "the worst fashion faux pas of 2008." [...] In the fall, Vogue Living was suspended indefinitely, and Men's Vogue cut back to two issues a year as an outsert or supplement to the women's magazine. At {{the end of the}} year, December's cover highlighted a disparaging comment Jennifer Aniston made about Angelina Jolie, to the former's displeasure; media observers began speculating that Wintour had lost <b>her</b> <b>touch.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Maurice Richardson in the 10 November 1940 {{issue of}} The Observer started, [...] "The Queen of Crime's scheming {{ingenuity}} {{has been so}} much praised that one is sometimes inclined to overlook the lightness of <b>her</b> <b>touch.</b> If Mrs Christie were to write about the murder of a telephone directory by a time-table the story would still be compellingly readable." [...] He did admit that the [...] "iend's identity is perhaps less obscured than usual; motivation a trifle shaky, but clue details are brilliant." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clinton's {{background}} as an elected politician showed in <b>her</b> <b>touch</b> {{for dealing with}} people, in remembering personal connections, in visiting State Department staff when overseas, and in sympathizing with the dilemmas of elected foreign leaders. At least until the Benghazi matter, she retained personal support {{among a number of}} Republicans; in mid-2012, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said, [...] "I think she's represented our nation well.

2500|$|... "The doe-eyed {{girl next}} door {{is proving to be}} quite a {{versatile}} performer, with a decidedly vampish performance in the movie Chicago and new imaging that redresses Mýa as a sexy and certain young woman. The first single from forthcoming Moodring [...] is a playfully coy call to arms for the singer's more tactile attributes, from her love, her kiss, and <b>her</b> <b>touch</b> to her sex, ass, and body—all of which 'are like wo.' Get it? An appropriately hip-swaying beat swirls around the vocal, courtesy of ever-hitworthy producer Missy Elliott. This is the record that will propel Mýa to the A-list among today's pop/R icons; throughout the song, she delivers womanly strength and sass with a knowing wink. Moodring sounds like a perfect fit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Artpop was {{included}} in several year-end lists by music critics and publications. In their list of the [...] "15 Best Albums of 2013", Billboard ranked it at 14th place, stating that it [...] is the statement of a singer-songwriter {{who wants to be}} more than a pop artist" [...] who [...] "hasn't lost <b>her</b> <b>touch</b> for creating otherworldly hooks." [...] Digital Spy similarly included Artpop in their [...] "30 Best Albums of 2013" [...] list at the 21st place. Popjustice ranked the album at sixth place on their [...] "Top 33 Albums of 2013" [...] list, claiming that it was [...] "amazing", while Entertainmentwise included it in their unranked round-up of the top ten albums of the year, calling Artpop [...] "original and innovative". Christgau named Artpop the sixth best album of 2013 in his year-end list, writing in an accompanying essay for The Barnes & Noble Review, [...] "since unlike the young I'm never bombarded by EDM synths at medically inadvisable volumes, this was not only the [...] album of the year for me, it sounded fresh.
