Foreign fees, surcharges and the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> are endogenously determined. We find that, when the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> is cooperatively fixed by banks to maximize joint profits, surcharges should be allowed, as they neutralize the collusive effect of the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee.</b> As a consequence, ATM deployment is higher and retail prices lower than without surcharges, increasing consumer surplus and social welfare.

40|$|We analyse a card {{payment system}} {{to assess the}} {{economic}} impact of the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee.</b> This fee is paid by the bank of the merchant, the acquirer, to the bank of the consumer, the issuer. We build up a mode in order to explore whether the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> can enhance the participation to the system and thus increase the benefits of the system as a whole. We also investigate what kind of incentives the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> provides to the actors of the system. We show that the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> selected by the card associations differs from the one that would be selected by a welfare maximising social planner. Moreover the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> selected by the market is likely to produce a smaller market for cards than the socially optimal one. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} two controversial {{features of}} the credit card industry. The first is the cooperative determination of the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> by member banks in credit card associations (Visa and MasterCard). The <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> is the ``access charge'' paid by the merchants' banks, the acquirers, to cardholders' banks, the issuers. The second practice is the prohibition for merchants accepting a card from charging different prices depending on the payment method (the no-discrimination or no-cash-discount rule). We analyze these practices in a frawework in which banks and merchants may have market power and consumers and merchants decide rationally on whether to buy or accept a credit card. Under the no-cash-discount rule, {{an increase in the}} <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> increases the usage of credit cards, as long as the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> does not exceed a threshold level at which merchants no longer accept credit cards. At this threshold level, the net cost for merchants of accepting the card is equal to the average cardholder benefit. The <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> selected by the credit card association either is socially optimal or leads to an overprovision of credit card services. Last, if the no-cash-discount rule is lifted, the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> no longer impacts the level of credit card services. The merchant price for cardholders is increased and that for noncardholders decreased. Credit cards services are reduced by merchant price discrimination regardless of whether the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> is set by the credit card association or by a social planner. association; credit cards; Discrimination; <b>interchange</b> <b>fee...</b>|$|R
25|$|Merchants that accept {{credit cards}} must pay <b>interchange</b> <b>fees</b> and {{discount}} fees on all credit-card transactions. In some cases merchants are barred by their credit agreements from passing these fees directly to credit card customers, or from setting a minimum transaction amount (no longer prohibited in the United States, United Kingdom or Australia). The {{result is that}} merchants are induced to charge all customers (including {{those who do not}} use credit cards) higher prices to cover the fees on credit card transactions. The inducement can be strong because the merchant's fee is a percentage of the sale price, which has a disproportionate effect on the profitability of businesses that have predominantly credit card transactions, unless compensated for by raising prices generally. In the United States in 2008 credit card companies collected a total of $48 billion in <b>interchange</b> <b>fees,</b> or an average of $427 per family, with an average fee rate of about 2% per transaction.|$|E
25|$|Plaintiffs {{allege that}} Visa, MasterCard, and major credit card issuers {{engaged in a}} {{conspiracy}} to fix <b>interchange</b> <b>fees,</b> also known as swipe fees, that are charged to merchants {{for the privilege of}} accepting payment cards at artificially high levels. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lower-cost cards, cash, and checks.|$|E

Other forms of payment accepted at Canadian, United Kingdom, and U.S. Costco locations included cash, Costco Cash Cards, Costco credit cards, checks, EBT cards (both cash and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits), and PIN-based debit cards (Interac in Canada).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} competition between cash and cards, with the card scheme based on the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee.</b> Merchants compete to attract consumers and, unlike previous papers, they compete on a Salop set-up so to emphasize {{the role played by}} network externalities. We find that for some levels of the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> incomplete card acceptance by merchants is an equilibrium, while when the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> is too large merchants opt out of card acceptance. However, if opting out is not a costless option there exists a stable “lock-in equilibrium ” in which merchants get locked into card acceptance. This happens when buyers face some cost for switching back to cash, which in turn has crucial implications on the level of the privately set <b>interchange</b> <b>fee...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia {{required}} that <b>interchange</b> <b>fees</b> be dramatically reduced, from about 0.95% {{of the transaction}} to approximately 0.5%. One notable result has been the reduced use of reward cards and increased use of debit cards. Australia also prohibited the [...] "no surcharge" [...] rule, a policy established by credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder. A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by a merchant, but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the card as the method of payment.

40|$|We {{consider}} whether banks {{should be allowed}} to set different ATM prices to their customers depending on whether they hold an account on the bank. In Massoud and Bernhardt (2002), without considering an <b>interchange</b> <b>fee,</b> a ban on price discrimination on ATM services increases total surplus. In the present model that considers an <b>interchange</b> <b>fee,</b> the effect of a ban on price discrimination depends on the way the interchange is fixed. If it is fixed to maximize the profits of banks, forbidding price discrimination reduces total surplus. However, if the interchange is fixed to maximize total surplus, banning price discrimination increases total surplus.

50|$|Regulators {{in several}} {{countries}} have questioned the collective determination of interchange rates and fees as potential examples of price-fixing.

5000|$|<b>Interchange</b> <b>fee</b> is a {{term used}} in the payment card {{industry}} to describe a fee paid between banks for the acceptance of card based transactions.

Findings: The approach of the scientific literature pays attention to costs and benefits, its equilibrium, also talking about social utility and social welfare the author is missing the whole impact on end consumer welfare and satisfaction. The dilemma is even more complicated due to the fact that the end consumer does not know he or she is not maximizing his or her utility, apart from the merchant, who is under pressure of margin squeeze.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} a card payment system as a two-sided market that allows for partial participation by heterogeneous consumers and merchants. Taking into account the strategic effects arising from competition between merchants, the model is used to characterize the optimal structure of fees between those charged to cardholders and those charged to merchants and, more specifically, the level of the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> that banks charge each other. The results modify the existing characterizations of the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee,</b> and explain the source of potential deviations between the privately and socially optimal level of the fee.

To accomplish this, three scenarios are analyzed: firstly, a unitary payment card network with merchants under Cournot quantity competition and, secondly, under Bertrand price competition respectively, as well as, thirdly, a multi-party payment card network with merchants under Cournot quantity competition. This study yields two significant results. Firstly, the merchant and the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> are found decreasing in the consumer price elasticity, the level of product substitutability and the relative frequency of card usage. Secondly, regulating the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> and the merchant fee respectively is found particularly useful since, in markets with less competition where consumers already face inefficiently high prices, the payment card fees will {{also tend to be}} higher. zugl.
