5|$|Ambler's Texaco Gas Station, {{also known}} as Becker's Marathon Gas Station, is a {{historic}} filling station located {{at the intersection of}} Old U.S. Route 66 and Illinois Route 17 in the village of Dwight, Illinois, United States. The station has been identified as the longest operating gas station along Route 66; it dispensed fuel for 66 continuous years until 1999. The station <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a domestic style gas station and derives its most common names from ownership stints by two different men. North of the station is an extant outbuilding that once operated as a commercial icehouse. Ambler's was the subject of major restoration work from 20052007, and reopened as a Route 66 visitor's center in May 2007. It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Barton Academy is a {{historic}} Greek Revival school building and local landmark on Government Street. The Bishop Portier House and the Carlen House {{are two of the}} many surviving examples of Creole cottages in the city. The Mobile City Hospital and the United States Marine Hospital are both restored Greek Revival hospital buildings that predate the Civil War. The Washington Firehouse No. 5 is a Greek Revival fire station, built in 1851. The Hunter House {{is an example of the}} Italianate style and was built by a successful 19th-century African American businesswoman. The Shepard House <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the Queen Anne style. The Scottish Rite Temple is the only surviving example of Egyptian Revival architecture in the city. The Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Passenger Terminal is an example of the Mission Revival style.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{large degree}} of {{variation}} in the size and exact shape of the castles built in England and Wales after the invasion. One popular form of castle was the motte and bailey, in which earth would be piled up into a mound (called a motte) to support a wooden tower, and a wider enclosed area built alongside it (called a bailey); Stafford Castle is a typical example of a post-invasion motte castle. Another widespread design was the ringwork in which earth would be built up in a circular or oval shape and topped with a wooden rampart; Folkestone Castle <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a Norman ringwork, in this case built {{on top of a}} hill although most post-invasion castles were usually sited on lower ground. Around 80% of Norman castles in this period followed the motte-and-bailey pattern, but ringworks were particularly popular in certain areas, such as south-west England and south Wales. One theory put forward to explain this variation is that ringworks were easier to build in these shallow-soil areas than the larger mottes.|$|E

25|$|Attempts {{to reach}} {{political}} agreement on effective policies for climate change continue, and pro-nuclear environmentalists seek {{to reverse the}} traditionally anti-nuclear attitudes of environmentalists.

25|$|Another major {{influence}} on Tolkien is riddle poetry from Anglo-Saxon England.

25|$|Lankester {{extended}} {{the idea of}} degeneration to human societies, which carries little significance today, but it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a biological concept invading social science.

25|$|In addition, Euler's {{recognition}} that the key information {{was the number of}} bridges and the list of their endpoints (rather than their exact positions) presaged the development of topology.

25|$|The Bibliotheca Alexandrina at Shatby, Egypt—a large airy spacious {{regional}} public library, built {{overlooking the}} Mediterranean—completed in 2001 and designed by Snøhetta, {{in association with}} Hamza Associates of Cairo, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a modern granite-cladding construction. A commemoration of the Library of Alexandria, once the largest library {{in the world but}} destroyed in antiquity, the new Library's architecture is ultramodern and very non-traditional.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, female artists {{have taken a}} more visible role in the Finnish pop music scene, not only as performers, but also songwriters. A talented singer-songwriter Chisu writing Finnish lyrics for {{instance}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> this phenomenon {{with a couple of}} her songs, that can very well be considered classics beside the songs of Eppu Normaali, Tuomari Nurmio and others in the future.|$|E

The nominal system impedance, frequency and any other factors which may influence the device, such as temperature, must also be specified.|$|E
25|$|While {{other churches}} of Anglican faith have since {{combined}} characteristics of both styles, the Holy Trinity Church appears {{to represent the}} clearest convergence, resulting in hybrid forms and elements rather than Spanish applique on a gothic church. In addition, the church <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> construction {{in a period of}} cultural and architectural transition in Puerto Rico, using concrete as a main building material, but keeping with the centuries-old tradition of exposed wooden rafters and Spanish-tile roofing.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{models and}} {{computer}} models have partially complementary strengths and weaknesses. Physical models {{can be used}} by those without access to a computer and now can be made cheaply out of plastic materials. Their tactile and visual aspects cannot be easily reproduced by computers (although haptic devices have occasionally been built). On a computer screen, the flexibility of molecules is also difficult to appreciate; illustrating the pseudorotation of cyclohexane <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the value of mechanical models.|$|E
