5|$|Favourable {{macroeconomic}} {{performance has}} been a necessary but not sufficient condition for the significant reduction of poverty amongst the Indian population. The rate of poverty decline has not been higher in the post-reform period (since 1991). The improvements in some other non-economic dimensions of social development <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>even</b> less favourable. The most pronounced example is an exceptionally high and persistent level of child malnutrition (46% in 2005–6).|$|E

Beck writes that by scrupulously fulfilling his campaign promises, Macdonald became known as a leader who always kept his word.|$|E
5|$|Edward II's {{refusal to}} pay homage to the French king was based on concern for his royal sovereignty, but also on fear of a {{potential}} resurgence of domestic resistance. For this reason, he sent his wife Isabella to negotiate with King Charles, who was her brother. The Queen departed for France on 9 March 1325, and in September she was joined by her son, the heir to the throne, Prince Edward. Isabella's negotiations were successful, and it was agreed that the young Prince Edward would perform homage in the king's place, which he did on 24 September. Not long after this, Edmund joined the queen and prince in Paris. A circle of opposition was emerging around the queen, including the exiled Roger Mortimer. Edmund, who had previously been steadfast in his support for his half-brother, now joined the plot against the king. Though he still distrusted Mortimer, his hatred for the Despensers seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>even</b> greater at this point. When Edmund, along with the others, ignored the king's order to return to England, his lands were confiscated in March 1326.|$|E

5|$|Limousins in {{different}} countries are bred according to different selection practices or objectives, and are connected by limited international gene flows. Poor genetic connectedness between countries has negative implications for estimation accuracies of international genetic prediction programmes. As a result of genetic drift or different selection, each country's population of Limousins is becoming genetically differentiated, but which is counterbalanced to a limited extent by gene flows from other countries. A study of over 2.4million Limousin pedigree files of five European countries (France, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, United Kingdom) showed moderate gene flows from France to the United Kingdom and Denmark, but negligible gene flows to Sweden. Except for gene flows originating from France, and some limited gene flows between Denmark and Sweden in the 1990s, bull and semen exchanges between European countries has been scarce, especially since about 2000. Cow and embryo flows <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>even</b> more scarce. Conversely, the genetic contribution of North American Limousins to European countries has increased since the late 1990s, which has occurred because of their use in breeding programmes to introduce the polled gene.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} {{behavioural}} {{theory is that}} the crest was used for intra-species recognition. This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in Parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids. Instead, social and physiological functions have become more supported as function(s) of the crest, focusing on visual and auditory identification and communication. As a large object, the crest has clear value as a visual signal, and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from the crest to the neck or back, the proposed visual display would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>even</b> showier. As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, the crest of Parasaurolophus likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus) and sexual identification by shape and size.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-18th century {{smallpox}} {{was a major}} {{endemic disease}} {{everywhere in the world}} except in Australia and in several small islands. In Europe smallpox was a leading cause of death in the 18th century, killing an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year. Up to 10 percent of Swedish infants died of smallpox each year, and the death rate of infants in Russia may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>even</b> higher. The widespread use of variolation in a few countries, notably Great Britain, its North American colonies, and China, somewhat reduced the impact of smallpox among the wealthy classes during {{the latter part of the}} 18th century, but a real reduction in its incidence did not occur until vaccination became a common practice toward the end of the 19th century. Improved vaccines and the practice of re-vaccination led to a substantial reduction in cases in Europe and North America, but smallpox remained almost unchecked everywhere else in the world. In the United States and South Africa a much milder form of smallpox, variola minor, was recognized just before the close of the 19th century. By the mid-20th century variola minor occurred along with variola major, in varying proportions, in many parts of Africa. Patients with variola minor experience only a mild systemic illness, are often ambulant throughout the course of the disease, and are therefore able to more easily spread disease. Infection with v. minor induces immunity against the more deadly variola major form. Thus as v. minor spread all over the USA, into Canada, the South American countries and Great Britain it became the dominant form of smallpox, further reducing mortality rates.|$|E

25|$|Founded in 1531 as a Spanish settlement, Puebla de los Angeles quickly rose to {{the status}} of Mexico's second-most {{important}} city.

25|$|One folk belief {{concerning}} the bakeneko {{is that they}} would lick the oil of oriental lamps, and in the Edo period encyclopedia, the Wakan Sansai Zue, {{it is said that}} for a cat to lick this oil is an omen of some strange event about to occur. People in the early modern period used cheap oils from fish, like sardine oil, in the lamps, and that could explain why cats would want to lick them. Also, the diet of Japanese people at that time was based mainly on grains and vegetables, and the leftovers would be fed to the cats. However, since cats are carnivores, such a diet would have been lacking in protein and fat, and therefore they would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>even</b> more attracted to the oil in the lamps. Furthermore, the sight of a cat standing up its hind legs to reach the lamp, with its face lit up and eyes round with anticipation, could have seemed eerie and unnatural, like a yōkai.|$|E

25|$|Because Callisto and Ganymede are {{structurally}} {{similar to}} Titan, {{it is unclear}} why their atmospheres are insignificant relative to Titan's. Nevertheless, the origin of Titan's N2 via geologically ancient photolysis of accreted and degassed NH3, as opposed to degassing of N2 from accretionary clathrates, {{may be the key}} to a correct inference. Had N2 been released from clathrates, 36Ar and 38Ar that are inert primordial isotopes of the Solar System should also be present in the atmosphere, but neither has been detected in significant quantities. The insignificant concentration of 36Ar and 38Ar also indicates that the ~40K temperature required to trap them and N2 in clathrates did not exist in the Saturnian subnebula. Instead, the temperature may have been higher than 75K, limiting even the accumulation of NH3 as hydrates. Temperatures would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>even</b> higher in the Jovian subnebula due to the greater gravitational potential energy release, mass, and proximity to the Sun, greatly reducing the NH3 inventory accreted by Callisto and Ganymede. The resulting N2 atmospheres may have been too thin to survive the atmospheric erosion effects that Titan has withstood.|$|E
25|$|Ashraful went {{on after}} lunch, making 42 before a slower ball from Fernando ended his 43-run stand with Aftab Ahmed, and after that, wickets fell quickly.

Earlier, Javed Omar and Habibul Bashar had been out to expansive shots for low scores, and once again it was down to Ashraful. He recorded 21 runs in the evening session, at an unusually slow pace, while Shahriar Nafees were left to hit the big shots, taking eight fours off the Sri Lankan bowlers as he moved to 51. Two balls before the close of play, however, he edged to Samaraweera at slip, giving Muralitharan another wicket, and Bangladesh closed on 131 for 4, still 135 short of Sri Lanka's first innings score.|$|E
