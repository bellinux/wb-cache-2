25|$|MRI can {{sometimes}} identify <b>intra-articular</b> causes of snapping hip syndrome.|$|E
25|$|These {{are also}} called {{injectable}} formulations {{and are used}} with intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, and <b>intra-articular</b> administration. The drug is stored in liquid or if unstable, lyophilized form.|$|E
25|$|Because the iliopsoas or hip flexor crosses {{directly}} over the anterior suprior labrum of the hip, an <b>intra-articular</b> hip derangement (i.e. labral tears, hip impingement, loose bodies) can lead to an effusion that subsequently produces internal snapping hip symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Bennett {{fracture}} is {{a fracture}} {{of the base}} of the first metacarpal bone which extends into the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. This <b>intra-articular</b> fracture is {{the most common type of}} fracture of the thumb, and is nearly always accompanied by some degree of subluxation or frank dislocation of the carpometacarpal joint.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of OA, the most {{attractive}} intra- articular sites for gene transfer are the synovium and the articular cartilage. Most experimental {{progress has been made}} with gene transfer to a convenient <b>intra-articular</b> tissue, such as the synovium, a tissue amenable to genetic modification by a variety of vectors, using both in vivo and ex vivo protocols.|$|E
25|$|Similar causes as extra-articular {{snapping}} hip syndrome but often with an underlying mechanical {{problem in the}} lower extremity. The pain associated with internal variety {{tends to be more}} intense and therefore more debilitating than the external variety. <b>Intra-articular</b> {{snapping hip}} syndrome is often indicative of injury such as a torn acetabular labrum, recurrent hip subluxation, ligamentum teres tears, loose bodies, articular cartilage damage, or synovial chondromatosis (cartilage formations in the synovial membrane of the joint).|$|E
25|$|One such {{previously}} suspected complication was coxa magna, {{which is}} an overgrowth of the femoral head and broadening of the femoral neck, accompanied by changes in the acetabulum, which may lead to subluxation of the femur. There was also some controversy about whether continuous high <b>intra-articular</b> pressure in transient synovitis could cause avascular necrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease), but further studies did not confirm any link between the two conditions.|$|E
25|$|Joint {{injection}} of glucocorticoids (such as hydrocortisone) leads to short term pain relief that may last between {{a few weeks}} and a few months. Injections of hyaluronic acid have not produced improvement compared to placebo for knee arthritis, but did increase risk of further pain. In ankle osteoarthritis, evidence is unclear. The effectiveness of injections of platelet-rich plasma is unclear; there are suggestions that such injections improve function but not pain, and are associated with increased risk. A 2015 Cochrane review found that <b>intra-articular</b> corticosteroid injections of the knee did not benefit quality of life, {{had no effect on}} knee joint space, and clinical effects one to six weeks after injection could not be determined clearly due to poor study quality.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Intra-articular</b> {{bodies in}} SOC {{typically}} have popcorn calcification, with a dense sclerotic border with radiolucent central region. [...] This distinct radiographic appearance sets it {{apart from other}} cause of <b>intra-articular</b> bodies. [...] Number and size of <b>intra-articular</b> bodies can prove helpful as well. [...] SOC typically presents as multiple <b>intra-articular</b> bodies. [...] Few or isolated <b>intra-articular</b> bodies are more consistent with trauma or osteoarthritis.|$|E
2500|$|MR {{appearance}} {{depends on}} {{composition of the}} <b>intra-articular</b> body.

2500|$|Asymptomatic {{patients}} {{do not require}} therapy. [...] Symptomatic patients should undergo arthroscopic or surgical removal of <b>intra-articular</b> bodies. [...] Patients who have recurrent <b>intra-articular</b> bodies or in whom the entire synovial lining is metaplastic require total synovectomy.|$|E

2500|$|The direct in vivo {{approach}} is <b>intra-articular</b> insertion of a vector to affect synovicytes. Vectors play crucial role in success of this method. [...] The effect of Different vectors for in vivo gene delivery to synovium is summarized in Table 2: ...|$|E
2500|$|Clicking, grating, or locking {{may result}} from acute {{mechanical}} problems due to <b>intra-articular</b> bodies within the affected joint. [...] Locking may destroy articular cartilage, resulting in secondary osteoarthritis. [...] Symptoms such as joint stiffness and aching {{are the result of}} osteoarthritis that sets in after years of persistent joint irritation.|$|E
2500|$|Surgical {{treatment}} is rarely necessary unless <b>intra-articular</b> pathology is present. [...] In patients with persistently painful iliopsoas symptoms surgical {{release of the}} contracted iliopsoas tendon has been used since 1984. [...] Iliopsoas and iliotibial band lengthening can be done arthroscopically. [...] Postop, these patients will usually undergo extensive physical therapy; regaining full strength may take up to 9–12 months.|$|E
2500|$|Classification {{is divided}} into primary versus {{secondary}} SOC. [...] Primary SOC occurs in an otherwise normal joint. [...] It is suggested by monoarticular involvement in a patient in the third to fifth decades of life. [...] Secondary SOC occurs in older patients in joints previously affected by joint disease such as osteoarthritis. [...] This pattern is suggested by bilateral involvement with multiple joint <b>intra-articular</b> bodies.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a recent}} {{comparative}} orthopedic study, a new bioscaffold having an embryonic-like structure has shown positive clinical outcomes in dogs with advanced, end stage osteoarthritis. [...] The bioscaffold was implanted into <b>intra-articular</b> areas and reported up to 90-days of clinical improvement after a single implant. [...] The bioscaffold {{has been shown}} to cause infiltrating cells to upregulate a variety of tissue repair factors including aggrecan, connective tissue growth factor, bone morphogenetic protein, transforming growth factors, and other tissue repair factors associated with osteoarthritis.|$|E
2500|$|Chronic, {{progressive}} {{pain and}} {{swelling of the}} affected joint are exacerbated by physical activity. [...] Joint effusion and limited range of motion are common associated features. [...] It affects primarily large joints, including knee (>50% of cases), elbow, hip, and shoulder. [...] SOC is twice as common in men as women. [...] Some patients have <b>intra-articular</b> bodies resting in stable positions within joint recesses or bursae. [...] These patients may be asymptomatic, with SOC merely as an incidental finding at imaging.|$|E
2500|$|Cartilaginous <b>intra-articular</b> bodies float freely {{within the}} {{synovial}} fluid, which they require for nutrition and growth. [...] Progressive enlargement and ossification occur with time. If they remain free, {{they continue to}} grow larger and more calcified. [...] In severe cases, they may occupy the entire joint space or penetrate to adjacent tissues. [...] Also, they can deposit in the synovial lining, reestablish a blood supply, and become replaced by bone. [...] On occasion, synovial reattachment can lead to complete reabsorption of the cartilage fragment.|$|E
2500|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) {{have been used}} {{for a number of years}} to treat osteoarthritis. Their use has mostly been {{autologous}} (self); used fresh (in the form of a mixed cell population mainly sourced from adipose tissue), or expanded in number via culture; or allogeneic (non-self). The majority of their action via a paracrine effect, and hence the route of administration has been mostly via <b>intra-articular</b> injection. In vitro, this paracrine effect has been shown to enhance type II collagen expression in OA chondrocytes while decreasing matrix metalloproteinase activity (MMP-3 and MMP-13). In clinical cases, this has been shown via their anti-inflammatory/pain relieving effects. Dogs treated with adipose derived stem cell therapy have had significantly improved scores for lameness and compiled scores for pain and range of motion compared with control dogs. Other randomised studies have shown similar improved results with functional limitation, range of motion, and owner and veterinary investigator visual analogue scale for pain all showing improvement. [...] Beyond this, significant improvements in MSC treated animals as measured by peak vertical force and vertical impulse in force platform have been observed.|$|E
