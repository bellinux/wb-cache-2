500|$|Ripley {{graduated}} from drama school in 1990. Her first role afterwards was playing Osatko {{in the chorus}} of Around the World in 80 Days at the Liverpool Playhouse during the 1990–91 pantomime season. She had ten lines in Japanese. Her next role came {{at the end of}} the year in the Manchester Royal Exchange's production of Medea. Ripley recalled, [...] "It was only my second <b>job,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> took it all very seriously, in my Greek sarong and my torch of fire, having to burble in tongues." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{his return}} from the Middle East, Jackson was briefly an {{instructor}} at No.1 Service Flying Training School, based at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria. He wrote to his wife, [...] "I just loathe this joint. This training is a tough <b>job</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> take my hat off to the boys who {{have been doing it}} since war broke out... every one of these instructors is longing to be sent overseas, but I doubt if they have any chance of ever getting there—they are so valuable here." [...] In January 1942, he was posted to No.4 Squadron, which operated Wirraways in Canberra.|$|E
500|$|The North County Times {{referred}} to him observing, [...] "Page {{is one of the}} most recognizable artists in the entertainment industry for his iconic designs." [...] Director of exhibitions and collections at the Oceanside Museum of Art, Teri Sowell, reflected of the exhibition featuring Page's work to The San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "These creatures are so embedded in our minds, we take them for granted. It's really handcrafted art." [...] Film director J. J. Abrams commented on Page's work on his film Super 8, [...] "the designer of the creature, Neville Page, did an amazing <b>job</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think he gave us something that took a ton of iterations but he really nailed it".|$|E

I'm puzzled, because they're not a bad-tempered lot, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> understand that Wilkinson {{is not a}} favorite. Your throwing him down the bank wouldn't strengthen his influence." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jim {{turned to}} the others with a triumphant smile. [...] "It's fixed. Your mother will need you, Carrie, and I'll need my partner. We have put over some hard <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> imagine I'm up against another now. I want you, Jake; {{you have got to}} see me out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm not a {{very clever}} sort of chap, you see. I somehow didn't seem able to grasp the workings. After about a year, my uncle, getting a bit fed-up, hoofed me out and got me a mastership at a school, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> made a hash of that. He got me one or two other <b>jobs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> made a hash of those." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{his role}} as producer, Iwakami took a mostly {{hands-off}} approach. Due to Puella Magi Madoka Magica being an original series rather than an adaptation based on an already existing work, he described the main goal solely as [...] "coming up with a high-quality piece of entertainment." [...] After helping to recruit the staff, he allowed them mostly free rein in developing the actual content of the story, providing minimal guidance from himself. After viewing the character designs that Aoki created, he became fully assured that he could trust the creative talent of the team. In an interview with Anime News Network after the series finished airing in Japan, Iwakami summed up his philosophy as [...] "I don't matter much; it's up to those talents to do their work. If something comes to a stand-still I might intervene, but they did an excellent <b>job</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was very happy seeing the results in episode one." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, {{speculation}} arose that Walton {{had taken}} a medical leave; however, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported {{that she had been}} asked to accept a salary cut and had decided to leave. The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill. She later clarified her departure as having to do with [...] "family and this economy". She stated: [...] "I felt so bad that so many people have lost their jobs, that, all of a sudden, I thought: 'This is really silly. I have a wonderful <b>job</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really think I owe it to myself and my family to continue on.'" [...] In February 2012, Walton signed a new contract with the soap opera, which would continue her portrayal of the role for an unspecified amount of time. The actress was then announced to be taking a leave of absence beginning that April, slated to last six months. [...] She made her return on November 2, 2012. After her return, Walton confirmed in an interview with Soap Opera Digest that she had voluntarily dropped to recurring status to allow for more time with her family.|$|E

After completing her first season with the orchestra, Salerno-Sonnenberg stated: [...] "I also have a solo career that I have to maintain -- <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> have a record label. I have three full-time <b>jobs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't know how long I can keep up this pace." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ray was {{interested}} in working in make up and special effects, [...] "probably from all of those years of reading Famous Monsters magazine," [...] he later said. He found out [...] "it soon became apparent that you would always be between <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{was looking for something}} that would actually earn me a living. I think I became a director because that was the fastest way to get a film made on the independent side of things." ...|$|R

"Strong's his man of business, {{draws the}} Governor's bills, and indosses 'em, and does his odd <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> that; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> suppose Altamont's in it too," [...] Mr. Lightfoot replied. [...] "That kite-flying, you know, Mr. M., always takes {{two or three}} on 'em to set the paper going. Altamont put the pot on at the Derby, and won {{a good bit of}} money. I wish the Governor could get some somewhere, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could get my book paid up." ...|$|R

2500|$|Although Mortaza {{returned}} from injury {{in time for}} Zimbabwe's tour of Bangladesh in December, Shakib was retained as captain for the five-match ODI series. Following his side's defeat in the opening ODI, Shakib stated that he [...] "was not prepared to take the <b>job</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am also not satisfied with my role as a captain". Bangladesh {{went on to win}} the next three complete matches, with one called off due to rain, to beat Zimbabwe 3–1. Shakib was Bangladesh's second-highest run-scorer and wicket taker for the series with 156runs, including two half centuries, and ninewickets.|$|E

2500|$|Chapman {{worked in}} the prison as a legal clerk and kitchen helper. He was barred from {{participating}} in the Cephas Attica workshops, a charitable organization that helps inmates to adjust to life outside prison. He was also prohibited from attending the prison's violence and anger management classes due to concern for his safety. Chapman reportedly likes {{to read and write}} short stories. At his parole board hearing in 2004, he described his plans; [...] "I would immediately try to find a <b>job,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really want to go from place to place, at least in the state, church to church, and tell people what happened to me and point them the way to Christ." [...] He also said that he thought that there was a possibility he could find work as a farmhand or return to his previous trade as a printer.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Brooks {{returned}} to EastEnders for a guest stint. She was later confirmed {{to be coming}} back as a regular character. She said, [...] "I had doubts to begin with, mainly because of Kiki, as I know how full-on EastEnders can be, and then there's that stigma {{about going back to}} a soap. But I'm so pleased I did, it was the right decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel really lucky to have a <b>job</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> need the security because of Kiki. I was just going to go back for a year, but I had a meeting with the boss last week and we're going to go for another year. So lots more time to get up to much mischief". Executive producer Diederick Santer said, [...] "I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining EastEnders. With her appearances last month, she reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine". She temporarily departed in September 2012, and returned in April 2013 before departing again in March 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Merkerson {{made her}} {{television}} debut as Reba the Mail Lady on Pee-wee's Playhouse. [...] "It {{was one of}} those wild things where I went to audition. And I thought I was funny and the person I auditioned for didn't, and so I had blown the <b>job</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> guess weeks later they got new casting people," [...] Merkerson said on the NPR program Tell Me More. [...] "I didn't know who Pee-wee Herman was, so if, you know, for fans of the show, if they watch like the first episode that I ever did, I think it was a big party and he just kept making me laugh because I had never seen the character before. And the director was angry and he was like how can we get through this scene? And I said I {{have to look at the}} plate. So the entire [...] he's serving hors d'oeuvres, I'm looking at the plate, and we're still good buddies. He still, to this day, knows how to make me laugh like no one else, Paul Reubens". Merkerson has also appeared on The Cosby Show, among other series.|$|E

40|$|When match {{formation}} is costly and wage determination is decentralized, privately optimal investments in <b>job</b> <b>and</b> worker quality diverge from socially efficient outcomes. To explore this issue, I consider search equilibrium environments with endogenous quality distributions for <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> workers. <b>I</b> {{show that a}} search equilibrium with decentralized wage setting exhibits excessive relative supplies of inferior <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> inferior workers. Moreover, there are fundamental tensions between the standard wage-setting condition for an efficient total supply of <b>jobs</b> (<b>and</b> workers) in two-sided search models and the conditions required for efficient mixes of <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> workers. <b>I</b> also derive the efficient wage structure, contrast its properties to the decentralized wage structure and evaluate the welfare and productivity gains of moving to an efficient wage structure. Numerical exercises show that centralized bargaining between a labor union and an employer confederation over the structure of wages can improve productivity and welfare by compressing job-related wage differentials. ...|$|R

2500|$|Bianchi's ninth-place finish {{earned him}} his first career points and his team's first in Formula One in their 83rd Grand Prix start since {{entering}} under the name Virgin Racing in 2010. He told Sky Sports F1 that Marussia had been awaiting the result {{for a long period}} and since it had been achieved, he stated that he was [...] "so proud" [...] for his team: [...] "They did a really good <b>job</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am really happy to give them the result." [...] Marussia team principal John Booth was delighted at Bianchi's overtake on Kobayashi, describing it as [...] "stunning", and despite the five-second time penalty, his team were [...] "absolutely over the moon" [...] with the achievement. Graeme Lowdon, the team's chief executive officer, was pleased at the sign of progress, saying: [...] "It is tough and I would be lying if I didn't reflect that", and the result was a [...] "direct reward for people who have worked very hard." [...] Alonso expressed his huge satisfaction for Bianchi, stating: [...] "I am extremely happy for him, [...] very proud for what this result will mean for his career. I have no doubts it will be a good career, but hopefully with this result he can have a more competitive car next year and show his talents even more." [...] Former driver Allan McNish wrote in his BBC F1 column that the result was like [...] "a Grand Prix victory" [...] for Marussia and that it was [...] "a deserved reward for their dogged determination and never-say-die attitude." [...] Following Bianchi's death nine months after sustaining severe head injuries at the Japanese Grand Prix, Will Dale of Fox Sports Australia wrote: [...] "Monaco 2014 will be remembered as his day in the sun, the high watermark of a career — a life — ended far too soon." ...|$|E

5000|$|The explanation, Maibaum {{once told}} an interviewer, was that writing for Bond is [...] "a case of Walter Mitty. I'm law-abiding and non-violent.

5000|$|In November 2014 Bobby Smith (activist) {{accompanied}} by Carol Wheeler covered the A Real Birmingham Family statue {{with a white}} sheet and pictures of his own 2 daughters in protest at no Father being included in the statue. Smith said 'They've depicted the normal family with no fathers, There's nothing wrong with single mothers but this statue is saying one person can do both <b>jobs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> believe kids are always better off with both parents in their lives. The director of the Ikon Gallery Jonathan Watkins said of Smith’s protest after meeting with him “We had a good exchange of ideas, He has his take on things, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have my take on things. I think it's great that somebody has the freedom to express themselves. It's all good, it's part of this democratic society that we cherish." ...|$|R
