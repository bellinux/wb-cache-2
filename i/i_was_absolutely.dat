Both during {{composition}} and afterwards he would continually revise his music; he said, [...] "Without an india-rubber <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> sunk." [...] Consequently, his total body of work from his sixty-year career as a composer is not large. Between the first performance of Façade in 1923, for example, {{and that of the}} Sinfonia Concertante in 1928, he averaged only one small piece a year. Of his work as a whole, Byron Adams in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians writes: ...|$|E

According to Nomura, he only had Utada in mind to create the theme song for the video game, so he had contacted her to collaborate; as a result, she accepted his offer. In a brief interview with IGN, Nomura further stated; [...] "Her music has moved millions of fans, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> thrilled when she agreed to contribute to this project.

500|$|Jansch's music, and {{particularly}} his acoustic guitar playing, have influenced {{a range of}} well-known musicians. His first album (Bert Jansch, 1965) was much admired, with Jimmy Page saying, [...] "At one point, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> obsessed with Bert Jansch. When I first heard that LP, I couldn't believe it. It was so far ahead of what everyone else was doing. No one in America could touch that." [...] The same debut album included Jansch's version of the Davy Graham instrumental [...] "Angie." [...] This was a favourite of Mike Oldfield, who practised acoustic guitar alone as a child, and was then heavily influenced by Jansch's style. The title of the instrumental inspired Oldfield to call his first band (with sister Sally) The Sallyangie.|$|E
500|$|Sasha {{became aware}} of {{electronic}} dance music in 1988 at The Haçienda, a Manchester dance venue. [...] Drawn to the rough sound of acid house music and the rebellious attitude he associated with it, he visited Manchester weekly and soon moved to nearby Disley. [...] Sasha purchased many jazz records and began to teach himself how to mix. A local DJ at a club Sasha frequented {{announced that he was}} looking for other DJs to travel with him on a regional tour. Sasha volunteered and made his first live appearance in nearby Stockport. Sasha recalled of his debut, [...] "I'd never even touched a Technics: I thought the pitch control was the volume, I didn't even know where to plug my headphones in! I'm sure <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> horrendous." ...|$|E
500|$|Membership in the Sex Pistols had a {{progressively}} destructive {{effect on}} Vicious. As Lydon later observed, [...] "Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly {{he was a}} big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the right places, adoration. That's what it all meant to Sid." [...] Westwood had already been feeding him material, like a tome on Charles Manson, likely to encourage his worst instincts. Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York. Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional codependency between the couple alienated Vicious from {{the other members of the}} band. Lydon later wrote, [...] "We did everything to get rid of Nancy.... She was killing him. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission.... Only she didn't want to go alone. She wanted to take Sid with her.... She was so utterly fucked up and evil." [...] Lydon also admits to regretting introducing the two in The Filth and the Fury.|$|E

Jane Boursaw of TV Squad liked the revelation about Walter's safe deposit boxes, but questioned Olivia's logic to get out of her SUV when fleeing her kidnappers. SFScope's Sarah Stegall exclaimed, [...] "Now this is science fiction! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> thrilled by this week's episode". She elaborated by praising Olivia's [...] "B story" [...] about her and John Scott's memories, the series' use of [...] "cold-blooded" [...] villains, and believed [...] "the elements of the show are finally achieving some balance." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson noted [...] "Wow. Fringe brings its first chapter to a close, and it really does feel like the end of a chapter. What started as the 'wacky science project of the week' builds to an episode that feels like a mini season finale." ...|$|E

[...] "I decided <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> not willing to compromise the quality of my education in exchange for my health care." [...] she said. Fluke spent the following three years trying to persuade {{the administration of the}} Jesuit college to change its policy regarding student contraceptive coverage. She said she had intended to use her testimony before Congress to talk about the effects of the lack of birth control coverage on students at Georgetown.|$|E

[...] Andrew Lloyd Webber has since admitted that he made a mistake in sending her home too early from the BBC show, and is now immensely proud of the singer and her performances at the London Palladium as Maria; Lloyd Webber announced her recruitment saying her audition was [...] "sensational." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jaime Murray {{completed}} the lead actors, playing Stacie Monroe who, as the grifters' only female member, is self-styled as [...] "the lure". Murray, described {{by one of}} the Hustle production team as [...] "that rare specimen – a stunningly beautiful actress who can actually act", and who auditioned in platform shoes to match her 5ft7in height with Stacie's description as having [...] "legs that go on for miles", was reportedly [...] "terrified" [...] to be working with the more famous actors Vaughn and Lester, saying [...] "when we were filming the first couple of episodes <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> petrified and was convinced that it would be really obvious on screen. So when I watched some of it on tape I was totally amazed that you couldn't see how frightened I really was. I kept thinking, 'Oh my God! I'm working with Adrian Lester and Robert Vaughn. Any time now someone is going to tap me on the shoulder and ask me to get my coat!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Bankhead was {{director}} Irving Rapper's first {{choice for the}} role of Amanda in the film version of Tennessee William's The Glass Menagerie. Laurette Taylor, who originated the role of Amanda, was an idol of Bankhead's and also an alcoholic, whose brilliant performance in the original Broadway production reversed years of career decline. Rapper called Bankhead's screen test the greatest performance he had ever seen: [...] "I {{thought she was going to}} be difficult, but she was like a child, so sweet and lovely. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> floored by her performance. It's the greatest test I've ever made or seen in my life. I couldn't believe I was seeing such reality. Bankhead was absolutely natural, so moving, so touching without even trying. The crew was stunned, too." [...] But studio head Jack Warner rejected the idea because of his fear of Tallulah's drinking; though she promised not to drink during shooting, he refused to give her the part. The role was given to Gertrude Lawrence instead, whose acting was panned by most critics.|$|E
2500|$|Wild {{was looking}} forward to a fast ride on his first country train journey in many years. In the early days of his youth, in the 1930s, {{railways}} were always pushing to achieve an average speed of 60 miles per hour (97km/h). He had grown up [...] "when speed was regarded as the essential thing on the railway". But disappointment in his trip came when he realised that despite the train's much-publicised but very brief dash at 160 km/h, the journey, over all, had the leisurely features of a branch-line train. ... In the end, the journey took 4 hours and 37 minutes – 20 minutes longer than scheduled, at an average speed of 70.6 kilometres per hour. [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> appalled by the whole thing. After I flew home that night, I looked up an old reference book. [...] I learned that if the train had completed the run in an even four hours – a schedule that was soon to be introduced – it would have travelled at the same average speed of 81.6 km/h as the London to Bristol Express in 1851.|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> gobsmacked. I said, “This is horrible. Horrible!” And it’s a very slow, {{sinking feeling}} when you’re {{watching}} the movie, {{and the first}} scene comes out, and you’re like, “Oh, that’s a really bad scene.” But you say, “Well, that’s okay, the next one’ll be better.” And you somehow try to convince yourself that it’s going to get better… and it just gets worse. And I was like, “Wow. That was crazy.” I mean, I really didn’t see that coming. So at that point, I distanced myself from the movie. Now, of course, it has a whole other life {{as a sort of}} inadvertent… satire. No, “satire” isn’t the right word. But it’s inadvertently funny. So it’s found its place. It provides entertainment, though not in the way I think it was originally intended. It was just… maybe the wrong material with the wrong director and the wrong cast.Showgirls was universally derided by film critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 19% based on 48 reviews with the consensus; [...] "Vile, contemptible, garish, and misogynistic -- and that might just be exactly Showgirls' point." [...] Metacritic give the film an average score of 16/100, indicating [...] "Overwhelming dislike. Roger Ebert, following a relatively mild negative review (2 stars out of 4), wrote that Showgirls received [...] "some bad reviews, but it wasn't completely terrible". The film remains heralded as one of cinema's worst.|$|E
