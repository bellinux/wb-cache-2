5000|$|The OUN {{was formed}} {{from a number}} of radical {{nationalist}} and extreme right-wing organizations including the Union of Ukrainian Fascists. Initially, it was led by war veterans who failed to establish a Ukrainian state in 1917-1920. The ideology of the organization was heavily influenced by the philosophy of Nietzsche, German National Socialism and Italian Fascism; combining extreme nationalism with terrorism, corporatism, and anti-Semitism, as well as totalitarianism and anti-democracy. In order to create an illusion that the Ukrainian brand of nationalism was a product of domestic development, most early OUN writers denied their ideological connection to fascism in a self-deceptive manner, contradicting <b>generally</b> <b>known</b> <b>facts.</b> According to its initial declaration, the primary goal of OUN was to establish an independent and ethnically pure Ukrainian state. This goal was to be achieved by a national revolution, that would drive out all foreign element and set up an authoritarian state led by a strong man. The OUN's leadership felt that past attempts at securing independence failed due to democratic values in society, poor party discipline and a conciliatory attitude towards Ukraine's traditional enemies. Its ideology rejected the socialist ideas supported by Petliura, and the compromises of Galicia's traditional elite. Instead the OUN, particularly its younger members, adopted the ideology of Dmytro Dontsov, an émigré from Eastern Ukraine. [...] The OUN shared the fascist attributes of antiliberalism, anticonservatism, and anticommunism, an armed party, totalitarianism, anti-Semitism, Führerprinzip, and an adoption of fascist greetings. Its leaders eagerly emphasized to Hitler and Ribbentrop that they shared the Nazi Weltanschauung and a commitment to a fascist New Europe. — Per Anders Rudling ...|$|E

40|$|It is a <b>generally</b> <b>known</b> <b>fact</b> that Hungarian {{products}} {{are at a}} disadvantage in Western markets, since a certain part of foreign customers have not yet heard of Hungarian products. Many of them believe that products made in Eastern Europe are cheap and of poor quality. How could they possibly know Hungarian products, if national food producers and traders can only invest a minimal amount to promote their products? Food producers in EU countries spend far much more to market their products than their fellows in Hungary. The Community strategy for agricultural marketing has been aimed at counterbalancing this tendency. In 1998, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural development launched the “Quality Food from Hungary” trademark {{with the aim of}} distinguishing top quality food products from other products. The role of the quality trademark is to inform and protect the customers. The trademark makes the customers {{aware of the fact that}} the concerned food product differs from other products, and it also protects the customer, since both the producer and the certifying authority assume the responsibility for the controlled top quality of the product. In order to obtain the “Quality Food from Hungary” trademark, the raw materials, ingredients, the manufacturing process and the final product shall exceed the criteria stipulated within the effective food regulations.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} ulcerative colitis {{as well as}} with the impact of such a disease on patient's diet. The aim of this thesis is to describe the composition of the diet of patients with ulcerative colitis. The following research questions are defined: "How do the patients follow the principles of a proper diet in this disease?", "What foods do the patients tend to avoid most often?" and "What is the experience of selected patients with a nutritional therapist?" At first, this bachelor thesis summarizes theoretical knowledge of the current status, incidence, diagnostics, causes and the course of the disease. Other chapters deal with symptoms of ulcerative colitis which is not just a matter of the digestive tract. This is followed by the extraintestinal complications that are related to the disease. The nutritional status of patients is also mentioned here. Last but not least, this work describes the diet plan of patients. To achieve the goal of this thesis, quantitative and qualitative researches are selected. The quantitative research is conducted using questionnaires which were distributed to patients of the Clinical Centre ISCARE I. V. F a. s., that is under the leadership of a head of the department, Prof. MUDr. Milan Lukáš, CSc. The survey results are presented in the form of graphs. The qualitative research is carried out through the recording sheet to which the selected respondents wrote down their two-week diet. This diet was subsequently evaluated in the program Nutriservis. The results were compared with the recommendations and interpreted in the form of tables and plain text. For comparison, a general sample menu for the period of remission has been worked out. The research results show that eating habits of patients are quite stereotypical. <b>Generally</b> <b>known</b> <b>facts</b> have been confirmed. Most frequently, patients try to avoid the consumption of dairy products, wholemeal bread and legumes. The consumption of vegetables, fruits and fish is not sufficient. Patients are not aware enough of the role of a nutritional therapist, most respondents do not have any personal experience with him. Dietary advice is searched on the internet where some unverified recommendations may endanger health of individuals of malnutrition, hypovitaminoses or deficiency of trace elements.

40|$|The {{present in}} vitro study was {{concerned}} with the primary stability of dental implants. Two different implant systems produced by the Friadent company (press-fit implants and screw implants) that were of the same length (13 mm) but of different implant diameters (3, 8 mm, 4, 5 mm and 5, 5 mm) were tested. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine a critical value for the primary stability of dental implants directly after insertion, since there has been a growing trend in implantology towards reduced healing periods and towards the immediate loading of implants. At the same time, however, there is a wide range of fixation methods and fixation materials for supra-constructions that are hardly orientated towards the stability of the implants in the bone. The favourable circumstance of having human jaw bones (devitalized) available for testing made it possible at the same time to draw comparisons with other bones of animal origin, using the same study design. As an appropriate method for testing the pull-out procedure employing a specifically designed testing device in a Zwick testing machine was chosen. In addition, several bone samples were subjected to a gray scale measurement to determine a relative bone density measured against titanium, in order to draw conclusions on the influence of bone quality on primary stability. The results of the pull-out test showed that screw implants when compared to press-fit implants have a higher primary stability by a factor of approximately 2. Critical values of around 30 N in the human maxilla and of around 100 N in the mandible were identified that should not be exceed when manipulating the implant after insertion, especially when taking into account that four to six weeks after implant insertion the primary stability is still decreasing and excessive forces prevent a successful osseointegration. The comparison with other bone types allowed the development of a bone model as an alternative to testing on human bones. If the behaviour of press-fit implants in the maxilla is to be investigated the use of porcine metatarsal bone suggests itself. An even better alternative is represented by the spongiose bovine scapula. When investigating their pull-out behaviour in the mandible, both press-fit implants and screw implants show no significant differences if used in the spongiose bovine scapula. Parallel to this, the macrostructures of both bone types are also very similar. The results of the gray scale measurement confirm <b>generally</b> <b>known</b> <b>facts</b> that low bone density correlates with low pull-out values. This method of measurement is not suitable for more precise findings. Under clinical conditions the indication for loading dental implants immediately must be determined very critically. Should an immediate loading with all the necessary steps (provisional restoration) be carried out, the use of fixation materials with pull-out forces of 30 N is recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} whether a prototype aural training programme could successfully develop tertiary level aural training skills if face-to-face teaching components were replaced entirely by interactive CD-ROM delivery. Audiation is the ability by which one hears with the eyes (and, by extension, sees with the ears), and the reciprocal nature of listening and reading has long been recognised (Karpinski, 2000). According to Allvin (1970), sound-to-sight and sight-to-sound skills can be developed through CAI with an effectiveness equal to face-to-face instruction. It appears that some aural skills assist naturally in the development of other aural skills; Carlsen (1969), for example, suggested that the effect of aural training by instruction generalised to sightsinging ability, while Baggaley (1974) writes in contrast that the ability to discriminate does not necessarily guarantee the ability to recognise and identify. Porter (1977) asserts what is now a <b>generally</b> <b>known</b> <b>fact</b> that one must teach for transfer, rather than to expect transfer to be automatic. A six-semester distance-mode prototype aural training programme was developed at the University of Southern Queensland and delivered to tertiary music students in all states of Australia as well as other countries including New Zealand, Singapore, south-east Asia and the United Kingdom. A pre-test/post-test model assessing three groups (internal, external and control) was applied at the beginning and end of the first semester of the six semester programme. The internal group received face-to-face teaching during the first semester; the external group received tuition via CD-ROM; the control group received no tuition in ear training. The study sought to compare results within and between the three groups in the areas of rhythmic perception, melodic perception, scale/mode recognition and interval recognition during this first semester of the study, and to find correlations between demographic data and test performance. External students achieved higher levels of improvement for all aural acuities than internal students and control group students. The findings indicate that students learning multiple instruments and students learning piano perform aural tasks better than students learning only a melody line instrument (including voice) or no instrument. In addition, internal students’ results showed a greater ceiling effect than the externals’, suggesting that the aural perception curriculum itself may need to take into account different individual levels of achievement. Tertiary music schools experiencing funding constraints may be able to re-organise aural tuition practice either to replace or to augment face-to-face classes with external aural training materials, without sacrificing the quality of their instruction. ...|$|R

40|$|A. GENERAL REMARKS During {{three years}} 4500 reports of whales sighted from Netherlands ships were collected, bearing on {{approximately}} 11. 000 individual animals. Most of the observations {{were made in}} the Atlantic and Indian Ocean. It was supposed that the species could be determined with a fairly high degree of reliability in the case of Humpback Whales, Sperm Whales and Right Whales. No distinction could be made between Blue, Fin, Sei and Bryde Whales. They were collected under the heading Rorquals. Catches of land stations and strandings of whales, however, indicate that in all areas, at least a part of these Rorquals must have been Blue or Fin Whales. Probably the majority of this part were Fin Whales. Nevertheless it must he emphasized that the observations give no exact figures but only indications. It would be highly desirable if the results could be controlled by observations made by experienced whale biologists or gunners, especially in tropical and subtropical waters. We have the impression that for the time being no better results can be obtained with the present type of research. On the other hand, the fact that the <b>generally</b> <b>known</b> <b>facts</b> about the annual migration of the big whales were also clearly shown by this research, may be an indication for a certain degree of reliability of the research. The monthly number of animals of each species observed per 1000 hours steamed in daylight was plotted on charts in ten degrees squares. The reliability of the converted data is highest in the black dots. B. RORQUALS AND HUMPBACKS 1. Distribution The animals involved are not evenly distributed over the Oceans. There are big concentrations in certain areas, whereas in other areas practically no whales occur. Broadly outlined the highly populated areas coincide with the areas of greatest biological productivity of the sea, as shown by WALFORD (1958). In the tropics and subtropics important areas with a great number of sighted whales are: the Caribbean, the North African west coast, the Atlantic coast of South Africa, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bay of Bengal, the Indonesian Archipelago and the African east coast between 30 ° S and 40 ° S. It could be demonstrated that in the Indian Ocean southern Rorquals migrate over the entire breadth of the Ocean south of 30 ° S. North of 30 ° they migrate only at the eastern and the western side, apparently {{in order to avoid the}} waters with low biological productivity in the central part of the Ocean. No special relationship was found between the distribution or the migratory routes of the whales and the course of the big Ocean currents with regard to the locomotory aspect. There was a special relationship only in those cases where the big currents show a great biological productivity, as for example the Gulf Stream and the currents in the northern part of the Indian Ocean. 2. Migration, general remarks With regard to Rorquals in the North and South Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, as well as with regard to Humpbacks in the Atlantic and in the Indian Ocean it could be demonstrated that during the summer a part of the population does not migrate into Arctic or Antarctic waters, but that it stays in tropical, subtropical or temperate waters. In Humpbacks the phenomenon is less pronounced than in Rorquals. In Rorquals the phenomenon is not caused by observations of Sei or Bryde Whales only, because catches of land stations and strandings show that Blue and Fin Whales are present during the summer in the waters involved as well. The percentage of the stock of Blue and Fin Whales staying behind in warm and temperate waters is not known, but the authors have the impression that it is not unsignificant. The number of Rorquals staying behind during the summer appears to be larger in the North than in the South Atlantic, probably because Fin Whales in the North Atlantic feed on fish. The phenomenon of staying behind of a part of the population confirms the assumption that estimations of the Antarctic population of Blue, Fin or Humpback Whales never bear on the total stock of the species involved. The phenomenon may also cause that the number of periods or laminations in baleen plates or ear plugs, used in determining the age of Whalebone Whales, is not a reliable indication for the actual age of the animals. The actual age may be higher than the number of periods, because the staying behind in warm waters causes irregularities in their formation. It could, however, be demonstrated, that in most areas the majority of the populations showed the generally accepted type of annual migration. 3. Migration, Rorquals In the North Atlantic the principal northward migration of Rorquals takes place in April-July, the southward migration in September-November. In the South Atlantic the period of migration southward is September-December, that of the northward migration March-June. The majority of the Rorqual population (which may be principally the Fin Whale population) lives in the North Atlantic during the northern winter between 0 ° and 40 ° N and during the northern summer between 30 ° N and the border of the pack ice. With regard to the South Atlantic these areas are: in the southern winter between 20 ° N and 50 ° S, in the southern summer between the equator and the pack ice, but mainly in Antarctic waters. The northern and southern population apparently meet in the Caribbean, in waters off the North African west coast and probably also in the central part of the Ocean between 0 ° and 20 ° N. In the Indian Ocean large concentrations of Rorquals have been encountered in the northern part of the Ocean during the southern summer, whereas the number of sightings during the southern winter is surprisingly small. During this season the majority of the Rorquals is concentrated in waters of Madagascar and off the Australian west coast. This suggests, that during the southern summer (northern winter) the northern part of the Ocean is populated by Rorquals coming from the northern part of the Pacific Ocean. Probably these whales enter the Indian Ocean by passing the waters of the Indonesian Archipelago and the straits between these waters and the Indian Ocean. This supposition is supported by the fact that in the northern part of the Indian Ocean calves have been sighted in almost equal monthly numbers during the whole year, whereas in the Atlantic Ocean seasonal peaks in the number of sightings have been demonstrated. On the other hand, the possibility of a local stock in the northern part of the Indian Ocean may not be excluded. Although a number of southern Rorquals certainly migrate into the northern part of the Ocean during the southern winter, the majority of the population probably live in this season between the equator (or 10 ° S) and 30 ° S. In the southern summer the majority of the population is found in Antarctic. In the North Pacific Ocean the majority of the population is found during the northern summer between 20 ° N and the pack ice and in the northern winter between 10 ° N and 30 ° N. The South Pacific population apparently migrates northward during the southern winter up to about 10 ° N. 4. Migration, Humpbacks Humpbacks appear to migrate principally in coastal waters with the exception of the crossing part of the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic (30 ° N to 50 ° N) where they are found during the northern winter over the entire breadth of the Ocean. In the northern part of the Indian Ocean they are spread over a large part of the Ocean as well. In the North Atlantic the majority of the population is found during the northern summer between 30 ° N and 50 ° N, and during the northern winter between 40 ° N and 10 ° S (especially in the Caribbean and off the North African west coast). Probably all Humpbacks in the Caribbean belong to the northern stock, because the southern population appears to live during the southern winter between 30 ° S and 20 ° N at the African side of the Ocean, but between 30 ° S and the equator at the American side. During the southern summer they are found between 30 ° S and the pack ice (mostly in Antarctic waters). In former days the North Atlantic Humpback population probably lived further northward (in summer as well as in winter) than nowadays. This may be connected with changes in feeding conditions or with the general decrease of the stock. Just as has been shown with regard to Rorquals, a part of the North Pacific Humpback population seems to migrate into the northern part of the Indian Ocean during the northern winter. The southern population of the Indian Ocean lives during the southern winter between the continent and 30 ° S. During the southern summer the animals are found between 45 ° S and the border of the pack ice. The northern and southern stocks of the Pacific Ocean meet in waters of the Indonesian Archipelago. At the eastern (American) side of the Ocean the northern population lives during the summer between 30 ° N and 50 ° N (or farther northward). During the winter they live between 10 ° N and 30 ° N. The southern stock appears to migrate as far to the North as 10 ° N. 5. Calves Sightings of calves of Rorquals (probably the majority of them being Fin Whales) in the Atlantic Ocean point to a peak in the number of births in December-January for the northern population and in May-June for the southern stock. North Atlantic Humpbacks appear to be born principally in the southern part of the North Atlantic in April, whereas births of the southern stocks apparently occur in tropical waters with a peak in September. C. SPERM WHALES 1. North Atlantic Sperm Whales are always present in the North Atlantic between 10 ° S and 30 ° N, but on the African side the population appears to be much larger than on the American side. A great number of animals are sighted in the Gulf Stream during the summer. The northward migration starts in April, the animals return to the South in autumn. The majority of the females do not go farther to the North than 40 ° N (a minority probably up to 50 ° N). The males migrate into Arctic waters. During the northern winter the majority of the males and females apparently live between 10 ° S and 30 ° N (the American stock mostly in the Caribbean), but some males may stay behind in colder waters as far as 60 ° N. 2. South Atlantic Practically no sightings of Sperm Whales have been reported from the South American east coast, although these waters show a reasonable biological productivity and although a great number of Rorquals have been sighted there. In former days great numbers of Sperm Whales have been caught in these waters. During the summer the males migrate into Antarctic waters, the females migrate up to about 40 ° S. During the winter most of the animals live in tropical waters but some males and females are present up to 40 ° S. 3. Indian Ocean With regard to the Indian Ocean there is a very significant correlation between the distribution of Sperm Whales and the biological productivity of the sea. In the northern part of the Ocean there are many more Sperm Whales sighted during the northern winter than during the northern summer. The general seasonal movements described with regard to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans could not be demonstrated in the Indian Ocean. Apparently the Sperm Whales in this region show very special migratory movements which may be correlated with special conditions, caused by the fact that the Monsoon-stream in the northern part flows in an opposite direction in the two halves of the year. 4. Pacific Ocean Sperm Whales are encountered in the Indonesian Archipelago the whole year round. In the South Pacific they are not evenly distributed but apparently they are restricted to certain areas. The normal seasonal migratory movements could be demonstrated with regard to the South Pacific. D. OTHER SPECIES 1. Little Piked Whales Fairly large numbers of this species were sighted throughout the whole year in tropical waters of all oceans. Large herds were also seen in the northern hemisphere. They show concentrations in areas with a high biological productivity of the sea. During the winter the majority of the animals apparently live in tropical and subtropical waters. During the spring and the autumn they show the usual migratory movements, just as Rorquals and Humpbacks. During the winter, however, some animals stay behind in northern waters, whereas during the summer there are some stragglers in warm waters. The species has been observed in the northern part of the Indian Ocean during the northern winter. In the North Atlantic births take place in warm or temperate waters, probably from November to March. 2. Californian Grey Whales Sightings in the North Pacific were quite in accordance with the generally accepted opinion about the migration of this species. 3. Right Whales North Atlantic as well as Southern Right Whales have been reported. The majority of the animals do not migrate into waters between 20 ° N and 20 ° S, but there are indications that a few animals may also visit these tropical waters. With regard to the North Atlantic no sightings have been reported from regions north of 50 ° N, whereas there was a large number of sightings between 20 ° N and 50 ° N during the northern summer. In the Indian Ocean and in the Indian Archipelago two sightings were reported from waters between 10 ° N and 10 ° S. These observations, however, need further confirmation...|$|E

In the available foreign literature, I came across a collection of works dedicated to the use of classical spolia in the architecture of the Middle Ages and the Renaissanee, and some of the works referred to pre-Romanesque spolia. I took as my starting paint <b>generally</b> <b>known</b> <b>facts</b> ahout preRomanesque furnishinp,s in the interiars ofchurches and the period when their use ended AJter detailed analyses of all of the described cases and consideration of the concrete historical circumstances ofeach ofthem, certain conclusions have been reaches, which are presented here in summary form. Despite the generally widespread theory that pre-Romanesque cancelli had ceased being used with the development of Romanesque church architecture -wbicb is basically true when it refers to newly erected or renovated structures -the performed analysis offers a certain basis for a conclusion {{that a large number of}} these altar screens had remained entire or in a reduced form, andfurther continued in function, whether in situ ur reused, sometimes even into the Gothic period A chronological gradation is apparent in this between the larger urban churches, primarily cathedrals and large monasterial hasilieas on the one hand, and the smaller parish churches or former private endowments in villages, but also in urban contexts, on the other hand. The former were the first to throw out pre-Romanesquefurnishings and be renovated in the modern s yle oftbe then dominant Romanesquestyle (J 2 th- 13 th centuries). The cited examples from Zadar (tbe gable from Sukošan, tbe beam witb an inSCription mentioning Donatus, tbe grave ofAbhess Vekenega) and Split (the belltower oftIJe catbedral, the lining of the baptismal pool in the baptisteJY), as well as thatfrom the basilica ofSt Bartholomew at Kapitul near Knin, and indirectly the major renovation of the Trogir Cathedral undertaken by the master Radovan -parallels to which are represented by pilasters in tbe Romanesque cathedral church in Pisa in Italy are eloquent witnesses to these changes. In the hinterland of the urban communes in the Adriatic region, in the rural sU 172 ̆ 7 oundings of feuda/ settlements and fortresses, there are almost no examples during the Romanesque of the use ofpre-Romanesque spolia analogous to that in the cities, Along with the example from KapituI (which is exceptionalfor several reasons), the only example known to me of an altar screen that had been dismantled at such an early date is the one from Otres, where the plutei from tbe earlier church had been walled into the foundations of the Romanesque church. All other cited examples as a rule represent late mediaeval (Gothic) or even modern period (Baroque) immuring ofpre-Romanesque fragments. Such fragments were incorporated in this manner into the following Gothic religious stnlctures (14 th- 15 th centuries) : St George at Putalj, St Peter at Selo, the Holy Saviour at Vrh rika, the Gothic church at Crkvina in Mokro Polje near Knin, St Michael at Nin, St Cassian at Sukošan; or in the construction ofcontemporary graves: St George at Putalj, St Michael at Brnaze, the Holy Saviour at Vrhrika, Otres-Lukačuša, Ka 6 ić-Begovača, and Šopot-Crkvina. Early Christian spolia can be added here: such as those from the late mediaeval graves surrounding St Cyprian at Gata, as this church had no pre-Romanesque furnishings, as well as the preRomanesque material from the graves around St Andrew in the central district ofthe city ofSplit. To a minor extent, they ended up in secular stnlctures, such as the arch in the late mediaeval tower at Sućurac. Parallel examples can be found in Gothic churches in towns: St George at Marjan Point, and Our Lady of the Belfry (ex St. Theodore), and the Baptistery in Split (?J, St Peter in Dubrovnik, the cathedrals in Trogir, Zadar, and Istrian Novigrad, as well as St John in Trogir. The fact is that a far greater number of fragments of preRomanesque sculpture ended up as spo/ia in the Gothic architecture of the late Middle Ages and its contemporary graves than in Romanesque churches. l particularly point out the fact that preRomanesque spolia have still not been confirmed from graves throughout the developed Middle Ages, but only in religious structures, which eloquently speaks about the relations of the people of that period towards this element ofchurch interiors. Only from the late mediaevalperiods, in cemeteries around Gothic churches, will pre-Romanesque fragments appear as part ofgrave structures. The second chronological period of intensive use of preRomanesque spolia belongs to the modern period, otherwise defined as the period of the renovation and construction of new churches in the Baroque style. Other than in newly erected religious buildings and walls, individual fragments at this pOint also end in grave structures. Along with rare examples from the 16 th century, such as the gable in the Church of St Nicholas on Čiovo, and the small sections of grave spo/ia around St Michael at Brnaze, when the general situation in the Croatian lands and the surrounding countries was hardly appropriate to ereeting new churches, all the other examples are from the 17 th- 18 th centuries. lt should nonetheless be mentioned that even in the rare urban churches built in Renaissanee forms, no pre-Romanesque spolia were registered for this period, other than in rare cases, such as that notedfor the facade ofthe Church ofSt Nicholas on the island of Čiova. The Baroque period, however, again abounds in immurred fragments of earlier decorations. There are many such finds in the coastal towns: St Peter in Dubrovnik, the Cathedral, St Lawrence, and St Nicholas in Split, St Theodore in Okruk Gornji on the island of Čiova, and they are also common in the broader vicinities of urban districts and in the hinterland: St Cassian at Sukošan (jor the second time), St Michael at Nevidane on the island ofPasman, St Michael at Ston. At the same time, following inheritedpractices from the Middle Ages, some ofthe fragments are also included in grave structures, equally in the cities and in the hinterland: St Michael "in ripa maris" and St Stephen "sub pinis " in Split, and St Stephen at Gorica and St Nicholas at Povijana on the island ofPag. The habit of utilizing pre-Romanesque furnishings was still maintained at the beginning of the 19 th century, although with reduced intensity. As example, l noted the late Baroque beifry of the cemeteriai chapel in Trogir, and part ofthe spolia in the graves around St Stephen at Gorica. A more detailed analysis would surely offer an even greater number of examples, but the examples cited here are entirely sufficient to illustrate the chronological sequence ofuse ofpre-Romanesque furnishings after their removal from church interiors, as well as new purposes in later ecclesiastic structures, altars, and graves surrounding churches. The chronological framework of the Gothic and the Baroque, when there was intensive reuse ofpre-Romanesque sculpture and its fragments became spolia, suggests certain conclusions related to the socia-economic and political processes that marked the periods of the cited artistic styles in which the use ofspolia was so emphasized. The first cycle of taking down altar screens during the period ofRomanesque art encompassed -as {{the analysis}} has shown -only a limited number of churches, mostly large basilicae and cathedrals in the Dalmatian communes. A more extensive phase of removing the old pre-Romanesque screens, or allOWing a reduced form of them, followed in the numerous Gothic alterations in smaller urban churches and the majority of churches in the hinterland, so that the third and final act of their removal from the churches followed in the first centuries ofthe modem period, during the period characterized by the Baroque style. The majority of altar screens had then already been removed, and their parts, if they had not already been utilized in the Gothic phase, were preserved in the churches themselves or around them. There are rare examples of altar screens, like that of St Nicholas in Split, which remained in situ to the 17 th centU 1 Y, or like the one in the nearby St Martin, which is the only screen to have remained in its original place to the present day. The Baroque was quite simply the period when using preRomanesque spolia was in fashion. Taking into account the changes in the liturgical ritual, which caused concomitant changes in the church interiors, and the erection of new Romanesque and GothiC churches without altar screens, the fact remains that a great number of pre-Romanesque screens long remained in theirplaces, even after the end of the pre-Romanesque period, so it is impossible to speak of the necessity of their removal because ofsuch chanp,es in the liturgy. Ifthe process is viewedfrom another point of view, the economic realities should be placed in the foreground. The first cycle during the Romanesque was limited to the urban communes ofDalmatia, which in thatperiod were the main factors of economic advancement and the revival of trade and exchange, while the feudal Croatian hinterland was still primarily dependent upon a natural or barter economy. This is the reason that the pre-Romanesque spo/ia first appear in the Romanesque cathedrals and other urban churches along the coast. In the Gothic period, the development of trade and exchange and the social organization ofthe communes were far more developed in comparison to the Romanesque period, and hence investment was much more common even in minor religious structures, whether in the towns or in the hinterland. In the latter, the circulation of various COinages gradually but certainly led to the increasing disrnption ofthe feudal natural economy. In Croatian historiography, this was specifically the period of the reign ofLudovic Louis I of Anjou 0342 - 82), which has been noted as a time of economic security and vitality, and also represented the period of the final ascendancy of the Gothic style in architecture. All ofthe citedfactors together resulted in a hastened dismantling ofold altar screens and the morefrequent use ofthem as spolia in new or renovated churches. The appearance of new religious orders should be noted as supporting such a concept of removal: particularly the begging orders, the Dominicans and the Franciscans, whose liturgical concept also excluded screens with pre-Romanesque characteristics being placed in front of the altar. In conclusion, the third cycle during the Baroque can be tied to two pivotal factors: the end ofthe lengthy Candian Wars 064569) marked the transferal of the Venetian-Turkish border in Dalmatia deeper into the interiOr, which partially resulted in a renewal of trade and led to an economic revival. Following thiS, investments were also revived, as were the renovation and reconstrnction of a large number of religious strnetures, in which the remaining spolia preservedfrom the former altar screens were then immurred. This process, in addition to the urban centers, also encompassed the interior qf. Dalmatia, particularly in the 18 th century after the definitive collapse of Turkish rule throughout the entire Adriatic coastal regio...|$|E
