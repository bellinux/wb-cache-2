500|$|The booklet {{contains}} outdated {{discussions of}} health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, {{seem to be more}} personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one ("I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me."). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or shouldn't be lived. An example is the poem typed on the [...] "Aye Davanita" [...] page. The song's subtitle is [...] "The song without words", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of [...] "intruder words" [...] is on the [...] "Not for You" [...] lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the Sisyphus myth ("Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock"). The lyrics to [...] "Whipping" [...] are written on a copy of a petition to Bill Clinton against [...] "pro-life" [...] killings of abortion doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for [...] "Corduroy".|$|E

"Step {{into the}} Sideshow", [...] "Falling Down", [...] "Rejection" [...] and [...] "Jonesin" [...] were all rerecorded songs that {{originally}} {{appeared on the}} band's independent releases Side Show Freaks and Rain. D'Amico stated [...] "'Falling Down' is like the epitome of 40 Below Summer. There {{was no way that}} it wasn't going to make the album. 'Jonesin' is a sick twisted tale that we <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> It's a true story. 'Sideshow' is like the anthem. It always gets the crowd going. 'Rejection'… I don't know. It's just a pretty heavy song so it made it." [...] The song [...] "Power Tool" [...] was one of the earliest pieces of music written by the band. It was originally titled [...] "Monica" [...] (in reference to the Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton scandal) but had to be changed for legal reasons.|$|E
2500|$|On May 22, 2009, a video went viral of Hamilton freestyling, {{and then}} getting {{assaulted}} by his former girlfriend/fellow rapper Briana Latrise, the stepdaughter of Mary J. Blige, due to Hamilton rapping, [...] "OK, call me irresponsible and immature, but you're beautiful, {{what the hell}} else would I hit it for? Now I can say that I hit it raw, but {{that would mean that}} you will have to get an abor, or I just not need to go there", clarifying at some point at that past time that Hamilton had got Latrise pregnant but for undisclosed reasons Latrise would have an abortion. On May 25, 2009, during an interview, they both publicly apologized to each other, with Hamilton stating, [...] "I apologize honestly for putting some things out there that shouldn't have been out there. I understand it; it was the heat of the moment, and I didn't get the chance to really talk to you about it. I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you I apologize because I know what I shouldn't have said", and with Latrise remarking, [...] "I'm going to thank you for your apology. I'm going to apologize for acting outside of the norm. We're going to talk about our personal business, on our personal time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 1988, Cox's {{campaign}} {{sent out}} a four-page political mailer to 110,000 potential Republican voters in the district, which accused Rosenberg of concealing links to Erhard and his companies and of not being fully truthful regarding his work experience. The mailer characterized Rosenberg as an [...] "est advocate". It quoted a Los Angeles magazine article which had said that the Chicago, Illinois organization Cult Awareness Network referred to Erhard's companies as [...] "destructive cults". Quotations included in the mailer said [...] "what Erhard has done is utterly disastrous". The Los Angeles magazine article cited by the mailer quotes {{a representative of the}} Cult Awareness Network who had compared the est organization to the Unification Church, Scientology, Transcendental Meditation, and Hare Krishna. The Orange County Register compared the mailer to a similar brochure sent out by Badham's 1986 campaign to voters in the district. A political consultant for Cox said that the mailer was sent out in order to point out [...] "Rosenberg's campaign tactics of concealment and distortion," [...] and stated [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the voter to be wary of anything Nathan Rosenberg says." [...] The Cox campaign also placed phone calls to voters asking for their opinions on a political candidate's links [...] "with that cult est".

5000|$|Many {{songs on}} the album take {{influence}} from poetry and literature.

Nielsen said in a radio interview in 2006 that while writing [...] "Buried a Lie" [...] he <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story. He stated that he loved crime shows such as CSI and Law and Order, and wanted to have a song like that.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{achieved}} {{much of its}} fame when it {{was performed}} by Johnny Cash in his Folsom Prison concert (At Folsom Prison).

[...] The man yelled something about [...] "Hell!" [...] and Cash answered, [...] "I know, 'hell'!" [...] When he finished the song, Cash made a comment that was largely repeated, somewhat out of context, by Joaquin Phoenix in the 2005 film Walk the Line: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that this show is being recorded for an album released on Columbia Records, so you can't say 'hell' or 'shit' or anything like that." ...|$|E

50|$|After a {{considerable}} amount of time, and while suffering incredible personal difficulties involving his wife and children—including a trial judging his fitness for custody—Kassler assumes a job at a mental hospital. There, Kassler counsels Satan, who really <b>just</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> his story <b>to</b> the good doctor.
