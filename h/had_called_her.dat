25|$|Amber Lynn Costello, 27, of North Babylon, New York, a town {{ten miles}} north of Gilgo Beach, was a sex worker and a heroin user who went missing on September 2, 2010. On the night she disappeared, she went to meet a {{stranger}} who <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> several times and offered $1,500 for her services. As of 2012, Costello's sister, Kimberly Overstreet, a call girl, has vowed {{to use the same}} Craigslist booking system as her sister in an effort to lure the killer.|$|E
25|$|In early 1960, during Castro's {{second trip}} to New York, tabloids {{reported}} that 17-year-old Marita Lorenz {{had been raped}} by the Cuban leader. She was pregnant, and Cobb later said that the father was Castro's bodyguard, Jesus Yanez Pelletier. Lorenz's mother later reported that Cobb <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> and offered her employment if she would return to Cuba with her daughter. Che Guevara conducted {{an investigation of the}} incident and Cobb was included in a roundup of the suspects. She was protected by Castro and Sánchez, but the relationship cooled and she lost the access she had had before.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, {{while on}} a visit to the Cannes Film Festival, Constantine and Woodall were the victims of gem thieves. The thieves broke into the villa on the French Riviera where they were staying, {{rendered}} Constantine and Woodall unconscious with chloroform, and then continued to steal money and jewellery. Carol Vorderman was involved in a feud with Constantine and Woodall in 2003. Vorderman commented harshly about the double-act, referring to them as 'Tranny and the Horse', based on their appearance, after they <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> an [...] "overdone Eighties nightmare" [...] and named Vorderman in their list of the 20 worst-dressed celebrities.|$|E

500|$|To support Wood's claim, {{the defence}} called Wood's mother, {{who said that}} Ledez had confided her suicidal {{intention}} to her on multiple occasions and that she feared that her husband Colin would physically harm her or Christopher. The witness also stated that Wood <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> within 24 hours of the shootings and explained the plan to her. The prosecution called Alan Wales, Wood's doctor, who testified that he advised the police to confiscate Wood's gun collection after an appointment on 11 November 1985. Wales said that Wood appeared [...] "distressed" [...] and prescribed him with antidepressants.|$|E
500|$|... {{he thought}} of him till she began to chide herself for defrauding the dead, and, {{determining}} to grieve for Ann, she dwelt on Henry's misfortune and ill health [...] [...] [...] she thought with rapture that there was {{one person in the}} world who had an affection for her, and that person she admired — had a friendship for. He <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> his dear girl [...] [...] [...] My child! His child, what an association of ideas! If I had a father, such a father! — She could not dwell on the thoughts, the wishes which obtruded themselves. Her mind was unhinged, and passion unperceived filled her whole soul.|$|E
500|$|Keyes {{was also}} criticized for {{his views on}} homosexuality. In an {{interview}} with Michelangelo Signorile, a gay radio host, Keyes defined homosexuality as centering {{in the pursuit of}} pleasure, literally [...] "selfish hedonism". When Signorile asked if Mary Cheney, Vice President Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter, fit the description and was therefore a [...] "selfish hedonist", Keyes replied, [...] "Of course she is. That goes by definition." [...] Media sources picked up on the exchange, reporting that Keyes had [...] "trashed", [...] "attacked," [...] and [...] "lashed out at" [...] Mary Cheney, and <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> a [...] "sinner"—provoking condemnation of Keyes by LGBT Republicans and several GOP leaders. Keyes noted that it was an interviewer, not he, who brought up Mary Cheney's name in the above incident, and he told reporters, [...] "You have tried to personalize the discussion of an issue that I did not personalize. The people asking me the question did so, and if that's inappropriate, blame the media. Do not blame me." ...|$|E

500|$|Alizon Device, {{her mother}} Elizabeth, {{and her brother}} James were summoned to appear before Nowell on 30 March 1612. Alizon confessed that she had sold her soul to the Devil, {{and that she had}} told him to lame John Law after he <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> a thief. Her brother, James, stated that his sister had also confessed to bewitching a local child. Elizabeth was more reticent, admitting only that her mother, Demdike, had a mark on her body, {{something}} that many, including Nowell, would have regarded as having been left by the Devil after he had sucked her blood. When questioned about Anne Whittle (Chattox), the matriarch of the other family reputedly involved in witchcraft in and around Pendle, Alizon perhaps saw an opportunity for revenge. There may have been bad blood between the two families, possibly dating from 1601, when a member of Chattox's family broke into Malkin Tower, the home of the Devices, and stole goods worth about £1, equivalent to about £100 as of 2008. Alizon accused Chattox of murdering four men by witchcraft, and of killing her father, John Device, who had died in 1601. She claimed that her father had been so frightened of Old Chattox that he had agreed to give her [...] of oatmeal each year in return for her promise not to hurt his family. The meal was handed over annually until the year before John's death; on his deathbed John claimed that his sickness had been caused by Chattox because they had not paid for protection.|$|E
500|$|As a young adult, Angelou, who {{preferred}} {{to be called}} Maya because her brother <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> {{that when she was}} a child, had a series of jobs and occupations, achieving modest success as a singer, dancer, and performer. She was a cast member of a European tour of Porgy and Bess in 1954 and 1955 and was a cabaret singer in nightclubs in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas throughout the 1950s. While performing at the Purple Onion in San Francisco, due to the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters, she changed her name from Rita Johnson to Maya Angelou, a [...] "distinctive name" [...] that set her apart and captured the feel of her calypso dance performances. In 1957, Angelou recorded her first album, Miss Calypso, which captured her focus on calypso music, popular at the time, and her years as a nightclub performer. As she described in her fourth autobiography, The Heart of a Woman (1981), Angelou eventually gave up performing for a writing career, although music remained an important aspect of her poetry. [...] In the late 1980s, she returned to music. [...] In 1988, she co-wrote a song with Roberta Flack, [...] "And So It Goes", which appeared on Flack's album Oasis. [...] Angelou collaborated with R artists Ashford & Simpson on seven of the eleven tracks of their 1996 album Been Found. [...] The album was responsible for three of Angelou's only Billboard chart appearances. [...] In 2007, she and jazz musician Wynton Marsalis wrote [...] "Music, Deep Rivers in My Soul", which traces the history of African-American music. [...] Angelou was also a fan of country music, and had written several songs.|$|E
2500|$|She {{is noted}} for another remark made to her coachman, who was {{fighting}} {{with another man}} who <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> a whore. She broke up the fight, saying, [...] "I am a whore. Find something else to fight about." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Isaac settled in Gerar, {{and when the}} men of Gerar asked Isaac about his {{beautiful}} wife, he {{said that she was}} his sister out of fear that the men might kill him on account of her. But looking out of the window, Abimelech saw Isaac fondling Rebekah, and Abimelech summoned Isaac to complain that Isaac <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> his sister. Isaac explained that he had done so to save his life. Abimelech complained that one of the people might have lain with her, and Isaac would have brought guilt upon the Philistines, and Abimelech charged the people not to molest Isaac or Rebekah, on pain of death. God blessed Isaac, who reaped bountiful harvests. The second reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|Mildred Ella Didrikson {{was born}} on June 26, 1911, the sixth of seven children, in the coastal city of Port Arthur, Texas. Her mother, Hannah, and her father, Ole Didriksen, were {{immigrants}} from Norway. Although her three eldest siblings were born in Norway, Babe and her three other siblings were born in Port Arthur. She later changed the spelling of her surname from Didriksen to Didrikson. She moved with her family to 850 Doucette in Beaumont, Texas, at age 4. She claimed to have acquired the nickname [...] "Babe" [...] (after Babe Ruth) upon hitting five home runs in a childhood baseball game, but her Norwegian mother <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> [...] "Bebe" [...] {{from the time she}} was a toddler.|$|E
2500|$|She gave {{herself the}} name Sojourner Truth in 1843 after she became {{convinced}} that God <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> {{to leave the city}} and go into the countryside [...] "testifying the hope that was in her". Her best-known speech was delivered extemporaneously, in 1851, at the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. The speech became widely known during the Civil War by the title [...] "Ain't I a Woman?," [...] a variation of the original speech re-written by someone else using a stereotypical Southern dialect; whereas Sojourner Truth was from New York and grew up speaking Dutch as her first language. During the Civil War, Truth helped recruit black troops for the Union Army; after the war, she tried unsuccessfully to secure land grants from the federal government for former slaves.|$|E

5000|$|She {{holds up}} former National MP Katherine Rich {{as one of}} her role models. Kaye's own policies, placing her in the {{socially}} liberal wing of the National Party, have been criticised by some people in her own party, where some <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> a [...] "high maintenance backbencher". Others <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> [...] "obsessive", or, in a more positive vein, [...] "driven". However, commentators have argued that her stance is unlikely to hurt her in her marginal electorate, which has traditionally voted Labour.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{comes to}} me,' she said, {{alluding}} to her father-in-law, and not choosing {{to understand that}} <b>her</b> brother should <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> husband 'Mr. Caldigate.' ...|$|R
2500|$|It was {{announced}} that Criswell's body was identified on February 11, 2015. Her estranged aunt and uncle, who at first were hoping she was still alive, eventually turned to online databases, to search through unidentified persons cases after their hope dwindled. Criswell was never reported missing by her family members, which is most likely a major reason why she remained unnamed for decades. Because of her history of running away from home, her family made the assumption that she would [...] "contact them when she wanted to," [...] as she <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> sister once after departing. The pair began to search through cases in Arizona, as they eventually learned that Criswell {{had been given a}} bus ticket by Knight to the area that she was later found dead. It is believed that the two were in a romantic relationship, although Knight was considerably older than Criswell. Knight is also believed to have purchased the bus ticket that transported the victim to Tucson, according to her family.|$|E
2500|$|Smailey {{says he has}} {{no desire}} to be hard on her, but that [...] "it is a fraud". Ruth points out he was guilty of fraud, and she has {{evidence}} to prove it. Smailey tries to buy it from her, but she's respectable now: She won't take his money, though she keeps the papers as she [...] "ain't a fool"; Smailey leaves. Fitz-Partington interviews Ruth, to her confusion. Mrs. Van Brugh re-enters, and Fitz-Partington warns her about Smailey, explaining that his detective agency was called on to find out about Smailey's fraud, but as Smailey then hired him to investigate Mrs. Van Brugh, they had combined the cases. However, Fitz-Partington goes on to ask several further questions about Mrs. Van Brugh's marriage, and she begins to realise what Smailey is looking for: if Mrs. Van Brugh's godfather <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> Captain Van Brugh's wife in his will, her secret might be revealed. Smailey returns with the will, and reads out the relevant section about the farm, ending with the section referring to her as [...] "Catherine Ellen, wife of Captain Richard Van Brugh." [...] She faints into a chair.|$|E
