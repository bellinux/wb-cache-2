5|$|Invertebrate <b>introductions</b> {{have had}} an {{observable}} effect on Puerto Rican fauna. Native freshwater snails such as Physa cubensis have been adversely affected by introduced species. Currently, the most abundant freshwater snail in Puerto Rico is the Quilted Melania (Tarebia granifera), an introduced species. Another invertebrate introduced to Puerto Rico is the honeybee. This animal competes with the endangered Puerto Rican parrot for secondary nesting cavities at the Caribbean National Forest. Africanized bees, which pose an even greater threat for secondary cavity nesters, have recently extended their range to Puerto Rico. Other <b>introductions</b> include 18 species of ant, {{one of the most}} abundant taxa in leaf litter habitats.|$|E

40|$|Since the <b>introduction</b> of the seven-valent pneumococcal {{conjugate}} vaccine (PCV 7) in 2007, invasive pneumococcal {{disease has}} declined, but the incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19 A has risen worldwide. The present study examined changes in the features of invasive pneumococcal disease since the <b>introduction</b> of the PCV 7 in Kochi, Japan. Pediatric cases of invasive pneumococcal disease were investigated before and after vaccine <b>introduction</b> (January 2008 to December 2013). Cases of invasive pneumococcal disease tended to decrease after PCV 7 <b>introduction.</b> In addition, before <b>introduction</b> of the vaccine, most serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease were those included in the vaccine. However, after the <b>introduction,</b> we found cases infected by serotypes not covered by vaccine. Penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae was the predominant serotype causing invasive pneumococcal disease before <b>introduction</b> of the PCV 7, and the susceptibility of this serotype to antibiotics improved after vaccine <b>introduction.</b> Serotype isolates identified after vaccine <b>introduction</b> were also relatively susceptible to antibiotic therapy, but decreased susceptibility is expected...|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded <b>introductions</b> were to Barbados and Martinique. The Barbados <b>introductions</b> {{were focused}} on the biological control of pests damaging the sugarcane crops, and while the toads became abundant, they have done even less to control the pests than in Australia. The toad was introduced to Martinique from French Guiana before 1944 and became established. Today, they reduce the mosquito and mole cricket populations. A third introduction to the region occurred in 1884, when toads appeared in Jamaica, reportedly imported from Barbados to help control the rodent population. While they had no {{significant effect on the}} rats, they nevertheless became well established. Other <b>introductions</b> include the release on Antiguapossibly before 1916, although this initial population may have died out by 1934 and been reintroduced at a later date and Montserrat, which had an introduction before 1879 that led to the establishment of a solid population, which was apparently sufficient to survive the Soufrière Hills volcano eruption in 1995.|$|E
