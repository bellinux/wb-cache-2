5|$|Radner died on 24 March 2015 {{along with}} her husband Sascha Schenk, their two-year-old son Felix, and her {{colleague}} Oleg Bryjak, when Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed near Prads-Haute-Bléone, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, France. The pilot had a history of depression, had barricaded himself <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> and steered the plane into the mountains. They were en route to Düsseldorf after Radner's and Bryjak's two performances in Wagner's Siegfried at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistani negotiators {{inadvertently}} {{reveal the}} name of radio engineer Ali, whom the hijackers bring to the cockpit to use the radio for negotiations. Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers drag on, the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was in {{good health}} {{for most of his}} life. He {{retained}} a private pilot's license well into his 80s, eventually quitting flying {{when he and his wife}} found it too difficult to get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> due to knee problems. In June 2014, Glenn underwent successful heart valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. In early December 2016, he was hospitalized at the James Cancer Hospital of Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. According to a family source, Glenn had been in declining health, and his condition was grave; his wife and their children and grandchildren were at the hospital.|$|E
50|$|Ruggedized HMDs are {{increasingly}} being integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> of modern helicopters and fighter aircraft. These are usually fully integrated with the pilot's flying helmet and may include protective visors, night vision devices, and displays of other symbology.|$|R
50|$|Bolivia's Directorate General of Civil Aviation {{opened an}} {{investigation}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> accident. <b>The</b> <b>cockpit</b> voice recorder and {{flight data recorder}} were recovered from the wreckage and sent to Brazil for analysis.|$|R
5000|$|The jetliner hit {{the ground}} at 140 mph, with a descent rate of [...] Upon impact, the Boeing 727 broke up <b>into</b> several sections, <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> being torn off the fuselage.|$|R
5|$|During {{the first}} leg of the flight, at about 15:00, Keč, wearing a winter coat, got up from his seat and walked {{to the front of the}} aircraft. A flight {{attendant}} stopped him. After talking for a short while, and another flight attendant came by, he was let <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> No information about the hijacking was given to the passengers until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø Main Air Station, the military section. After landing, by order of the hijacker, the passengers were informed that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had happened, there were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 and headed for Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|E
5|$|Krusty, {{refusing to}} submit to Bob's demands, takes refuge in a civil defense shack in the desert, which he uses to {{transmit}} a heavily improvised show. Bart and Lisa find their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> of the Duff Blimp, where Bob, having lost his patience thanks to Krusty, tries to detonate the bomb, {{which turns out to}} be a dud. Lisa alerts the police to Bob's location, but Bob deflates the blimp and kidnaps Bart, before stealing the original Wright Brothers aircraft, which had been an exhibit at the air show. Bob attempts to carry out a kamikaze attack against the civil defense shack where Krusty is hiding, but the slow-moving plane ends up merely bouncing harmlessly off the shack. The authorities quickly arrest Bob and take him into custody while Bart is reunited with his family.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first effective anti-aircraft missiles by the late 1950s changed this picture dramatically. Missiles could stand ready for immediate launch, eliminating operational delays like {{the time needed to}} get the pilot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> of a fighter. Guidance did not require wide-area tracking or calculation of an intercept course: a simple comparison of the time needed to fly to the altitude of the target returned the required deflection. Missiles also had greater altitude capability than any aircraft, and improving this to adapt to new aircraft was a low-cost development path. The US was aware of Soviet work in the field, and had reduced the expected operational lifetime of the U-2, knowing that it would become vulnerable to these missiles as they were improved. This later happened with the 1960 downing of the U-2 flown by Gary Powers.|$|E
50|$|The Force 5 {{is a small}} one-design racing {{sailboat}} that {{is similar}} to the more well known Laser but with a hard chine aft. Although it is designed for single-handed racing, two people can easily fit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> large <b>cockpit.</b> <b>The</b> boats are currently built in Long Island, New York by Weeks Yacht Yard.|$|R
5000|$|Raffaele Marciello {{returns to}} the Trident outfit for the Austria round, in place of Sergio Canamasas, who will race for Rapax Team instead. This results in Johnny Cecotto Jr. without a seat for this round while the ART Grand Prix regular Alexander Albon is back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> #8 <b>cockpit.</b>|$|R
50|$|The DC-9 then slammed {{onto the}} grass strip between the runway and the taxiway. 60 meters from the first impact point, the {{empennage}} struck a concrete drainage culvert. The aircraft disintegrated and burst <b>into</b> flames. <b>The</b> <b>cockpit</b> and <b>the</b> forward fuselage broke off from its main body and slid along the taxiway, creating a total trail of wreckage of 120 meters.|$|R
5|$|On 20 February 1942 Finucane flew a two-Spitfire sortie to Dunkirk, France. The {{last few}} days had been {{monotonous}} and Finucane was eager to fly and asked Dick Lewis—a 29-year old Australian who had put his age down so he was accepted for pilot training—to fly as his wingman. At 10:55 GMT Finucane took off and headed over Manston toward France. Off the coast, they strafed a small ship and turned north to return home. Finucane spotted two aircraft taking off from Mardyck but lost sight of them. Both Spitfires dropped to sea level. Minutes later two enemy fighters came towards them. They were identified as Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. The Fw 190 had a higher performance than the Spitfire V in all departments other than turning circle and was more heavily armed. Finucane scored hits on the first Fw 190's wing but the enemy quickly gained the advantage and Finucane's Spitfire was hit with six machine gun rounds which blew a piece of fuselage <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> and into his leg. Blood loss induced dizziness and Lewis protected his leader from six more astern attacks. In the last attack the two Fw 190s came from opposite directions. Lewis was able to claim one shot down and the other gave up over the mid-Channel. They taxied to 452's dispersal where Finucane passed out after shutting down the engine. On 2 March Finucane went on leave after spending over a week in hospital. No claim or loss was recorded by JG 26, the resident German fighter unit.|$|E
25|$|On February 2016 a Virgin Atlantic {{flight from}} Heathrow to New York JFK Airport {{was forced to}} turn back when a laser beam was shone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> The {{incident}} led BALPA to call for lasers to be classified as offensive weapons.|$|E
25|$|Entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> and {{passenger}} cabin {{were from the}} upper surface of the wing center section. Access was through bi-fold doors latched at the bottom. Both doors were equipped with a center hinge allowing the doors, when opened, to lay folded onto the upper surface of the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|Originally Taylor {{tested the}} boat on Walker Lake in Nevada but his backers demanded a more {{accessible}} location, so Taylor switched to Lake Tahoe. An attempt {{was set for}} 13 November 1980, but when conditions on the lake proved unfavourable, Taylor decided against trying for the record. Not wanting to disappoint the assembled spectators and media, he decided to do a test run instead. At 432 km/h (270 mph) Discovery II started to become unstable. It has been speculated {{that it may have}} hit a swell. Whatever the cause, the boat's unstable lateral oscillations caused the left float to collapse, sending <b>the</b> boat plunging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water. <b>The</b> <b>cockpit</b> section with Taylor's body was recovered three days later. <b>The</b> <b>cockpit</b> had not floated as intended and Taylor drowned as a result.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cockpit</b> was {{significantly}} altered for the Comet 4's introduction, on which an improved layout {{focusing on the}} onboard navigational suite was introduced. An EKCO E160 radar unit was installed in the Comet 4's nose cone, providing search functions as well as ground and cloud mapping capabilities, and a radar interface was built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Comet 4 <b>cockpit</b> along with redesigned instruments.|$|R
25|$|In response, the RAF readied all Tempests and Spitfires {{to attack}} any IAF {{aircraft}} they encountered and bomb IAF airfields. British {{troops in the}} Middle East were placed on high alert with all leave cancelled, and British citizens were advised to leave Israel. The Royal Navy was also placed on high alert. At Hatzor Airbase, the general consensus among the pilots, most of whom had flown with or alongside the RAF during World War II, was that the RAF would not allow the loss of five aircraft and two pilots to go without retaliation, and would probably attack the base at dawn the next day. That night, in anticipation of an impending British attack, some pilots decided not to offer any resistance and left the base, while others prepared their Spitfires and were strapped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> at dawn, preparing to repel a retaliatory airstrike. However, despite pressure from the squadrons involved in the incidents, British commanders refused to authorize any retaliatory strikes.|$|R
25|$|It was {{reported}} that the first officer survived the accident but rescuers were unable to reach him via the cockpit door due to security measures introduced {{in the wake of}} the September 11, 2001 attacks. The rescuers eventually cut their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> through the roof, by which time the first officer had died.|$|E
25|$|On 17 November 2002, Tawfiq Fukra, a twenty-three-year-old Israeli Arab, {{attempted}} to hijack an El Al flight from Tel Aviv to Istanbul. He was reportedly {{armed with a}} pocket knife, and {{attempted to}} break <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> in order to fly the aircraft back to Israel and crash it into a building. He was apprehended by on-board security personnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{navigation}} equipment developed at McCook Field took the concept {{one step further}} by wiring the RDF receiver <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> instrument panel. Three lights provided visual cues to the pilot: a red light that illuminated when the aircraft {{was left of the}} airway, a green light when it was to the right, and a white light between them that indicated on course when steadily lit.|$|E
50|$|The Bournemouth Aviation Museum is an {{aviation}} museum located next to Bournemouth International Airport, {{near the village}} of Hurn in Christchurch. It houses a number of aircraft, aero engines, cockpits and a double-decker bus. Unusually for such a museum, its policy is to have open cockpits and visitors are encouraged to climb <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> and press knobs, turn dials, pull levers, flick switches, etc. Cockpits open in this manner include the Vulcan, Lightning and Canberra. It has a flight simulator which is free to use, operated from a mock up <b>cockpit.</b> <b>The</b> museum has recently restored a Boeing 737-200 named 'The Spirit of Peter Bath' and has created an exhibition about Sir Peter Bath and his company 'Bath Travel' inside the fuselage. It is believed that Bournemouth Aviation Museum is the only museum in Europe to include a 737-200 in its collection. Even more recently the museum has taken ownership of the forward fuselage of an ex Empire Test Pilots School BAC 1-11, quite apt considering the aircraft was built only a few hundred metres from where it rests now.|$|R
25|$|The Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC/МАК) of the Commonwealth of Independent States {{opened an}} {{investigation}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> accident. Both <b>cockpit</b> voice recorder and {{flight data recorder}} were recovered. МАК stated that it had downloaded information from both instruments.|$|R
2500|$|Evidence of Darlwynes history {{confirmed}} Barratt as {{its legal}} owner. [...] The court noted the general {{state of the}} vessel and the various alterations that had been carried out, affecting its seaworthiness. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> floor was not watertight and had inadequate scuppers, so that water entering <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> [...] drained <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lower hull rather than back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea. Lacking watertight bulkheads, the hull would easily flood with any rapid ingress of water. The hull itself showed evidence of dry rot and other external damage. Poor communication between the various parties concerned with the vessel in the preceding months meant that these various shortcomings had been overlooked or ignored. Furthermore, the overloading of the vessel with 31 people meant that she lay low in the water, so that a modest heel of 30 degrees would allow water <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open <b>cockpit.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 28 March 2000, a Boeing 737-300 of Germania (registration D-AGES) {{operating}} a charter flight {{on behalf of}} LTU from Tenerife South Airport to Schönefeld {{was the subject of}} an attempted hijack in mid-flight. A passenger forced his way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> where he attacked the pilot, leading to a sudden loss of altitude. The perpetrator was restrained and the flight continued to Berlin.|$|E
25|$|The right-front {{wheel and}} {{suspension}} {{are believed to}} have been sent back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> striking Senna {{on the right side of}} his helmet, forcing his head back against the headrest. In addition, a piece of the upright assembly, most likely a tie rod, penetrated the helmet visor, which was a new, thinner version, above his right eye. Senna sustained fatal skull fractures, brain injuries and a ruptured temporal artery.|$|E
25|$|On a ride {{during the}} winter of 1931 her plane was in a flat spin and would have crashed. She climbed out of the cockpit {{preparing}} to parachute but her weight on the wing tilted the aircraft enough to take her out of the spin. She climbed back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> and regained control at 200 feet. This got her a job at Viking as a spokeswoman. In 1931 she also received her transport license.|$|E
50|$|Evidence of Darlwynes history {{confirmed}} Barratt as {{its legal}} owner. The court noted the various alterations {{that had been}} carried out from time to time, and concluded that on 31 July 1966 she {{was not in a}} seaworthy state.

50|$|The F.370 was a low-wing {{monoplane}} {{that first}} flew on the 22 April 1933. Powered by a Farman 8 Vee-piston engine it had streamlined features, including a shallow fin faired <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open <b>cockpit</b> headrest and fixed main monowheel landing gear faired <b>into</b> <b>the</b> engine and oil radiators of the engine. It was entered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 1933 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe air race {{in which it}} averaged over 300 km/h (187 mph), on the fifth circuit the engine overheated and the F.370 withdrew from the race.|$|R
25|$|Ridley {{corrected}} {{a problem}} with over-sensitive controls on the F-86E Sabre, which was still unsolved after several test flights. Waiting until night had fallen, Ridley led a team of engineers into a darkened hangar. There, he placed a flashlight on the horizontal tail and climbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> The flashlight beam, moving across the hangar door {{in response to his}} control inputs, easily revealed a lag problem, which could soon be corrected.|$|E
25|$|Stanger {{fell ill}} {{while he was}} aloft {{on one of his}} October sorties. He landed on a handy {{airfield}} and shut down his plane's engine before realizing he had landed on an Austro-Hungarian strip. His only chance to escape any enemy soldiers investigating the racket of an untimely landing was to restart his engine and fly away. The customary method for starting an engine was for a ground crew member to yank the propeller as a lever to crank the engine, while a pilot sat at the controls. Stanger's solution was to remove his boots and chock the landing gear tires with the footwear. He then cranked the prop, started the engine, circled about the rotating blades, clambered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> and departed. The fate of the boots is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Zorner {{claimed his}} 7th victory on 28/29 June {{southeast}} of Antwerp, Belgium at 02:20. It was recorded as a Halifax bomber. Another Wellington was claimed southwest of Sint-Truiden at 01:09. Zorner achieved his 10th victory west of Malmedy at 01:53. Zorner's 11th victory {{was shot down}} northeast of Groningen at 03:54 on 24/24 July. His victim was Halifax R5573 flown by Flight Sergeant Kenneth Hector Wally McLean from No. 106 Squadron RAF. Zorner saw the Halifax crash and explode {{which resulted in a}} fire-work display of green, red and white flashes. They assumed the aircraft to be a pathfinder, and the flashes exploding flares. Soon afterwards Zorner and his crewman had to abandon the Bf110G-4 because an engine caught fire. Zorner extinguished the fire but he could no longer calibrate the propeller pitch to a glide setting. The other power plant could not cope with the added workload and the Bf110 began to lose height. Zorner ordered his crew to leave. Zorner struggled to exit as his parachute snagged. He managed to clamber back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> and lower the flaps which slowed the aircraft and afforded him time to unhook the parachute from the strengthening beam in the cockpit and parachute to safety.|$|E
5000|$|Slingsby {{joined the}} Royal Flying Corps in 1914 as a gunner/observer. On one sortie {{the pilot was}} killed. Slingsby climbed out of his gun {{position}} and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pilot's <b>cockpit</b> and regained control of the aircraft. He flew the aircraft back to the British lines. For this, {{he was awarded the}} Military Medal. After he left the service, now the RAF, in 1920, he bought a partnership in a wood-working and furniture factory in Queen Street, Scarborough.|$|R
50|$|On 6 December 2015 {{players and}} staff of RK Vojvodina were {{travelling}} with plane from Portugal, where RK Vojvodina had lost an 2015-16_EHF_Champions_League game against FC Porto (handball)), back to Serbia. When {{one of the}} passengers, Jordanian citizen with an American passport, tried to break <b>into</b> <b>the</b> plane's <b>cockpit,</b> he was tackled by Rastvortsev and Milan Mirković, club's assistant coach. The passenger stayed calm {{for the rest of}} the flight, but he was observed by the player and the coach.|$|R
5|$|The aerial {{operation}} had {{a considerable}} effect in strangling Axis logistics. The supplies reaching Axis units dwindled, and the Axis armies and air units remaining in Tunisia gradually {{ran out of}} fuel, ammunition and other supplies. Having lost most of its airbases, the Luftwaffe also evacuated most of its units. By early May 1943, only the Italian fighter units, and one German Gruppe (I. JG 77), remained as the Axis held on to a narrow strip of African coastline near Tunis. Allied air superiority was so overwhelming, that Luftwaffe personnel climbed into fighter fuselages, or squeezed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> of Bf 109s alongside the pilot rather than risk flying in transport aircraft. Most ground crew and pilots attempted to escape this way. Flying large numbers of personnel in one go and by transport was too dangerous; 16 personnel {{were killed in a}} crash on 29 or 30 April. The last transport missions were flown on 4 May, in which 117 tons of fuel and ammunition was brought in. Some supply drops were attempted (by II./Kampfgeschwader 1), but most of the remaining signals, FlaK, transport and administrative staff left were captured when the campaign ended on 13 May 1943.|$|R
