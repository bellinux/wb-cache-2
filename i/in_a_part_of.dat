5|$|Daedalus– A {{brilliant}} architect, Daedalus {{constructed the}} labyrinth in which Pandora was imprisoned after Zeus discovered her existence. Zeus also promised to reunite Daedelus {{with his son}} Icarus as a reward, but never revealed that Icarus was already dead. Kratos encountered Daedalus hanging <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the labyrinth and the architect revealed that the labyrinth must be united to free Pandora. Daedelus was killed when Kratos united the labyrinth and left a message in blood encouraging Kratos to get even with Zeus for him. The character was voiced by Malcolm McDowell in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|John Hancock {{was born}} on January 23, 1737 in Braintree, Massachusetts <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> town that {{eventually}} became the separate city of Quincy. He {{was the son of}} Col. John Hancock Jr. of Braintree and Mary Hawke Thaxter (widow of Samuel Thaxter Junior), who was from nearby Hingham. As a child, Hancock became a casual acquaintance of young John Adams, whom the Reverend Hancock had baptized in 1735. The Hancocks lived a comfortable life, and owned one slave to help with household work.|$|E

5|$|All {{apprentices}} were to {{be educated}} in reading, writing and arithmetic {{for the first four}} years of their apprenticeship. The Act specified that this should be done every working day within usual working hours but did not state how much time should be set aside for it. Educational classes should be held <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the mill or factory designed for the purpose. Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices {{were to be}} taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed.|$|E
5|$|Gwyneth {{stands in}} the middle of an arch and opens the rift, {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth is much greater than anticipated, and their true motive is revealed: they intend to kill the living to give themselves more hosts and take over the planet. One of the animated bodies strangles Sneed to death, allowing another Gelth to possess his body. Dickens flees the parlour, and Rose and the Doctor are trapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the basement. Outside, Dickens realises that the beings are affected by gas and returns to the house. He extinguishes the gaslights and turns the gas on full, pulling the Gelth out of the bodies. The Doctor tells Gwyneth to send the Gelth back and close the rift, but she cannot close it or leave. Instead she takes out a box of matches, intending to ignite the gas and kill the Gelth along with herself. The Doctor determines that Gwyneth is already dead, and that by opening the rift, she had doomed herself. The Doctor, Rose, and Dickens flee the parlour just before it explodes and burns, killing Gwyneth and the Gelth.|$|E
5|$|HD {{affects the}} whole brain, but certain areas are more {{vulnerable}} than others. The most prominent early effects are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the basal ganglia called the neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen. Other areas affected include the substantia nigra, layers 3, 5 and 6 of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus {{and parts of the}} thalamus. These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells. Striatal spiny neurons are the most vulnerable, particularly ones with projections towards the external globus pallidus, with interneurons and spiny cells projecting to the internal pallidum being less affected. HD also causes an abnormal increase in astrocytes and activation of the brain's immune cells, microglia.|$|E

5|$|Monarchs often pledged various {{items of}} state regalia as {{collateral}} for loans throughout the Middle Ages. At {{some point in}} the 14thcentury, all of the state regalia were moved to the White Tower at the Tower of London due to a series of successful and attempted thefts <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Westminster Abbey that housed state regalia. The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey. Arches topped with a monde and cross were added to images of StEdward's Crown by the time of HenryIV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor HenryV. Known as a closed or imperial crown, the arches symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{took up the}} {{environmental}} cause of her birthplace, the Lord Howe Island, in 1982, when it was listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Though the islanders were pleased with the heritage status accorded to the island, Sinclair was unhappy {{with many of the}} planning and management actions initiated by the Government of Australia to conserve the newly accorded heritage status, as it affected the basic rights of the islanders. Her objections were to the cutting of pine trees planted in the 19th century; she considered these trees (though not indigenous) as part of the island's heritage. When the trees were being felled she threatened to lie down between the trees to stop the tree cutters. Her argument was that the trees added to the aesthetic beauty of the island. She also objected to the neglect of maintenance of embankments that were built to extend the airport on the island, as the embankments were eroding. She objected to the garbage that was being dumped in the lagoon of the island as it was causing health hazards. The management plan proposed by the government to preserve the island's heritage status envisaged restricting the tourist accommodation to about 400 and limiting the number of cars on the island to 100, which she objected for the reason that it was limiting the opportunities to the islanders who had lived there for many years. Another of her protests was on the creation of an aquatic reserve <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the island. She considered this action as detrimental to the fishing rights of the local people who had fished in the area for several years. All her objections resulted in the Ministry of Planning and Environment agreeing to address the issues she had raised. In 1967, she worked in the Prime Minister's Department and dealt with public relations and facilitated the Montreal Expo.|$|E
5|$|Stafford repaid the king's {{generosity}} {{by serving}} him faithfully {{as a local}} commissioner, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the country that had up until that point been fiercely Lancastrian. Throughout the 1460s he presided at Quarter Sessions and other courts all over the West Country. His activities were not limited to legal commissions; in 1461–2 he performed military service against the Scots, and in 1468 he conducted diplomacy with Brittany. In 1469 he {{was admitted to the}} Royal Council, and served on the commission that convicted Henry Courtenay, Thomas Courtenay's brother, for treason. According to the chronicler John Warkworth, Henry's downfall was due to the machinations of Stafford, who was rewarded with further land and the earldom of Devon on 17 May 1469. However, the king himself took great interest in the trial against Courtenay, and it is more reasonable to see the decision as a result of Edward's need for a loyal agent in the region.|$|E

5|$|The see of Philadelphia {{had been}} vacant {{since the death}} of Bishop Michael Francis Egan in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it. Archbishop John Carroll of Baltimore, whose {{province}} included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, Louis de Barth) had turned the job down. Part of the delay was logistical—Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province—but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the nation with few Catholics. There was also a significant dispute (known as trusteeism) over the rights of churches' lay trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization. In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.|$|E
5|$|The story {{focuses on}} the {{activities}} of the three species <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Milky Way known as the Koprulu Sector. Millennia before any of the events of the games, a species known as the Xel'Naga genetically engineer the Protoss and later the Zerg in attempts to create pure beings. These experiments backfire and the Xel'Naga are largely destroyed by the Zerg. Centuries before the beginning of StarCraft in 2499, the hardline international government of Earth, the United Earth Directorate (UED), commissions a colonization program as part of a solution to overpopulation, however the computers automating the colony ships malfunction, propelling the Terran colonists far off course to the edge of Protoss space. Out of contact with Earth, they form various factions to maintain their interests. Intrigued by the behavior and mentality of the Terrans, the Protoss remain hidden to examine the humans, while protecting them from other threats without their knowledge. The Zerg, however, target the Terrans for assimilation to harness their psionic potential, forcing the Protoss to destroy tainted Terran colonies to contain the Zerg infestation.|$|E
5|$|Twelve players born {{outside the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the United States, plus two players born in U.S. insular areas (territories), have made either the first or second All-Defensive Team—Manute Bol, born <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Sudan that is now the independent nation of South Sudan; Hakeem Olajuwon of Nigeria; Patrick Ewing of Jamaica; Dikembe Mutombo of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Andrei Kirilenko, born in the portion of the former Soviet Union that is now Russia; Anderson Varejão of Brazil; Thabo Sefolosha of Switzerland; Duncan and Raja Bell of the U.S. Virgin Islands; Luol Deng, a naturalized citizen of the United Kingdom born in what is now South Sudan; Serge Ibaka, born in the Republic of the Congo and naturalized in Spain; Marc Gasol, born and primarily raised in Spain; Rudy Gobert of France; and Giannis Antetokoumpo of Greece. Ewing, Olajuwon, and Kirilenko are naturalized U.S. citizens, and Duncan and Bell are U.S. citizens by birth, but they are still considered international players by the NBA because they were not born in one of the fifty states or Washington, D.C.|$|E
