40|$|ABSTRACT: The flow of deep-sea {{turbidity}} {{currents in}} meandering channels {{has been of}} considerable recent interest. Here {{we focus on the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> associated with a subaqueous bottom current in a meandering channel. For simplicity, a saline bottom current {{can be used as a}} surrogate for a turbidity current driven by a dilute suspension of fine-grained sediment that does not easily settle out. In the case of open-channel flow, i. e., rivers, the classical Rozovskiian paradigm is often invoked to explain <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> in meandering channels. This paradigm indicates that the near-bottom <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> in a bend is directed inward, i. e., toward the inner bank. It has recently been suggested based on experimental and theoretical considerations, however, that this pattern is reversed in the case of subaqueous bottom flows in meandering channels, so that the near-bottom <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> is directed outward (reversed <b>secondary</b> <b>flow),</b> towards the outer bank. Experimental results presented here, on the other hand, indicate near-bottom <b>secondary</b> <b>flows</b> that have the same direction as observed in a river (normal <b>secondary</b> <b>flow).</b> The implication is an apparent contradiction between experimental results.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Flow mechanisms of compound meandering channels are recognised {{to be far more}} complicated than compound straight channels. The compound meandering channels are mainly characterised by the continuous variation of mean and turbulent flow parameters along a meander wavelength; the existence of horizontal shear layer at the bankfull level and the presence of strong helical <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> circulations in the streamwise direction. The <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> circulations are very important as they govern the advection of flow momentum, distort isovels, and influence bed shear stress, thus producing a complicated and fully three-dimensional turbulent flow structures. A great deal of experiments has been conducted in the past, which explains flow mechanisms, mixing patterns and the behaviour of <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> circulations. However, a complete understanding of <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> structures still remains far from conclusive mainly because the <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> structures are influenced by the host of geometrical and flow parameters, which are yet to be investigated in detail. The three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and continuity equations were solved using a standard Computational Fluid Dynamics solver to predict mean velocity, <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> and turbulent kinetic energy. Five different flow cases of various model scales and relative depths were considered. Detailed analyses of the measured and predicted flow variables were carried out to understand mean flow mechanisms and turbulent <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> structures in compound meandering channels. The streamwise vorticity equation was used to quantify the complex and three-dimensional behaviour of <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> circulations in terms of their generation, development and decay along the half-meander wavelength. The turbulent kinetic energy equation was used to understand energy expense mechanisms of <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> circulations. The strengths of <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> circulations were calculated and compared for different flow cases considered. The main findings from this research are as follows. The shearing of the main channel flow as the floodplain flow plunges into and over the main channel influences the mean and turbulent flow structures particularly in the crossover region. The horizontal shear layer at the inner bankfull level generates <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> circulations. As the depth of flow increases, the point of generation of <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> circulations moves downstream. The secondary shear stress significantly contributes towards the generation of streamwise vorticity and the production of turbulent kinetic energy. The rate of turbulence kinetic energy production was found to be higher than the rate of its dissipation in the crossover region, which demonstrates that the turbulence extracts more energy from the mean flu...|$|R

40|$|In fully {{developed}} single-phase turbulent flow in straight pipes, {{it is known}} that mean motions can occur in the plane of the pipe cross-section, when the cross-section is non-circular, or when the wall roughness is non-uniform around the circumference of a circular pipe. This phenomenon is known as <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> of the second kind and is associated with the anisotropy in the Reynolds stress tensor in the pipe cross-section. In this work, we show, using careful laser Doppler anemometry experiments, that <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> of the second kind can also be promoted by a non-uniform non-axisymmetric particle-forcing, in a {{fully developed}} turbulent flow in a smooth circular pipe. In order to isolate the particle-forcing from other phenomena, and to prevent the occurrence of mean particle-forcing in the pipe cross-section, which could promote a different type of <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> (<b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> of the first kind), we consider a simplified well-defined situation: a non-uniform distribution of particles, kept at fixed positions in the ‘bottom’ part of the pipe, mimicking, in a way, the particle or droplet distribution in horizontal pipe flows. Our results show that the particles modify the turbulence through ‘direct’ effects (associated with the wake of the particles) and ‘indirect’ effects (associated with the global balance of momentum and the turbulence dynamics). The resulting anisotropy in the Reynolds stress tensor is shown to promote four <b>secondary</b> <b>flow</b> cells in the pipe cross-section.
