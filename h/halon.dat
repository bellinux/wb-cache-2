5|$|A {{number of}} gaseous or highly {{volatile}} brominated halomethane compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use {{has been greatly}} curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include bromochloromethane (<b>Halon</b> 1011, CH2BrCl), bromochlorodifluoromethane (<b>Halon</b> 1211, CBrClF2), and bromotrifluoromethane (<b>Halon</b> 1301, CBrF3).|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{involved the}} accidental triggering {{of a fire}} extinguishing system which sealed two forward compartments and released <b>Halon</b> 2402 (freon R-114B2), dibromotetrafluoroethane gas into them. According to survivors, those affected by the gas release were caught off guard and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in. Some of the victims were reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated.|$|E

New Deal Studios constructed a miniature of the paddle steamer that is seen upturned in the film. Kerner Optical built a miniature of the alien ship and bluescreen stand-ins.

Other agents were added to suppress the methanol flare up, such as chlorobromomethane (CBM), <b>Halon</b> 2402, and <b>Halon</b> 1211, with varied success. <b>Halon</b> 1211 was the most successful, and the combined TMB pressurized with <b>halon</b> 1211 and nitrogen was called Boralon was used experimentally by the Los Alamos National Laboratory for use on atomic metals, using sealed cylinder extinguishers made by Metalcraft and Graviner which eliminated the moisture contamination problem.

Considerations for <b>halon</b> replacement include human toxicity when used in confined spaces, ozone depleting potential, and greenhouse warming potential. The three recommended agents meet minimum performance standards, but uptake has been slow because of disadvantages. Specifically, they require two to three times the concentration to extinguish a fire compared with <b>Halon</b> 1211. They are heavier than <b>halon,</b> require a larger bottle because they are less effective, and have greenhouse gas potential. Research continues to find better alternatives.|$|E

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{records of}} four <b>halons,</b> H- 1211 (CBrClF 2 ), H- 1301 (CBrF 3 ), H- 2402 (CBrF 2 CBrF 2 ) and H- 1202 (CBr 2 F 2 ), measured from air collected at Cape Grim, Tasmania between 1978 and 2011, are reported. Mixing ratios of H- 1211, H- 2402 and H- 1202 {{began to decline}} {{in the early to}} mid- 2000 s but those of H- 1301 continue to increase throughout the record. These trends are compared to those reported by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Experiment). The continued increase of H- 1301 mixing ratios means that the contribution of the <b>halons</b> to total tropospheric bromine is not declining. Top-down global annual emissions of the <b>halons</b> were derived using a two-dimensional atmospheric model. The emissions of all four have decreased since peaking in the late 1980 s–mid 1990 s but this decline has slowed recently, particularly for H- 1301 and H- 2402 which have shown no decrease in emissions over the past five years. The UEA top-down model derived emissions are compared to those reported using a top-down approach by NOAA and AGAGE and the bottom-up estimates of HTOC (<b>Halons</b> Technical Options Committee). Additionally results are presented that suggest that H- 1202 emissions are linked to H- 1211 emissions rather than H- 1211 production. Finally revised steady state atmospheric lifetimes are reported as 14 yr for H- 1211, 75 yr for H- 1301, 17 yr for H- 2402 and 2. 6 yr for H- 1202. These revised lifetimes would reduce the estimated existing bank of H- 1211 by over 80 % to 10 Gg while increasing the H- 1301 bank by 15 % to 49 Gg...|$|R

25|$|During World War II, various chloroalkanes were in {{standard}} use in military aircraft, although these early halons suffered from excessive toxicity. Nevertheless, {{after the war}} they slowly became more common in civil aviation as well. In the 1960s, fluoroalkanes and bromofluoroalkanes became available and were quickly recognized as being highly effective fire-fighting materials. Much early research with <b>Halon</b> 1301 was conducted {{under the auspices of}} the US Armed Forces, while <b>Halon</b> 1211 was, initially, mainly developed in the UK. By the late 1960s they were standard in many applications where water and dry-powder extinguishers posed a threat of damage to the protected property, including computer rooms, telecommunications switches, laboratories, museums and art collections. Beginning with warships, in the 1970s, bromofluoroalkanes also progressively came to be associated with rapid knockdown of severe fires in confined spaces with minimal risk to personnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{agent is}} emptied and {{depressurized}} and the valve is removed.

CO2 types have the test information stamped on the cylinder, all other types get a sticker {{on the back of}} the cylinder. Once dry, the units are recharged. Unlike the UK, the US does not rebuild extinguishers and replace valves at specific intervals unless parts are found to be defective, with the exception of <b>halon.</b> <b>Halon</b> types are often given new o-rings and valve stems at every internal maintenance to minimize any leakage potential.|$|E
