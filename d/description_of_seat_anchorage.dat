40|$|This (seat) {{attribute}} {{target list}} and Design for Comfort taxonomy report {{is based on}} the literature review report (C 3 - 21, Milestone 1), which specified different areas (factors) with specific influence on automotive seat comfort. The attribute target list summarizes seat factors established in the literature review (Figure 1) and subsumes detailed attributes derived from the literature findings within these factors/classes. The attribute target list (Milestone 2) then provides the basis for the “Design for Comfort” taxonomy (Milestone 3) and helps the project develop target settings (values) that will be measured during the testing phase of the C 3 - 21 project. The attribute target list will become the core technical <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> attributes, to be incorporated into the final comfort procedure that will be developed. The Attribute Target List and Design for Comfort Taxonomy complete the target definition process. They specify the context, markets and application (vehicle classes) for seat development. As multiple markets are addressed, the target setting requires flexibility of variables to accommodate the selected customer range. These ranges will be consecutively filled with data in forthcoming studies. The taxonomy includes how and where the targets are derived, reference points and standards, engineering and subjective data from previous studies as well as literature findings. The comfort parameters are ranked to identify which targets, variables or metrics have the biggest influence on comfort. Comfort areas included are seat kinematics (adjustability), seat geometry and pressure distribution (static comfort), seat thermal behavior and noise/vibration transmissibility (cruise comfort) and eventually material properties, design and features (seat harmony). Data from previous studies is fine tuned and will be validated in the nominated contexts and markets in follow-up dedicated studies...|$|R

40|$|Hardness {{is defined}} as the {{resistance}} and load bearing capability <b>of</b> an item. <b>Seat</b> hardness {{is an important factor in}} seat comfort as it impacts on a number <b>of</b> variables including <b>seat</b> postural stability, postural control, pressure comfort as a result of tissue deformation, and occupant vibration. The development of the test rig further on described in this report will enable Futuris Automotive to develop their current comfort testing procedures and thus increase the comfort <b>of</b> their automotive <b>seats.</b> The test rig consists of a buttock indenter, which produces a controlled application of a load to a seat cushion with measured displacement via a linear indenter. In parallel with the physical property presented, an analytic (software) finite element tool was developed to simulate seat pressure in an ANSYS Workbench V 13 environment. This report also details the procedure required for Futuris to accurately and precisely measure cushion hardness which will enhance their comfort testing procedures, product development and target settings. The report is divided into three main sections: 1 	Test equipment specification (M 4) - A detailed <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the process used to build the seat cushion indenter and a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the indenter mechanical structure and electrical functionality (chapter 2). 2 	Analytic tool specification (M 5) – A detailed <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the CAE <b>seat</b> and indenter software tool, developed as a finite element model (FEM) under ANSYS Workbench V 13 to simulate indentation <b>of</b> a physical <b>seat</b> cushion similar to the hardware tool (chapter 3). 3 	Product Development and Comfort Design Procedure (M 6) - The cushion hardness testing procedure to be used with the physical indenter. This milestone is partially incomplete, as it covers a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the test procedure to be applied, however not the operating system (control software) required to operate the physical property (chapter 4). Although outside the scope of this project, this report also details the testing procedures required to measure overall seatback hardness. ...|$|R

The characteristics of the drivers are reviewed in relation to the causation of these accidents and to accident prevention measures in general and the role of vehicle factors in accident and injury causation is discussed with emphasis on the Australian Design Rules for Motor Vehicle Safety. Two hundred and sixtytwo, or 86 per cent of the accidents in the survey involved one or more cars. Alcohol intoxication and inexperience in driving in traffic were the two characteristics of drivers that were most often obviously related to accident involvement. Vehicle defects played only a minor role. Seat belts were found to reduce the frequency and severity of injury; this was particularly so for the later inertia-reel belts which {{were also more likely to}} be worn. Seventy-nine per cent of drivers and 65 per cent of left front passengers wore a seat belt where one was available. Door latches and hinges, <b>seat</b> <b>anchorages,</b> and the steering wheel and instrument panel were either deficient in the crash or otherwise were frequently found to be objects causing injury to the occupants of the car.
