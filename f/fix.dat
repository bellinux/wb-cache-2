5|$|An f-deck is a {{data file}} that {{contains}} {{a record of the}} fixes of a storm's location and/or intensity. A location <b>fix</b> is any position estimate of the storm center. An intensity <b>fix</b> is any estimate of the storm's intensity. Both location and intensity fixes can be obtained by aircraft flying low-level penetrations through the storm center. Various methods that use satellite imagery or other remote sensing can also provide location and intensity fixes.|$|E

In this paper, we give some remarks {{on the notion of}} n-tuple <b>fixed</b> point given by Ertürk and Karakaya in [18, 19].

Live Optimization, according to the application's author, is intended to improve the responsiveness of Windows applications by tweaking their execution priorities.|$|E

5000|$|Firstly GFCF {{measures}} {{only the}} value of additions to the <b>fixed</b> capital stock less {{the value of}} disposals of scrapped <b>fixed</b> assets. So normally total <b>fixed</b> investment in a year {{is in fact a}} larger value than GFCF. [...] "Total <b>fixed</b> investment" [...] (gross) is not usually a published statistical measure, since economists are interested primarily in the contribution of <b>fixed</b> investment to value added, i.e., they are interested in the net additions made to the total <b>fixed</b> capital stock (additions less withdrawals). If, hypothetically, the amount of <b>fixed</b> investment and the amount of scrapped <b>fixed</b> assets are equal in value, then the total <b>fixed</b> investment figure would tell us only that the scrapped <b>fixed</b> assets have been replaced. If we want to know by how much the <b>fixed</b> capital stock has increased, we need to know the relationship between <b>fixed</b> assets purchased and disposals of <b>fixed</b> assets.|$|R

5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to <b>fix</b> it without assistance. The coureurs de vitesse could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to <b>fix</b> a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E

On January 29, an in-game search feature was implemented for Halo 4s file sharing system; a web version of the Halo 4 file browser was made available on February 27, 2013. On April 8, 343 Industries launched a competitive skill ranking system akin to that featured in Halo 2 and Halo 3.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Second World War had {{finished}} the Albert Dock's future looked bleak. The owners of the dock, the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB) were in financial crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage, adopting an attitude of 'if it's not broke don't <b>fix</b> it, {{and if it is}} broke we still won't <b>fix</b> it'. At the same time a change in geo-political orientation towards Europe, coupled with the advent of containerisation meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the UK. Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I listed building status.|$|E
