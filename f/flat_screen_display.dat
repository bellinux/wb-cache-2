50|$|I/O is {{the means}} by which a {{computer}} exchanges information with the outside world. Devices that provide input or output to the computer are called peripherals. On a typical personal computer, peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and mouse, and output devices such as the display and printer. Hard disk drives, floppy disk drives and optical disc drives serve as both input and output devices. Computer networking is another form of I/O.I/O devices are often complex computers in their own right, with their own CPU and memory. A graphics processing unit might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display 3D graphics. Modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist the main CPU in performing I/O. A 2016-era <b>flat</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> contains its own computer circuitry.|$|E

Regression analysis showed that, compared to a <b>flat</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display,</b> males showed higher levels of performance on a test of survey knowledge after learning in the fulldome, but no benefit occurred for females. Furthermore, performance correlated with spatial visualization ability in male participants, but not in female participants.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a digital signage system and shows how to manage this system efficiently with help of existing software tools. Digital signage systems are becoming ubiquitous in {{both public and private}} places with the decreasing cost of <b>flat</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> panels and the development of telecommunication infrastructures. However, embarrassing displays with black screens or pop up error message boxes appeared frequently during the early stage of digital signage systems, and they are a common sight even {{at the time of this}} thesis writing. This shows that the reliability and fault monitoring of display systems still need work. In this thesis, we design and implement a lightweight Linux based digital signage player for an existing digital signage server. The system is then secured by a VPN environment to prevent unauthorized access, which reduces the possibilities of malicious content modification and other attacks. We also develop a screen monitoring system for all digital players in our system, providing the system administrators a way to notice abnormal behaviour at least no later than the audiences. Remote access to the digital signage player is provided by using SSH or VNC connection. Test results show that our system satisfies the design requirements. Also, we present ideas for the future development of the system...|$|E

40|$|Many {{scientists}} {{have demonstrated that}} compared {{to the real world}} egocentric distances in head-mounted display virtual environments are underestimated. However, distance perception in large <b>screen</b> immersive <b>displays</b> has received less attention. We investigate egocentric distance perception in a virtual office room projected using a semi-spherical, a Max Planck Institute CyberMotion Simulator cabin and a <b>flat</b> large <b>screen</b> immersive <b>display.</b> The goal of our research is to systematically investigate distance perception in large <b>screen</b> immersive <b>displays</b> with commonly used technical specifications. We specifically investigate the role of distance to the target, stereoscopic projection and motion parallax on distance perception. We use verbal reports and blind walking as response measures for the real world experiment. Due to the limited space in the three large <b>screen</b> immersive <b>displays</b> we use only verbal reports as the response measure for the experiments in the virtual environment. Our results show an overall underestimation of distance perception in the large <b>screen</b> immersive <b>displays,</b> while verbal estimates of distances are nearly veridical in the real world. We find that even when providing motion parallax and stereoscopic depth cues to the observer in the <b>flat</b> large <b>screen</b> immersive <b>display,</b> participants estimate the distances to be smaller than intended. Although stereo cues in the <b>flat</b> large <b>screen</b> immersive <b>display</b> do increase distance estimates for the nearest distance, the impact of the stereoscopic depth cues is not enough to result in veridical distance perception. Further, we demonstrate that the distance to the target significantly influences the percent error of verbal estimates in both the real and virtual world. The impact of the distance to the target on the distance judgments is the same in the real world and in two of the used large <b>screen</b> <b>displays,</b> namely, the MPI CyberMotion Simulator cabin and the flat displays. However, in the semi-spherical display we observe a significantly different influence of distance to the target on verbal estimates of egocentric distances. Finally, we discuss potential reasons for our results. Based on the findings from our research we give general suggestions that could serve as methods for improving the LSIDs in terms of the accuracy of depth perception and suggest methods to compensate for the underestimation of verbal distance estimates in large <b>screen</b> immersive <b>displays...</b>|$|R
40|$|Traditional <b>flat</b> <b>screen</b> <b>{{displays}}</b> present 2 D images. 3 D and 4 D displays {{have been}} proposed making use of lenslet arrays to shape a fixed outgoing light field for horizontal or bidirectional parallax. In this article, we present different designs of multi-dimensional displays which passively react to {{the light of the}} environment behind. The prototypes physically implement a reflectance field and generate different light fields depending on the incident illumination, for example light falling through a window. We discretize the incident light field using an optical system, and modulate it with a 2 D pattern, creating a flat display which is view and illumination dependent. It is free from electronic components. For distant light and a fixed observer position, we demonstrate a passive optical configuration which directly renders a 4 D reflectance field in the real world illumination behind it. We further propose an optical setup that allows for projecting out different angular distributions depending on the incident light direction. Combining multiple of these devices we build a display that renders a 6 D experience, where the incident 2 D illumination influences the outgoing light field, both in the spatial and in the angular domain. Possible applications of this technology are time-dependent displays driven by sunlight, object virtualization and programmable light benders / ray blockers without moving parts...|$|R

50|$|CIGS and CdTe {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} thin-film solar cells and have recently seen growing commercial success. Despite continued rapid cost reduction, concerns about material price and availability as well as toxicity have been raised. Although current material costs are {{a small portion of the}} total solar cell cost, continued rapid growth of thin-film solar cells could lead to increased material price and limited supply. For CIGS, indium has been subject to growing demand because of the rapid expansion of indium tin oxide (ITO) used in <b>flat</b> <b>screen</b> <b>displays</b> and mobile devices. The demand coupled with limited supply helped prices quickly climb to over $1000/kg before the global recession. While processing and capital equipment make up the majority of the costs for producing a CIGS solar cells, the price of the raw material is the lower bound for future costs and could be a limiting factor in decades ahead if demand continues to increase with limited supply. Indium exists mostly in low concentration ore deposits and is therefore obtained mainly as a byproduct of zinc mining. Growth projections based on many assumptions suggest that indium supply could limit CIGS production to the range of 17-106 GW/yr in 2050. Tellurium is even scarcer than indium, although demand has also been historically lower. Tellurium abundance in the earth's crust is similar to that of gold, and projections of future availability range from 19 to 149 GW/yr in 2050.|$|R
