5|$|Plant ecology is {{the science}} of the {{functional}} relationships between plants and their habitats—the environments where they complete their life cycles. Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras, their biodiversity, genetic diversity and fitness, the adaptation of plants to their environment, and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other species. Some ecologists even rely on empirical data from indigenous people that is gathered by ethnobotanists. This information can relay {{a great deal of}} information on how the land once was thousands of years ago and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> changed over that time. The goals of plant ecology are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns, productivity, environmental impact, evolution, and responses to environmental change.|$|E

25|$|Player safety {{has become}} a major issue within the past five years and concussions, which result from a hard hit to the head, have been the biggest cause. With recent studies showing how concussions can affect retired players and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{decreased}} their quality of life after retirement, concussions have become a very important topic of debate when it comes to player safety issues. This had significant effects on the league as elite players were being taken out of the game, such as Sidney Crosby being sidelined for approximately 10 and a half months, which adversely affected the league's marketability. As a result, in December 2009, Brendan Shanahan was hired to replace Colin Campbell and given the role of Senior Vice-President of Player Safety. Shanahan began to hand out suspensions on high-profile perpetrators responsible for dangerous hits, such as Raffi Torres receiving 25 games for his hit on Marian Hossa.|$|E

500|$|The {{poems in}} this volume, like her poems in other volumes and contexts, contain {{universal}} identifications with ordinary objects. [...] For example, [...] "The Telephone" [...] describes {{her relationship with}} an object, and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> intruded upon the silence and solitude of her life. [...] In this poem, which is three structured stanzas long, Angelou demands that the telephone ring, despite her resentment of its intrusion and her dependency upon it. [...] She uses familiar and feminine metaphors, and themes also found in blues songs, such as the colors black and blue and weekend loneliness. [...] In the poem [...] "Poor Girl", Angelou uses the vernacular to express universal themes, {{in the voice of}} a teenage girl who has lost her boyfriend.|$|E

Crawford mentioned, [...] "Toddlers have tackled [...] [...] recreation centre dance classes, sorority sisters in their dorm rooms, suburban teenagers in their basements and high school cheerleaders." [...] In February 2009, Columbia Records announced the launch of a [...] "Single Ladies" [...] Dance Video Contest. Fans aged eighteen and older were invited to adhere precisely to the dance routine performed by Beyoncé and her two dancers in the original production.

[...] He believed that his actions were justifiable because he had undertaken them in his duty as schoolteacher. He portrayed himself as a victim of public opinion, claiming that [...] "a mournful accident was swelled up into a bloody midnight murder, and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been brought about that my unfortunate name has been branded, not simply through the United Kingdom, but through the civilised world, {{as one of the most}} execrable monsters or of madmen."

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2008, the Government of Saskatchewan Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck Lake that [...] "the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an {{excellent}} opportunity {{to tell the story}} of the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples' struggle with Government forces and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> shaped Canada today." [...] One of three Territorial Government Buildings remains on Dewdney Avenue in the Saskatchewan capital city of Regina, Saskatchewan which was the site of the Trial of Louis Riel, where the drama the [...] "Trial of Louis Riel" [...] is still performed. Following the May trial, Louis Riel was hanged 16 November 1885. [...] The RCMP Heritage Centre, in Regina, opened in May 2007.

500|$|One of the {{problems}} that the All-China Women's Federation has identified is that women in China do not understand the federation’s contributions, or its significance in the women’s movement. [...] The members of the ACWF identified two potential sources for the lack of understanding. The first is that the ACWF has many roles and branch organizations which may be obscuring the contribution it is making. The second is that it has lacked consistency in <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> represented women, especially during its early years. Another problem facing the ACWF is its relationship with the international women’s movement. [...] The relationship between the Marxist view of feminism and current international views on feminism are often viewed as contradictory. Marxism often labels feminist movements as bourgeois because it focuses on the betterment of only one segment of society instead of society as a whole, and states capitalism, not the patriarchy, is the creator of gender inequality. The ACWF struggles with how to engage both, sometimes denying to have borrowed anything from international feminism.|$|E
500|$|Regarded as an auteur filmmaker, Nolan's visual style often emphasises urban settings, men in suits, muted colours, {{dialogue}} scenes {{framed in}} wide close-up with a shallow {{depth of field}} and modern locations and architecture. Aesthetically, the director favours deep, evocative shadows, documentary-style lighting, natural settings and real filming locations over studio work. Nolan has noted {{that many of his}} films are heavily influenced by film noir. He has continuously experimented with metafictive elements, temporal shifts, elliptical cutting, solipsistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, labyrinthine plots and the merging of style and form. Discussing The Tree of Life (2011), Nolan spoke of Terrence Malick's work and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> influenced his own approach to style, [...] "When you think of a visual style, when you think of the visual language of a film, there tends to be a natural separation of the visual style and the narrative elements. But with the greats, whether it's Stanley Kubrick or Terrence Malick or Hitchcock, what you're seeing is an inseparable, a vital relationship between the image and the story it's telling".|$|E
