5|$|In 2008, Australian {{researcher}} Jean Williams {{claimed that}} cancer {{rates in the}} town of Innisfail, Queensland were 10 times higher than the state average due to secret testing of Agent Orange by the Australian military scientists during the Vietnam War. Williams, who had won the Order of Australia medal for her research on the effects of chemicals on U.S. war veterans, based her allegations on Australian government reports found in the Australian War Memorial's archives. A former soldier, Ted Bosworth, backed up the claims, saying that he had been involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> testing. Neither Williams or Bosworth have produced verifiable evidence to support their claims. The Queensland health department determined that cancer rates in Innisfail were no higher than those {{in other parts of the}} state.|$|E

5|$|Kingsley Amis, in The James Bond Dossier, {{noted that}} {{although}} Bond {{is a very}} good shot and the best <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> Service, he is still beaten by the instructor, something that added realism to Bond's character. Amis identified a number of skills where Bond is very good, but is still beatable by others. These included skiing, hand-to-hand combat, underwater swimming and golf. Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to write off his battleship-grey supercharged Bentley 4½ Litre. Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.|$|E

5|$|Larrea's {{business}} prospered, and in 1808 the Buenos Aires Cabildo {{appointed him}} to oversee a naval patrol to suppress shipments of contraband. This {{gave him an}} opportunity to put his nautical skills to use. He also participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> meetings of patriots who promoted political change, and joined the 1809 Mutiny of Álzaga, which attempted to depose viceroy Liniers and replace him with a Junta. The mutiny failed, but the patriots continued to plot, and in 1810 the May Revolution succeeded in deposing the new viceroy. Larrea did not {{take part in the}} discussions at the open cabildo, but was appointed as member of the Primera Junta.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{stated that}} he {{conceived}} the Star Wars saga's story {{in the form of}} a plot outline in 1973. However, he later clarified that, at the time of the saga's conception, he had not fully realized the details—only major plot points. He began working on Episode III even before the previous film, , was released, proposing to concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets. Michael Kaminski, <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> History of Star Wars, surmises that Lucas found flaws with Anakin's fall to the dark side and radically re-organized the plot. For instance, instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles, Lucas decided instead to focus on Anakin, ending the film's first act with his killing of Count Dooku, an action that signals his descent to the dark side.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} the railcar, seeing its door ajar; an alien-human test subject is locked in a room inside. The Red-Haired Man attacks Mulder, causing the {{conductor}} to lock them both in the car. The Red-Haired Man claims {{to work for the}} NSA, and that a bomb in the car was triggered after he gained entry with Zama's pass code. Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a smokescreen. She also confirms that a bomb is in the car and believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will die from the disease if the car explodes.

5000|$|Wambaugh's {{novels are}} noted for {{numerous}} quirky but incidental characters, stereotypical lampoons of police officer [...] "types" [...] he either observed personally or {{the subjects of}} anecdotes related to him by officers. <b>In</b> <b>The</b> <b>Secrets</b> of Harry Bright the officers of the small, fictional Mineral Springs Police Department fill this role.
