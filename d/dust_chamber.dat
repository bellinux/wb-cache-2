An investigation of the efficiency of various total inhalable and respirable dust samplers has been conducted to identify the most convenient way of collecting dust particles to examine their physical characteristics. The efficiency of a variety of dust samplers were investigated using limestone dust clouds generated inside an environmental <b>dust</b> <b>chamber.</b> Various sampling periods were employed to establish dust concentrations in the environmental <b>dust</b> <b>chamber.</b> The experimental dust cloud was found to contain on average 55. 74 % of respirable dust as defined by different instruments while a consistent dust concentration of approx 200 mg/m 3 was repeatedly produced. The methods for collecting and estimating airborne asbestos fibre concentrations were studied and found to be extremely limited. Standard optical techniques grossly underestimated both airborne fibre concentrations and respirable dimensions of fibres. The size and dimensions of respirable asbestos fibres are defined by their ability to gain access to the lungs and there is no instrument or technique available at present, which will allow collection and estimation of respirable fibrous dust clouds. A comparison of coal dust particles with similar particles retained in the lungs has shown a difference from the predicted respirable fractions as proposed by the British Medical Research Council (BMRC) and other conventions. Respirable dust sampling instruments may therefore be under sampling larger particles. The difficulty in estimating the characteristics of airborne particulate material has been demonstrated by illustrating urban particulate collection and analysis.

Using a specially designed, portable <b>dust</b> <b>chamber,</b> twenty-two tests were conducted in an underground coal mine. Each test consisted of collecting 16 simultaneous dust samples, using 16 coal mine dust sampler units, symmetrically mounted in a container with a central inlet. Dust filter capsules were weighed in the same laboratory before and after exposure, with pre- and post-exposure weights recorded to the nearest µg (0. 001 mg).

Control animals were exposed similarly to clean air or TiO 2. Development of fibrosis {{was followed by}} histological examination, measurement of lung weight and determination of lung collagen content (as hydroxyproline). A steady increase in lung weight and collagen content together with changes in cellularity and metabolic activity of the lungs, as ascertained by chemical determination of DNA and RNA, were measured in the lungs of the SiO 2 -exposed animals. Hybridization of total lung RNA, extracted at each time point, with cDNA probes specific for type I and type III procollagen mRNA levels showed {{that the development of}} fibrosis was associated with increased levels, as compared to age matched controls, of pulmonary procollagen mRNAs. Interestingly, the highest levels of procollagen mRNAs were observed in young (pretreatment control) animals, suggesting that during pulmonary development collagen metabolism in lungs is even greater than during development of fibrosis. In rats exposed to SiO 2 the increase in type III procollagen mRNA occurred earlier than the increase in type I procollagen mRNAs. These observations demonstrate both age-dependent and silicosis-related changes in pulmonary procollagen mRNA levels.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaf 48). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. When studying air quality it is often necessary to measure the aerodynamic size distribution of particles. True aerodynamic diameter must be measured using a gravitational settling method, which is impractical. Other methods exist that use other properties of the particles to estimate the aerodynamic diameter. One of the most common methods is the TSI Aerodynamic Particle Sizer, which measures the time of flight of the particles in an accelerated flow field. This time is related to the aerodynamic properties of the particles. Another method uses the Coulter Multisizer, which measures the volume of each particle that has been collected on a filter. An equivalent diameter for each particle can be found by assuming the particle is spherical, which can then be converted to an aerodynamic diameter using the density of the particles. Both methods have been shown to work well for spherical particles, but cannot account for the shape of the particles being tested, which can significantly increase the drag force on the particle. As a result the APS tends to undersize these particles, while the Coulter Method overestimates the aerodynamic size. This study compared the two methods of estimating particle size using a <b>dust</b> <b>chamber</b> where two different irregularly shaped dusts were supplied to three Coulter filters and the APS inlet. Results showed that the shape of the distributions from both the Coulter and APS methods were comparable, but the Coulter diameters were generally higher than those of the APS. This was consistent with what was expected, although there was significant variability in the Coulter results for one of the dusts that could not be explained. The APS also demonstrated significant problems with counting large "phantom" particles that did not actually exist. This problem was improved upon using a data "mask" provided by the manufacturer, but was not entirely corrected. Overall the two methods gave similar results indicating that a possible conversion factor could be developed to compare the two, but no simple method could be found using this data set.

About 20 mg of the individual samples were pneumatically dispersed by 0. 5 liter of pressurized air inside the chamber under defined temperature and humidity conditions. Then the dynamics of aerosol size distributions was recorded using an aerodynamic particle sizer with a frequency of 5 seconds. The lignite and flue ash contributed most to the mass of atmospheric aerosol particles smaller than 10 / 2. 5 micrometer – PM 10 / PM 2. 5. The re-suspended mass of the samples varied between 0. 001 % for overburden soil and 0. 32 % for mine road soil.

To receive this information {{it is necessary to}} apply the stochastic [1] and determinate methods [2]. The last ones are based on the studying of single dust particles behavior and on the determination of maximum diameter of the caught particles or on the composition of their bordering trajectories. The main objective of this scientific paper is to work out the methods of dispersed composition prediction and dust concentration in extracting local exhausts air in the areas of arbitrary geometry taking into account vortical transitional currents which occur as a result of abrupt modification of area configuration. The mentioned method is based on the introduction of finite number of different fractions dust particles into the stream at every design moment of definite time period and on the tracing of their behavior until they are caught or precipitated. The stream of air current is designed {{on the basis of the}} method of discontinuous vortexes. Vortical transitional currents are formed as a result of current isolation from sharp edges of area border, and also from smooth surface on the spot of tangential gear constituent change.

This research evaluated the quality of dust dispersion in the Siwek 20 -L chamber using Pittsburgh coal, Gilsonite, and purple K dusts. A Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) optical dust probe {{was used to measure}} optical transmittance through the dust cloud at various locations within the chamber. A total of 540 tests were performed, with triplicate tests at five nominal dust concentrations and six locations. The two standard dispersion nozzles (rebound and perforated annular nozzle) were compared. The transmissions corresponding to the normal ignition delay period were used to: (a) determine variations in spatial uniformity of dispersion obtained with both nozzles; (b) make comparisons between the experimental transmission data and those calculated from theory for the three dusts; and (c) make comparisons with transmission data measured in the PRI, 20 -L and Fike 1 -m 3 <b>dust</b> explosion <b>chambers.</b> The uniformity of dispersion for the three dusts was similar with both nozzles, despite the differences in nozzle geometry and mode of operation. Transmission data of the three dusts were all significantly lower than those calculated from theory. This was discovered to be, in part, due to significant reduction in particle size that occurred during dispersion. By measuring particle sizes before and after dispersion, values of 60 %, 50 %, and 20 % reduction in particle size (based on the surface weighted mean diameter) were obtained for Pittsburgh coal, Gilsonite, and purple K, respectively. Transmission data from the PRL 20 -L, Fike 1 -m 3 and the Siwek 20 -L chambers indicated comparable results in terms of uniformity of dispersion. However, transmission data from the Siwek 20 -L chamber were significantly lower than those of the PRL and Fike chambers. Again, this was attributed, in part, to the significant reduction in particle size that occurred during dispersion in the Siwek chamber. The design of the outlet (dispersion) valve of the Siwek 20 -L apparatus charge vessel was largely responsible for the particle break-up. The contribution to particle break-up by the dispersion nozzles and the high level of turbulence in the chamber were found to be minimal. This is a significant finding in that the dust particle size tested for explosibility in the Siwek chamber is considerably smaller than the original dust sample...|$|R

British Journal of Industrial Medicine, 31, 261 - 274. Intervention {{studies of}} cotton {{steaming}} to reduce biological effects of cotton <b>dust.</b> Previous exposure <b>chamber</b> studies {{had suggested that}} steaming cotton could reduce significantly the levels and the biological effects of cotton dust. Therefore an intervention study using a high capacity steamer was designed to test {{the effectiveness of this}} process in a single cotton mill. The mill population was surveyed and dust sampling was completed prior to intervention with steamed cotton. A panel of 62 byssinotics and heavily exposed workers was selected to serve as a test panel while steamed cotton was introduced to the mill. Following the introduction of adequately steamed cotton the mean Monday decrement in forced expired volume in one second among panel members was significantly reduced to half that observed during control trials. Dust levels were also significantly reduced in the initial opening and picking processes but increased significantly in later processes. Re-evaluation of the mill population by work area suggested some improvement in expiratory flow per milligram of dust exposure but a progression in symptoms of byssinosis and bronchitis in later mill processes. It is suggested that steaming may have resulted in removal of some bronchoconstricting property of cotton dust, but that binding of fine dust to the fibre may also occur, resulting in delayed release of fine dust particles. The implications of these observations on environmental control are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 36 - 38) Limits on {{exposure to}} various airborne nonfibrous mineral dusts are given as Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) (ACGIH, 1976). The TLVs {{for some of}} these dusts are given in terms of millions of particles per cubic foot of air (mppcf) as collected by midget impinger and counted by microscope using light field technics. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (1976) has recently proposed a means of converting this concentration to an equivalent concentration stated in terms of milligrams per cubic meter of air (mg/m 3) for the respirable portion of the dust sampled. This conversion would allow the use of respirable mass sampling devices such as the 10 mm nylon cyclone in determining whether the level of exposure is exceeding the TLV. Respirable dust sampling is now widely accepted as the best estimate of the health hazard due to inhalation of insoluble particles. The proposed conversion, 6 mppcf = l mg/m 3 of respirable mass (ACGIH, 1976), is based largely on one study (Jacobson and Tomb, 1967), mostly of coal dust, in which an empirical relationship of 5. 6 mppcf = 1 mg/m 3 of respirable mass was derived. The present experiment centered on evaluating if the relationship found mostly with coal dust particles, which are closely spherical, is the same for non-asbestiform talc dust particles, which are platelet in shape. Using a <b>dust</b> generator, mixing <b>chamber,</b> and sampling trains with midget impingers and cyclones, pairs of dust samples were collected under two sets of conditions.

30|$|Hall {{thrusters}} are coaxial plasma accelerators {{regarded as}} one of the most streamlined and combative electric propulsion devices having numerous spacecraft applications in telecommunications satellites and other commercial space missions [1]. In general, these consist of three parts, namely discharge region (anode), cathode and magnetic field. The insulated discharge region is cylindrical chamber called channel, in which ionization and acceleration of the propellant are performed in the presence of crossed axial electric field and radial magnetic field. Cathode is located externally around the channel, and gas is fed through the base into the channel and dispersed eventually. Electrons trying to reach the anode experience a transverse magnetic field, which decreases their mobility and traps them; hence, the electrons trace out spiral motion along the axis of the thruster in the E[*]×[*]B direction, constituting the Hall current. Trapped electrons in the channel undergo collisions with the propellant atoms, creating ions. Ions so produced experience the electric field produced between the channel (positive) and the ring of electrons (negative) and accelerate out of the thruster as a strong ion beam. These ions impart force to the electron cloud due to which thrust is generated, which is transferred to the magnetic field and hence to the magnetic circuit of the thruster [2, 3, 4]. Bombardment of the electrons and the ions erodes the walls of the channel, which leads to the addition of <b>dust</b> to the <b>chamber</b> that is likely to affect the efficiency and lifetime of the Hall thrusters [5, 6]. Further, the major flaw of Hall thrusters is large exhaust-beam divergence, which may cause electrostatic charging and thus the communication interference of satellites [7]. Hence, for the efficient and hassle-free thrusters operations, a number of parameters are to be checked and fixed, for example, lower beam divergence, minimum erosion rate and optimum thrust-to-power ratio. Above all, the major challenge is to handle or suppress the oscillations produced in the chamber, which gives rise to different types of instabilities.|$|R
