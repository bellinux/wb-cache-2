50|$|Unpowered {{aircraft}} {{can remain}} airborne {{for a significant}} period of time without onboard propulsion. They can be classified as fixed-wing gliders, lighter-than-air balloons and tethered kites. This requires a trajectory that {{is not merely a}} vertical descent such as a parachute. In the case of kites, lift is obtained by tethering to a fixed or moving object, perhaps another kite, to obain a flow of wind over the lifting surfaces. In the case of balloons, lift is obtained through <b>inherent</b> <b>buoyancy</b> and the balloon {{may or may not be}} tethered. Free balloon flight has little directional control. Gliding aircraft include sailplanes, hang gliders, and paragliders that have full directional control in free flight.|$|E
50|$|Polar Star has {{sufficient}} hull {{strength to}} absorb the high-powered ice breaking common to her operations. The shell plating and associated internal support structure are fabricated from steel that has especially good low-temperature strength. The portion of the hull designed to break ice is 1.75 in thick in the bow and stern sections, and 1.25 in thick amidships. The hull strength is produced almost entirely from the massive internal support structure. Polar Stars hull shape is designed to maximize icebreaking by efficiently combining {{the forces of the}} ship's forward motion, the downward pull of gravity on the bow, and the upward push of the <b>inherent</b> <b>buoyancy</b> of the stern. The curved bow allows Polar Star to ride up on the ice, using the ship's weight to break the ice.|$|E
5000|$|Polar Sea has {{sufficient}} hull {{strength to}} absorb the high-powered ice ramming common to her operations. The shell plating and associated internal support structure are fabricated from steel with superior low-temperature strength. The portion of the hull designed to ram ice is 1¾ inches thick (44 mm) in the bow and stern sections, and 1¼ inches thick (32 mm) amidships. The hull strength is produced almost entirely from a sophisticated internal support structure that features [...] ribs for approximately the forward two-thirds of the ship's frame. Polar Sea's hull shape is designed to maximize icebreaking by efficiently combining {{the forces of the}} ship's forward motion, the downward pull of gravity on the bow, and the upward push of the <b>inherent</b> <b>buoyancy</b> of the stern. The curved bow and heavy weight allows Polar Sea to force ice edges to break off downward as cusps. Contrary to some myths, this design does not use sharp edges or hammer-like blows to cut or break the ice, as the round bow and massive weight are sufficient. With high power to back it up, the 13,000-ton (13,200-metric ton) Polar Sea is able to continuously progress through 6 feet (1.8 m) of new hard ice at 3 knots (6 km/h) and break up to 21 feet when using back-and-ram methods.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Accidental {{immersion}} {{in cold water}} is an occupational risk. Work suits and life jackets (LJ) should work effectively in combination to keep the airway clear of the water (freeboard) and enable self-righting. We hypothesized that <b>inherent</b> <b>buoyancy,</b> in the suit or LJ, would be beneficial for enabling freeboard, but its distribution may influence LJ self-righting. Methods: Six participants consented to complete nine immersions. Suits and LJ tested were: flotation suit (FLOAT; 85 N inherent buoyancy); oilskins 1 (OS- 1) and 2 (OS- 2), both with no inherent buoyancy; LJs (inherent buoyancy/buoyancy after inflation/total buoyancy), LJ- 1 50 / 150 / 200 N, LJ- 2 0 / 290 / 290 N, LJ- 3 80 / 190 / 270 N. Once dressed, the subject entered an immersion pool where uninflated freeboard, self-righting performance, and inflated freeboard were measured. Data were compared using Friedman’s test to the 0. 05 alpha level. Results: All suits and LJs enabled uninflated and inflated freeboard, but differences were seen between the suits and LJs. Self-righting was achieved on 43 of 54 occasions, irrespective of suit or LJ. On all occasions that self-righting was not achieved, this occurred in an LJ that included <b>inherent</b> <b>buoyancy</b> (11 / 54 occasions). Of these 11 failures, 8 occurred (73...|$|E
40|$|Whether the {{volcanism}} of the Columbia River Plateau, eastern Snake River Plain, and Yellowstone (western U. S.) {{is related}} to a mantle plume or to plate tectonic processes is a long-standing controversy. There are many geological mismatches with the basic plume model as well as logical flaws, such as citing data postulated to require a deep-mantle origin in support of an “upper-mantle plume” model. USArray has recently yielded abundant new seismological results, but despite this, seismic analyses have still not resolved the disparity of opinion. This suggests that seismology {{may be unable to}} resolve the plume question for Yellowstone, and perhaps elsewhere. USArray data have inspired many new models that relate western U. S. volcanism to shallow mantle convection associated with subduction zone processes. Many of these models assume that the principal requirement for surface volcanism is melt in the mantle and that the lithosphere is essentially passive. In this paper we propose a pure plate model in which melt is commonplace in the mantle, and its <b>inherent</b> <b>buoyancy</b> is not what causes surface eruptions. Instead, it is extension of the lithosphere that permits melt to escape to the surface and eruptions to occur—the mere presence of underlying melt is not a sufficient condition. The time-progressive chain of rhyolitic calderas in the eastern Snake River Plain–Yellowstone zone that has formed since basin-range extension began at ca. 17 Ma results from laterally migrating lithospheric extension and thinning that has permitted basaltic magma to rise from the upper mantle and melt the lower crust. We propose that this migration formed part of the systematic eastward migration of the axis of most intense basin-range extension. The bimodal rhyolite-basalt volcanism followed migration of the locus of most rapid extension, not vice versa. This model does not depend on seismology to test it but instead on surface geological observations...|$|E
