Here, we investigate the consequence of geographic differentiation in male reproductive traits on female preferences to these traits in Bombus terrestris. We characterise (1) the geographic differentiation in male cephalic labial gland secretions (CLGS), a key trait for mate attraction, and (2) the preference of virgin females to the CLGS of different subspecies.

40|$|Müllerian mimicry, {{in which}} toxic species gain mutual {{protection}} from shared warning signals, is poorly understood in vertebrates, reflecting {{a paucity of}} examples.

Mantel matrix correlation tests show that conspicuous red colour pattern elements are significantly associated with sympatric and parapatric populations in four genera. To our knowledge, this represents the first evidence of a Müllerian mimetic radiation in vipers. The putative mimetic patterns are rarely found in females. This appears paradoxical {{in light of the}} Müllerian prediction of monomorphism, but may be explained by divergent selection pressures on the sexes, which have different behaviours.

The lengths (75 bp/ 76 bp) of the second and subsequent repeat units of the mtDNA control region (CR) sequences differentiated the five haplogroups (HPGs) observed in the domestic sheep into two genetic clusters as was already implied by other mtDNA markers: the first cluster being composed of HPGs A, B, D and the second cluster harboring HPGs C, E. To manifest genetic relatedness between wild Ovis gmelinii and domestic sheep haplogroups, their partial cytochrome B sequences were examined together on a median-joining network. The two parallel but wider aforementioned clusters were observed also on the network of Ovis gmelenii individuals, within which domestic haplogroups were embedded. The Ovis gmelinii wilds of the present day appeared to be distributed on two partially overlapping <b>geographic</b> areas <b>parallel</b> to the genetic clusters that they belong to (the first cluster being in the western part of the overall distribution). Thus, the analyses suggested that the domestic sheep may be the products of two maternally distinct ancestral Ovis gmelinii populations.

40|$|Abstract. —Geographic {{variation}} in color pattern, body dimensions, and scalation of the low-altitude {{populations of the}} Tenerife gecko (Tarentola delalandii) is analyzed and depicted by multivariate ordination and contouring. Comparison with <b>parallel</b> <b>geographic</b> {{variation in}} other lizards on Tenerife and an adjacent island suggests an "ecogenetic " rather than "phylogenetic" cause (i. e., adaptation to current latitudinal habitat types with different climate and vegetation). Three quantitative procedures that may be of use in distinguishing between ecogenetically and phylogenetically caused geographic variation are {{used to test the}} geographic variation in the Tenerife gecko (i. e., investigating congruence by random resampling, anagenesis in putative phylogenetic trees, and partial correlation/Mantel tests). The latter two procedures appear to be the most useful; in particular, simultaneous Mantel tests indicate that scalation is significantly associated with latitudinal habitat types irrespective of the effects of spatial proximity.

40|$|Detecting {{the factors}} that {{determine}} the interruption of gene flow between populations is key to understanding how speciation occurs. In this context, caves are an excellent system for studying processes of colonization, differentiation and speciation, since they represent discrete geographical units often with known geological histories. Here, we asked whether discontinuous calcareous areas and cave systems represent major barriers to gene flow within and among the five species of Sardinian cave salamanders (genus Hydromantes) and whether intraspecific genetic structure <b>parallels</b> <b>geographic</b> distance within and among caves. We generated mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences from 184 individuals representing 48 populations, and used a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to infer possible areas of cladogenesis for these species and reconstruct historical and current dispersal routes among distinct populations. Our results show deep genetic divergence within and among all Sardinian cave salamander species, which can mostly {{be attributed to the}} effects of mountains and discontinuities in major calcareous areas and cave systems acting as barriers to gene flow. While these salamander species can also occur outside caves, our results indicate that there is a very poor dispersal of these species between separate cave systems...|$|R
40|$|Chthonomonas calidirosea T 49 T is a low-abundance, carbohydrate-scavenging, and {{thermophilic}} soil bacterium with {{a seemingly}} disorganized genome. We {{hypothesized that the}} C. calidirosea genome would be highly responsive to local selection pressure, resulting in the divergence of its genomic content, genome organization, and carbohydrate utilization phenotype across environments. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing the genomes of four C. calidirosea isolates obtained from four separate geothermal fields in the Taupō Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. For each isolation site, we measured physicochemical attributes and defined the associated microbial community by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Despite their ecological and geographical isolation, the genome sequences showed low divergence (maximum, 1. 17 %). Isolate-specific variations included single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), restriction-modification systems, and mobile elements but few major deletions and no major rearrangements. The 50 -fold variation in C. calidirosea relative abundance among the four sites correlated with site environmental characteristics but not with differences in genomic content. Conversely, the carbohydrate utilization profiles of the C. calidirosea isolates corresponded to the inferred isolate phylogenies, which only partially paralleled the geographical relationships among the sample sites. Genomic sequence conservation does not entirely <b>parallel</b> <b>geographic</b> distance, suggesting that stochastic dispersal and localized extinction, which allow for rapid population homogenization with little restriction by geographical barriers, are possible mechanisms of C. calidirosea distribution. This dispersal and extinction mechanism is likely not limited to C. calidirosea but may shape the populations and genomes of many other low-abundance free-living taxa...|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{historical}} demographies of two Müllerian comimetic butterfly species: Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene. These species show an extensive <b>parallel</b> <b>geographic</b> divergence in their aposematic wing phenotypes. Recent {{studies suggest that}} this coincident mosaic results from simultaneous demographic processes shaped by extrinsic forces over Pleistocene climate fluctuations. However, DNA sequence variation at two rapidly evolving unlinked nuclear loci, Mannose phosphate isomerase (Mpi) and Triose phosphate isomerase (Tpi), show that the comimetic species have quite different quaternary demographies. In H. erato, despite ongoing lineage sorting across the Andes, nuclear genealogical estimates showed little geographical structure, suggesting high historical gene flow. Coalescent-based demographic analysis revealed population growth since the Pliocene period. Although these patterns suggest vicariant population subdivision associated with the Andean orogeny, they are not consistent with hypotheses of Pleistocene population fragmentation facilitating allopatric wing phenotype radiation in H. erato. In contrast, nuclear genetic diversity, θ,in H. melpomene was reduced relative to its comimic and revealed three phylogeographical clades. The pattern of coalescent events within regional clades was most consistent with population growth in relatively isolated populations after a recent period of restricted population size. These different demographic histories suggest that the wing-pattern radiations were not coincident in the two species. Instead, larger effective population size (Ne) in H. erato, together with profound population change in H. melpomene, supports an earlier hypothesis that H. erato diversified first as the model species of this remarkable mimetic association...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) has {{a remarkable}} <b>geographic</b> distribution inversely <b>paralleling</b> that of regional ultraviolet radiation, supporting {{the hypothesis that}} vitamin D plays {{a central role in}} the disease etiology. The major histocompatibility complex exerts the largest genetic contribution to MS susceptibility, but much risk remains unexplained and direct gene-environment interaction is a strong candidate for this additional risk. Such interactions may hold the key for disease prevention. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: Several recent studies strengthen the candidacy of vitamin D as a key player in the causal cascade to MS. This includes a newly identified gene-environment interaction between vitamin D and the main MS-linked HLA-DRB 1 * 1501 allele and evidence showing that vitamin D levels are significantly lower in patients with MS as compared to controls. Also, a recent study in twins with MS supports the notion that vitamin D levels are under regulation by genetic variation in the 1 alpha-hydroxylase and vitamin D receptor genes, perhaps pointing to their importance in the disease pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have important practical implications for studies of disease mechanisms and prevention. Missing genetic risk may partly be explained by gene-environment interactions. More practically important is that these observations highlight a pressing need to determine if vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the timing of action and the tissues in which this interaction takes place are not clear and future studies in prospective cohorts and animal models will be essential for deciphering the role of vitamin D in MS...|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{infectious}} disease pathogens have previously been classified into three categories: virulence jumpers, species jumpers and <b>geographic</b> invaders. A <b>parallel</b> is drawn with {{animal and plant}} speciation theory used to differentiate natural evolution in new geographic areas or new ecological niches; speciation in allopatry (vacariance or peripatry) or sympatry. In this exercise, the theoretical concepts above are illustrated with 7 viral diseases that have been emergent in the recent past: West Nile, chikungunya, bluetongue serotype 8, African swine fever, HIV- 1, foot-and-mouth disease PanAsia and H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic avian influenza clade 2. 2. Schematically, species jumps undergo sympatric adjustment, where evolution takes place in distinct ecological niches in one geographic area. Virulence jumpers evolve in sympatric-like conditions, in a niche where the pathogen was already present but has gained a selective advantage. Peripatric adjustment refers to evolution of a pathogen after a geographic jump, in an area distant from its original distribution. Geographic jumpers are often vector-borne or very resistant to environmental destruction. Peripatric evolution is often limited to minor genetic changes required for adaptation to a new vector, for example. Sympatric evolution results in major genetic changes, due to adaptation to a novel host or different driving forces in different production systems. Genetic change in virulence jumpers is frequently restricted to the mutations conferring the increase in virulence jump itself. Sympatric and peripatric adjustment {{are the result of}} disease emergence in a different niche, whereas sympatric-like evolution {{in the case of a}} virulence jump is the cause of disease emergence.

50|$|An {{indication}} of the power and historical impact of the Banu Gómez is their roles {{in two of the}} medieval epics of the Iberian peninsula. The tale of Bernardo del Carpio firsts appears in the 13th century, and relates the saga of the son of a legendary Sancho Díaz, count of Saldaña, blinded and imprisoned over his love for (and perhaps marriage to) Jimena, the sister of king Alfonso II of Asturias. Their son, Bernardo is raised by Alfonos as heir, but his attempts to get the king to release his father come to naught, and he eventually turns to rebellion and revenge. At Roncevaux he defeats a Carolingian army sent to support Alfonso in exchange for the latter naming the Frankish king his successor, and while Bernardo forms an allince with the Moors to attack León and Astorga. The presentation of Bernardo is ambivalent, in that his resistance to the foreign Carolingian armies is viewed as heroic, yet this is tempered by this traitorous collaboration with the Muslims. The epic appears to combine two distinct narratives, an Old French tale related to The Song of Roland (a variant related then dismissed by one of the earliest surviving versions instead makes Bernardo, like the Roland of epic, a nephew of Charlemagne) that would be merged with a native Iberian story involving the rebellion of the counts of Saldaña, while also drawing from the 13th century internecine disputes between the Kingdoms of León and Castile. Pick points to several <b>parallels,</b> <b>geographic</b> and thematic, between this legendary tale of a count of Saldaña and the historical fractious relationship between the senior line of the Banu Gómez and the Leonese kings.|$|R
40|$|Our {{models for}} {{detecting}} {{the effect of}} adaptation on population genomic diversity are often predicated on a single newly arisen mutation sweeping rapidly to fixation. However, a population can also adapt to a new situation by multiple mutations of similar phenotypic effect that arise in parallel. These mutations can each quickly reach intermediate frequency, preventing any single one from rapidly sweeping to fixation globally (a "soft" sweep). Here we study models of parallel mutation in a geographically spread population adapting to a global selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a selected allele can allow other selected alleles to arise and spread elsewhere in the species range. When these different selected alleles meet, their spread can slow dramatically, and so form a geographic patchwork which could {{be mistaken for a}} signal of local adaptation. This random spatial tessellation will dissipate over time due to mixing by migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within the global population. We show that the spatial tessellation initially formed by mutational types is closely connected to Poisson process models of crystallization, which we extend. We find that the probability of parallel mutation and the spatial scale on which parallel mutation occurs is captured by a single characteristic length that reflects the expected distance a spreading allele travels before it encounters a different spreading allele. This characteristic length depends on the mutation rate, the dispersal parameter, the effective local density of individuals, and to a much lesser extent the strength of selection. We argue that even in widely dispersing species, such <b>parallel</b> <b>geographic</b> sweeps may be surprisingly common.

Phaseolus vulgaris is characterised by two geographic gene pools, one located in Mesoamerica and the second in the southern Andes, with <b>parallel</b> <b>geographic</b> structures in their wild and domesticated beans.

The occurrence of independent domestication events in Mesoamerica and the Andes is well established; however, the number of domestication events that occurred in the two different regions remains a topic of discussion. We have carried out various studies using multilocus molecular markers with the wild and domesticated genotypes of the common bean, including an analysis {{of the structure of the}} European landraces.

Here, we present a summary of the results obtained from these studies, with particular focus on the origin of the species and the effects of domestication on the common bean genome. Our data indicate a new scenario for the structure and evolution of wild P. vulgaris, especially questioning the Peru-Ecuador origin, and arguing in favour of a Mesoamerican origin of the species.
