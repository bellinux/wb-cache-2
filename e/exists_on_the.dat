East of the Mast Boulevard interchange, SR52 crosses and begins to parallel the San Diego River. The freeway enters the city of Santee, where SR52 was built alongside Mission Gorge Road. SR52 intersects {{the northern end of}} SR125, where SR52 traffic can exit south onto SR125. The freeway continues east through Santee, with interchanges at Fanita Drive, Cuyamaca Street, and Magnolia Avenue, before it comes to an end at SR67.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many species}} of Psittacosaurus have been named, their {{relationships}} to each other {{have not yet been}} fully explored and no scientific consensus <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject.

5|$|On July 14, 1861, Company E of the 21st New York Volunteer Infantry was {{assigned}} to garrison Fort Jackson.

5|$|Recent evidence,shows that bloomeries {{were used}} in China, {{migrating}} in from the west as early as 800 BC, before being supplanted by the locally developed blast furnace. Supporting this theory was the discovery of 'more than ten' iron digging implements found in the tomb of Duke Jing of Qin (d. 537 BCE), whose tomb is located in Fengxiang County, Shaanxi (a museum <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site today).|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the original building is attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor, with some alterations from around 1900 and the subsequent modern 1960s extensions. The original mansion is in the Queen Anne style. The house itself has three storeys constructed of red brick. The ground floor level has a rubbed brick band at nine courses, and another rubbed brick band <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second floor, along with a moulded stone cornice level with the sills.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. Zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only contact with the eyes requires medical attention.

5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires {{to do so in the}} same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.|$|E
5|$|Few railway tunnels {{exist in}} Victoria, with the {{exception}} of the Melbourne City Loop. The longest tunnel before the opening of the loop was on the Fyansford Cement Works Railway (near Geelong), where a 1300 metre long tunnel existed on a narrow gauge quarry railway. Of those open today the longest is the single track 422 metre long Geelong Tunnel, followed by the double track 385 metre Elphinstone and the 390 metre long Big Hill Tunnels on the Bendigo line. A 154 metre long tunnel also <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Healesville line, as well as three tunnels on the suburban Hurstbridge line, and another on the freight lines under Footscray station.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E

5|$|Small lymphatic {{networks}} called plexuses exist beneath each of {{the three}} layers of the heart. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. The left vessel joins with this third vessel, and travels along the pulmonary artery and left atrium, ending in the inferior tracheobronchial node. The right vessel travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.|$|E
5|$|Suggested {{conservation}} {{work for}} the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern end of Amami, so that area should be protected. Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access {{to the middle of}} forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.|$|E
5|$|The Thruway {{continues}} north {{through the}} river valley toward Harriman, where it encounters the Woodbury toll barrier, the southeastern {{end of the}} mainline's major closed ticket system. The barrier {{is located on the}} mainline within exit16 (NY17), a trumpet interchange. Along with the mainline barrier in Harriman, a separate toll plaza <b>exists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exit16 ramp midway between the Thruway and NY17 exit131 (NY32). Now a completely tolled highway, the Thruway heads northward, roughly paralleling the Hudson River to the river's west as it serves the city of Newburgh, the village of New Paltz, and the city of Kingston, indirectly connecting to the short I-587 in the latter.|$|E
