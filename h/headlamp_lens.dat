40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 14) This {{study examined}} the effect that hydrophobic treatment of glass <b>headlamp</b> <b>lenses</b> has on light output when headlamps are exposed to contaminants under naturalistic driving conditions. The hypothesis, a priori, was that the water-repelling nature of a glass surface after hydrophobic treatment would aid in minimizing the adhesion, or promote the removal, of contaminants on the lens, thereby leaving light output less affected. Additional variables of interest included the presence of precipitation, {{the side of the}} vehicle the headlamp was on, and whether the headlamp was illuminated during the exposure. The study examined vehicles with glass lenses installed as intended by the vehicle manufacturer. The vehicles were driven on a 155 -km route under conditions of active precipitation or no precipitation, and with or without the headlamps on. Subsequent to each drive, measurements of light output were made at eight key test points in the headlamp beam pattern. The headlamps were then cleaned and measured again. In this way, each headlamp served as its own control. The results indicate that hydrophobic treatment of glass <b>headlamp</b> <b>lenses</b> did not affect light output. However, the presence of precipitation did result in decreased light output below the horizontal cutoff of the beam pattern and increased light output above the horizontal cutoff. This result was especially evident above the horizontal cutoff when the headlamps had been illuminated. The side of the vehicle the headlamp was on did not affect light output...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} changes in headlamp beam patterns {{as a function}} of the level of haze in sheets of plastic materials that were inserted in front of either a U. S. or a European low-beam headlamp. The level of haze was measured according to the method required by the U. S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This method (ASTM Standard D 1003 - 92) measures the percentage of transmitted light that deviates from the incident beam through forward scatter by more than 2. 5 °. The actual effects on the beam pattern were then compared with predictions based on modeling the effects by assuming Gaussian distributions of the scattered light. The main finding is that the redictions for the four different plastic materials tested were neither uniformly accurate nor uniformly inaccurate. This lack of consistency is in agreement with the fact that the ASTM definition of haze does not uniquely specify the distribution of the scattered light. This problem with using the ASTM definition was confirmed by measuring the distributions of light scattering by two materials that had essentially the same ASTM index of haze. The implication of this research is that establishing a justifiable maximum haze level for <b>headlamp</b> <b>lens</b> materials would require using a definition of haze that uniquely defines the resultant distribution of the light scatter. Consequently, it is recommended that future research should evaluate the distribution of scattered light using actual materials for headlamp lenses after different lengths of weathering exposure...|$|E
40|$|Incorporating {{safety in}} the design of a highway is one of the {{foremost}} duties of a design engineer. Design guidelines provide standards that help engineers include {{safety in the}} design of various geometric features. However, design guidelines are not frequently revised and do not accommodate for the frequent changes in vehicle design. One such example is the change in vehicle headlamps. These changes significantly impact the illuminance provided on the road and in turn the design formula. Roadway visibility is critical for nighttime driving. In the absence of roadway lighting, vehicle headlamps illuminate the road ahead of a vehicle. Sag vertical curve design depends on the available headlight sight distance provided by the 1 degree upward diverging headlamp beam. The sag curve design formulas were developed in the early 1940 s when sealed beam headlamps were predominant. However, headlamps have changed significantly and modern headlamps project less light above the horizontal axis. In this research, the difference in illuminance provided by sealed beam headlamps and modern headlamps was examined. For the theoretical analysis, three different sag curves were analyzed. On these curves, about 26 percent reduction in illuminance was observed at a distance equal to the stopping sight distance when comparing sealed beam to modern headlamps. A change in the headlamp divergence angle from 1. 0 degree to 0. 85 degree will provide the required illuminance on the road when using modern headlamps. A field study was performed to validate the theoretical calculations. It was observed that for modern headlamps, a divergence angle less than 1 degree and greater than 0. 5 degrees will provide illuminance values comparable to sealed beam headlamps. As a part of this research, a preliminary study, examining the impact of degraded headlamp lenses on the illuminance provided on sag vertical curves was conducted. A significant reduction in illuminance reaching the roadway on sag curves was observed, due to <b>headlamp</b> <b>lens</b> degradation...|$|E

50|$|To {{replace the}} Primula the {{managing}} director of Autobianchi, Enrico Ghiretti, desired a new three-box saloon.

The project was authorized by Fiat management, but since Fiat's style centre was already overworked, decision was taken to use a design for the dismissed project 123.The chosen design was the most recent proposal for the transverse-engined front-wheel drive 123 E4; it was updated, chiefly in the front end to incorporate new rectangular <b>headlamp</b> <b>lenses,</b> and approved by Ghiretti for production.Therefore, on the outside the A111's lines unsurprisingly recalled coeval Fiat designs, especially the 124 and 128. Christened A111, the new car—albeit larger in size—was based on the Primula's platform and mechanicals, and used the 1.4-litre drivetrain {{of the most powerful}} Primula, the Coupé S of 1968.

In the presented study the microtraces collected from the scenarios of hit-and-run accidents were analysed.

Both techniques enabled substantial reduction of data dimensionality. Univariate and multivariate likelihood ratio models were proposed for such data.
