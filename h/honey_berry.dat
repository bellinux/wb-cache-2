5000|$|During Russian {{celebration of}} Maslenitsa (Russian Butter Week), {{one of the}} most popular foods is blini, or crepes. Since crepes are made from butter, eggs and milk, they are allowed to be {{consumed}} during the celebration by the Orthodox church. There are endless combinations to the recipes and the execution of crepes. White flour can be replaced with buckwheat flour and milk can be switched for kefir. Also different oils can be added or substituted. Blini are served stocked with a piece of butter and topped with caviar, cheese, meat, potatoes, mushrooms, <b>honey,</b> <b>berry</b> jam or often a dollop of sour cream. The dish is supposed to represent the sun, since the holiday is about the beginning of the spring.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Urban trees {{provide a}} number of {{services}} including shade and thermal attenuation. This is related to morphological and physiological characteristics of trees and may vary between species and even between individuals of the same species. The aim of this work was to identify thermic attenuations on concrete sidewalks under six tropical urban trees with six different types of shadows. Material and Methods: In Santa Marta City, Colombia (10 º 12 ´ 20 ” N, 74 º 13 ´ 33 ” W, 10 meters above sea level and 31 ºC temperature), we selected six trees (species) with different types of shade, and they are evaluated for soil temperature and {{the temperature in the}} shade and off throughout the day for four different days of the year. ANOVA and t-tests were performed with R program in order to identify the influence of the specie, the day, the hour and the position (at the thermic comfort level, surface temperature) on the temperature results obtained. Results and Conclusion: Some trees have the most translucent shadows most likely due to nictinastic movements and consequently less temperature attenuation. On the other hand, other trees have denser shadows and can generate more substantial thermic attenuations. Regarding temperature data, the hour of the day shows the greatest influence on the variability of air temperature and the species shows the greatest influence on the variability of surface temperature. <b>Honey</b> <b>berry</b> (Meliccoca bijugatus) and Malay almond (Terminalia atappa) trees have denser shadows and can generate more substantial thermic attenuations. Tree physiology can {{play an important role in}} temperature attenuation in cities as a result of shadow effects and can be applied as a criterion to select urban trees in tropical cities...|$|E

5000|$|Barnesville is {{a scenic}} rural {{community}} {{in the province of}} New Brunswick within the country of Canada. There are several small brooks, the Hammond River, and a lake in the area often used for sport fishing. There is one store and three churches. A commercial greenhouse supplies flower baskets for local garden centers and retail stores and employs several people from the surrounding area. A community garden--Barnesville and Area Community Garden--was formed in the spring of 2015 by a group of local volunteers, with 30 allotments in use and 13 participants in the first year. It is located behind the Presbyterian church. The group offers free and low-cost gardening workshops for the public. Only one fully operational farm--specializing in beef cattle--remains in the community. However, Weatherby's Peak Berry Orchard is now in its initial stage of planting (2015). The planned 8 acre orchard will include <b>honey</b> <b>berries</b> (AKA Haskap), raspberries and high bush blueberries. It will also be a source of employment for local residents. Data on population is not collected by Statistics Canada. [...] Barnesville is known for its 'May Run' which is an annual unofficial event when off-road enthusiasts bring their trucks, atvs, and home-made vehicles to drive the backwoods trails. There are various trail systems for atvs in the area.A weekly Kitchen Party often attracts upwards of 70 people, with as many as 20 musicians and singers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Food {{preferences}} {{are important for}} understanding foraging choices. In studying human foragers rather than other animals, we {{have the advantage of}} being able to ask them which foods they prefer. Yet surprisingly, no studies of systematically collected data exist on human forager food preferences. The Hadza of Tanzania are full-time foragers in an area where the hominin record extends back to 3 - 4 million years ago, so their diet is very relevant for understanding the paleo-diet. Here, we report on their food preferences, elicited with photographs of species within the five major food categories in their diet: <b>honey,</b> meat, <b>berries,</b> baobab, and tubers. There were sex differences in the ranks of two food categories: meat and berries. While male and female ranks agreed on the other three food categories, females ranked berries second and meat fourth, whereas males ranked meat second and berries fourth. Theses similarities and differences are interesting {{in light of the fact}} that the sexes target different foods. We discuss the implications of Hadza food preferences for the origin of the uniquely human sexual division of foraging labor...|$|R

40|$|Prošek is a {{traditional}} dessert wine from the coastal region of Croatia made from partially dried grapes. There is very little literature data about the chemical composition and sensory properties of Prošek, so an experimental production from the dried grapes of Plavac mali cultivar has been done using native and induced alcoholic fermentations. To determine the volatile compounds, gas chromatography with flame ionisation detector (GC/FID) was used on the samples prepared with solid phase microextraction (SPME). Higher alcohols, esters, carbonyl compounds and volatile acids were determined in the wine samples. Wines were grouped according to the production method using principal component analysis (PCA). It was found that Prošek wines produced with native and induced alcoholic fermentation differ in their volatile compounds. Descriptive sensory analysis was applied to show the sensory properties of Prošek wine, whose characteristic aromas include those of dried fruit (raisins), red <b>berries,</b> <b>honey,</b> chocolate and vanilla.

50|$|The monk saki (Pithecia monachus) {{also known}} as Geoffroy's monk saki or Miller's monk saki, is a species of saki monkey, a type of New World monkey, from South America. It is found in forested areas of northwestern Brazil and northeastern Peru. This monkey can {{grow up to be}} 30 to 50 cm long and weigh about 1 to 2 kg, {{approximately}} the same as a large rabbit. The thick, bushy tail can be up to 25 to 55 cm long. It has coarse fur, which is long and shaggy around the face and neck. A shy, wary animal, it is totally arboreal, living high in the trees and sometimes descending to lower levels but not to the ground. It generally moves on all fours but may sometimes walk upright on a large branch and will leap across gaps. During the day, it moves in pairs or small family groups, feeding on fruits, <b>berries,</b> <b>honey,</b> some leaves, small mammals such as mice and bats, and birds. The female gives birth to 1 young per mating season with the average family size being 4.5.|$|R
30|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that commensal microbes and the host have evolved reciprocal crosstalk to establish mutualistic relationships. For instance, the existence of vast numbers of intestinal microbes provides an enormous pool of metabolic enzymes, which can break down otherwise indigestible carbohydrates. The availability of such metabolic enzymes is subjected to flux in response to diet. A study in Tanzanian Hadza people provides an elegant {{example of how the}} microbiome changes in response to diet to optimize nutrient uptake for the host (Smits et al., 2017). The microbiome in the Hadza is highly seasonal, changing in a cycle throughout the year. The annual changes in the gut microbiome are probably caused by cyclical shifts in the Hadza diet. During the dry season, the Hadza eat a lot of meat plus tubers and fruit from the baobab tree, but in the wet season they eat more <b>honey</b> and <b>berries.</b> Prevotella species become predominant in the dry season, because they are particularly good at breaking down plant material. Furthermore, several studies have found that childhood malnutrition is associated with microbiota immaturity (Subramanian et al., 2014; Blanton et al., 2016). How is the microbiota established in a newborn, and how does it subsequently mature? It turns out that around 10 percent of human milk comprises complex sugars called human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) (Charbonneau et al., 2016), which babies cannot digest. Instead, these sugars have evolved to feed a baby’s first microbes. They are the means through which mothers ensure that their newborns are colonized by beneficial bacteria. More studies have revealed how intestinal microbes profoundly shape host metabolism. In addition, commensal microbes {{play a critical role in}} host defense against pathogens by directly combating invading pathogens or educating the immune systems. Overall changes in lifestyle, such as western diet, high hygiene standards and overuse of antibiotics, have profoundly altered our microbiome composition. For example, one study on microbiota in people from Amazonas in Venezuela, rural Malawi and US metropolitan areas showed pronounced differences in bacterial assemblages and functional gene repertoires between US residents and those in the other two countries (Yatsunenko et al., 2012). Dysbiosis has been observed in syndromes associated with metabolic and immune regulation, which suggests a scenario in which altered crosstalk between host and microbes underlies the pathogenesis of the related diseases.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{worldwide}} socioeconomic, ecological, {{and cultural}} changes {{have led to}} a paradigm shift in forestry and forest management. Some years ago, most forest enterprises exclusively focused on wood production, whereas today, forest management is expected to be multifunctional and economically as well as socially and ecologically sustainable [Harrison, S., Herbohn, J., Niskanen, A., 2002. Non-industrial, smallholder, small-scale and family forestry: what's in a name? Small-scale Forest Economics. Management and Policy 1 (1), 1 - 11; Schmithuesen, F., 2004. Forest policy developments in changing societies [...] political trends and challenges to research. Towards the sustainable use of Europe's forests: Forest ecosystems and landscape research: Joensuu: European Forest Institute, Proc., vol. 49, pp. 87 - 99]. In this context, non-timber forest products (NTFPs) such as forest <b>honey,</b> mushrooms, or <b>berries</b> could gain importance as an additional source of income for the forestry sector. To assess the market potential of NTFPs in Switzerland, two corresponding surveys were conducted. A consumer survey (NÂ =Â  897) conducted in six cities in Switzerland investigated the purchase of Swiss NTFPs, consumer preferences, and demand potentials. An additional survey of sellers of NTFPs (NÂ =Â  105) looked at these aspects from a complementary perspective. The results showed that there is a high esteem and considerable demand potential for such products among urban consumers. Food products were mentioned most frequently. Both consumers and sellers considered quality and environmental friendliness the most important attributes of NTFPs. Structural and organizational innovations and considerable marketing efforts and sales promotion would be required to expand the market for Swiss NTFP, however. Our results indicate that certification of the products' origin, environmental performance, and quality could support such efforts and that recreational and ecological forest services have a synergetic potential for the marketing of NTFPs.
