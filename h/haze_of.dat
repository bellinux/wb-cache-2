25|$|After {{the middle}} of May and in {{particular}} from mid June {{to the end of}} July the heat in the Sinai desert ranged from extreme to fierce.

The troops and their commanders, unused to the conditions, suffered considerably from heatstroke and thirst during these early patrols. One such patrol, returning during the hottest part of the day after a sleepless night far from base, and very little water, suffered casualties of 160 men who collapsed from heat exhaustion.|$|E
25|$|In March 1978, Gacy lured a 26-year-old named Jeffrey Rignall {{into his}} car. Upon {{entering}} the car, {{the young man}} was chloroformed and driven to the house on Summerdale, where he was raped, tortured with various instruments including lit candles and whips, and repeatedly chloroformed into unconsciousness. Rignall was then driven to Lincoln Park, where he was dumped, unconscious but alive. Eventually he managed to stagger to his girlfriend's apartment. Rignall was later informed the chloroform had permanently damaged his liver. Police were again informed of the assault, but did not investigate Gacy. Rignall was able to recall, through the chloroform <b>haze</b> <b>of</b> that night, Gacy's distinctive black Oldsmobile, the Kennedy Expressway and particular side streets. He staked out the exit on the Expressway where he knew he had been driven until—in April—he saw Gacy's distinctive black Oldsmobile, which Rignall and his friends followed to 8213 West Summerdale. Police issued an arrest warrant, and Gacy was arrested on July 15. He was facing an impending trial for a battery charge for the Rignall incident when he was arrested in December for the murders.|$|E

A second standard gauge railway line from Romani to Mahamdiyah on the Mediterranean coast was completed by 9 June.

He recalled later, [...] "for me the war passed in a romantic <b>haze</b> <b>of</b> trying to be a hero." [...] This attitude changed as he reflected on the destructiveness of war and in 1940 he wrote, {{in a letter to his}} friend Arthur Sale, that [...] "a year or two after [...] the sight of a khaki uniform began to mean everything in life that was wrong and wasteful and anti-life.

500|$|The Austrians were {{astonished}} at the Prussian appearance on their left flank. The objective was soon clear: the Prussian infantry, now arrayed {{in the conventional}} two lines of battle, advanced on the weakest part of the Austrian line, intending to roll up the flank. [...] The Austrian colonels on the scene did the best they could: by turning their own lines 90 degrees, they tried {{to take advantage of}} a shallow ditch facing the Prussian line. Franz Leopold von Nádasdy, commanding the flank, asked Charles for support, a request the Prince ignored: even at late morning, with most of the Prussian army on his left flank, he still believed that any attack would come at the northern flank. [...] Most of the men in the first Austrian line were Württembergers, Protestant troops whose willingness to fight the Lutheran Prussians had been called into question by the Austrian command. The Württembergers held out, maintaining steady musket fire until the mass of Prussians emerged through the <b>haze</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder. Then they ran for their lives, sweeping the Bavarians Nádasdy had deployed to support his flank with them.|$|E

[...] In later years, O'Reilly vigorously denied that Leyland held the upper hand, responding to such suggestions by saying [...] "You just check how many times I got him out!" [...] The cricket historian David Frith points out that [...] "the answer is nine times in 16 Tests, but with decreasing frequency. In their Test encounters Leyland made 1,412 runs at an average of 56." [...] Robertson-Glasgow noted that Leyland was almost anonymous in good batting conditions under little pressure; he came to life in more difficult circumstances: [...] "His element was foul weather.

40|$|North China Plain (NCP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{populated}} and polluted regions in China. During the recent years, haze and fog occur frequently and cause severely low visibility in this region. In order to better understand the impact of aerosol particles on the formation <b>of</b> <b>haze</b> and fog, a long-term record <b>of</b> <b>haze</b> and fog occurrences in the past 56 years (from 1954 – 2009) over NCP is analyzed. The results show that there are rapid changes in the occurrences <b>of</b> <b>haze</b> and fog over NCP. The occurrences <b>of</b> <b>haze</b> and fog were low during 1970 – 1980, and reached a maximum during 1981 – 1998. After 1999, the occurrences <b>of</b> <b>haze</b> and fog slightly decreased.
