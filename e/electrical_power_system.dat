He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.|$|E
5|$|Hammer {{pointed out}} that Edison {{was not the first}} to make an {{electric}} light bulb. He claims instead that Edison made the first commercial electric light bulb that was successful. The other electric lamps made by others had inherent defects and burned out quickly, making them not practical for use to the general public. Edison first used various experimental vegetable fibers for the lamp filaments. One was a processed bamboo fiber used for a filament inside a glass bulb containing a vacuum. This was a filament of high resistance. Edison's electric lamp internal wire was unique in that the element had a resistance of around 140 ohms. There were several advantages to this, one being that several could be connected {{at the same time to}} a circuit. Others used filaments of low resistance ranging from 1 ohm to 5 ohms. This low resistance not only overloaded the <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> <b>system,</b> but the wire filaments burned out quickly from extreme heat. They were impractical and expensive – not conducive to a commercial market.|$|E

Small voltages often exist between two grounded objects in separate locations, due to normal current flow in the power system.

25|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{the power}} factor of an AC <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> {{is defined as}} the ratio of the real power flowing to the load to the apparent power in the circuit, and is a dimensionless number in the closed interval of −1 to 1. A power factor of less than one means that the voltage and current waveforms are not in phase, reducing the instantaneous product of the two waveforms (V × I). Real power is the capacity of the circuit for performing work in a particular time. Apparent power is the product of the current and voltage of the circuit. Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source, or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source, the apparent power will be greater than the real power. A negative power factor occurs when the device (which is normally the load) generates power, which then flows back towards the source, which is normally considered the generator.|$|E
