5|$|Universal {{wanted a}} sequel to Jaws early into {{the success of the}} {{original}} film. Producers Brown and Zanuck realized that someone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> produce the film if they did not, and preferred {{to be in charge of}} the project themselves.|$|E
5|$|After Naomi (Marsha Thomason) parachuted {{onto the}} island in season three, the {{producers}} began to plan who <b>else</b> <b>would</b> be on the freighter she came from. They wanted these new characters to be scientists, who {{would be interested in}} finding the island for their own personal reasons. They decided to create a character who would be interested in lost civilizations, and named her Charlotte Staples Lewis as a reference to C. S. Lewis, which Lost producer Damon Lindelof said was a clue to the direction the show would be taking during season four.|$|E
5|$|Elvis {{might never}} have been born, but someone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic {{accounts}} for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.|$|E

5|$|The {{children}} {{were put into}} {{the care of a}} nanny, as was usual in upper-class families at the time. The first nanny was dismissed for insolence and the second for abusing the children. This second woman, anxious to suggest that the children preferred her to anyone <b>else,</b> <b>would</b> pinch Edward and Albert whenever they were about to be presented to their parents so that they would start crying and be speedily returned to her. On discovery, she was replaced by her effective and much-loved assistant, Charlotte Bill.|$|E
5|$|This little work, if Mary {{had never}} {{produced}} any thing <b>else,</b> <b>would</b> serve, with persons of true taste and sensibility, {{to establish the}} eminence of her genius. The story is nothing. He that looks into the book only for incident, will probably lay it down with disgust. But the feelings are of the truest and most exquisite class; every circumstance is adorned with that species of imagination, which enlists itself under the banners of delicacy and sentiment.|$|E
5|$|On December 12 the Dukes faced {{off against}} another local rival, Robert Morris. In a 59–54win, B.J. Monteiro again {{led the team}} with 17points. Monteiro's {{continued}} high level of play prompted some analysts, as well as fans, to wonder whether the approaching return of Melquan Bolding would send Monteiro back to the bench, or if someone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> lose their starting position. Four days later the Dukes held off the Canisius Golden Griffins in a double overtime 86–77 victory at home. Bill Clark and Damian Saunders both contributed double doubles while B.J. Monteiro scored a career high 27 points.|$|E

60|$|I repeat, to {{say that}} any {{creature}} was called into being for no purpose at all, is to question {{the wisdom of the}} Almighty. Even if a babe makes its appearance on this terrestrial scene, and wails out its brief career in a single day, it was sent here for a special purpose, <b>else</b> it <b>would</b> not have been sent, and that purpose must have been fully accomplished, <b>else</b> it <b>would</b> not have died.|$|R

5|$|Religions {{outside the}} Judeo-Christian {{mainstream}} {{also have a}} home in the city. During the mid-to-late 1950s, members of the Nation of Islam created a temple in north Minneapolis, and the first mosque was built in 1967. In 1972 a relief agency resettled the first Shi'a Muslim family from Uganda. By 2004, between 20,000 and 30,000 Somali Muslims made the city their home. In 1972, Dainin Katagiri was invited from California to Minneapolis—by one account, a place he thought nobody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> want to go—where he founded a lineage which today includes three Sōtō Zen centers among the city's nearly 20 Buddhist and meditation centers. Atheists For Human Rights has its headquarters in the Shingle Creek neighborhood in a geodesic dome. Minneapolis has had a chartered local body of Ordo Templi Orientis since 1994.|$|E
5|$|With Homer having {{convinced}} Lisa {{that nothing}} can go wrong at Krusty's show, Lisa and Ralph go together. On live air, Krusty begins interviewing audience members, and Ralph takes the opportunity to declare that Lisa is {{the love of his}} life and that he intends to marry her in the future. Angry, Lisa snaps, stating that she had never liked him and that the only reason she gave him a Valentine was because nobody <b>else</b> <b>would.</b> Later at home, Bart takes the moment to replay that scene to Lisa in which Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt. Lisa soon feels guilty and regrets her actions in hurting Ralph's feelings.|$|E
5|$|After Byzantium, the Spartans were {{allegedly}} {{eager to}} end their involvement in the war. The Spartans were supposedly of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible. In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion. Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities were originally Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one <b>else,</b> <b>would</b> protect the Ionians. This marks {{the point at which}} the leadership of the Greek Alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantium, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.|$|E

5|$|Together {{with the}} demon Nadja, Aleph travels through the underground, finding a brainwashed Hiroko in a {{concentration}} camp. Her cell is guarded by Zayin, who admits to having {{doubts about the}} Center's action and lets Aleph free Hiroko; she refuses to leave, but Nadja frees her from the brainwashing by fusing with her. On their way back, Aleph and Hiroko learn that the Center has released the demon Abaddon to swallow the entire Valhalla district, and that the Center only plans to let those they deem worthy be allowed {{to live in the}} Thousand-Year Kingdom; everyone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> be abandoned and left to die. Zayin starts a revolt against the Center, who threatens to cut off the air supply to the Holytown district if he does not surrender; he, Aleph and Hiroko go to the Center to confront the four elders leading it. Aleph and Hiroko learn that the elders are actually the archangels Michael, Raphael, Uriel and Gabriel; Aleph and Hiroko fight and kill the first three archangels, after which Gabriel reveals that YHVH, the creator god, had ordered the archangels to watch over the creation of Tokyo Millennium and wait for the Messiah, but that Michael, Raphael and Uriel, unable to wait any longer, created Aleph as an artificial, false Messiah, leading YHVH to abandon them; he was the boy Hiroko was searching for, aged unnaturally fast to take on the role of Messiah. Similarly, Beth was artificially created as the Messiah's partner, Zayin as his bodyguard, Daleth as a false savior intended to be defeated by the Messiah so that Aleph would win the people's favor, and Gimmel as a trial Messiah for the Arcadia prototype.|$|E
25|$|This {{is how it}} was for me. This is how I played it. It's just a pippy-poo {{little book}} and people come back with this {{diatribe}} about its great social significance. Well it's just because nobody ever got off his high horse long enough to write to single women in any form they could associate with. If they had, somebody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> be the arbiter for single women at this point instead of me.|$|E
25|$|The earning to give {{strategy}} has been proposed as a possible strategy for effective altruists. This strategy involves choosing to work in high-paying careers with the explicit goal of donating {{large sums of money}} to charity. Benjamin Todd and William MacAskill have argued that the marginal impact of one's potentially unethical actions in such a lucrative career would be small since someone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> have done them regardless, while the impact of donations would be large.|$|E

25|$|This {{icy water}} rescue {{is said to}} have {{exacerbated}} Peter's bladder problems and caused his death. The story, however, has been viewed with skepticism by some historians, pointing out that the German chronicler Jacob von Stählin is the only source for the story, and it seems unlikely that no one <b>else</b> <b>would</b> have documented such an act of heroism. This, plus the interval of time between these actions and Peter's death seems to preclude any direct link.|$|E
25|$|For example, suppose jobs A and B {{are both}} valued at $1 on the market. And suppose {{that because of}} your unique abilities, you can do job A twice over (100% extra output) in the same effort as it would take you to do job B. But job B {{is the one that}} you need done right now. Under perfect {{division}} of labor, you would do job A and somebody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> do job B. Your unique abilities would always be rewarded.|$|E
25|$|The Mirror of Erised was {{the final}} {{protection}} given to the Philosopher's Stone in the first book. Dumbledore hid the Mirror and hid the Stone inside it, knowing that only a person who wanted to find but not use the Stone {{would be able to}} obtain it. Anyone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> see him or herself making an Elixir of Life or turning things to gold, rather than actually finding the Stone, and would be unable to obtain it. What happens to it afterwards is unknown.|$|E

25|$|Arthur's father {{insists that}} Arthur {{has to get}} the play {{published}} so that Arthur, Dana, and their mother can profit immensely from it. He wants Arthur to claim the quarto was found by Sil in an attic in the 1950s, and to verify that nobody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> have a claim to the text (namely, the estates of the printer and publisher, William White and Cuthbert Burby). A.E.H. Phillips reveals that he is dying, and, with Dana and Petra's encouragement, Arthur agrees {{to carry out this}} last request in spite of his lifelong distrust of his father.|$|E
25|$|The {{bridge is}} the subject of several local legends. Its {{construction}} was said to have been financed by the two Bellamont sisters. Both had become engaged and were to throw a joint celebration; their fiancés, however, had to meet with the local barons {{on the far side of}} the river. Following a storm the Trent became swollen. Eager to return to their brides-to-be and their party, the men tried to ford the river on horseback. Both were swept away and drowned. The Bellamont sisters commissioned the bridge so that no one <b>else</b> <b>would</b> suffer the tragedy they had suffered. Neither sister married and both died in poverty having exhausted their fortune on building the bridge.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} {{raised by}} union supporters is that unionized workers will spend their higher wages, driving {{economic growth and}} creating new jobs. Union opponents respond {{that this is an}} example of the broken window fallacy; union supporters assume that money is more valuable in the hands of unionized workers than in the hands of whoever <b>else</b> <b>would</b> obtain it in the union's absence. There is some evidence that this is not a fallacy, as greater wealth equality seems to be correlated with greater economic growth. Union supporters counter that unions, if organized without violence or government help, are part of the free market; if unions can win higher wages for their workers without coercion, those wages are legitimate.|$|E
