50|$|Even {{keratinized}} tissue can undergo further {{level of}} hyperkeratinization; {{an increase in}} the amount of keratin is produced as a result of chronic physical trauma to the region. Changes such as hyperkeratinization are reversible if the source of the injury is removed, but it takes time for the keratin to be shed or lost by the tissue. Thus, to check for malignant changes, a baseline biopsy and microscopic study of any whitened tissue may be indicated, especially if in a high-risk cancer category, such with a history of tobacco or alcohol use or are HPV positive. <b>Hyperkeratinized</b> tissue is also associated with the heat from smoking or hot fluids on the hard palate in the form of nicotinic stomatitis.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{keratinized}} epithelium, nonkeratinized epithelium normally has no superficial layers showing keratinization. Nonkeratinized epithelium may, however, readily {{transform into}} a keratinizing type {{in response to}} frictional or chemical trauma, in which case it undergoes hyperkeratinization.This change to hyperkeratinization commonly occurs on the usually nonkeratinized buccal mucosa when the linea alba forms, a white ridge of calloused tissue that extends horizontally at the level where the maxillary and mandibular teeth come together and occlude. Histologically, an excess amount of keratin is noted {{on the surface of}} the tissue, and the tissue has all the layers of an orthokeratinized tissue with its granular and keratin layers. In patients who have habits such as clenching or grinding (bruxism) their teeth, a larger area of the buccal mucosa than just the linea alba becomes <b>hyperkeratinized.</b> This larger white, rough, raised lesion needs to be recorded so that changes may be made in the dental treatment plan regarding the patient’s parafunctional habits.|$|E
40|$|Heat shock {{proteins}} (HSPs), {{known to}} {{play a key role}} in cellular homeostasis, may also play a role in the defensive mechanisms of gastric mucosa. By means of appropriate immunohistochemical and immunobiochemical techniques, the expression of HSP 27, HSP 72 and HSP 73 within the epithelium of normal and pre-ulcerative (<b>hyperkeratinized)</b> mucosa of the pars oesophagea of abattoir pigs was assessed. In normal mucosa, HSP 72 and HSP 73 expression was mainly limited to the basal epithelial cell layer, whereas HSP 27 expression was consistently detected within the superficial epithelial cell layers. In <b>hyperkeratinized</b> mucosa, HSP 72 and HSP 73 immunoreactivity appeared to be more widespread, becoming very intense within epithelial cells affected by hydropic degeneration. <b>Hyperkeratinized</b> mucosa also showed HSP 27 immunoreactivity, which was particularly intense in epithelial areas affected by hydropic degeneration. Western blot analysis confirmed HSP 27, HSP 72 and HSP 73 expression in normal and in pre-ulcerative mucosa of the pars oesophagea. Semi-quantitative analysis showed that for all three HSPs the immunoreactivity was more intense in pre-ulcerative mucosa than in normal mucosa. The different expression patterns observed may have functional significance; further studies are needed, however, to define the role of HSPs in swine oesophagogastric lesions, the aetiology and pathogenesis of which are largely unknown.

40|$|AbstractCongenital {{ichthyosis}} {{is a type}} of generalized hyperkeratinization of {{the skin}} at birth. Three forms of congenital ichthyosis have been defined based on clinical aspects and severity: (1) congenital ichthyosis mitis; (2) congenital ichthyosis tarda; and (3) congenital ichthyosis gravis. Desquamation of the parchment-like <b>hyperkeratinized</b> skin begins shortly after birth and may require several weeks to complete. Skin alterations in the eyelid cause shortening of the anterior lamella, subsequently resulting in ectropion. This affects the upper eyelid more often than the lower eyelid and can lead to complications such as chronic palpebral or bulbar conjunctivitis and keratinization or exposure keratopathy. In this paper, we present two case reports illustrating the course of ichthyosis congenita mitis and ichthyosis congenita tarda...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{proto-oncogene}} c-fos {{is a major}} nuclear {{target for}} signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and transformation. Using the multistep skin carcinogenesis model, we have directly tested the ability of c-fos-deficient mice to develop cancer. Upon treatment with a tumor promoter, c-fos knockout mice carrying a v-H-ras transgene were able to develop benign tumors with similar kinetics and relative incidence as wild-type animals. However, c-fos-deficient papillomas quickly became very dry and <b>hyperkeratinized,</b> taking on an elongated, horny appearance. While wild-type papillomas eventually progressed into malignant tumors, c-fos-deficient tumors failed to undergo malignant conversion. Experiments in which v-H-ras-expressing keratinocytes were grafted onto nude mice suggest that c-fos-deficient cells have an intrinsic defect that hinders tumorigenesis. These results demonstrate that {{a member of the}} AP- 1 family of transcription factors is required {{for the development of a}} malignant tumor...|$|E
40|$|A young Labrador Retriever was {{presented}} {{for treatment of}} severe distal hindlimb necrosis caused by bandage ischemia. During digit amputation at the metatarsophalangeal joints, {{the third and fourth}} digital pads were salvaged and transferred to the metatarsal stump to create a weight-bearing surface. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPVVT) was utilized for flap immobilization and to promote granulation tissue in the remaining wound defect. Sturdy adherence of the digital pads was achieved after only four days. The skin defect healed completely by second intention and the stump was epithelialized with a thin pad after three months. At the nine month follow-up examination, the stump had a thick <b>hyperkeratinized</b> pad. The dog walked and ran without any apparent signs of discomfort and compensated for the loss of limb length by extending the stifle and tarsocrural joints. Despite a challenging wound in a difficult anatomical location, digital pad flap transfer and NPWT proved successful in restoring long-term ambulation in an active large breed dog...|$|E
40|$|Skin lesions from {{patients}} with Flegel's disease {{have been reported}} to be without membrane-coating granules (Odland bodies). Biopsies of the <b>hyperkeratinized</b> papules of Kyrle-Flegel disease were incubated in vitro with the intercellular tracer, horseradish peroxidase, and the extent of penetration of this substance examined in the light and electron microscopes. The peroxidase was present throughout the corium and extended through the intercellular spaces of the epidermis to a level close to the junction of the granular and keratinized layers; it did not enter the bulk of the thickened stratum corneum of the lesion. Ultrastructural examination revealed the presence of small vesicles in the granular layer, similar in size and shape to membrane-coating granules but lacking a lamellate internal structure; these were occasionally seen fusing with the plasma membrane of the cells. It is suggested that the intercellular permeability barrier to horseradish peroxidase demonstrated in the Kyrle-Flegel lesion may arise from material contributed by these granules to the intercellular space...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. We {{hypothesize that}} growth hormone (GH) plays a {{significant}} role in the regulation of the meibomian gland. To test our hypothesis, we examined the influence of GH on mouse meibomian gland structure. Methods. We studied four groups of mice, including (1) bovine (b) GH transgenic mice with excess GH; (2) GH receptor (R) antagonist (A) transgenic mice with decreased GH; (3) GHR knockout (−/−) mice with no GH activity; and (4) wild type (WT) control mice. After mouse sacrifice, eyelids were processed for morphological and image analyses. Results. Our results show striking structural changes in the GH-deficient animals. Many of the GHR−/− and GHA meibomian glands featured <b>hyperkeratinized</b> and thickened ducts, acini inserting into duct walls, and poorly differentiated acini. In contrast, the morphology of WT and bGH meibomian glands appeared similar. The sizes of meibomian glands of bGH mice were significantly larger and those of GHA and GHR−/− mice were significantly smaller than glands of WT mice. Conclusions. Our findings support our hypothesis that the GH/IGF- 1 axis plays {{a significant role}} in the control of the meibomian gland. In addition, our data show that GH modulates the morphology and size of this tissue...|$|E
40|$|Verrucous {{carcinoma}} is a rarely occurring, low-grade {{variant of}} squamous cell carcinoma, slow-growing verrucous and with minimal dysplasia. [1] The incidence of epithelioma cuniculatum is unknown, with a predominance {{for men in}} their fifth–sixth decades. [2] It occurs most commonly on the ball of the sole (53 %), followed by the toes (21 %) and heel (16 %). [3] The three major locations of verrucous carcinoma are the oral cavity (oral florid papillomatosis), the anogenital region (giant condyloma of Buschke and Lowenstein); when verrucous carcinoma involves the plantar surface of the foot, it is named carcinoma cuniculatum (CC). Metastasis from CC is rare, although it can invade deep into the soft tissues and can extend to tendons, muscles, or bone. [1, 4] We report {{a case of a}} 67 -year-old healthy man with 10 years history of enlarging cauliflower-like lesion of his right heel, initially diagnosed and treated as a wart. During the years, the lesion has grown progressively despite treatment until becoming a deeply penetrating mass, 6 cm × 5 cm × 3 cm, with an exophytic and hyperkeratotic component [Figure 1 a]. Histopathologic examination showed <b>hyperkeratinized</b> epithelium, acanthosis, parakeratosis with keratin-filled cores, and crypts often contained keratin-rich neutrophil microabscesses, with a characteristic burrowing pattern; blunt papillary projections of well-differentiated epithelium, little atypia, with nonreactive edematous stroma [Figure 1 e]. The histopathological diagnosis was CC. Surgical intervention is the treatment of choice for CC, with a 5 -mm tumor-free margin so that early detection may result in a smaller surgical defect. [2] If the tumor causes deep bone invasion, amputation might be warranted. [2] Computed tomography (CT) is superior to any other imaging technology to assess a bone involvement, particularly when minimal changes in the cortical bone and periosteal reaction are involved, due to its excellent spatial resolution and high specificity. [4] In our patient, a solid enhancing exophytic lesion at cutaneous localization was well evident in the plantar region [Figure ​[Figure 1 c 1 c and ​andd],d], with partially deep extension in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. CT did not show any deep invasion affecting the plantar aponeurosis and calcaneus bone with an evident cleavage plane represented by adipose tissue. In the subcutaneous adipose tissue, near the lesion, there were several hyperdense strands [Figure 1 c and d arrowhead], which were not infiltrative aspects of the tumor, but rather vascular structures. A wide excision and reconstruction with successful, full-thickness skin grafting were performed [Figure 1 b]. After the treatment, the patient follow-up is required, as recurrence of CC has been reported despite clear histological resection margins. [3] CT is superior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in determining incipient bone invasion. [4, 5] MRI can discriminate better between different types of soft tissue pathology than CT, but not so precisely an early bone invasion. In other words, it delineates the depth of involvement of tumor but does not influence the final choice of surgical procedure in an early stage of invasion. CT can show early, typical signs of an aggressive tumor, as radiolucent lesions with ill-defined margins and resorption of the adjacent cortical bone. [4] Hence, it is crucial to evaluate the evidence of possible bone involvement on imaging with CT for a correct surgical approach in all CC with a high risk of bone and periosteal tissues invasion...|$|E
