40|$|PHILOSOPHY {{undertakes}} {{to study}} the general principles {{in a field of}} knowledge. For the purposes of this review, the term philosophy <b>of</b> <b>guidance</b> is construed as embracing philosophical and theoretical rationales fundamental to guidance services. In terms of this definition, there exists a plethora <b>of</b> books on <b>guidance</b> methods and services, but there are almost no books that deal with theory; articles on the philosophy <b>of</b> <b>guidance</b> are outnumbered 30 to 1 by articles on methods and procedures. There is, nevertheless, some material in journals on the philosophical and theoreti-cal foundations <b>of</b> <b>guidance.</b> This review makes no reference to dissertations, because the philosophy <b>of</b> <b>guidance</b> is a subject that appears to have been wholly neglected by doctoral researchers.

5000|$|Research has {{demonstrated}} that higher level <b>of</b> <b>guidance</b> has a greater effect on scaffolded learning, but is not a guarantee of more learning. [...] The efficacy of higher amount <b>of</b> <b>guidance</b> {{is dependent on the}} level <b>of</b> detail and <b>guidance</b> applicability. [...] Having multiple types <b>of</b> <b>guidance</b> (i.e. worked examples, feedback) can cause them to interact and reinforce each other. Multiple conditions do not guarantee greater learning, as certain types <b>of</b> <b>guidance</b> can be extraneous to the learning goals or the modality of learning. With this, more guidance (if not appropriate to the learning) can negatively impact performance, as it gives the learner overwhelming levels of information. [...] However, appropriately designed high levels <b>of</b> <b>guidance,</b> which properly interact with the learning, is more beneficial to learning than low levels <b>of</b> <b>guidance.</b>|$|R
