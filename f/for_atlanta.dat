25|$|The Bucs {{went to the}} Georgia Dome for a Week 2 contest {{against their}} {{division}} rival, the Atlanta Falcons. Historically, the Buccaneers {{had been able to}} effectively contain Falcons' QB Michael Vick, shutting down the Falcons' offense in the process. However, the Bucs' performance here had not improved much from Week 1. The defense was unable to stop the running duo of Vick and RB Warrick Dunn, whose combined performance netted 261 yards, and 306 <b>for</b> <b>Atlanta</b> as a team—a new Falcons team record. Also illustrating their sharp fall in performance from their #1 NFL ranking the previous season, the Bucs' defense also allowed a 1-yard QB TD run by Vick and a 4-yard TD pass to RB Fred McCrary. Bucs QB Chris Simms continued to struggle, throwing another three interceptions, while Carnell Williams was held to just 37 yards on 15 carries. The Bucs' only points came on a chip-shot 22-yard field goal by kicker Matt Bryant.|$|E

25|$|The Falcons {{started off}} {{the third quarter}} with an 8-play, 71-yard drive, {{including}} Bartkowski's passes to Floyd Hodge and Alfred Jenkins for gains of 25 and 22 yards. Faced with fourth down on the Vikings 17-yard line, Atlanta managed to fool the Minnesota defense with a fake field goal play. Backup quarterback Mike Moroski, the holder on field goal plays, took the snap and started run right, but then pitched the ball to kicker Mick Luckhurst, who raced 17 {{yards for a touchdown}} (the only rush attempt of his career) to give his team a 14-13 lead. The situation got even better <b>for</b> <b>Atlanta</b> just two minutes later when safety Bob Glazebrook intercepted Kramer's pass and returned it 35 yards for a touchdown. However, the Vikings managed to cut their deficit down to one score {{before the end of the}} third quarter with a 70-yard drive that included Kramer's 18-yard completion to tight end Joe Senser. Danmier finished off the series with a 39-yard field goal, making the score 21-16 going into the final quarter.|$|E

25|$|The Nationals {{played their}} annual Independence Day contest at Nationals Park on July 4 against the {{division}} rival New York Mets, with Joe Ross starting {{for the home}} team. The Nationals won 11–4, marking yet another game for Ross in which he received run support in the double-digits: his seventh in 12 starts on the season to that point. The win was also Washington's 50th of the season. The next day's game was postponed due to rain, while the game {{on the day after}} that — the opener of a series at Nationals Park against Washington's top division rival, the Atlanta Braves — was delayed for more than three hours due to a thunderstorm in the forecast, which never materialized, prompting some criticism of the Nationals for unnecessarily pushing back the start time until 10:10 p.m. EDT. The July 6 game, which actually finished early in the morning of July 7 due to the late start, was a 5–2 Braves win. Starting center fielder Michael A. Taylor was lifted midway through the game with an oblique strain, which manager Dusty Baker announced after the game would send him to the 10-day disabled list, with outfielder Chris Heisey being activated from the disabled list in a corresponding move. The Nationals struck back that evening, mounting a ferocious ninth-inning rally in the July 7 game to come back from a three-run deficit and force extra innings. In the tenth inning, the shortstop Sánchez lined a slider from former National Ian Krol, pitching in relief <b>for</b> <b>Atlanta,</b> up the middle for his first career hit. Three at-bats later, Sánchez came around to score on second baseman Daniel Murphy's walk-off single over the head of left fielder Matt Kemp, and the Nationals won 5–4. In the July 8 game, though, the Nationals suffered their first shutout of the year, losing 13–0 as the Braves pummeled starter Stephen Strasburg, who exited the game in the third inning after being hit on the hip with a line drive comebacker; usual starter Tanner Roark, in his first relief appearance of the season; and Solis, still working his way back from injury. The Nationals defeated Atlanta 10–5 to earn a split of the four-game series on July 9, in their last game before the All-Star Break. Ross again received double-digit run support, for the eighth time in 13 starts to begin the season, but exited in the fourth inning after exhibiting a marked decrease in velocity and struggling with his command. The team announced several days later that Ross would undergo Tommy John surgery, forcing him to miss the remainder of the season and beyond.|$|E
