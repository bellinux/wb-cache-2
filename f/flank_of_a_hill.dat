60|$|Upon September 25th {{the small}} {{garrison}} {{heard that the}} main force of the Boers was sweeping towards them, and prepared {{to give them a}} soldiers' welcome. The fort is situated upon the <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill,</b> on the summit of which, a mile from the main trenches, a strong outpost was stationed. It was upon this that the first force of the attack broke at midnight of September 25th. The garrison, eighty strong, was fiercely beset by several hundred Boers, and the post was eventually carried after a sharp and bloody contest. Kane, of the South Lancashires, died with the words 'No surrender' upon his lips, and Potgieter, a Boer leader, was pistolled by Kane's fellow officer, Lefroy. Twenty of the small garrison fell, and the remainder were overpowered and taken.|$|E

5000|$|Novelist and screenwriter Raymond Chandler on Westport, Washington, circa 1936:An hour’s fast driving Olympia, Washington through thinned-out timber…brought me within {{sound of}} surf. The broad white road, striped with yellow down the center, swept around the <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill,</b> a distant cluster of {{buildings}} loomed {{up in front}} of the shine of the ocean, and the road forked. The left fork was posted: “Westport - 9 miles”, and didn’t go towards the buildings. It crossed a rusty cantilever bridge and plunged into a region of wind-distorted apple orchards.Twenty minutes more and I chugged into Westport, a sandy spit of land with scattered frame houses dotted over rising ground behind it. The end of the spit was a long narrow pier and the end of the pier a cluster of sailing boats with half-lowered sails flapping against their single masts. And beyond them a buoyed channel and a long irregular line where the water creamed on a hidden sandbar.Beyond the sandbar the Pacific rolled over to Japan. This was the last outpost of the coast, the farthest west a man could go and still be on the mainland of the United States...|$|E
5000|$|Ocieka, {{a village}} on the stream Ocieka or Ociecki (part of the Tuszymka river), in the county (‘powiat’) of Ropczyce, lies in a sandy lowland (206 m), along with Wola Ocieska and Zadzikierz. To the north it is {{surrounded}} by a large pine forest, the southern part of which is called ‘Spalony las′ (‘burnt forest′), the northern part ‘Sokolny las′ (‘falcon forest′); to the east is the forest of the village of Kamionka, and to the south part of the forests of the village of Ostrów, ‘Duży las′ (‘large forest′), Saszczyński and Sarni (‘deer's’) las. In the middle of the village, near the church, runs the Kolbuszowa-Ropczyce highway, from which a branch runs west, and in Dąbie (8 km away) on the Wisłoka river, it joins the main highway from Rzochów to Dębica. The outlying settlement of Zadzikierz lies to the northeast (3 km), near the forest on the northeast <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> (245 m) (this now appears to be the place now called Sadykierz). Wola Ocieska (today called Wola Ociecka), which has a beautiful manor house, is northwest of Ocieka, on the road to Dąbie, on the northwest flank of the wooded Łysa górka (211 m). Between Ocieka and Zadzikierz there are four small ponds, and on the stream a watermill and a windmill. With these outlying settlements the village has 1,465 Roman Catholic inhabitants, of whom 127 live {{on the grounds of the}} major estate, owned by Count Władyslaw Romer. The major estate has 756 mórgs of farmland (1 mórg ≈ 0.56 ha), 52 of meadows and gardens, 89 of pastures, and 1,678 of forests; the minor estate has 1,948 mórgs of farmland, 388 of meadows, 479 of pastures, and 343 of forests. The pastures are mostly sandy waste-land. The parish church is old and made of wood, of unknown funding, and contains sacramental registers dating from 1785. The parish includes Blizna, with 233 inhabitants; there are 37 Jews in the parish. There is a people's school here, and a fund for the poor, which has 500 zł. in austrian currency. The Reverend Franciszek Siarczyński (in a manuscript in the Ossolineum library, N°. 1826), says that this village belonged to Rzemień and that Anna née Ocieska Mielecka named it, but adds that it is probably the ancestral seat of the Ocieskis, who also owned Rzemień. The villages nearest Ocieka are, to the east, Zdżary and Kamionka, to the south Ostrów, to the west Pustków-Krownice and Dąbie, to the north Blizna.

40|$|In the {{well-known}} text of Philo of Alexandria’s De Vita Contemplativa, scholars today {{may find the}} portrayal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> community <b>of</b> men and women living {{in the first century}} AD who were united by their particular understanding of the contemplative life and by the lifestyle they adopted. This community lived in relative seclusion on the <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> overlooking Lake Mareotis, near Alexandria, and as ascetics who dedicated their lives to contemplation in silence and solitude, they named themselves therapeutae. But in Philo’s text they are further described not only as «philosophers», but as «true philosophers». The purpose of the present paper, therefore, is to understand something of the scope and meaning of the Mareot therapeutae’s philosophical life – conditioned, as this must be, by the fact that all we know comes from Philo’s work, and because while he refers to them there as «true philosophers», his study only examines the community in their historical context...|$|R

50|$|The {{excavations}} at Huaca Santa Clara tell us {{the nature}} of the relationship between the Moche leaders and the Gallinazo community. This site was originally believed to be a classic Moche settlement but through architectural assessment and ceramic evidence, Huaca Santa Clara was a ‘flourishing’ Gallinazo community. Huaca Santa Clara was a midsized administrative settlement built by members of the Virú polity on the <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small <b>hill</b> that dominates the center of the valley floor. It’s suggested that this site severed as an important node in Virú’s valley-wide administrative network because it is the only entry point from the highlands. This is important to the site because the major irrigation canal intakes are located in the highlands near the entry point.|$|R

6000|$|The {{next morning}} saw the Expedition afoot at six a.m., {{determined}} {{to make up for}} a half by the whole day's work so long intended. The track struck eastward, and issued from the dull hollow, Majrá el-Ruways, by a made road about {{a mile and a half}} long, a cornice cut in the stony <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> whose head projected southwards into the broad Wady Hujayl ("the Little Partridge"). This line seems to drain inland; presently it bends round by the east and feeds the Wady Dámah. Rain must lately have fallen, for the earth is [...] "purfled flowers," [...] pink, white, and yellow. The latter is the tint prevailing in Midian, often suggesting the careless European wheat-field, in which [...] "shillock" [...] or wild mustard rears its gamboge head above the green. Midian wants not only the charming oleander and the rugged terebinth, typical of the Desert; but also the [...] "blood of Adonis," [...] the lovely anemone which lights up the Syrian landscape like the fisherman's scarlet cap in a sea-piece. This stage introduced us to the Hargul (Harjal, Rhazya stricta), whose perfume filled the valley with the clean smell of the henna-bloom, the Eastern privet--Mr. Clarke said [...] "wallflowers." [...] Our mules ate it greedily, whilst the country animals, they say, refuse it: the flowers, dried and pounded, cure by fumigation [...] "pains in the bones." [...] Here also we saw for the first time the quaint distaff-shape of the purple red Masrúr (Cynomorium coccineum, Linn.), from which the Bedawi [...] "cook bread." [...] It is eaten simply peeled and sun-dried, when it has a vegetable taste slightly astringent as if by tannin, something between a potato and a turnip; or its rudely pounded flour is made into balls with soured milk. This styptic, I am told by Mr. R. B. Sharpe, of the British Museum, was long supposed to be peculiar to Malta; hence its pre-Linnaean name (Fungus Melitensis).[EN#2] Now it is known to occur through the Mediterranean to India. Let me here warn future collectors of botany in Midian that throughout the land the vegetable kingdom follows the rule of the mineral: every march shows something new; and he who neglects to gather specimens, especially of the smaller flowers, in one valley, will perhaps find none of them in those adjoining.|$|R
50|$|The dolmen {{is located}} on a level {{platform}} on the <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small <b>hill</b> and is oriented northeast to southwest. Excavations in the 1960s and 1970s have identified the different phases of the development. The first chamber was constructed with side slabs and a capstone, making a rectangular box some 3 by 1 m and about 2 m tall. This is the main structure {{that can be seen}} today, the capstone having slipped to one side to rest upon the ground. The second chamber was constructed to the northeast of this, and nothing remains of it now. However two post holes show where a wooden portal or some other structure stood. The third chamber was built to the northeast of the second one. It was about 5 m long and parts are still visible in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small upright, a large portal stone standing 3 m high and some way away from the other stones, and a stone stump, perhaps the remains of another portal. The whole structure would have been covered with <b>a</b> mound <b>of</b> earth or rubble, probably small and circular over the original chamber, but much longer and rather wider when all three chambers had been constructed. Although this mound has disappeared, excavations suggest that it stretched for about 65 m and was about 15 m wide. Excavations have revealed pieces of pottery and cremation sites.|$|R
50|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Burn of Monboys rise on the southern and western slopes of the Meikle Carewe Hill where the stream flows downslope at a first westerly and thence southerly as it makes its way to discharge to the Cowie Water. The southwestern <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> Craggie Cat, <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> in the northeast part of the Burn of Monboys drainage basin, drain to the Burn of Monboys. The stream has a greenish brown appearance and generally has lush vegetation growing {{all the way to}} its margins throughout most of its course of the middle and downstream reaches. The turbidity typically measures approximately 10 JTU and the July flow rate is roughly five cubic feet per second in the headwaters reach. pH levels have been measured at 7.27, very slightly alkaline, but undoubtedly less basic than other area streams due to the drainage from the higher elevation peat moorlands of Meikle Carewe and Curlethney Hills.|$|R
5000|$|Before the Second World War, {{the area}} would be {{described}} as industrial, {{because of the presence}} of wide-scale quarrying and associated activity. Men came from places such as Bridgnorth and Ludlow to work in the quarries, and the villages of Bedlam and Dhustone on Titterstone Clee were built especially for the quarry workers. Crumbling remains of quarry buildings now litter the <b>hill,</b> reminders <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bygone industry that once employed more than 2,000 people here. An old [...] narrow gauge railway incline is still visible on the <b>hill,</b> and <b>a</b> large concrete structure, under which the wagons were filled with stone, still remains next to the modern day car park. Nearby, on the <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> Clee <b>Hill,</b> <b>a</b> standard gauge railway incline provided means of exporting quarried stone from above Cleehill village. This railway infrastructure remained intact until abandoned in the early 1960s. In the past the quarries have also been worked (on a much smaller scale) for coal, fireclay and limestone.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{designation}} <b>of</b> Ham <b>Hill</b> as <b>a</b> country park, three local farms used ancient free range grazing rights {{on the main}} grass area of the hill. Country Park status brought more visitors and most importantly, more dogs. The dogs made the grazing of sheep impossible. This {{has resulted in a}} noticeable change in vegetation in the last forty years. In many areas, what were areas of short-cropped grassland interspersed with short stemmed plants such as wild thyme and clovers have been replaced by rank bracken, gorse, bramble and wild parsley. The absence of the sheep has also enabled woodland to overrun and obscure the previously grassed Iron Age earthworks, most noticeably on the northern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hill.</b> <b>A</b> disastrous fire on the south-west <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the hill (overlooking Little Norton) in the drought summer of 1976 was believed to have been caused by a discarded cigarette. The vegetation on the entire side of the hill was destroyed. When regrowth appeared, bracken was the dominant vegetation. In some places this has now given way to woodland, but the fine grassland of before the fire has not returned.|$|R

The foundations of some are still visible. They were small, but tolerably well-built, with regular stones of fair dimensions.On the door, still standing, of one oft hem, we observe a cross with standing, equal arms set in a niche. Besides these, the ruins <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building measuring twenty-six paces long from west to east, and twenty from north to south, deserve particular attention. It was built with cut stones worked in with much care and without cement. The southern facade was pierced with thesedoors. Another door, {{the only one on}} that side, was constructed {{in the middle of the}} western facade; its lintel is lying on the ground. On the east was an apse, whose interior are in place. Within this ancient church are several monolithic columns half hidden by the bushes; they measure 2.50 metres in length, by thirty-five centimetres in diameter. The capitals and the base are wanting, or at all events no longer visible. By the side of this building is observed <b>a</b> sort <b>of</b> subterranean magazine arched in stone with a circular arch.
