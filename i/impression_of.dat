40|$|The {{interface}} between tourism and built heritage is complicated because much built heritage {{is located in}} the middle of living communities. Questions arise about how to achieve a balance between the expectations of tourists and the community. To study this question, this paper reports on tourists’ and residents’ <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> an international heritage tourism site, the Kampong Taman Sari in Indonesia. Using a linear-numeric semantic differential as the measuring instrument and nine consensus photographs of the site as stimuli, the study investigated similarities and differences in impressions between three groups: tourists (international and domestic) and residents. Three principal dimensions were found to underlie <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> the site: Attractiveness, Organisation, and Novelty. Significant differences were found among all three groups in their <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> Attractiveness. In terms <b>of</b> <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> the Organisation of the site, international and domestic tourists have similar impressions but these differ significantly from the <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> residents. On the other hand, domestic tourists and residents have similar <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> the Novelty of the site, which is evaluated differently by international tourists...|$|R

5|$|An <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> the Great Seal {{of a state}} (or its coat of arms) {{has long}} been {{required}} on official documents ranging from deeds to legislative acts. It was the emblem that certified the authenticity of a given document or that {{the authority of the}} state was invested in said document. Judicial decisions upheld the need for a valid seal and/or coat of arms on notarized documents.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the south}} {{transept}} {{is similar in}} dimension to the nave and choir, views of the building from the south-east and south-west give the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a building balanced around a central axis, with its tower as the hub. The tower is of the late 15thcentury Perpendicular style, but its four large battlemented turrets are {{the work of the}} restoration architect George Gilbert Scott.|$|E
5|$|Blumenthal {{has since}} updated his recipe {{to include a}} ten-hour period of soaking the bacon in a {{vacuum-packed}} bag prior to baking.

5|$|Four main {{proposals}} were suggested {{for the new}} fixed link. One involved a four-lane subsea tunnel, one involved building a second, two-lane bridge immediately adjacent to the current one, which would give the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a single bridge, another involved a new four-lane bridge slightly to the south, and the last involved a new bridge considerably further to the south, which would connect to County Road 557.|$|E
5|$|Impressionist Francine Lewis {{performed}} an <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> Dot Cotton {{in the seventh}} series of Britain's Got Talent. During 2003, a promotional advertisement for the BBC featuring a character, Fizz, from the children's television programme The Tweenies pulling off a mask and morphing into Dot received complaints. Parents complained that their children were having nightmares and the BBC subsequently moved back the screening times.|$|E

5|$|Mills's {{relationship}} with McCartney triggered considerable media interest. After her divorce, {{the attitude of}} the British media was hostile.

5|$|Paths, arbors, and fences use {{traditional}} or antique looking materials.

Pots, ornaments, and furniture also use natural looking materials with traditional finishes—everything is chosen {{to give the}} <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> an old-fashioned country garden.|$|E

5|$|The Circles of Sustainability {{assessment}} of Delhi gives a marginally more favourable <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> the ecological sustainability {{of the city}} only because {{it is based on}} a more comprehensive series of measures than only air pollution.

40|$|Manager {{fairness}} {{matters to}} employees and has important work outcomes. The current research explored whether differences {{exist in the}} rate of revision (change) <b>of</b> first <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> a manager’s interactional and procedural fairness/unfairness. After observing impression-inconsistent information, participants’ initial <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> interactional fairness/unfairness were hypothesized to exhibit greater amounts <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> revision than <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> procedural fairness/unfairness. A 2 (fairness type: interactional vs. procedural) x 2 (initial behaviour: fair vs. unfair) x 2 (time of rating: initial vs. revised) experimental design involving 165 participants was implemented. Results show that the rate of change in ratings of interactional fairness over time was significantly greater than the rate of change in ratings of procedural fairness in the unfair initial-impression condition, as predicted. This was not true for the fair initial-impression condition. Unexpectedly, first <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> fairness in general did not exhibit more revision than unfair first impressions. Implications are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{color in}} the {{original}} print is breathtaking; Redskin leaves an <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a kaleidoscope of awe-inspiring backgrounds, with such much happening in the foreground that one hardly has time {{to take in the}} whole frame.

5|$|The episode's opening scene, {{featuring}} a camera moving slowly towards Scully in a harsh white light, {{was achieved by}} constructing a long narrow set covered in aluminium foil, which amplified the light being used and downplayed any colors.
