5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic mechanics of their body that normally provide lift—flying by turning their bodies upside <b>down</b> <b>but</b> with their necks twisted 180 degrees to keep their heads in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E
5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle upside down when they sink. Arkansas settled upside <b>down,</b> <b>but</b> a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of the {{starboard}} side of the hull, making it look like the ship is lying on her side. Most of the starboard side is present, but severely compacted.|$|E

The Jaguars were engaged in May and June 1978, contributing significantly in halting an offensive by Goukouni Oueddei's FROLINAT forces, who were routed. One aircraft was shot <b>down,</b> <b>but</b> the pilot was recovered by helicopter.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club (PJRTC) was {{reformed}} {{with the}} aim of seeking Kennel Club recognition for the breed. The initial application was turned <b>down,</b> <b>but</b> after several further rejections, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier was recognised on 9 January 1990 as a variant of the Fox Terrier, with the United Kennel Club following suit in 1991. The American Kennel Club recognised the breed as the Jack Russell Terrier effective 1 November 1997.|$|E

NC State's punt was returned to the Tech 13-yard line and the quarter came to an end with Virginia Tech leading, 107.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the damage}} in Georgia was {{as a result of}} several tornadoes related to Allison. The most {{significant}} of the tornadoes touched down in the town of St. Marys. An elementary school was destroyed and significant damage was also reported to several buildings at the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base. Several other tornadoes also touched <b>down</b> <b>but</b> damage from them was minimal. Damage from the tornado was estimated at $800,000 (1995USD).|$|E

5|$|The NGS deemed {{this gun}} {{obsolete}} {{shortly after the}} first ships were laid <b>down,</b> <b>but</b> the gun that it wanted to use, the Canon de 138 mm modèle 1923, was not yet available, so they planned to replace the 130mm guns later. The guns and their larger hoists were ordered well before any of the ships were completed {{and had to be}} written off when it became apparent that the ships' stability was too marginal to tolerate the additional top weight.|$|E

5|$|The signals {{used were}} of the ancient disc and {{crossbar}} type, installed when the line opened and never modified. They remained in use up to the line's closure in 1898.

5|$|Today some of {{the sharpest}} opening {{variations}} have been analyzed so deeply that they are often used as drawing weapons. For example, at the highest levels, Black often uses the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez, a line where Black sacrifices a pawn for strong attacking chances, to obtain an endgame where Black is still a pawn <b>down</b> <b>but</b> is able to draw with correct play.|$|E
5|$|After Indiana {{returned}} to active duty, she {{participated in the}} invasion of Hollandia in western New Guinea. The ship then {{returned to}} the central Pacific and bombarded Truk, and subsequently took part in operations off the Marianas Islands. On 19 June 1944 a Japanese torpedo bomber attempted to attack the ship, but Indianas anti-aircraft gunners managed to destroy both the aircraft and the torpedo it had dropped, with no damage to the ship. Shortly thereafter, a second Japanese plane was shot <b>down,</b> <b>but</b> a third managed to crash into the ship. The aircraft disintegrated upon striking the side armor plates and scattered pieces of the plane across the stern. Five men were injured, but the ship suffered only very slight damage.|$|E

5|$|After the Protestants {{were caught}} in crossfire by townspeople {{engaging}} in the battle, many decided to flee through the Battant. They took the portcullis <b>down,</b> <b>but</b> could not find boats to cross the Doubs, so some soldiers chose to swim; many of them drowned, including goldsmith Guillaume Laboral from Montbéliard. Those who did not escape the battle were executed at the gallows. The executions occurred on the same day, or later in the week. In total, twenty Protestants were killed in combat, and two drowned in the Doubs. The Father of Faverney, Antoine d'Achey, and the army in Vesoul were dispatched to rescue the city, not knowing that the battle had already ended. Nonetheless, Luis de Requesens y Zúñiga thanked Achey for his attempts.|$|E
5|$|Alfa Romeo {{dominated}} {{the rest of}} the Grand Prix season. Nuvolari and Campari drove the newly introduced Alfa Romeo P3 at the Italian Grand Prix, while Borzacchini and Caracciola drove much heavier 8Cs. Caracciola was forced to retired when his car broke <b>down,</b> <b>but</b> he took over Borzacchini's car when the Italian was hit by a stone, and came third, behind Nuvolari and Fagioli. In the French Grand Prix, Caracciola, now driving a P3, battled Nuvolari for the lead early on. Alfa Romeo's dominance was so great and their cars so far ahead the team could choose the top three finishing positions, thus Nuvolari won from Borzacchini and Caracciola, with the two Italians ahead of the German. The order was different at the 1932 German Grand Prix, where Caracciola won from Nuvolari and Borzacchini.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, if {{the density}} in the {{universe}} were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow <b>down</b> <b>but</b> never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach absolute zero—a Big Freeze. Moreover, if the proton were unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation. The entropy of the universe would increase {{to the point where}} no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.|$|E
