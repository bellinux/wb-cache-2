40|$|There {{has been}} a recent {{resurgence}} {{in the area of}} <b>explainable</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> as researchers and practitioners seek to provide more transparency to their algorithms. Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that, if these techniques are to succeed, the explanations they generate should have a structure that humans accept. However, {{it is fair to say}} that most work in <b>explainable</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exists vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations. This paper argues that the field of <b>explainable</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> should build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on <b>explainable</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (AI) {{programming}} has a {{wide variety}} of aspects of which only the decision system is usually focused on. This paper puts the decision system into perspective {{with the rest of the}} <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> system and then proceeds to categorize different types of <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> by function or efficacy rather than method of implementation. The focus of this paper is on games programming <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> where two types of <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> are defined followed by placing the entire <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> system into perspective. Then a taxonomy model is presented upon which <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> can be categorized. This taxonomy model also forms a foundation upon which <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> should be implemented in the development of a game and upon which all previous, present and future <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> can be gauged. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Reflection is {{critically}} important for time-constrained training simulations that do not permit extensive tutor-student interactions during an exercise. Here, we describe a reflective tutoring system for a virtual human simulation of negotiation. The tutor helps students review their exercise, elicits where and how {{they could have done}} better, and uses <b>explainable</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (XAI) to allow students the chance to ask questions about the virtual human’s behavior. ...|$|E
40|$|In his seminal book `The Inmates are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy And How To Restore The Sanity' [2004, Sams Indianapolis, IN, USA], Alan Cooper {{argues that}} a major reason why {{software}} is often poorly designed (from a user perspective) is that programmers {{are in charge of}} design decisions, rather than interaction designers. As a result, programmers design software for themselves, rather than for their target audience, a phenomenon he refers to as the `inmates running the asylum'. This paper argues that explainable AI risks a similar fate. While the re-emergence of explainable AI is positive, this paper argues most of us as AI researchers are building explanatory agents for ourselves, rather than for the intended users. But explainable AI is more likely to succeed if researchers and practitioners understand, adopt, implement, and improve models from the vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science, and if evaluation of these models is focused more on people than on technology. From a light scan of literature, we demonstrate that there is considerable scope to infuse more results from the social and behavioural sciences into explainable AI, and present some key results from these fields that are relevant to explainable AI.

INTRODUCTION Distribution and parallelism have historically been important themes in <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (AI). Hayes-Roth [1] argues that "all real systems are distributed". The conceptual basis for concurrent problem solving underlying <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> has been heavily discussed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with copyright regulation of works created by <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> systems. The rapid advances in <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> are calling into question some of the fundamental assumptions upon which intellectual property law rests. Currently, the European framework of copyright law does not take non-human innovation into account. Meanwhile, advances in <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> are quickly making machine-generation of creative works a reality. Institutions of the European Union have recently explicitly addressed the need to clarify legal implications of advancements in <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> In this regard, two research questions have been analysed in the thesis: First, whether works co-created or independently created by <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> systems are eligible for copyright protection under current EU copyright law. Second, to whom, if anyone, should the rights to works entirely generated by <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> systems be allocated...|$|R
