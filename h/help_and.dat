40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of sympathy, guilt, and moral reasoning in <b>helping,</b> cooperation, <b>and</b> sharing in a 6 -year, three-wave longitudinal study involving 175 children (Mage 6. 10, 9. 18, and 12. 18 years). Primary caregivers reported on children's <b>helping</b> <b>and</b> cooperation; sharing was assessed behaviorally. Child sympathy was assessed by self- and teacher reports, and self-attributed feelings of guilt–sadness and moral reasoning were assessed by children's responses to transgression vignettes. Sympathy predicted <b>helping,</b> cooperation, <b>and</b> sharing. Guilt–sadness and moral reasoning interacted with sympathy in predicting <b>helping</b> <b>and</b> cooperation; both sympathy and guilt–sadness {{were associated with the}} development of sharing. The findings are discussed in relation to the emergence of differential motivational pathways to <b>helping,</b> cooperation, <b>and</b> sharing...|$|R

5|$|Cooper {{runs for}} <b>help</b> <b>and</b> {{goes into the}} kitchen. Ma Soupswill, the cook, is delighted to help, but Cooper must {{retrieve}} three ingredients: Glowworms, a giant egg, and a sprig of dungweed. After retrieving the ingredients, Ma Soupswill creates a potion to reverse the effects on Amber. However, she unwittingly transforms Amber into an even more hideous monster, having added the wrong spice, and Amber attacks Cooper in anger. Cooper defeats the mutated Amber and Ma Soupswill arrives with the correct spice, finally transforming Amber back to herself. Afterward, Cooper and Amber attempt to escape the mansion but are stopped by Mr. Ribs (Ma Soupswill's assistant). He tells them to help free the other children who are imprisoned all over the mansion. Cooper seeks Crivens for <b>help</b> <b>and</b> tells him that only the Baron has the key to free them. To get to his room, Cooper must collect three pieces of a rhyme which {{opens the door to}} the Baron's room. Once there, a battle ensues, and Cooper emerges victorious.|$|E

Finally he relented, and the Confederates held their fire while the Union recovered the wounded and dead, soldiers from both sides mingling and trading as if no hostilities existed for the moment.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{interest}} in understanding how demographic factors can mediate social evolution in viscous populations. Here, we {{examine the impact of}} heterogeneity in patch quality [...] that is, the availability of reproductive resources for each breeder [...] upon the evolution of <b>helping</b> <b>and</b> harming behaviors. We find that, owing to a cancellation of relatedness and kin competition effects, the evolution of obligate <b>and</b> facultative <b>helping</b> <b>and</b> harming is not influenced by the degree of viscosity in populations characterized by either spatial or temporal heterogeneity in patch quality. However, facultative <b>helping</b> <b>and</b> harming may be favored when there is both spatial and temporal heterogeneity in patch quality, with <b>helping</b> <b>and</b> harming being favored in both high-quality and low-quality patches. We highlight the prospect for using kin selection theory to explain within-population variation in social behavior, and point to the need for further theoretical and empirical investigation of this topic...|$|R
5|$|After 1963 Blyton's output was {{generally}} confined to {{short stories and}} books intended for very young readers, such as Learn to Count with Noddy and Learn to Tell Time with Noddy in 1965, and Stories for Bedtime and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend. Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, Noddy and the Aeroplane, in February 1964. In May the following year she published Mixed Bag, a song book with music written by her nephew Carey, and in August she released her last full-length books, The Man Who Stopped to <b>Help</b> <b>and</b> The Boy Who Came Back.|$|E
5|$|After the French {{defeat at}} Waterloo, the works' former owners sought their return. The Louvre's administrators were loath to comply and hid many works {{in their private}} collections. In response, foreign states sent emissaries to London to seek <b>help,</b> <b>and</b> many pieces were returned, even some that had been {{restored}} by the Louvre. In 1815 Louis XVIII finally concluded agreements with the Austrian government for the keeping of pieces such as Veronese's Wedding at Cana which was exchanged for a large Le Brun or the repurchase of the Albani collection.|$|E

By now, Nuño de Guzmán was {{governor}} in Mexico, and he despatched Juan Enríquez de Guzmán to Chiapa as end-of-term judge over Mazariegos, and as alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor). He occupied his post for a year, during which time he attempted to reestablish Spanish control over the province, especially the northern and eastern regions, {{but was unable to}} make much headway.|$|E

5|$|An {{accomplice}} {{could be}} sued {{if he had}} provided help ope consilio – a physical act relating to the method of execution, rather than mere encouragement. It appears that Labeo {{was the first to}} require help or advice, and earlier sources suggest that both <b>help</b> <b>and</b> advice was required. Labeo's version was certainly entrenched by the early second century AD. An accomplice was treated as if he himself had committed the crime. Only one person needed to have handled the thing for all wrongdoers to be liable. Republican jurists were harder on accomplices than later jurists under the empire. Indeed, Ulpian considers the unwitting accomplice, who accidentally knocks out of the victim's hand some coins which are then stolen, an accomplice to the theft. Some commentators have gone as far to say that the veteres ("ancients") may not have even required a third party to remove the coins, {{as long as they were}} otherwise lost to the owner.|$|E
