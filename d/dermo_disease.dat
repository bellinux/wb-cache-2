40|$|Perkinsus marinus is the {{protozoan}} endoparasite of the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) {{responsible for}} <b>Dermo</b> <b>disease.</b> While not harmful to humans, <b>Dermo</b> <b>disease</b> causes extensive oyster mortality, increasing annual natural mortality from 10 to 35 % {{or more in}} Delaware Bay annually. The disease spreads through the water as parasites are shed from infected and moribund hosts. One prior study has indicated that scavengers may spread the parasite to new hosts, but little information exists as to how such trophic interactions affect host-parasite dynamics. From July 2010 to September 2011, uninfected, or specific-pathogen free (SPF) oyster hosts were exposed in the laboratory to four different species of scavengers feeding on infected or uninfected oyster tissue. In each experiment, the accumulation of P. marinus in oyster hosts was compared after 1 - 2 months {{as a measure of}} parasite transmission.

There they infest more cells or are excreted or released when the host dies and disintegrates. The infected oyster becomes stressed, its tissues pale in color, its gamete production is retarded, its growth slows, it becomes emaciated, its mantle shrivels and pulls away from the shell, and it may develop pockets of pus-like fluid.

40|$|The Gulf Coast {{has seen}} a {{dramatic}} decline in commercial oyster harvest in recent years.

A disease has its largest detrimental effect on a host when environmental conditions support an abrupt increase in density of the pathogen population. Therefore, documenting the relationships between distribution and prevalence of <b>Dermo</b> <b>disease</b> in the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and environmental conditions would be beneficial to management of the eastern oyster in Galveston Bay. My study consisted of four sites located in Galveston Bay, Texas, which were sampled 20 oysters every other month from November 2014 through September 2015. Specific objectives were to determine: (1) prevalence of Dermo in oysters, (2) spatial location of Dermo infected oysters, (3) concentrations of the parasite Dermo within infected oysters (Mackin Dermo Intensity Scale), and (4) the relationship of water quality parameters (i. e., fresh-water flow, salinity, water temperature, and water turbidity) to prevalence and parasite concentration of <b>Dermo</b> <b>disease</b> in oysters. Initially (November 2014), Dermo was present in oysters at all reefs sampled, and Dermo prevalence was greatest at April Fool (0. 55, intensity on Mackin Dermo Intensity Scale) and Confederate (0. 85) reefs, but declined after heavy rainfall (July 2015, April Fool Reef: 0. 21, Confederate Reef: 0. 81). Linear regression analysis indicated water variables such as temperature, salinity, turbidity and fresh water inflow explained different amounts of the variability in the Mackin Dermo Intensity Scale among sampled reefs. Fresh-water inflow from the Trinity River explained the most variability in Dermo intensity at April Fool (61. 8 %), Fishers (44. 5 %), and Frenchy?s (46. 9 %) reefs. At Confederate Reef, salinity (20. 6 %) explained the most variability in Dermo intensity, and this reef was least affected by the Trinity River flow. I found that combinations of low fresh-water inflow, high salinity, and high temperatures accounted for majority the variance of Dermo in oysters located in Galveston Bay. However, this relationship was not necessarily a linear relationship with mortality, in that high fresh-water inflow also was related to oyster mortality at Fishers Reef...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Humans rely on marine {{ecosystems}} for {{a variety}} of services but often impact these ecosystems directly or indirectly limiting their capacity to provide such services. One growing impact is the emergence of marine disease. We present results from a unique case study examining how oysters, a dominant organism in many coastal bays and estuaries that is often harvested for food, have responded to pathogens influenced by human activities, namely the introduction of novel pathogens. Climate change has enabled a northward spread and establishment of <b>Dermo</b> <b>disease</b> in oysters along the eastern seaboard of North America and human activities inadvertently introduced MSX disease along this same coast. Oysters in Delaware Bay have responded differently to each pathogen, and uniquely to MSX disease by developing a highly resistant baywide population not documented in any other bay. Offspring were produced using parents collected from low or high disease (MSX and Dermo) regions of Delaware Bay and exposed in a common garden experiment along with a naïve population from Maine. Results indicated widespread resistance to MSX disease, but not to <b>Dermo</b> <b>disease,</b> across Delaware Bay. One striking result was the demonstration of resilience in the population through its capacity to spread, presumably through larval transport, resistance to MSX disease into portions of the population that have experienced little to no MSX disease pressure themselves. Related studies indicated that larval transport mechanisms allowed widespread dispersal such that the entire metapopulation could acquire a high level of resistance over time if disease resistance is sufficiently heritable. The findings have implications for restoration, management and recovery of diseased populations. Namely, that if left to their own devices, natural selection may find a solution that enables populations to recover from introduced pathogens...|$|E

Diel-cycling DO increased P. marinus infection and cycling DO and pH stimulated hemocyte activity and reduced oyster growth.

40|$|Wommack, K. EricPolson, Shawn W. The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is a {{keystone}} species in estuarine environments {{along the east}} coast of North America. Oysters are ecosystem engineers that provide habitat for native species and increase biodiversity, improve water quality, influence biogeochemical cycling, and structure trophic levels. To the detriment of estuarine environments, oyster populations today are a fraction of their historic levels due to anthropogenic and disease pressures, and climate change and pathogens pose serious threats to future populations. Next-generation, high-throughput sequencing technologies have led to an appreciation for the diversity of host-associated microbial communities (microbiomes) and their role in the health and physiology of their host; yet, little is currently known about the diversity of the oyster microbiome, the factors that shape the microbiome community, or the role of the microbiome in oyster health and fitness. In the work described herein, bacterial and viral populations within C. virginica extrapallial fluid (EF) – fluid produced by the oyster that initiates shell formation – were investigated using high-throughput, cultivation-independent approaches. The EF microbiome was characterized over time and between locations to identify temporal and geographic differences in community composition. In addition, the bacterial communities of healthy and diseased individuals were compared to identify changes in the normal microbiota in response to infection by Perkinsus marinus, a major oyster pathogen and the etiological agent of oyster <b>disease</b> <b>Dermo.</b> The EF bacterial community was distinct from the surrounding water and seasonally dynamic. Water and EF bacterial communities were both influenced by temperature, but the same taxa in water and EF often responded differently to changing environmental conditions. The EF bacterial community was also influenced by geographic location, and oysters from the same sample site had more similar EF communities to each other than to oysters from other sites. In contrast, the EF community was largely unchanged by infection with P. marinus, though several individual taxa were associated with health status. A number of bacterial taxa were enriched in EF, notably Deltaproteobacteria, which are capable of catalyzing calcium precipitation and are found in caves and lithifying microbial mats where calcification is common. Given that the EF is the site of shell formation, which occurs via calcium precipitation, {{it is possible that the}} EF microbiome plays an unappreciated role in oyster shell formation. The abundance of Deltaproteobacteria in oyster EF decreased with higher water temperatures and may be an important consideration as average water temperatures increase in the future. Lytic phage populations were investigated in EF via ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a diverse, abundant, and ecologically important marker gene of viral diversity in aquatic environments. The RNR assemblage as a whole was seasonally dynamic, although many of the most abundant populations were persistent over one year. The most abundant populations were also endemic to the Delmarva region. These endemic populations belonged to the dsDNA tailed bacteriophage family Podoviridae and likely infected members of the Proteobacteria, the most abundant bacterial phylum in oyster EF. Thus, these abundant and persistent lytic phage populations may play an important role in the top-down regulation of EF bacterial communities. Ultimately, a better understanding of the EF microbial community, its role in oyster health, and how that role might be impacted by various threats will enable more targeted and effective conservation efforts in the future.

A significant increase in protease activity was observed in oyster plasma 4 hr after injection with P. marinus, followed by a sharp decrease within 24 hr.

40|$|In Galveston Bay, Texas, {{the eastern}} oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is found {{throughout}} the bay both intertidal along mudflats and subtidal where their self-built reefs extend vertically deeper. The eastern oyster is an important ecological and economical resource and as such has led to studies regarding their community structure to permit effective creation of artificially built reefs and restoration of existing ones. The presence of {{the oil and gas}} industry coupled with increased oyster mortality led to investigations to determine the effects of petroleum substances on the setting, growth, and mortality of the eastern oyster. Many of those studies indicated increased settlement and increased growth of oysters on substrate coated with oil. A field conducted experiment was used to assess the settlement of oyster larvae on cleaned oyster shells coated with two different types of petroleum substances (mineral oil and motor oil), comparing viscosities, in a shallow bayou in Galveston, Texas, where the eastern oyster dominates the intertidal zone. Oyster shells were used as cultch material and divided into three groups; a non-treated control group, mineral oil treated group, and a motor oil treated group. Nekton assemblages, distributions of the ivory barnacle, Balanus eberneus, and <b>Dermo</b> <b>disease</b> infection were assessed. Settlement of oyster larvae occurred in all three groups with no significant difference of preference; algae and sediment present on the shells coupled with the presence of predators most likely caused reduced numbers of spat settlement.

This balance results in a characteristic distribution of allelic variation with the maximum allelic difference determined by effective population size. Here, we report a striking departure from these expectations {{in the form of}} allelic dimorphism, observed at the majority of seven loci examined in Perkinsus marinus, an important oyster parasite that causes <b>Dermo</b> <b>disease.</b> DNA sequences were collected from five loci flanking microsatellite repeats and two loci coding for superoxide dismutase enzymes that may mediate the parasite’s interaction with its host. Based on 474 sequences, sampled across 5000 km of the eastern United States coastline, no more than two alleles were observed at each locus (discounting singletons). Depending on the locus, the common allele ranged in overall frequency from 72 % to 92 %. At each locus the two alleles differed substantially (3. 8 % sequence difference, on average), and the among-locus variance in divergences was not sufficient to reject a simultaneous origin for all dimorphisms using approximate Bayesian methods. Dimorphic alleles were estimated to have diverged from a common ancestral allele at least 0. 9 million years ago. Across these seven loci, only five other alleles were ever observed, always as singletons and differing from the dimorphic alleles by no more than two nucleotides. Free recombination could potentially have shuffled these dimorphisms into as many as 243 multilocus combinations, but the existence of only ten combinations among all samples strongly supports low recombination frequencies and is consistent with the observed absence of intragenic recombination. We consider several demographic and evolutionary hypotheses to explain these patterns. Few can be conclusively rejected with the present data, but we advance a recent hybridization of ancient divergent lineages scenario as the most parsimonious...|$|E

Additionally, oysters are extremely important within the shellfish aquaculture industry; {{they are the}} second most widely produced species in world aquaculture production. Eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, are produced in aquaculture and are unfortunately susceptible to <b>Dermo</b> <b>disease.</b> Dermo {{is caused by a}} protozoan parasite, Perkinsus marinus, and infection is often fatal in oysters due to widespread tissue damage and blockage of blood vessels. Research in oyster disease is particularly needed because disease {{is one of the largest}} impediments faced by the aquaculture industry as entire oyster populations can be decimated. One of the best options for prevention of Dermo involves identifying oysters with genetic resistance to the disease and breeding them for aquaculture use. In order to rapidly and effectively breed oysters for disease resistance, links between disease resistant genotypes and phenotypes must be established. To date, only one gene has been associated repeatedly with Dermo resistance in the eastern oyster: the serine proteinase inhibitor 1 gene (CvSI- 1). Proteinase inhibitors are known to play a role in immunity; hence an alteration in these genes, such as a SNP, can have functional consequences. The focus of this research project involved developing an assay for genotyping a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the CvSI- 1 gene and confirming its association with disease resistance in two selected oyster populations. Development of the genotyping assay involved the identification of individuals to use as positive controls (known genotypes at the CvSI- 1 SNP 198 locus) via amplification and sequence analysis. Once positive controls were identified, additional samples, collected before and after a natural Dermo outbreak, were genotyped using a high resolution melting (HRM) assay. Melting curves from all samples were compared to positive controls to assign genotypes. Genotype and allele frequencies were used to identify shifts following selection by Dermo. A significant difference in allele frequencies before and after Dermo induced mortality suggests the CvSI- 1 SNP 198 locus is associated with resistance...|$|E

Finally, I examined an interesting pattern of di-allelism observed in P. marinus DNA sequences. Two allelic classes were discovered at six out of seven nuclear loci where large divergences indicated the alleles had been independent for possibly millions of years. Balancing selection may be responsible for the retention of ancient diversity in this parasite, but it seems more likely that a recent hybridization event has occurred between two formerly allopatric lineages.

40|$|Abstract Background Perkinsus marinus, a {{protozoan}} parasite of {{the eastern}} oyster Crassostrea virginica, has devastated natural and farmed oyster populations along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. It is classified {{as a member of}} the Perkinsozoa, a recently established phylum considered close to the ancestor of ciliates, dinoflagellates, and apicomplexans, and a key taxon for understanding unique adaptations (e. g. parasitism) within the Alveolata. Despite intense parasite pressure, no disease-resistant oysters have been identified and no effective therapies have been developed to date. Results To gain insight into the biological basis of the parasite's virulence and pathogenesis mechanisms, and to identify genes encoding potential targets for intervention, we generated > 31, 000 5 ' expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from four trophozoite libraries generated from two P. marinus strains. Trimming and clustering of the sequence tags yielded 7, 863 unique sequences, some of which carry a spliced leader. Similarity searches revealed that 55 % of these had hits in protein sequence databases, of which 1, 729 had their best hit with proteins from the chromalveolates (E-value ≤ 1 e- 5). Some sequences are similar to those proven to be targets for effective intervention in other protozoan parasites, and include not only proteases, antioxidant enzymes, and heat shock proteins, but also those associated with relict plastids, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase and methyl erythrithol phosphate pathway components, and those involved in glycan assembly, protein folding/secretion, and parasite-host interactions. Conclusions Our transcriptome analysis of P. marinus, the first for any member of the Perkinsozoa, contributes new insight into its biology and taxonomic position. It provides a very informative, albeit preliminary, glimpse into the expression of genes encoding functionally relevant proteins as potential targets for chemotherapy, and evidence for the presence of a relict plastid. Further, although P. marinus sequences display significant similarity to those from both apicomplexans and dinoflagellates, the presence of trans-spliced transcripts confirms the previously established affinities with the latter. The EST analysis reported herein, together with the recently completed sequence of the P. marinus genome and the development of transfection methodology, should result in improved intervention strategies against <b>dermo</b> <b>disease.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Perkinsus marinus, the causative {{agent of}} <b>Dermo</b> <b>disease</b> in eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica {{has been a}} great hurdle for oyster {{population}} restoration. Iron was shown to be an essential element for P. marinus growth and virulence, but iron uptake pathways have not been elucidated. 	Natural Resistance-associated Macrophage Protein (Nramp), an iron transporter, was considered to be a potential virulence factor in intracellular pathogens. One Nramp homolog (PmNramp 1) was reported in P. marinus previously. Two other PmNramp isotypes (PmNramp 2 and PmNramp 3) were identified through genome mining followed by molecular characterization. The three PmNramp isotypes with distinct gene structures were transcribed in parasite trophozoites cultured in defined medium. Transcripts of a number of P. marinus genes, including PmNramp isotypes, superoxide dismutases (PmSOD), ascorbate peroxidase (PmAPX) and heat shock proteins (PmHSP 70 and PmHSP 90) were trans-spliced with a trans-splicing leader (SL) highly similar to dinoflagellate SL. No change in transcription level of those genes was detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), under iron/manganese overload, iron depletion and host hemolymph exposure, indicating a constitutive polycistronic transcription in the parasite. Functional study by yeast complementation assays suggested iron uptake activity by PmNramp 1. Prediction of PmNramp 1 topology by homologous modeling indicated that PmNramp 1 was an integral protein with 12 transmembrane segments (TMS). The central position of the Nramp-specific triplets Asp-Pro-Gly (TMS 1) and Met-Pro-His (TMS 6) in a three-dimensional (3 D) arrangement formed with TMS 3 and TMS 8 provided the mechanistic basis for iron acquisition via PmNramp 1. Site-directed mutagenesis of the residues on the triplets in PmNramp 1 caused the lost of complementation activity as iron transporter in yeast. A chimeric protein with PmNramp 1 N- and C-termini but PmNramp 3 core structure from TMS 1 to TMS 12 complemented yeast growth, suggesting PmNramp 3 an iron transporter. Phylogeny data implied that all the three PmNramp isotypes were archetype Nramp. Protein sequence divergence among PmNramp isotypes was not related to diversification of critical functional elements, which remained constrained by purifying selection. This result was consistent with the function of both PmNramp 1 and PmNramp 3 as iron transporters in yeast, despite their different evolutionary rate and substitution patterns. Subcellular localization of PmNramp isotypes in P. marinus trophozoites are in progress. PmNramp 3 was shown to localize on cell peripheral when the parasite proliferates by binary fission. The data were consistent with the previous observation that iron is important for P. marinus growth. As the first functional study of Nramp homolog in protozoan parasites, the work in the dissertation may serve as the reference for research in other protozoan Nramp and iron transporters...|$|E
