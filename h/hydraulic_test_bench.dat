For the {{limitations}} of the existing <b>hydraulic</b> <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> for experimenting with multi-species of hydraulic components, the additional cartridge valve circuit and multi-way directional valve circuit were designed. The AMESim simulation models of the hydraulic test bench’s basic hydraulic circuits were established and simulated. Then the simulation results were compared with the experimental data to get some principles of simulation modeling and optimize the models. These principles were used to simulate the additional hydraulic circuits.

Technical specifications of enterprises, which repair diesel locomotive hydraulic transmission, recommend conducting a certain amount of evaluation and regulatory tests to monitor their condition after repair. Experience shows that a significant portion of hydraulic transmission defects is revealed by <b>bench</b> <b>tests.</b> The advantages of <b>bench</b> <b>tests</b> include the ability to detect defects after repair, ease of maintenance of the hydraulic transmission and relatively low labour intensity for eliminating defects. The quality of these tests results in the transmission resource and its efficiency.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Probabilistic General Diagnostic Engine (PGDE), a novel method of offline consistency-based fault isolation. Many existing proposals require qualitative logic models for consistency-based diagnosis {{due to their}} ability to speed the search for conflict sets through the use of an ATMS. However, for many applications, quantitative dynamic models are preferred or already available. The key strength of the PGDE is that it allows the use of any modelling language for which an appropriate calculation engine can be written. It also offers graceful degradation in the presence of uncertainty, commonly caused by noise or modelling errors. Finally, given perfect knowledge, it can be shown that the PGDE computes the same result as existing consistency-based diagnosis methods. To demonstrate the performance of the algorithm, we have used a quantitative dynamic model of the fluid power circuit of a singledegree of freedom <b>hydraulic</b> <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> and developed an appropriate calculation engine for computing consistency between measured values and predicted results. Various failures were generated on the physical test bench and the PGDE isolated the faults with approximately 85 % accuracy...|$|E

In this frame are also considered the mechanical vibrations, in particular whole-body vibrations (WBV). This study aims to reproduce and analyse the vertical displacement of the wheel of an agricultural tractor during the passage on a standard surface (ISO 5008) for defining potential correlations between the surface contour and the effects on vehicle dynamic and driver comfort by analysis of the signals acting under the tractor tires.

40|$|The {{proposed}} paper {{deals with}} the development process and initial measurement results of an opposed-piston combustion engine for application in a Free-Piston Linear Generator (FPLG). The FPLG, which is being developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), is an innovative internal combustion engine for a fuel based electrical power supply. With its arrangement, the pistons freely oscillate between the compression chamber of the combustion unit and a gas spring with no mechanical coupling like a crank shaft. Linear alternators convert the kinetic energy of the moving piston into electric energy. The virtual development of the novel combustion system {{is divided into two}} stages: On the one hand, the combustion system including e. g. a cylinder liner, pistons, cooling and lubrication concepts has to be developed. On the other hand, 3 D-CFD-simulations are used in the early stage within the virtual development process toward the optimization of the geometry of the scavenging ports and ducts, the gas exchange, injection and ignition. With the high variability of the free piston concept, a strategy for a dual combustion mode operation with spark ignition and HCCI is developed. The new engine is constructed on and implemented at the <b>hydraulic</b> free-piston <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> at DLR and was successfully taken into operation.

At the same time first of all it is necessary to start from the possibility of modifying the already existing <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> for <b>hydraulic</b> locomotive transmissions at the Dnipropetrovsk diesel locomotive repair plant «Promteplovoz». Methodology. In the work, the researchers proposed a methodology for modifying the sensor design and the algorithm for processing its signals. It is grounded on previous developments of tachometric sensor of the optical type on the basis of D- 2 MMU- 2 sensor of the microprocessor automated <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> system of <b>hydraulic</b> locomotive transmission in the locomotive repair plant conditions. Selection of the necessary measurement algorithm and the number of sensor teeth is substantiated by calculating instrumental and methodological errors. Also, the studies aimed at identifying the source of interference in the measurement of rotational speed are described and solution for its elimination has been found. Findings. For the designed rotation speed sensor of the optical type based on the existing D- 2 MMU- 2 sensor, the authors analyzed the dependence of the methodological and instrumental errors. Based on the obtained data more rational variant of the rotation speed calculation algorithm is proposed, and the number of teeth of the sensor disk is justified. Further, the main source of measurement interference was established and a method for improving the hardware of the <b>hydraulic</b> locomotive <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> was proposed. Originality. There were conducted the studies according to the methodological and instrumental errors of the designed rotation speed of sensor. The mechanisms of interference filtering arising from the sensor rotation speed fixing were proposed. Additional studies have shown the need for a hardware revision of signal conditioner scheme.

It was also performed a hardware improvement of signal conditioner scheme from the sensor, helping to get rid of interferences.

40|$|A numerical-experimental {{analysis}} {{of a new generation}} Common Feeding (CF) fuel injection system, equipped with last generation solenoid injectors that feature pressure-balanced pilot-valves, has been developed. The main feature of the CF system is that it removes the accumulator from the high-pressure layout of the standard Common Rail (CR). In the CF apparatus, the high-pressure pump is connected directly to the injectors, and a small accumulation volume is integrated in the pump high-pressure circuit. The hydraulic performance of the CF system, including the injectors with the pressure-balanced pilot-valve, has been compared with that of the standard CR system in terms of injected masses, fuel leakages, high-pressure and injected flow-rate time histories. A previously developed advanced one-dimensional code for CR type systems has been adapted for the simulation of the CF high-pressure layout. Furthermore, electromagnetic, hydraulic and mechanical submodels have been set up for the pressure-balanced pilot-valve simulation. This new pilot-valve configuration is aimed at reducing injector fuel leakages and at improving the dynamic response of the needle to the electrical command. The complete numerical model of the CF system has been validated by means of comparison with experimental data that have been acquired at the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>test</b> <b>bench.</b> Hence, the validated model has been applied to investigate the internal fluid-dynamics of the pressure-balanced solenoid injector, when inserted into the CF setup, as well as the effects of some design modifications in the high-pressure hydraulic circuit of the CF syste...|$|E
40|$|Axial {{piston pumps}} and motors {{are widely used}} in {{heavy-duty}} applications and play {{a fundamental role in}} hydrostatic and power split drives. The mechanical power losses in hydraulic piston pumps come from the friction between parts in relative motion. The improvement, albeit marginal, in overall efficiency of these components may significantly impact the global efficiency of the machine. The friction between slipper and swash plate is a functional key in an axial piston pump, especially when the pump (at low rotational speed or at partial displacement) works in the critical areas where the efficiency is low. The application of special surface treatments have been exploited in pioneering works in the past, trying different surface finishing or adding ceramic or heterogeneous metallic layers. The potential of structured coatings at nanoscale, with superhydrophobic and oleophobic characteristics, has never been exploited. Due to the difficulty to reproduce the real working conditions of axial piston pump slippers, it has been made a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> properly designed in order to compare the performance of nano-coated slippers with respect to standard ones. The nano-coated and standard slippers have been subjected to the following working conditions: a test at variable pressure and constant rotational speed, a test at constant pressure and variable rotational speed. The comparison between standard and nanocoated slippers, for both working conditions, shows clearly that more than 20 % of friction reduction can be achieved using the proposed nano-coating methodology...|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{representation of}} rotary blood pumps in a numerical environment {{is important for}} meaningful investigation of pump-cardiovascular system interactions. Although numerous models for ventricular assist devices (VADs) have been developed, modeling methods for rotary total artificial hearts (rTAHs) are still required. Therefore, an rTAH prototype was characterized in a steady flow, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> over a wide operational range for pump and hydraulic parameters. In order to develop a generic modeling method, a data-driven modeling approach was chosen. k-Nearest-neighbors, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines (SVMs) were the machine learning approaches evaluated. The best performing parameters for each algorithm were determined via optimization. The resulting multiple-input-multiple-output models were subsequently assessed under identical conditions, and a SVM with a radial basis function kernel was identified as the best performing. The achieved root mean squared errors were 0. 03 L/min, 0. 06 L/min, and 0. 18 W for left and right flow and motor power consumption, respectively. In comparison with existing models for VADs, the flow errors are more than 70 % lower. Further advantages of the SVM model are the robustness to measurement noise and the capability to operate outside of the trained parameter range. This proposed modeling method will accelerate further device refinements by providing a more appropriate numerical environment in which to evaluate the pump-cardiovascular system interaction. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation...|$|E

These systems are constituted by 2 or 4 fins fitted on hull sides, in a proper position; the hydrodynamic forces, generated by interacting with the water flow due to ship speed, can be controlled to obtain a momentum that counteract the wave action. So reducing the effects of roll motion on people onboard and on ship structures. A full scale fin hydraulic actuator has been installed in our <b>hydraulic</b> <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> where an hydraulic power pack and some hydraulic valves group allow to performs various tests. Reproducing the dynamic behaviour of the fin actuator system it is possible to evaluate the influence of some hydraulic component (i. e. a proportional valve) on the system performance and the feasibility of the adoption of less expensive components. Moreover an hydraulic accumulator has been added to the plant in order to improve the fin actuation speed and to reduce the pressure spikes in order to reduce hydraulic noise. In fact noise reduction represents a very important aspect onboard pleasure boats, where every effort is made to assure a high comfort level to passengers; in particular, noise is important when the boat is anchored and the fins work; in that condition the propulsion engines are stopped, the gensets are generally well insulated, and the hydrodynamic noise is absent because the speed is zero, so the stabilizing plant {{is one of the main}} noise source onboard, with the air conditioning plant of course...|$|E

It is applicable for the assessment of {{ready biodegradability}} in water and soil. In this study the "O 2 /CO 2 Headspace Test with GC-TCD" is used for the assessment of synthetic ester lubricants. The effects on biodegradability in water and soil of both additives and usage are examined and discussed. Ester based cutting fluids, gear fluids and hydraulic fluids with and without additives are used under defined conditions in machine tools and hydraulic and plain bearing test benches. The lubricants are characterised additionally with respect to kinematic viscosity, acidity and elemental composition. Furthermore, a formulated mineral oil is characterised before and after usage in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>test</b> <b>bench.</b> Early results clearly show that the mineral oil is far less biodegradable than the ester oils and that their biodegradability is not affected by usage. The biodegradability of the ester oils mainly depends on the characteristics of the base fluids and is not affected by the additives. Antioxidants influence stability and biodegradability indirectly, since they prevent oxopolymerisation effects. Other effects of usage on biodegradation of lubricants are not detected. In this context, the antioxidants ensure ready biodegradability and {{have a positive effect on}} the environmental fate of synthetic ester lubricants.

Additionally, a desktop application needed to be developed for creating tests for the drill <b>test</b> <b>benches.</b> In this thesis a concept of a testing framework is created, which describes conceptually how the automatic tests for the drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> are defined and run. Applicability of the concept is analyzed also in a broader context for testing various kinds of systems. An implementation of the testing framework concept for drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> is developed, which is the main focus of this thesis.

40|$|AbstractDirect {{introduction}} of solar energy into a Brayton cycle using Solar Tower systems enables a highly efficient {{conversion of the}} solar energy, especially so when combined cycles are used. One key component of such a solar gas turbine system is the receiver. High and inhomogeneous heat fluxes pose the main challenge {{for the design of}} such receivers. One possible design of the receiver uses directly irradiated metallic tubes arranged in an insulated cavity. The paper presents the results of a study comparing thermo hydraulic absorber tube layouts with varying absorber tube dimensions and number of parallel tubes. The more parallel tubes are used the lower is the velocity of the fluid flow and in the same way the heat transfer coefficient is reduced. This leads to higher wall temperatures and therefore to a lower receiver efficiency. Using corrugated tubes instead of smooth tubes gives the possibility to increase the heat transfer coefficient. A thermo <b>hydraulic</b> <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> was developed in order to analyze the influence of different structures of corrugated tubes on heat transfer capability and pressure drop. The geometry of helicallyribbed tubes was optimized using CFD modelling. Design goal was a high heat transfer coefficient without exceeding the allowed pressure drop of the turbine. The resultingconfigurations were used to improve a tubular receiver based on the SOLUGAS receiver design. A thermal FEM model was used to analyze the temperature field and the efficiency of the different receiver designs. Solar radiation, convection to fluid, radiation exchange, convective and conductive losses were considered in the model. It was found that the receiver efficiency of about 0. 719 (at design point) could be increased up to 0. 835 by using more parallel absorber tubes than needed to fulfill the pressure drop limit...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{reconfigurable}} {{assembly fixture}} {{is a major}} and important component of a reconfigurable assembly system. It {{is required for the}} assembly of a variety of press brake models {{in order to reduce the}} assembly time and overall production time. The stages and requirements for the design of an assembly fixture and understanding of the assembly process for press brake models were used to design a reconfigurable assembly fixture. A detailed design analysis of parts of the fixture and the hydraulic system is considered and presented in this article. The stress and displacement analysis of the parts is executed using Solidworks express simulation. The parameters of the hydraulic components were determined from force requirements, and the hydraulic system was modelled physically using Matlab Simscape hydraulics. The response of the hydraulic system was obtained for each actuator in the system in order to depict the output of the actuators from the spool displacement of the valves. Stress analysis conducted on parts of the fixture showed that it can withstand maximum stresses that are lesser than the yield strength of the material used for the part. It was also established that synchronization of hydraulic actuators can best be achieved by the use of a sine input to the electrohydraulic valve. An experimental investigation was done using FESTO <b>hydraulic</b> <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> in order to observe the synchronized extension and retraction of the hydraulic actuators. The simulation of the hydraulic system, electric system and the programmable logic controller was prepared using automation studio. The design is envisaged to provide the industries with relevant information on accurate location and gripping of press brake frames rather than turning and repositioning of the frame in order to fit other parts during assembly. The article provides relevant information on the design analysis of a reconfigurable assembly fixture for press brakes which is novel because articles on reconfigurable assembly fixtures have not considered its application to press brake assembly...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of numerical simulation and experimental study of fluid flow in the jet pump, and, in particular, near the nozzle. It considers the influence of possible manufacturing errors of the pump on its characteristics, such as head and efficiency. Numerical simulation is based on the calculation method of control volume discrete analogs of the Reynolds averaged Navies-Stokes and continuity equations of a continuous medium (method RANS). The closure of the system of equations is performed by k-ω SST turbulence model. The number of cells of the computational grid is about 2 million. The boundary conditions are a fluid velocity at both pump inlets and a pressure at the outlet. In this case the calculated value is the pressure at both inlets. An experimental study is conducted on a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>test</b> <b>bench.</b> The data obtained by experiment are used to discharge characteristic of the pump and its efficiency. Given comparison of design and experimental characteristics shows a significant difference resulting from the manufacturing inaccuracies of the inner shape of the pump nozzle. The paper reports results of modeling a flow in the pump with a shape of the nozzle corresponding to that of really manufactured and several models more with intermediate forms of the nozzle. The simulation results obtain good agreement between the calculation of the corresponding real prototype model with experimental data, and it is shown that a small taper of the inner shape of the nozzle significantly affect the pump head, namely it increases with insignificant change of pressure at the pump inlet, which gives an indication of increasing pump efficiency. This work complements the existing studies of the effect of various factors on the operation of jet devices, such as the scale factor, the change in the axial position of the nozzle and the surface roughness. From {{the results of the study}} several conclusions can be drawn. In contrast to the accepted recommendations of designing the jet pump nozzle should be made slightly conical (no straight section) to improve the efficiency of the pump. In preparing design documentation and conducting control, one should focus on the tolerances of the nozzle shape. </p...|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis {{shows the}} {{development}} of a <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> for a flow sensor devices calibration. The project development will be carried out at a company, between February 2017 and July 2017. Therefore, during the project time, the <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> will be designed, developed and tested. The purpose of the <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> is the calibration for one of the products that the company is currently developing. For the product calibration, it is necessary air flowing into. For the current <b>test</b> <b>bench,</b> the calibration needs an operator to control air flow by using manual valves. However, the calibration process is long and if the operator is not on site, the calibration process may fail. So the new <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> will include three modes of operation, which will be explained for the next chapters...|$|R
40|$|Two new <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} for the combined measurement of the thermal properties and overall optical efficiencies of receivers for the use in parabolic trough collectors. In the first <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> two receivers are simultaneously irradiated by natural sunlight via parabolic troughs that are mounted on a two axis tracking stage. Shutters enable the variation of the aperture for quasi constant solar input power over the test period. The second, the solar simulator <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> consists of an elliptical cylinder with flat end reflectors. Metal halide lamps (HMI) and the receiver are positioned in the two respective focal lines. The <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> are operated in two modes: Cold performance tests with water flow through the receiver at near ambient temperature in order to measure the optical efficiency in the stationary enthalpy increase, secondly hot testing with the empty receiver at typical operating temperature in order to compare irradiant power and steady state thermal loss power and calculate the efficiency. The <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> are operated in combination with classic heat loss measurement, together the three <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> form a complementary set. First comparative measurements with cold testing on the solar simulator <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> show high reproducibility and a measurement precision relevant for qualification and comparison of different receiver types at industrial and research level...|$|R
