500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""No One" [...] may have given us a bloodless siege, but {{there were plenty of}} bloody moments, namely from the {{brothers}} Clegane, who were both awesomely brutal this week. Though not against one another, as it looks like, for now, the Cleganebowl's been canceled. I loved the end of Arya's arc along with Jaime's scheme to take Riverrun - though I'm curious to see what comes of the Tully angle. Brienne failed to get an army for Sansa and Jaime's just going to head back home now? It seems like there should be more to this that him just winning one for the Lannister name. Though regardless of what the payoff might be, it was still good to see how so much of this story tied back to the first three seasons and Jaime's time as Catelyn's prisoner." [...] He gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticized the episode's momentum within the season, writing [...] "The lack of momentum driving these stories is surprising to me given that the season has largely been doing a fine job with internal momentum." [...] McNutt continued, [...] "The show may have run into an unfortunate convergence of so many anti-climactic storylines in a single episode, but their very existence is a necessary byproduct of a narrative that is preparing to shed its skin and move forward with a new lease on life." [...] Despite this, he gave the episode a grade of B-. Erik Kain of Forbes wrote about the episode, [...] "Not the greatest episode of the season, but I still didn't want it to end. Sometimes I realize that even an episode <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> complaints about manages to be some of the best television out there. Game of Thrones isn't always on the money, but even an off night can be surprisingly good." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly summarized the episode in his review by saying [...] "Cheers, chills, and the sound of online fan theories imploding. [...] "No One" [...] delivered Jaime Lannister's finest scene in years, a thrilling chase, and set one Stark on an exciting new path." ...|$|E

At the time, Gullit was signed to Milan and the Italians raised their eyebrows: [...] "Nelson who?" [...] Gullit tried to explain and they said, [...] "Oh, a footballer with political beliefs." [...] Gullit has since in interviews said that he met Mandela after he was released and that Mandela had said to him, [...] "Ruud, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> friends now.

[...] Georges Collinet {{reported}} on an edition of his radio program Afropop Worldwide devoted to Les Quatre Etoiles, [...] "After more than ten years living in France, Bopol and Nyboma have now come to the US, looking for a new base, because they say that in America, business is business, while in France, people are always looking at the color of your skin." [...] Collinet continued, translating from his interview in French with Bopol for the program, [...] "Bopol says, if there were good studios in Zaire I would prefer to work there, because there <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> inspiration -- you can see what people are doing.

I had expected a terrible scolding, but I suppose my crimes simply seemed to her too enormous for words.|$|E

My gracious, Rose, you'd have thought me a romantic goose last night while Steve proposed in the back parlor, for I actually cried, he was so dreadfully in earnest when I pretended that I didn't care for him, and so very dear and nice when I told the truth. I didn't know he had it in him, but he came out delightfully and never cared a particle, though I dropped tears all over his lovely shirtfront. Wasn't that good of him?
