5|$|Actor Rishi Kapoor was {{subsequently}} cast as Rauf Lala, an underworld Don. Kapoor, {{who had never}} played a completely negative character in his entire career, was initially hesitant to sign the film. In an interview with Daily News and Analysis he stated that when Malhotra had offered him the role, he considered {{it to be a}} joke and thought that he would be the reason for the film's failure. Kapoor subsequently insisted on a test look before principal photography could begin, so that he could comfortably fit into the Muslim character of Lala, who wears kohl in his eyes, a <b>karakul</b> cap and is dressed in traditional kurta-pajamas. While shooting for the action sequences, Kapoor suffered several bad falls and bruises, but continued shooting and was thereby praised by co-star Hrithik Roshan for his professionalism.|$|E

25|$|Karzai is {{believed}} to be from the Shamizai subtribe of the Popalzais. His grandfather, Khair Muhammad Karzai, was a head of the Popalzai tribe from Kandahar who relocated to Kabul and ran the business of a guest house. This allowed Karzai's father Abdul Ahad, to gain a foothold in the royal family, and subsequently, the parliament. These actions and upwards movement within the Popalzai tribal system, led to the Karzai family furnishing a viable Shamizai clan alternative to Sadozai leadership {{in the aftermath of the}} Soviet invasion when the Sadozai clan failed to provide a tribal leader. He is often seen wearing a <b>Karakul</b> hat, something that has been worn by many Afghan kings in the past.|$|E
500|$|The Western {{world not}} only {{inspired}} Jinnah in his political life, but also greatly influenced his personal preferences, {{particularly when it}} came to dress. Jinnah abandoned local garb for Western-style clothing, and throughout his life he was always impeccably dressed in public. He came to own over 200 suits, which he wore with heavily starched shirts with detachable collars, and as a barrister took pride in never wearing the same silk tie twice. [...] Even when he was dying, he insisted on being formally dressed, [...] "I will not travel in my pyjamas." [...] In his later years he was usually seen wearing a <b>Karakul</b> hat which subsequently {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Jinnah cap".|$|E
2500|$|A {{project of}} {{modernization}} was undertaken in 1934, in which eight streets were laid out, housing and bazaars built.

2500|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} rivers in northern Tajikistan are the Syr Darya and the Zeravshan (Zarafshan). The former, the second longest river in Central Asia with a total length of , stretches [...] across the Fergana Valley in far-northern Tajikistan. The Zeravshan River, with a total length of , runs for [...] through the north-center of Tajikistan. Tajikistan's rivers reach high-water levels twice a year: in the spring, fed by the rainy season and melting mountain snow, and in the summer, fed by melting glaciers. The summer freshets are the more useful for irrigation, especially in the Fergana Valley and the valleys of southeastern Tajikistan. Most of Tajikistan's lakes are of glacial origin and {{are located in the}} Pamir region in the eastern half of the country. The largest, the <b>Karakul</b> (Qarokul) Lake, is a salt lake devoid of life, lying at an elevation of [...] Tajikistan's second largest water body is the Kayrakum Reservoir, a [...] long artificial lake {{in the heart of the}} Fergana Valley, not far from the city of Khujand in Sughd Province. The lake is fed by the Syr Darya. Another well-known natural lake of glacial origin is Iskanderkul. It is smaller than the Kayrakum Reservoir and lies in the Fann Mountains in western Tajikistan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Karakul</b> sheep are a {{multi-purpose}} breed, {{kept for}} milking, meat, pelts, and wool. As a fat-tailed breed, {{they have a}} distinctive meat. Many adult <b>Karakul</b> are double-coated; in this case, people separate the coarse guard hair from the undercoat. <b>Karakul</b> is relatively coarse fiber used for outer garment, carpets and for felting.|$|E
50|$|Very {{young or}} even fetal <b>Karakul</b> lambs are prized for pelts. Newborn <b>karakul</b> sheep pelts are called <b>karakul</b> (also spelled caracul), swakara (coined from South West Africa <b>Karakul),</b> {{astrakhan}} (Russian), Persian lamb, agnello di Persia, (Italian), krimmer (Russian) and garaköli bagana (Turkmen). Sometimes the terms for newborn lambs' and fetal lambs' pelts are used interchangeably. The newborn lambs have a tight, curly pattern of hair. The lambs must be under three days old {{when they are}} killed, or they will lose their black color and soft, tightly wound coils of fur. Dark colors are dominant and lambs often darken in color as they age. Fetal <b>karakul</b> lamb pelts are called broadtail, Breitschwanz (German), and karakulcha. Fetal <b>karakul</b> lambs are harvested through miscarriages, induced early delivery or by killing the mother sheep and removing the fetus. Rather than killing healthy female sheep, farmers will kill older sheep that have already given birth many times. People use the lamb pelts to create various clothing items, such as The Astrakhan (hat) or <b>karakul</b> hat. The pelts have also been used in haute couture.|$|E
