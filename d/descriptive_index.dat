5000|$|Although {{there are}} a few surveys used to measure the {{happiness}} or well-being level of people in different countries such as the World Happiness Report, the Happy Planet Index and the OECD Better Life Index, there are no surveys that measure happiness in the specific context of the workplace. There are, however, surveys created to assess the job satisfaction level of employees. Even though job satisfaction is a different concept, it is positively correlated to happiness and subjective well-being. The main job satisfaction scales are: The Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS), The Job <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Index</b> (JDI) and The Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ). The Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS) assesses nine facets of job satisfaction, as well as overall satisfaction. The facets include pay and pay raises, promotion opportunities, relationship with the immediate supervisor, fringe benefits, rewards given for good performance, rules and procedures, relationship with coworkers, type of work performed and communication within the organization. The scale contains thirty-six items and uses a summated rating scale format. The JSS can provide ten scores. Each of the nine subscales produce a separate score and the total of all items produces a total score. The Job <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Index</b> (JDI) scale assesses five facets which are work, pay, promotion, supervision and coworkers. The entire scale contains seventy-two items with either nine or eighteen items per subscale. Each item is an evaluative adjective or short phrase that is descriptive of the job. The individual has to respond [...] "yes", [...] "uncertain" [...] or [...] "no" [...] for each item. The Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) has two versions, a one hundred item long version and a twenty item short form. It covers twenty facets including activity, independence, variety, social status, supervision (human relations), supervision (technical), moral values, security, social service, authority, ability utilization, company policies and practices, compensation, advancement, responsibility, creativity, working conditions, coworkers, recognition and achievement. The long form contains five items per facet, while the short one contains only one.|$|E

40|$|The growing {{interest}} in personalized medicine requires making inferences from <b>descriptive</b> <b>indexes</b> estimated from individual recordings of physiological signals, with statistical analyses focused on individual differences between/within subjects, rather than comparing supposedly homogeneous cohorts. To this end, methods to compute confidence limits of individual estimates of <b>descriptive</b> <b>indexes</b> are needed. This study introduces numerical methods to compute such confidence limits and perform statistical comparisons between indexes derived from autoregressive (AR) modeling of individual time series. Analytical approaches are generally not viable, because the indexes are usually nonlinear functions of the AR parameters. We exploit Monte Carlo (MC) and Bootstrap (BS) methods to reproduce the sampling distribution of the AR parameters and indexes computed from them. Here, these methods are implemented for spectral and information-theoretic indexes of heart-rate variability (HRV) estimated from AR models of heart-period time series. First, the MS and BC methods are tested {{in a wide range}} of synthetic HRV time series, showing good agreement with a gold-standard approach (i. e. multiple realizations of the "true" process driving the simulation). Then, real HRV time series measured from volunteers performing cognitive tasks are considered, documenting (i) the strong variability of confidence limits' width across recordings, (ii) the diversity of individual responses to the same task, and (iii) frequent disagreement between the cohort-average response and that of many individuals. We conclude that MC and BS methods are robust in estimating confidence limits of these AR-based indexes and thus recommended for short-term HRV analysis. Moreover, the strong inter-individual differences in the response to tasks shown by AR-based indexes evidence the need of individual-by-individual assessments of HRV features. Given their generality, MC and BS methods are promising for applications in biomedical signal processing and beyond, providing a powerful new tool for assessing the confidence limits of indexes estimated from individual recordings...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{shape of}} the capnogram is {{modified}} by airway obstruction, and the evaluation of this deformation, using measurable indices, could allow an indi-rect measurement of bronchial patency. A previous study undertaken in asthmat-ic subjects showed a good correlation between a capnographic index (end-tidal slope) and a spirometric parameter (forced expiratory volume in one second as a per-centage of predicted (FEV 1 %pred)) and suggested the study of other indices. The correlations between capnographic and spirometric indices were measured in 10 healthy subjects and 30 asthmatic patients. The usefulness of eight <b>descriptive</b> <b>indices,</b> analysing the successive phases of the capnogram, was assessed by measur-ing their reproducibility and their sensitivity to airway obstruction. The intra-individual and interindividual variabilities (Vi and VI) and the noise/signal ratio (Vi/VI) were measured {{by comparing the results}} of two successive capnographic measurements in 14 asthmatic subjects.
