50|$|In {{the early}} days of photography, a wide range of {{developing}} agents were used, including chlorohydroquinone, ferrous oxalate,:131 hydroxylamine, <b>ferrous</b> <b>lactate,</b> ferrous citrate, Eikonogen, atchecin, antipyrin, acetanilid and Amidol (which unusually required mildly acidic conditions).|$|E
40|$|Both {{yogurt and}} pasteurized liquid milk {{was made from}} whole cow’s milk which was {{fortified}} with ferrous bisglycinate, <b>ferrous</b> <b>lactate</b> and ferrous sulfate microencapsulate. Yogurt was stored for 7 days and milk for 2 days before consumer acceptance sensory tests was done. Chemical analysis was done every 5 days for yogurt and every 3 days for pasteurized milk. Sensory mean scores show {{that there were no}} significant differences between the control yogurt and yogurt fortified with ferrous sulfate microencapsulate in appearance, flavor, mouthfeel and overall preference. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) were observed between control yogurt and yogurt fortified with ferrous bisglycinate and yogurt fortified with <b>ferrous</b> <b>lactate.</b> The observation was different in milk where no significant differences were observed in appearance and flavor in all treatments while control milk and milk fortified with <b>ferrous</b> <b>lactate</b> showed no significant differences in taste. Both Thiobarbituric Acid (TBA) and Peroxide Value (PV) numbers were highest in yogurt and pasteurized milk fortified with ferrous sulfate microencapsulate. Control yogurt had the lowest TBA value. PV was lowest in yogurt fortified with <b>ferrous</b> <b>lactate</b> while pasteurized milk has low PV in control. ...|$|E
40|$|Allergies to iron salts {{are seldom}} reported. We studied {{a patient with}} iron-defi ciency anemia who had {{suffered}} anaphylactic reactions caused by oral iron salts. An allergy study was performed using single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge and skin tests with various iron salts as well as excipients in commercial formulations. Oral challenges were positive for 2 of the commercial formulations of iron salts. Intradermal tests with ferrous sulphate and <b>ferrous</b> <b>lactate</b> also showed positive results. All of the cutaneous tests using the excipients were negative. A desensitization protocol was designed which enabled us to readminister ferrous sulphate, although antihistamines were necessary to guarantee good tolerance to iron salts. We report a patient with allergy to iron salts, positive skin tests, and positive controlled challenge. We highlight the desensitization protocol designed to complete the therapeutic management of the anemia. Key words: Oral iron salts. Anaphylaxis. Desensitization...|$|E
40|$|To {{produce an}} {{acceptable}} snack of high nutritional quality for the programs against anemia and malnutrition, the direct expansion snack products were developed from extrusion process using Thai brown rice of two specialty hybridization (variety: 313 and 1000) as basic raw materials. For each variety of brown rice, the optimum operating conditions were investigated with twin-screw extruder at varying screw speed (300 and 350 rpm), type of iron fortificants (ferrous sulphate, <b>ferrous</b> <b>lactate</b> and ferrous fumarate) {{and level of}} iron content in snack product (20 and 100 % RDI) in the 2 × 3 × 2 factorial experiment. Similarly, the optimum operating condition of snack production from each variety of rice had shown that increasing screw speed resulting in extrudate with higher expansion, lower density and broad peak or lower slope of the deformation curve from texture analyzer. The type of iron fortificant had no significant effect on palatability and metallic smell of snack product. Furthermore, the level of iron content had no significant effect on expansion and density of extrudate. It was concluded that all of snack products should be operated at 350 rpm of screw speed, ferrous sulphate as iron fortificant and level of 20 % RDI for iron to provide the good appearance and {{meet the requirements of}} iron as well as lower production cost. In addition, the representative of the finished products were analyzed for the pattern of nutrition labeling microbiological test and shelf life between 0 - 4 months on the determination of moisture, aw, TBA numbers, iron content and sensory test which correspond to nutrition claims of high iron and high potential for further commercial production...|$|E
40|$|The {{bioavailability}} of {{five different}} iron sources {{added to a}} bovine milk based formula was investigated in the anaemic, suckled piglet. These iron sources were ferrous pyrophosphate (FP), ferrous sulphate (FS), milk protein-iron complex (MPIC), <b>ferrous</b> <b>lactate</b> (FL), and haemin (Hm). Forty eight male piglets {{were removed from the}} sow at five days of age and {{randomly assigned to one of}} six treatment groups (n= 8). Iron depletion was achieved in two ways: firstly, by withholding the iron injection usually given to these piglets at birth, and secondly, by feeding the piglets an iron-deficient formula throughout an eleven day adjustment/iron-depletion period. The five formulas containing the supplementary iron and one formula containing no iron (control diet) were bottle-fed to the piglets (336 g of liquid formula/kg bodyweight/day) seven times daily for a 25 day repletion period. Analysis of the formulas revealed that iron levels in each of the five iron treated formulas varied over a range of 6. 0 - 8. 3 mg/l 00 g of powdered formula. Iron bioavailibility was assessed in the piglets by a haemoglobin repletion assay. Blood was collected from the anterior vena cava of the piglets on days 0, 11, 24, and 36 of the trial, and the piglets were weighed every three to four days throughout the 25 day repletion period. Blood haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, unsaturated iron binding capacity, and piglet liveweights were used as indicators of iron status in the piglets. Haemoglobin Repletion Efficiency (HRE%), a measure of the proportion of ingested iron that is incorporated into haemoglobin in the body, was calculated to correct for differences in the iron content of the formula and differences in iron intake by the piglets. The HRE% for the FP, FS, MPIC, FL, and Hm fortified formulas were 23. 5, 35. 8, 38. 0, 32. 9, and 3. 2 %, respectively. There were no significant differences, however, in the mean blood haemoglobin concentrations, haematocrits, HRE% and UIBC for piglets fed the FS, MPIC, or the FL fortified formulas half way through, and at the end, of the repletion. This implied that there were no differences in the bioavailability of these iron sources. In contrast, these parameters were all significantly lower (P> 0. 05), for the piglets fed either the FP or the Hm formulas. Based on relative biological value, the bioavailability of each iron source, when ranked in order from highest to lowest, was MPIC<FS<FL<FP<Hm. These findings have important implications for the development of iron-enriched milk products destined for human consumption...|$|E
