50|$|On frames with no {{derailleur}} hanger, {{a direct}} mount derailleur or derailleur with a <b>hanger</b> <b>plate</b> is used. These only fit bikes with horizontal dropouts, and {{are held in}} place by a small bolt and the rear wheel axle. These have now been effectively superseded by the derailleur hanger. Since a derailleur designed to be fitted to a separate hanger will be aligned lower on the bike than one that bolts directly onto the frame, it follows that a derailleur must be selected firstly with the mounting method in mind.|$|E

50|$|Another type of {{fastening}} {{commonly found}} in construction is the strap fastening which is roughly analogous to the large head clout nail. These are {{used in conjunction with}} a strap shot nailer (or positive placement nailer UK) to fix metalwork such as joist <b>hangers,</b> corner <b>plates,</b> strengthening straps, etc. to timber structures. They differ from conventional nailers in that the point of the fastening is not sheathed so it can be exactly positioned before firing the nail gun.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The vortex-induced across-wind {{vibrations}} {{of vertical}} bridge tie rods, often domi-nated by the so-called lock-in effect, have been proved as a prominent load {{factor in the}} dimen-sioning of arched steel bridges. In order to realistically predict the oscillation amplitudes of the bridge hangers, an improved load model has been developed. This model is used to estimate the lifetime of the <b>hanger</b> connection <b>plate,</b> which represents the most sensitive part of the bridge. The stresses are computed on an a 3 D finite element model of the structure, according to the notch stress approach. The distribution function of the damage accumulated during an excitation process can be evaluated by using the Palmgren-Miner accumulation rule, applied to stochastically defined, uniform Woehler-curves. Analysing several statistically equivalent realisations of the wind pro-cess, a distribution function of the damage can be established. With this and the Weibull func-tion describing the occurrence-frequency of mean wind velocities, the time-dependent failure probability of the plate can be estimated. As a reference-system, the hanger-plates of an arched bridge in Germany have been chosen. The form of the cut {{at the end of}} the flattened hangers, originally a semi-circle, has been op...|$|R
40|$|Building {{structure}} of this final {{project will be}} re-modified and redesigned by using composite steel structure. The composite structure between concrete and steel beam is a structure which utilize concrete and steel benefits, working together as a one holder. Those benefits are concrete strong in a deep pressure and steel strong in a high pull. The design of this building is based on “The Ethics of Designing Structure Steel on Building (SNI 03 - 1729 - 2002) ”, “The Ethics of Designing Endurance Earthquake on Building (SNI 03 - 1726 - 2002) ” and The Indonesian Rule of Building Load in 1983. Designing of roof plate and floor plate is used composite plate floor deck and armed beam. The thickness of plate roof and plate floor is 120 mm. Floor deck which is used 2 ” Lok – Floor Gage 20, Produced by United Steel Deck Inc. The Arms that is needed on plate roof D 16 – 200 (cross), for plate floor D 20 – 200 (cross). On the designing beam is used composite beam system by using WF (Wide Flange) profile WF 400. 200. 8. 13 for cross beam and longitudinal beam. Composite column dimension is 550 x 550 mm, consist of profile WF 400. 400. 13. 21 by using arms longitudinal 8 D 22 and arms crossbar D 12 - 275. Displacement joint between steel-profile beam and concrete is used stud kind displacement connection 19 x 90, requirement displacement connection on each beam 40 stud. Beside, column beam joint uses bolt A 324 5 / 8 ” diameter (15. 87 mm), also T plate and elbow plate. Base Plate is designed 508 x 508 mm dimension, with 25 mm thick and base <b>plate</b> <b>hanger</b> to foundation used 25 mm diameter and 800 mm channel length...|$|R
