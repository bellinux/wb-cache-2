40|$|A {{smart grid}} system {{constitutes}} a control loop, and {{recent research has}} tried to implement the loop using a cyber-physical system (CPS) model integrating physical processes (i. e., power flow) with networked computing capabilities. More specifically, the system aims to read/control energy resources in a physical domain {{for the purpose of}} energy balance. This requires each resource to be capable of accepting control command messages as well as sending out data, making bi-directional interactions with external entities. Regarding the interactions, we pose two research questions. (1) How to enable the interactions? (2) How to secure the interoperation? To answer the questions, this dissertation designs and develops an interoperable and secure communication model for cyber-physical systems and extends it to examine the realization of smart grid interoperation, the <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy</b> (IoE). The contribution of the dissertation is three-fold. First, we develop a generic middleware model in which an object represents various physical functions and inter-communicates with other objects in a unified manner, maximizing the interoperability. Second, we conduct an experimental study. We develop and deploy a real-world testbed of Microgrid on our campus, on which we run a variety of energy services, demonstrating feasibility of the <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy.</b> Last, we propose several schemes securing inter-networking in the cyber-physical systems.

However, in a deregulated energy market, coordinating the exchange of data between these so-called smart meters and the various market participants entitled to this data is challenging. The British government has decided for a regulated and monopolistic communication provider as a solution to this coordination problem. In this paper, we propose non-regulated data exchange services as an alternative approach. We show the suitability of exchanging smart meter data as a new business model in two steps: We identify potential economic benefits and then discuss market size, revenue model and market penetration.

40|$|Under intense {{environmental}} pressure, {{the global}} energy sector is promoting {{the integration of}} renewable energy into interconnected energy systems. The demand-side management (DSM) of energy systems has drawn considerable industrial and academic attention in attempts to form new flexibilities to respond to variations in renewable energy inputs to the system. However, many DSM concepts {{are still in the}} experimental demonstration phase. One of the obstacles to DSM usage is that the current information infrastructure was mainly designed for centralized systems, and does not meet DSM requirements. To overcome this barrier, this paper proposes a novel information infrastructure named the <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy</b> Things (IoET) in order to make DSM practicable by basing it on the latest wireless communication technology: the low-power wide-area network (LPWAN). The primary advantage of LPWAN over general packet radio service (GPRS) and area Internet of Things (IoT) is its wide-area coverage, which comes with minimum power consumption and maintenance costs. Against this background, this paper briefly reviews the representative LPWAN technologies of narrow-band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and Long Range (LoRa) technology, and compares them with GPRS and area IoT technology. Next, a wireless-to-cloud architecture is proposed for the IoET, based on the main technical features of LPWAN. Finally, this paper looks forward to the potential of IoET in various DSM application scenarios...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{interest}} in the Internet of Things (IoT) {{has resulted in a}} number of wide-area deployments of IoT subnetworks, where multiple heterogeneous wireless communication solutions coexist: from multiple access technologies such as cellular, WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth, to multi-hop ad-hoc and MANET routing protocols, they all must be effectively integrated to create a seamless communication platform. Managing these open, geographically distributed, and heterogeneous networking infrastructures, especially in dynamic environments, is a key technical challenge. In order {{to take full advantage of}} the many opportunities they provide, techniques to concurrently provision the different classes of IoT traffic across a common set of sensors and networking resources must be designed. In this paper, we will design a software-defined approach for the IoT environment to dynamically achieve differentiated quality levels to different IoT tasks in very heterogeneous wireless networking scenarios. For this, we extend the Multinetwork INformation Architecture (MINA), a reflective (self-observing and adapting via an embodied Observe-Analyze-Adapt loop) middleware with a layered IoT SDN controller. The developed IoT SDN controller originally i) incorporates and supports commands to differentiate flow scheduling over task-level, multi-hop, and heterogeneous ad-hoc paths and ii) exploits Network Calculus and Genetic Algorithms to optimize the usage of currently available IoT network opportunities. We have applied the extended MINA SDN prototype in the challenging IoT scenario of wide-scale integration of electric vehicles, electric charging sites, smart grid infrastructures, and a wide set of pilot users, as targeted by the Artemis <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy</b> and Arrowhead projects. Preliminary simulation performance results indicate that our approach and the extended MINA system can support efficient exploitation of the IoT multinetwork capabilities...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the development of a project concerning a demonstration in the scope of the Supply Chain 6 of the <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy</b> (IoE) project: the Remote Monitoring Emulator, which bears my personal contribution in several sections. IoE is a project of international relevance, that means to establish an interoperability standard as regards the electric power production and utilization infrastructure, using Smart Space platforms. The future perspectives of IoE have to do with a platform for electrical power trade-of, the Smart Grid, whose energy is produced by decentralized renewable sources and whose services are exploited primarily according to the Internet of Things philosophy. The main consumers of this kind of smart technology will be Smart Houses (that is to say, buildings controlled by an autonomous system for electrical energy management that is interoperable with the Smart Grid) and Electric Mobility, that is a smart and automated management regarding movement and, overall, recharging of electrical vehicles. It is precisely in the latter case study that the project Remote Monitoring Emulator takes place. It consists {{in the development of a}} simulated platform for the management of an electrical vehicle recharging in a city. My personal contribution to this project lies in development and modeling of the simulation platform, of its counterpart in a mobile application and implementation of a city service prototype. This platform shall, ultimately, make up a demonstrator system exploiting the same device which a real user, inside his vehicle, would use. The main requirements that this platform shall satisfy will be interoperability, expandability and relevance to standards, as it needs to communicate with other development groups and to effectively respond to internal changes that can affect IoE. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} Wireless Sensor Networks is heavily {{constrained}} by {{its reliance on}} storage technology like batteries, which are a finite resource. Whilst the number of transistors in an IC doubles every 18 months, the <b>energy</b> density <b>of</b> batteries is relatively flat {{during the same time}} period. This is a key challenge in leveraging the <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> Things on trains. The gravity of this problem is increased by an order of magnitude when the network is to be scaled up to hundreds or thousands of nodes. Comprehensive research and development efforts have been devoted to building ultra-low power sensors. These ultra-low power sensors are configured to have very low duty cycle and are practically asleep most of the time. Short duty cycle might extend the battery life, but the energy will inevitably run out. Energy harvesting has emerged as a viable solution to the energy loss issue by ensuring sensors never run out <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> Though, there could be a significant upfront cost in employing energy harvesting; several studies have shown it takes 24 months or less to break even. Energy harvesters, unlike batteries, are not commonly a one size fits all; some customization is required based on the environment. Mechanical harvesting sources are ideal for the rail environment because this environment has an abundant amount <b>of</b> vibration <b>energy.</b> This thesis focuses on how Energy Harvesting and Storage can be used as the sole power source for the Wireless Sensor Networks that make up the <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> Things in the railroad industry.

This article focuses on the latter and presents a smart socket system that collects the information about energy price and makes use of sensors and actuators to optimize home energy consumption according to the user preferences. Specifically, this article provides three main novel contributions. First, what to our knowledge is the first hardware prototype that manages in a practical real-world scenario the price values obtained from a public electricity operator is presented. The second contribution is related to the definition of a novel wireless sensor network communications protocol based on Wi-Fi that allows for creating an easy-to-deploy smart plug system that self-organizes and auto-configures to collect the sensed data, minimizing user intervention. Third, it is provided a thorough description of the design of one of the few open-source smart plug systems, including its communications architecture, the protocols implemented, the main sensing and actuation components and the most relevant pieces of the software. Moreover, with the aim of illustrating the capabilities of the smart plug system, the results of different experiments performed are shown. Such experiments evaluate in real-world scenarios the system’s ease of use, its communications range and its performance when using HTTPS.

The performance of the scheme is optimized by means of a Markov Decision Process framework. Comment: Presented at IEEE SECON 201...|$|R
