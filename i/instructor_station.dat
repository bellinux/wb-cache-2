The system is composed of both trainers teaching crew trainees how to operate different systems of the tank and simulators allowing training more advanced situations. For example, the SJ-02 is used tech how to load a main gun. SJ-09 is the driver training vehicle used to train divers in operating of the vehicle as big and heavy as main battle tank. The vehicle itself is a tank chassis that have turret replaced with <b>instructor</b> <b>station.</b> All unnecessary equipment (like side skirts) was removed, the vehicle have a dummy main gun that obstructs drivers view (like in the real tank).

40|$|Abstract: A {{power plant}} {{simulation}} tool (‘PowerSim’) {{has been developed}} with 10 years experience from {{the development of a}} plant simulator for efficient modeling of a power plant. PowerSim is the first developed tool in Korea for plant simulation with various plant component models, <b>instructor</b> <b>station</b> function and the Graphic Model Builder (GMB). PowerSim is composed of a graphic editor using general purpose design software, a netlist converter, component models, the scheduler, <b>Instructor</b> <b>Station</b> and an executive. The graphic editor generates a netlist that shows the connection status of the various plant components from the Simdiagram, which is drawn by Icon Drag method supported by GUI environment of the PowerSim. Netlist Converter normalizes the connection status of the components. Scheduler makes scheduling for the execution of the device models according to the netlist. Therefore, the user makes Simdiagram based on the plant Pipe and Instrument Drawing (P&ID) and inputs the plant data for automatic simulating execution. This paper introduces Graphic Model Builder (GMB), <b>instructor</b> <b>station,</b> executive and the detailed introduction of thermal-hydraulic modeling. This paper will also introduce basic ideas on how the simulation Diagram, based on netlist generated from general purpose design software, is made and how the system is organized. The developed tool has been verified through the simulation of a real power plant...|$|E

30|$|In {{response}} to this advent of the modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), many universities in Taiwan have made conscientious efforts to modernize their classrooms by equipping them with technologies (McAlpine and Gandell 2003). In Taiwanese university classrooms, such implemented technology {{is often referred to}} as an “e-Station” (Winer and Cooperstock 2002). A typical e-Station classroom has an <b>instructor</b> <b>station</b> equipped with a networked computer and audiovisual devices which allow the instructor to teach using various media including presentation software, DVD players, LCD projectors and the like. Even with the addition of these types of technology, many of the e-Station classrooms still seem inadequate in facilitating teaching and learning. Therefore, this study was initiated to renovate the current university classrooms in Taiwan by establishing a “smart classroom” with innovative ICT systems (Chang and Lee 2010). In addition to the features of an e-Station, the smart classroom incorporates innovative technologies to create a classroom with interactive learning materials.|$|E

Now Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) has issued Standard Safety Analysis Report (SSAR) and acquired Standard De-sign Approval (SDA) for SMART. In order to conduct the design verification and validation for li-cense, the integrated simulation test environment that is composed of 1) the system specific si-mulation codes formerly developed in the name of Nuclear Plant Analyzer (NPA) including NSSS and BOP simulation, 2) <b>Instructor</b> <b>Station</b> (IS), 3) Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), 4) operator and instructor Human Machine Interface (HMI), and 5) soft-controller has been con-sidered as an important area for operator training and system validation.

This paper introduces the structure of integrated simulation test environment for SMART, explains the efforts to assist system-specific simulation code interface, and also addresses the effort for implementing and optimizing the test environment by maintaining its own simulation functionality and performance in order to revie...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{geothermal}} {{power plant}} multiple simulator for operators training is presented. The simulator {{is designed to be}} installed in a wireless local area network and has a capacity to train one to six operators simultaneously, each one with an independent simulation session. The sessions must be supervised only by one instructor. The main parts of this multiple simulator are: instructor and operator’s stations. On the <b>instructor</b> <b>station,</b> the instructor controls the simulation sessions, establishes training exercises and supervises each power plant operator in individual way. This station is hosted in a Main Personal Computer (NS) and its main functions are: to set initial conditions, snapshots, malfunctions or faults, monitoring trends, and process and soft-panel diagrams. On the other hand the operators carry out their actions over the power plant simulated on the operator’s stations; each one is also hosted in a PC. The main software of instructor and operator’s stations are executed on the same NS and displayed in PCs through graphical Interactive Process Diagrams (IDP). The geothermal multiple simulator has been installed in the Geothermal Simulation Training Center (GSTC) of the Comisión Federal de Electricidad, (Federal Commission of Electricity, CFE), Mexico, and is being utilized {{as a part of the}} training courses for {{geothermal power plant}} operators. Keywords—Geothermal power plant, multiple simulator, training operator. I. ...|$|E
40|$|In many {{air forces}} {{advanced}} computer equipment {{is being used}} for after-action review and evaluation. These tools hopefully help the student pilot to understand his mistakes, but they neither {{give him a chance}} to immediately correct what went wrong, nor provide a view of what would have happened had he acted differently. Although some simulators provide some support to this end, the full potential of this concept is seldom used. Especially in combination with run-time analysis of the tactical situation—pedagogically presented to the student pilot—very powerful learning effects can be achieved. The Swedish Defence Research Agency, in cooperation with the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters, is currently pursuing the WVR Illustrator Project. The purpose of this project is to explore the enhanced training effects given by a suite of pedagogical tools. In addition, the purpose is to provide a test-bed for trying out new ideas regarding visual presentation of tactical situations. Ideas that pass the tests in the WVR Illustrator will be further evaluated in more complex simulator environments. Furthermore, this system is built using COTS equipment, resulting in a total project cost that is only a fraction of the cost of a regular fighter simulator system. The system itself consists of one <b>instructor</b> <b>station</b> and two pilot stations. Motion Trackers sense the pilots ´ head positions, and the virtual environment is presented to the pilots in Head Mounted Displays. This enables them to turn thei...|$|E
