The internal genes of H 7 N 9 and H 10 N 8 were all derived from the H 9 N 2 influenza viruses circulating within poultry (Cui et al., 2014). Multiple reassortment events within wild birds and poultry have resulted in the establishment of H 7 N 9 and H 10 N 8 viruses, respectively, and finally resulted in human infections.

Consequently {{there is a}} need for accurate and sensitive detection of Eurasian H 9 subtype viruses. Two H 9 RealTime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) tests, developed by Monne et al. (2008) and Ben Shabat et al. (2010), were originally validated with a limited number of H 9 specimens. In the present study, the two tests have been assessed using 66 diverse H 9 isolates and 139 clinical specimens from six <b>H</b> 9 <b>poultry</b> outbreaks in four geographically disparate Eurasian countries. The Monne et al. (2008) test was modified and successfully detected all H 9 viruses from all three Eurasian H 9 lineages. Bayesian analysis of the clinical specimens' results revealed this test to be more sensitive (97 %) than the Ben Shabat et al. (2010) test (31 %). The latter test detected most H 9 isolates of the G 1 lineage, but no isolates from other H 9 lineages. Mismatches in the primer/probe binding sequences accounted for sensitivity differences between the two H 9 RRT-PCRs. Genetic analysis of 34 sequenced H 9 haemagglutinin genes showed the South Asian and Middle-East H 9 isolates to belong to the H 9 G 1 lineage, and possessed residues that appear to preferably bind alpha 2, 6 -linked sialic acid receptors which indicate a potential for human infection.

In this study we advanced {{our understanding of the}} genetic drift of the H 6 N 2 virus in poultry in South Africa, by phylogenetic analyses of gene segments and antigenic characterization of the virus, and determined the efficacy of the current vaccine. Using isolates collected between 2002 and 2013, full genome sequencing was performed to determine whether genetic re-assortment had occurred over the past decade. Vaccine batches were made from these isolates and with the use of antigenic cartography the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) data was visualized to determine antigenic similarities or differences between the viruses. From this research, information about the evolution of the H 6 N 2 virus was revealed.

30|$|In our {{previous}} study, we analyzed {{a large number}} of the H 7 N 9 influenza viruses available and proposed that the G 0 viruses were responsible for the spread of this virus (Cui et al., 2014). Both inter-province and intra-province transmissions have led to the genesis of novel genotypes, and hence raise the genetic diversity of the H 7 N 9 viruses. The five Guangdong chicken H 7 N 9 viruses isolated in May belonging to G 0 and G 1.1 were most likely to be transported from the Yangtze River Delta following the first outbreak (Fig.  2). The study of potential transmission route based on poultry transportation would be a proof (Chen et al., 2013 a). However, the human H 7 N 9 viruses in Guangdong and Hong Kong were novel reassortants following the genetic reassortment with local <b>poultry</b> <b>H</b> 9 N 2 viruses (Fig.  2). The phylogenetics also suggests that the H 9 N 2 virus gene pool also consists of viruses from adjacent provinces of Guangdong of China. The estimation of the reassortment date suggests that the reassortment events would have occurred following the H 7 N 9 introduction to Guangdong. Therefore, the H 7 N 9 virus has continued to undergo dynamic reassortments with local H 9 N 2 virus and caused the human infections in Guangdong and Hong Kong during the new influenza season.|$|R
40|$|Histomoniasis or {{blackhead}} is {{a disease}} of gallinaceous birds, caused by the protozoon Histomonas meleagridis. Since traditional diagnostics {{for the detection of}} this disease are complex and far less sensitive than molecular tools, a PCR would provide a more rapid and sensitive alternative. However, intestinal material and droppings, which are preferably used in epidemiological studies of histomoniasis, often contain PCR inhibitory substances. To detect these false negative results, the use of an internal amplification control is essential. Nevertheless, the recently developed PCR tests lack this internal control. Therefore, a new PCR assay with H. meleagridis specific primers was developed which does include an internal amplification control. The diagnostic value of the PCR assay was evaluated in comparison to three other conventional H. meleagridis specific PCR tests (HIS 5, HM 1 and HM 2). None of the organ samples originating from uninfected turkeys, showed positive PCR results in any of the tests. Among the lesion-positive, inhibition-free samples, 95. 4 % were positive by our PCR assay, while only 50, 66. 7 and 83. 3 % of the lesion-positive organs tested positive by the HM 1, the HIS 5 and the HM 2 PCR respectively.

In the current study, H 9 N 2 influenza viruses isolated from poultry in eastern China during the past 10 years were characterized genetically and antigenically. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these H 9 N 2 viruses have undergone extensive reassortment to generate multiple novel genotypes, including four genotypes (J, F, K, and L) {{that have never been}} recognized before.

40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (H 5 N 1) virus continues to cause infections in Egypt. This study describes the practices associated with raising and slaughtering household poultry to identify {{risk factors for}} H 5 N 1 infection and reasons for non-compliance with preventive measures. |An investigation was conducted of 56 households with household flocks (19 households with human H 5 N 1 cases, 19 with <b>poultry</b> <b>H</b> 5 N 1 cases, and 18 with no reported <b>poultry</b> or human <b>H</b> 5 N 1 cases). Data were collected via structured observations and in-depth interviews. |Half of the households kept at least some free-range poultry and mixed at least some different species of poultry as it was considered beneficial for the poultry. Feeding and cleaning practices exposed children to contact with poultry; slaughtering contaminated homes; use of personal protective barriers was not a norm; waste management exposed the communities to slaughtering waste and dead chickens; and reporting of sick and dead poultry was not a practice. Only minor changes in poultry-handling took place following H 5 N 1 virus outbreaks. |H 5 N 1 virus prevention in Egypt represents both an epidemiological and socio-cultural challenge. Traditional poultry-rearing practices that likely increase exposures to H 5 N 1 -infected poultry are common throughout Egypt. Despite education campaigns following sporadic H 5 N 1 outbreaks, no differences in these practices could be detected between households with previous H 5 N 1 human or poultry cases and those households with any previous experience with H 5 N 1. Development of H 5 N 1 infection-related education campaign strategies should focus on perceptions underlying traditional practices in order to tailor public awareness messages that are meaningful for communities. 23145955 PMC 463426...|$|R
40|$|A {{serological}} and {{virological surveillance}} program {{to investigate the}} HPAI H 5 N 1 virus in wild bird populations was undertaken from February 2007 to October 2008. The purpose of the survey {{was to investigate the}} infection status in free ranging wild birds in Banglane district, Nakhon Pathom province, central Thailand. Samples from wild birds were collected every two months. Choanal and cloacal swabs, serum and tissue samples were collected from 421 birds comprising 44 species. Sero-prevalence of the virus tested by H 5 N 1 serum neutralization test (using a H 5 N 1 virus clade 1; A/chicken/Thailand/vsmu- 3 -BKK/ 2004) was 2. 1 % (8 out of 385 samples; 95 % CI 0. 7, 3. 5). Species that were antibody positive included rock pigeons (Columba livia), Asian pied starling (Gracupica contra), spotted dove (Streptopelia chinensis), oriental magpie robin (Copsychus saularis), blue-tailed bee-eater (Merops philippinus), myna (Acridotheres spp.), and pond heron (Ardeola spp.). Prevalence by H 5 N 1 virus isolation was 0. 5 % (2 out of 421 samples; 95 % CI 0. 0, 1. 1); the two H 5 N 1 virus-positive samples were from Asian pied starling (Gracupica contra) and white vented myna (Acridotheres grandis). Positive virological samples were collected in June 2007 while all positive serology samples were collected between May and August except for one sample collected in December 2007. No positive samples were collected in 2008. Molecular studies revealed that the wild bird H 5 N 1 viruses were closely related to poultry viruses isolated in other parts of Thailand. However, there was no <b>poultry</b> <b>H</b> 5 N 1 prevalence study performed in the study site during the time of this wild bird survey. Interpretation of source of virus isolates would include spill-over of H 5 N 1 viruses from contaminated sources due to movement of domestic poultry and/or fomites from other areas; or infection of wild birds within the outbreak locations and then translocation by wild bird movement and interaction with wild birds inhabiting distant locations. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|AbstractMannose-binding lectin (MBL), a pattern-recognition {{molecule}} in serum, recognizes specific hexose sugars rich in mannose and N-acetylglucosamine on bacterium, yeasts, viruses {{as well as}} apoptotic cells. It {{has been}} well-identified that MBL has antiviral effects via binding to seasonal influenza H 1 and H 3 subtype viruses. Influenza A (H 7 N 9) virus, a novel reassortant virus to human population, possesses the surface hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from duck and wild-bird influenza viruses and internal genes from <b>poultry</b> <b>H</b> 9 N 2 viruses. As of Dec 7 th, 2014, a total of 467 human infections and 183 fatal cases have been identified. Here, recombinant human (rh) MBL was tested for its binding and effects on hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and NA activity inhibition (NAI) of avian H 7 N 9, H 9 N 2 and human H 3 N 2 viruses. We discovered that rhMBL exhibited a strong binding to H 7 N 9 virus as human H 3 N 2 did at high virus titers. However, it performed a significantly weaker HI activity effect on H 7 N 9 comparing to those of H 3 N 2 and H 9 N 2, even {{at a much higher}} concentration (3. 67  ±  0. 33 vs. 0. 026  ±  0. 001 and 0. 083  ±  0. 02  μg/mL, respectively). Similarly, minor NAI effect of rhMBL, even at up to 10  μg/mL, was found on H 7 N 9 virus while it displayed significant effects on both H 3 N 2 and H 9 N 2 at a lowest concentration of 0. 0807  ±  0. 009 and 0. 0625  μg/mL, respectively. The HI and NAI effects of rhMBL were calcium-dependent and mediated by lectin domain. Our findings suggest that MBL, the host innate molecule, has differential interference effects with human and avian influenza virus and limited antiviral effect against H 7 N 9 virus...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A novel avian-origin {{influenza}} A/H 7 N 9 virus infecting humans {{was first}} identified inMarch 2013 and, as of 30 May 2013, has caused 132 human infections leading to 33 deaths. Phylogenetic {{studies suggest that}} this virus is a reassortant, with the surface hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes being derived from duck and wild-bird viruses, respectively, while the six “internal gene segments ” were derived from <b>poultry</b> <b>H</b> 9 N 2 viruses. Here we determine the pathogenicity of a human A/Shanghai/ 2 / 2013 (Sh 2 /H 7 N 9) virus in healthy adult mice in comparison with that of A/chicken/Hong Kong/HH 8 / 2010 (ck/ H 9 N 2) virus, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/Hong Kong/ 483 / 1997 (483 /H 5 N 1) virus, and a duck influenza A H 7 N 9 virus of different genetic derivation, A/duck/Jiangxi/ 3286 / 2009 (dk/H 7 N 9). Intranasal infection of mice with Sh 2 /H 7 N 9 virus doses of 103, 104, and 105 PFU led to significant weight loss without fatality. This virus was more pathogenic than dk/H 7 N 9 and ck/H 9 N 2 virus, which has six internal gene segments that are genetically similar to Sh 2 /H 7 N 9. Sh 2 /H 7 N 9 replicated well in the nasal cavity and lung, {{but there was no}} evidence of virus dissemination beyond the respiratory tract. Mice infected with Sh 2 / H 7 N 9 produced higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the lung and serum than did ck/H 9 N 2 and dk/H 7 N 9 but lower levels than 483 /H 5 N 1. Cytokine induction was positively correlated with virus load in the lung at early stages of infection. Our results suggest that Sh 2 /H 7 N 9 virus is able to replicate and cause disease in mice without prior adaptation but is less pathogenic than 483 /H 5 N 1 virus. IMPORTANCE AnH 7 N 9 virus isolate causing fatal human disease was found to be more pathogenic for mice than other avia...|$|R
40|$|The {{transmission}} of influenza A viruses from avian to other species involves numerous adaptive processes {{to overcome the}} species barrier. One major determinant of host-range restriction is the viral hemagglutinin (HA). HA {{plays a crucial role}} in virus entry into the host cell by mediating receptor-binding and membrane fusion. Virus adaptation to mammals results in alteration of receptor-binding specificity. There is growing evidence that the HA-mediated membrane fusion activity contributes to host range restriction as well. This study aimed to identify host specific differences in membrane fusion properties and to characterise potential alterations during interspecies transmission. In {{the first part of the}} thesis Eurasian avian-like swine viruses that emerged by {{transmission of}} an avian H 1 N 1 virus in pigs in the late 1970 s in Europe were shown to have a higher pH optimum of HA-mediated fusion (pH 5. 1 - 5. 4) and a decreased HA stability when compared to avian precursors (pH 4. 9 - 5. 2). These results indicate that this avian-to-swine transmission was accompanied by changes in HA stability. Sequence comparison revealed eight amino acid substitutions that separate the HA of early avian-like swine viruses from their putative avian precursor. Furthermore, mutations in one of these positions contribute to the low stability phenotype. In agreement with natural avian-to-swine transmission, experimental adaptation of a potential avian precursor of the avian-like swine lineage to pigs resulted in a decreased HA stability. This states the first formal proof that viral membrane fusion and stability properties change during interspecies transmission. The second part of the thesis investigated differences in membrane fusion activity among different avian virus species. Comparison of H 7 viruses from wild birds and domestic poultry suggests that Eurasian <b>H</b> 7 <b>poultry</b> viruses have a higher pH optimum of membrane fusion (pH 6. 2) and thus possess a lower stability than H 7 viruses from wild birds (pH 5. 2). Moreover, all tested Eurasian H 7 viruses express a lower HA stability than HAs from other subtypes (H 2, H 3, H 4, H 5, H 13, H 14 und H 16). Previous studies indicate that H 5 viruses with low HA stability replicate but do not transmit via respiratory droplets in the ferret model (Imai et al., 2012; Herfst et al., 2012). Thus, it is feasible, that H 7 viruses originated from poultry are restricted in ferrets and humans to similar extend. In the last part, fusion properties of human pandemic and zoonotic viruses were studied. HAs of pandemic viruses from the last century initiated fusion in a narrow pH range between pH 5. 0 and 5. 2. In contrast, the swine-origin 2009 pandemic virus HA starts to fuse at a pH 0. 2 units higher, which might be due to the swine origin of this HA. This further suggests that fusion characteristics continue to adapt in the course of subsequent circulation. The pH optimum of fusion of a zoonotic human H 7 N 9 (2013) virus represents an intermediate in that it is lower when compared to putative ancestors circulating in wild birds, but still higher than that of typical human-adapted viruses. This may account for limited human-to-human transmission observed for this virus. In order to further investigate which changes in HA are needed for the emergence of avian viruses in humans, HA substitutions separating the 1968 Hong Kong pandemic virus HA from the putative avian precursor were examined. In addition to the well-known switch in receptor specificity, binding avidity changed prior to or during the emergence in humans. In this study, no difference in viral stability was observed between the pandemic virus and the putative avian precursor. This indicates that the avian ancestor was already sufficiently stable to facilitate replication and transmission in humans. In sum, this study shows that membrane fusion properties vary between host species and alter during influenza A virus emergence in new hosts. This suggests HA-mediated fusion and HA stability to act as host range restriction factors. Alterations in membrane fusion activity and viral stability may not be essential for initial infection of new host individuals. However, an optimal stability seems to be necessary to facilitate transmission within populations of new host species...|$|R
