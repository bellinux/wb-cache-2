The <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> the oil pipeline was filmed in Cwm Dyli, Snowdonia, Wales, while the production teams shot the oil pipeline explosion in Hankley Common, Elstead, Surrey. Istanbul, Turkey, was indeed used in the film and Elektra King's Baku villa was actually in the city, also using the famous Maiden's Tower which was used as Renard's hideout in Turkey. The underwater submarine scenes were filmed in The Bahamas.|$|E

5|$|Production was centred at Pinewood Studios and {{principal}} photography began there on 11 January 1999 with scenes {{from inside the}} MI6 offices, designed by Peter Lamont. The pre-title sequence was shot in Bilbao, Spain, in February, with production moving to Chamonix, France, which doubled for the Caucasus scenes.

5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{predominantly}} military character, {{the castle}} {{is one of}} the few sites where Crusader art (in the form of frescoes) has been preserved. In 1935, 1955, and 1978 medieval frescoes were discovered within Krak des Chevaliers after later plaster and white-wash had decayed. The frescos were painted on the interior and <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> the main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance, which no longer survives. Writing in 1982, historian Jaroslav Folda noted that at the time there had been little investigation of Crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at Krak des Chevaliers. Those in the chapel were painted on the masonry from the 1170–1202 rebuild. Mold, smoke, and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes. The fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel means they are difficult to assess. The one on the <b>exterior</b> <b>of</b> the chapel depicted the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple.|$|E
40|$|The idea {{to compute}} the <b>exterior</b> degree <b>of</b> a finite group G started in 2011. The <b>exterior</b> degree <b>of</b> a group is the {{probability}} that two randomly selected elements x and y in the group such that x ∧ y = 1 and denoted as P̂(G). However, {{in order to examine}} the <b>exterior</b> degree <b>of</b> a finite group, the nonabelian tensor square and some homological functors of the group must first be explored and determined. The homological functors that are used in determining the <b>exterior</b> degree <b>of</b> G are ∇(G) and the <b>exterior</b> square <b>of</b> G. In this research, the nonabelian tensor square, ∇(G) and the <b>exterior</b> square <b>of</b> symmetric group of order six are determined. Then, the <b>exterior</b> degree <b>of</b> symmetric group of order six is computed...|$|R
