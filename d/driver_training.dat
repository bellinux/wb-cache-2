5|$|To {{some extent}} {{this is due}} to {{geography}} and <b>driver</b> <b>training,</b> but more rigorous impaired driving enforcement and severe penalties in Sweden for driving under the influence may also explain the difference. While it might be argued that highways and vehicles in Sweden are different from those in the United States, the U.S. fatality rate is also about double the rate in the Canadian province of Ontario, which experienced 3.6 road fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km according to preliminary 2014 data. Ontario, which is a vast province of more than 1 million square kilometers, has a similar mix of highway types including congested urban and rural highways. Ontario also has a similar mix of large transport trucks essentially identical to U.S. transport trucks, full-sized pickup trucks, SUVs and passenger cars, although there may be more small cars driven in Ontario compared to the United States. This suggests that differences in fatality rates are due to non-physical factors such as driver behavior.|$|E
5|$|On 13 May 2015, {{the first}} test train, DRS Class 37 604 with DBSO 9702, worked the 1Q13 Tweedbank-Millerhill. On 4 June 2015, a {{ceremony}} was held at Edinburgh Waverley to mark {{the final stages of}} the completion of works during which Madge Elliot, a veteran campaigner and founder member of the Campaign for Borders Rail, had Class 66 528 renamed in her honour. Official completion and handover of the line to the ScotRail Alliance, a group formed by Network Rail and Abellio ScotRail, took place on 14 June 2015. A 12-week period of <b>driver</b> <b>training</b> for 64 drivers and 64 guards began on 7 June 2015, with Abellio ScotRail Class 170 170414 in livery promoting the new line undertaking a proving run to measure stepping distances from platforms to trains. The train, which carried a large number of Network Rail staff, stopped at all stations from Newcraighall to Tweedbank in the presence of large crowds of spectators. The following day Class 158 158741 was used for the first driver-training runs. On 26 July 2015, a driver-training train carried Borders rail campaigner Madge Elliot. The Borders Railway was named the Scottish infrastructure project of 2016 by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.|$|E

25|$|It {{took some}} time for the {{regiment}} to form {{and by the end}} of the first week of the regiment's existence there were only a total of 107 men on its books at Ingleburn. Initial training was only very rudimentary in nature, consisting mainly of drill and basic signals. Lacking vehicles, at the outset only limited <b>driver</b> <b>training</b> could be undertaken using private vehicles. Finally, on 13 November a quantity of weapons arrived for individual training and two days later a number utility vehicles and lorries arrived. More involved signals and <b>driver</b> <b>training</b> followed and on 23 November, the regiment was inspected by the divisional commander, Lieutenant General Thomas Blamey.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Whole body {{vibration}} {{exposure of the}} <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> working for State Railway Lines is assessed by referring to ISO standard 2631 - 1 and EU directive 2002 / 44 /EC. The vibration measurements were done in the cabins of suburban and intercity <b>train</b> <b>drivers.</b> Suburban <b>train</b> <b>driver</b> performs his job usually in standing posture. Whereas intercity <b>train</b> <b>driver</b> works generally in seated (bending forward) posture and exposed to longer periods of continuous vibration, compared to suburban <b>train</b> <b>drivers.</b> The mean accelerations, a, along lateral, y, and vertical, z, directions measured on the driver seat (on the cabin floor) of the intercity (suburban) train were 1. 4 a y = 0. 55 (0. 28) m/s 2 and a z = 0. 65 (0. 23) m/s 2. Daily exposure action values suggested in EU directive are exceeded in case of intercity <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> and their exposure falls within the health caution zone of ISO 2631 - 1. Intercity <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> are therefore under {{the risk of having}} spinal disorders. A health surveillance plan requiring every five years the reassessment {{of the state of the}} spinal system of <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> is suggested. As an early preventive measure, extended work day or more than one shift in a day is advised to be discouraged...|$|R
