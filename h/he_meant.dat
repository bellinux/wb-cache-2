Pramono, writing for Tempo, notes that the film presents a different side of Dahlan, who is usually portrayed as an old, bearded man who, in his opinion, seems neither modernist nor progressive.|$|E

While at the clinic he tells her he supports her, and that when he said {{that he wanted to be}} a grandfather, <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> sometime far in the future. The two agree that this is one of the nicest Valentine's Days they have ever had. After the abortion, Max takes Donna to his home where he makes her tea, and then they watch Gone with the Wind together.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna {{gets into}} trouble after she is misquoted in Maxim magazine, {{allegedly}} {{saying that she}} hates the troops.

During the interview, Jenna confuses Osama bin Laden and then-Senator Barack Obama, who was running for the Democratic Party nomination for President.

5|$|The Athenians {{and their}} allies chose a {{location}} for the battle, with marshes and mountainous terrain, that prevented the Persian cavalry from joining the main Persian army. Miltiades, the Athenian general, ordered a general attack against the Persian infantry-bowmen. He reinforced his flanks, luring the Persians' best fighters into his center. The inward wheeling flanks enveloped the Persians, routing them. The Persian army broke in panic towards their ships, and large numbers were slaughtered. The defeat at Marathon {{marked the end of}} the first Persian invasion of Greece, and the Persian force retreated to Asia. Darius then began raising a huge new army with which <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. After Darius died, his son Xerxes I restarted the preparations for a second invasion of Greece, which finally began in 480 BC.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army with which <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> to completely subjugate Greece. However, he died {{before the invasion}} could begin. The throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I, who quickly resumed the preparations for the invasion of Greece, including building two pontoon bridges across the Hellespont. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water {{as a gesture of}} their submission, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta (both of whom were at open war with Persia). Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed (hereafter referred to as 'the Allies'). This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.|$|E

Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and {{the throne of}} Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece. Since {{this was to be}} a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription. Xerxes decided that the Hellespont would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state. By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges.|$|E

According to Herodotus, Xerxes' army was so large that, upon arriving at the banks of the Echeidorus River, his soldiers proceeded to drink it dry. In the face of such imposing numbers, many Greek cities capitulated to the Persian demand for a tribute of earth and water.|$|E
25|$|If {{civilian}} control {{is the critical}} variable for military effectiveness, it {{raises the question of}} how {{civilian control}} is then to be determined. Huntington identified two shaping forces or imperatives for civilian control – (1) functional and (2) societal. He broke the societal imperative into two components, ideology and structure. By ideology, <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> a world-view or paradigm: liberal anti-military, conservative pro-military, fascist pro-military, and Marxist anti-military. By structure, <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> the legal-constitutional framework that guided political affairs generally and civil-military affairs specifically.|$|E
