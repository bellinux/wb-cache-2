6000|$|But {{there could}} be no mistaking the quality of Sir Isaac's [...] "International" [...] {{organization}} as Susan's dabs of speech shaped it out. It was indeed what we all of us see everywhere about us, the work of the base energetic mind, raw and untrained, in possession of the keen instruments of civilization, the peasant mind allied and blended with the Ghetto mind, grasping and acquisitive, clever as a Norman peasant or a Jew pedlar is clever, and beyond that outrageously stupid and ugly. It was a new view and yet the old familiar view of her husband, but now she saw him not as little eager eyes, a sharp nose, gaunt gestures and a leaden complexion, but as shops and stores and rules and cash registers and harsh advertisements and a driving merciless hurry to get--to get anything and everything, money, monopoly, power, prominence, whatever any other human being seemed to admire or seemed to find desirable, a lust rather than a living soul. Now that her eyes were at last opened Lady Harman, who had seen too little heretofore, now saw too much; she saw all that she had not seen, with an excess of vision, monstrous, caricatured. Susan had already dabbed in the disaster of Sir Isaac's unorganized competitors going to the wall--for charity or the state to neglect or bandage as it might chance--the figure of that poor little [...] "Father," [...] moping hopelessly before his [...] "accident" [...] symbolized that; and now she gave in vivid splotches of allusion, glimpses of the business machine that had replaced those shattered enterprises and carried Sir Isaac to the squalid glory of a Liberal honours list,--the carefully balanced antagonisms and jealousies of the girls and the manageresses, those manageresses who had been obliged to invest little bunches of savings as guarantees and who had to account for every crumb and particle of <b>food</b> <b>stock</b> that came to the branch, and the hunt for cases and inefficiency by the inspectors, who had somehow to justify a salary of two hundred a year, not to mention a percentage of the fines they inflicted.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of public}} <b>food</b> <b>stocks</b> for <b>food</b> {{security}} purposes is a hotly debated topic in agricultural negotiations within the World Trade Organization (WTO) (see Díaz-Bonilla, 2014, 2017 a and 2017 b). That debate needs to consider both the legal standing of public <b>food</b> <b>stocks</b> under the WTO framework, but, also, the more substantive issue of whether those instruments make sense in economic terms, particularly whether {{they are the best}} option to achieve food security. In this chapter I discuss briefly both aspects, starting with the economic considerations and then moving on to legal issues (a more detailed discussion of both topics can be found in Díaz-Bonilla, 2013, 2014, 2017 a and 2017 b).

40|$|This review {{examines}} {{the question whether}} the cumulative amount of benthic biomass removed by feeding shorebirds on a certain intertidal area {{is limited by the}} renewal rate of benthic <b>food</b> <b>stocks.</b> Limitations of current methods to estimate both predatory impact by shorebirds and harvestable benthic secondary productivity are discussed first. A heuristic model is then presented which summarises all the known interrelated causal processes (mechanisms) that connect <b>food</b> <b>stocks</b> and shorebird predation. Since the majority of terms in the model are operational, it is possible to translate them into a simulation-model for a specific predator-prey situation. Any influence of benthic <b>food</b> <b>stocks</b> on densities of feeding shorebirds works via the predator's selection of acceptable prey (i. e. availability and profitability). Short-term densities of feeding shorebirds are thus limited directly by the density of acceptable prey. Cumulative shorebird predation may be limited by the production of acceptable biomass, which is argued to be the crucial measurement to make to investigate whether benthic food supply limits shorebird predation in the long term. The heuristic model presented here can be modified to apply to other trophic systems. ...|$|R
