This paper develops dc impedance models for the rectifier and <b>inverter</b> <b>stations</b> for a VSC-HVDC system when they are viewed from a dc terminal.

The derived impedance models are validated by comparing frequency responses of the analytical model and the impedance measured at the dc terminal from a detailed VSC-HVDC model simulated in a real-time digital simulator. Reso-nances are examined in frequency domain (e. g., Bode plots and Nyquist plots) using the derived analytical impedance models. The analysis is verified by time-domain simulations. Real-time digital simulation in RT-Lab demonstrates that the dc capacitor has {{a significant impact on}} resonances while power transfer level has an insignificant impact on resonances...|$|R
30|$|Controlling {{short circuit}} current and {{increasing}} power system stability is a contradiction [21]. The application of current limiting measures will change the power grid structure, and then affect the voltage support capability of AC system to multiple DCs [22]. Specifically, the current limiting measures, on the one hand, reduce {{short circuit current}}, on the other hand, stretch the electrical distance between DC <b>inverter</b> <b>stations.</b> As a result, the multi-infeed short-circuit ratio may be increased or decreased under different conditions. This fact indicates that there exists a coordinated optimization scheme, which can not only control short circuit current within a reasonable range, but also remain the multi-infeed short-circuit ratio at a high level. Such scheme should be obtained by establishing and solving the multi-objective optimization model. Unfortunately, most researches {{pay attention to the}} single-objective optimization for the cost of current limiting measures, and there are still no literatures that consider the influence of current limiting measures on the multi-infeed DC system.|$|R
30|$|Multiple DC infeed {{is another}} {{important}} feature of the receiving-end power grid in China. From theoretical analysis and simulation, {{it is found that}} the biggest risk faced by the multi-infeed DC system is the voltage stability problem [14, 15, 16]. The short-circuit ratio was given to evaluate the voltage support capability of AC system to DC system in [17]. This index has not considered the interaction of multiple DCs, thus it is applicable to the system with just one DC. Reference [18] suggested an extension of the classical short-circuit ratio to multi-infeed DC systems, named the multi-infeed short-circuit ratio. This new index considers the AC system short circuit capacity, the multiple DC transmission capacity, and the electrical coupling relationship between DC <b>inverter</b> <b>stations.</b> Reference [19] showed that it is effective to use such new index for denoting the voltage stability level of the multi-infeed DC system. Reference [20] predicted the risk for voltage and power instability when the multi-infeed short-circuit ratio is low.|$|R

The outputs are connected to a fixed-voltage DC-bus. The last model has a bipolar PV generator with a maximum voltage of +/- 1500 VDC. With the last two models an output voltage of 1000 VAC can be realized. This leads to the maximum utilization of the voltage levels according to the European Low Voltage Directive [1]. As the simulation shows that for all models, the power electronic concepts with efficiencies of more than 98 % are possible.
