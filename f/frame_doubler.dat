50|$|The <b>frames</b> are <b>doubled</b> (from a 25 frame source) on {{broadcast}} (to avoid flicker) {{for display}} devices that lack {{any kind of}} <b>frame</b> <b>doubling</b> ability. Widescreen 16:9 material has only the width scaled down to fit 720 pixels instead of an unscaled 1024 width. SMPTE 344M defines a 576p50 standard with twice the data rate of BT.601, using 704 × 576 active pixels with 16 x 576 horizontal blanking pixels.|$|R
50|$|With doubled {{temporal}} resolution, 480p60 {{is considered}} enhanced-definition television (EDTV). It can be transported by both major digital television formats, ATSC and DVB. The <b>frames</b> are <b>doubled</b> (from either a 30 frame or 24 frame pull-down source) on broadcast (to avoid flicker) for display devices that lack {{any kind of}} <b>frame</b> <b>doubling</b> ability. Widescreen 16:9 material has only the width scaled down to fit 720 pixels instead of an unscaled 848 width.|$|R

50|$|SDTV refresh rates can be 24, 25, 30, 50 or 60 frames {{per second}} with a {{possible}} rate multiplier of 1000/1001 for NTSC timing accuracy. 50 and 60 rates are generally <b>frame</b> <b>doubled</b> versions of 25 and 30 rates for jitter issues when using non-interlaced lines.|$|R
2500|$|The 501 was an all-new platform, with a {{perimeter}} <b>frame,</b> <b>double</b> A-arm front suspension with {{torsion bar}} springs, and a live axle with torsion bar springs at the rear.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to study the effect of post {{tensioned}} cables on strengthening steel frames and improving their load carrying capacity, giving more resistance against the external load (dead plus live or wind load). Different types of frames are analyzed: simple <b>frame,</b> <b>double</b> bay <b>frame</b> and <b>double</b> story <b>frame.</b> The analysis and the results are obtained using ANSYS finite element (FE) program. Different techniques were used to apply post tensioning to steel frame. Comparisons are made between these techniques to determine which technique is better in strengthening each type of frame. The results show that using post tensioned cables increases significantly the load capacity of the steel frame...|$|R
50|$|The Edward W. Haviland House is a {{historic}} home located at Port Deposit, Cecil County, Maryland, United States. It is a -story, 12-room, stuccoed frame building constructed in 1913 in the Dutch Colonial style. In 1926, a large <b>frame</b> <b>double</b> garage and carriage house was built {{to the rear of}} the main house. The house was designed by architect Charles J. McDowell.|$|R
5000|$|Modern video formats utilize {{a variety}} of frame rates. Due to the mains {{frequency}} of electric grids, analog television broadcast was developed with frame rates of 50 Hz or 60 Hz, sometimes with video being interlaced so more motion information could be sent on the same available broadcast bandwidth, and sometimes with video being broadcast at 25 or 30 fps with each <b>frame</b> <b>doubled.</b> Film, which was almost universally shot at 24 frames per second, could not be displayed at its native frame rate, which required pulldown conversion, often leading to [...] "judder": to convert 24 frames per second into 60 frames per second, every odd <b>frame</b> is <b>doubled</b> and every even frame is tripled, which creates uneven motion. Other conversions have similar uneven <b>frame</b> <b>doubling.</b> Newer video standards support 120, 240, or 300 frames per second, allowing frames to be evenly multiplied for common frame rates such as 24 fps film and 30 fps video, as well as 25 and 50 fps video {{in the case of}} 300 fps displays. These standards also support video that's natively in higher frame rates, and video with interpolated frames between its native frames. Some modern films are experimenting with frame rates higher than 24 fps, such as 48 and 60 fps.|$|R

5000|$|Initial {{commentary}} largely <b>framed</b> <b>Double</b> Fine as exceptional, citing Double Fine's reputation, {{experience with}} the under-serviced genre, and history of difficulty with publisher funding as reasons why Double Fine's case was unique. Initially, many remained skeptical that such a level of success could be replicated. Schafer further agreed {{that the success of}} the Double Fine Kickstarter would be somewhat difficult to replicate for other games, even for Double Fine, as it would require the project to be [...] "a good story for people to get behind".|$|R

50|$|Eleanor Roosevelt, who {{screened}} {{the area}} {{off from the}} Central Hall, particularly enjoyed it. In the subsequent Truman reconstruction, architects enclosed the hall with solid partitions and created a living room. At that time, the kitchen elevator was extended to this floor, and the door opened into this room; the Kennedy restoration rerouted it into the little hall when {{the room to the}} north was converted into the Family Kitchen. During the Truman reconstruction the east wall was rebuilt to include <b>framed</b> <b>double</b> doors allowing the room more privacy.|$|R
50|$|As EDTV signals {{require more}} {{bandwidth}} (due to <b>frame</b> <b>doubling)</b> than is feasible with SDTV connection standards (such as composite video, SCART or S-Video), higher bandwidth media {{must be used}} to accommodate the additional data transfer. To achieve EDTV, consumer electronic devices such as a progressive scan DVD player or modern video game consoles must be connected through at least a component video cable (typically using 3 RCA cables for video), a VGA connector, or a DVI or HDMI connector. For over-the-air television broadcasts, EDTV content uses the same connectors as HDTV.|$|R

50|$|A new Harris “Matchless G80” single was {{released}} in 1987 powered by an Austrian Rotax 4-stroke, single over-head cam (SOHC), 500 cc engine.

The model was offered in colours of silver, black or metallic burgundy. Although electric start and twin disc brakes were options, priced at £2700 (£500 more than a Yamaha motorcycle of similar specification), {{this was not a}} successful product and production ended by the early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|In other words, {{double top}} twins and double bottom twins are with-trend signals, when the {{underlying}} short time <b>frame</b> <b>double</b> tops or double bottoms (reversal signals) fail. The price action trader predicts that other traders {{trading on the}} shorter time scale will trade the simple double top or double bottom, and if the market moves against them, the price action trader will take a position against them, placing an entry stop order 1 tick above the top or below the bottom, {{with the aim of}} benefitting from the exacerbated market movement caused by those trapped traders bailing out.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{features}} include a fanlight and sidelights <b>framing</b> <b>double</b> paneled front doors, original false graining on all original doors, original marbleizing on surviving mantels, and handwriting (including notes, poems and other records) on walls throughout the house, with the earliest dating to 1870. The nearby Old Bridgeport Road {{is a registered}} Mississippi Landmark. The current site has had a variety of uses, first as a Native American camp, later as Hall's Plantation, which was occupied by Union troops on numerous occasions during the Civil War, and finally {{as the center of}} an African American tenant farming community.|$|R
