A large wave like an eagre, diverging from its bow, was extending to either bank, swamping the tules {{and threatening to}} submerge the lower levees. The great boat itself--a vast but delicate structure of airy stories, hanging galleries, fragile colonnades, gilded cornices, and resplendent frescoes--was throbbing throughout its whole perilous length with the pulse of high pressure and the strong monotonous beat of a powerful piston. Floods of <b>foam</b> <b>pouring</b> from the high paddle-boxes on either side and reuniting {{in the wake of}} the boat left behind a track of dazzling whiteness, over which trailed two dense black banners flung from its lofty smokestacks.|$|E

This Requiem Publishing production was film in Los Angeles and New York for three days — one for Farmer, the two others for the extras — and cost about 80,000 euros. In addition to the version broadcast on television, there was another video of [...] "Instant X" [...] {{that was the first}} editing which contains only Farmer's unpublished shots. The producer Anouk Nora explained: [...] "We shot video in February with -10 degrees celsius in New York. Mylène was completely frozen and took a bath in foam as if she was under the Tropics". Some video's photos were touched up by American rock group The Third Eye Foundation that used them on the cover of its album I Poo Poo on Your Juju. The small towel worn by Farmer was made by French fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier. Farmer explained that she liked the idea of the <b>foam</b> <b>pouring</b> as it reminded her parties in Ibiza.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{presents}} the results of a survey performed to investigate whether different patterns of foam and lacing affect consumer beer preference and the perception of beer characteristics. The impact of three different levels of foam (huge, medium and little) at pouring, and two lacing patterns (very laced to not laced) during consumption, was evaluated on a set of 26 attributes by a panel of Italian beer consumers. Overall, beers which delivered a medium level of <b>foam</b> at <b>pouring</b> were considered by Italian consumers as the best dispensed, the most liked for their visual appearance, the most attractive to consume and the most likely to be purchased. Cluster analysis determined four groups of consumers with different preference patterns for beer foam and expectations for sensory characteristics of the beer. It was found that 80...|$|R

40|$|Renewable {{polymers}} {{have been}} of increasing interest as replacements for petroleum based products. Here, an efficient, one-pot method of synthesizing renewable, sustainable, and biodegradable polyols from algae oil was developed, demonstrating that Prilezhaev epoxidation with acetic acid and ring-opening with short-chain carboxylic acids can be performed in a single step. Renewable polyols from MCPU Engineering were utilized to create a rigid polyurethane foam surfboard with a weight-by-weight percent renewability of 11 %. Though this foam {{did not have the}} same density or hardness of a benchmark board, the cause of this was determined to be due to additive and processing differences rather than inferior polyols. Tests manipulating the additives and <b>foam</b> <b>pouring</b> process are currently underway. A method of measuring polyol hydroxyl number to within 5 % using Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy was also developed, which presented a faster, less expensive, and more environmentally-conscious alternative to current methods...|$|E

This high-pressure, plural-component polyurethane <b>foam</b> <b>pouring</b> system {{will be used to}} fill process gas and non-process equipment/piping (PGE/P) within the K- 25 /K- 27 Buildings with polyurethane foam to immobilize contaminants prior to removal. The system creates foam by mixing isocyanate and polyol resin (Resin) component materials. Currently, the project plans to utilize up to six foaming units simultaneously during peak foaming activities. Also included in this system description are the foam component material storage containers that will be used for storage of the component material drums in a staging area outside of the K- 25 /K- 27 Buildings.

40|$|Project (M. S., Computer Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Beer foam is a {{major source}} of waste in most bars today. An average bar will lose close to 10, 000 a year due to beer waste. Automated Beverage Dispensers attempt to {{eliminate}} this waste, however most fail due to the inability to prevent excess amounts of beer <b>foam</b> during <b>pouring</b> of a beer. The root cause of beer foam is best described by Henry???s Law which describes the relationship between the solubility of a gas in a liquid due to temperature and pressure. 	Automated Beverage Dispensers currently regulate pressure however they do not control the beverage temperature; this must be regulated in order to eliminate beer foam. The beverage temperature can be regulated by an Automated Beverage Dispenser {{through the use of a}} custom computer controlled heat exchanging system. This heat exchanging system combines hardware, software, and mechanical components in a way that is energy efficient, environmentally safe, and cost effective. In the context of an Automated Beverage Dispenser this integrated solution holds temperature and pressure constant thus eliminating beer waste due to foam. Computer Engineerin...|$|R
60|$|It was {{the first}} Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more amazed than terrified, {{watching}} this Titan advancing deliberately towards the shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell away. Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another, striding over some stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther off, wading deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between sea and sky. They were all stalking seaward, as if to intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between Foulness and the Naze. In spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the little paddle-boat, and the <b>pouring</b> <b>foam</b> that her wheels flung behind her, she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance.|$|R
40|$|International audienceCasting techniques, which {{consist in}} infiltrating a porous network by a metal, enable to make cheap metal foams with very regular cell shape. To {{make a right}} <b>foamed</b> part, the <b>pouring</b> device has to be sized {{with a number of}} gates {{sufficient}} to fill completely the porous network before metal solidification. Nevertheless, the number of gates must be as low as possible for economical reasons. As a consequence, it is necessary to estimate the length of network that can be infiltrated from one gate to optimize the pouring device. In this article, a model to predict the length of porous network that can be infiltrated by the metal before solidifying is presented. It considers fluid mechanics and thermal aspects separately. Its predictions are compared with experimental measures {{in the case of the}} infiltration of a chloride sodium preform by an AlSi 10 Mg alloy...|$|R
40|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} wine {{produced}} in England and Wales is traditional method sparkling wine. English Sparkling Wine (ESW) {{has gained a}} good international reputation for quality, and maintaining this standard {{is critical to the}} UK wine industry. Effervescence and foamability are key features used to assess ESW quality. A critical, yet understudied, area of research is the potential for dosage to influence foam behaviour via associated changes in wine viscosity. In this project, dosage treatments of increasing levels of sucrose (5 g/L, 10 g/L, 20 g/L, and 50 g/L,) were added to commercially produced ESW, using commercial dosage practices. After storage for two months, bottles were opened and the foamability attributes of different treatments analyses via two novel foam assessment methods; an adapted Mosalux method and a novel image analysis method, designed to simulate more accurately ‘real world’ serving conditions when assessing foam behaviour. General wine chemical parameters as well as the wine dynamic viscosity were also measured. Results indicated that increasing sucrose concentration at dosage resulted in an improved foam formation, but reduced foam stability. As expected, sucrose increased wine viscosity and we hypothesised that this change could be the major driver for the observed alterations in foam behaviour. These results give an important insight into the impact that dosage treatments can have on the quality of <b>foam</b> produced upon <b>pouring,</b> and therefore have the potential to inform future sparkling winemaking practice...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tests on cold-formed steel foamed {{concrete}} (CSFC) composite walls subjected to axial load were proposed. The {{primary purpose of the}} experiments was to study the mechanical behavior and identify the failure modes of CSFC composite walls. Two main factors were considered in this study: 1) specimen with <b>pouring</b> <b>foamed</b> concrete or without and 2) different foamed concrete density ranks (corresponding to different foamed concrete strength). The interior space between two pieces of straw board of the specimen W- 2 and W- 3 were poured foamed concrete, and the specimen W- 1 does not have foamed concrete core. The foamed concrete density rank of the specimen W- 2 was A 05 grade, and that of the specimen W- 3 was A 07 grade. Results showed that the failure mode of CSFC composite wall without foamed concrete was distortional buckling of cold-formed steel (CFS) column, and that poured foamed concrete includes the local crushing of foamed concrete and local buckling of CFS column, but the former prior to the later. Compared with CSFC composite wall without foamed concrete, the ultimate bearing capacity of spec imens poured A 05 grade and A 07 grade foamed concrete increased 1. 6 times and 2. 2 times respectively, and specimen poured foamed concrete had a low vertical deformation. According to these results, the simplified calculation formula for the CSFC wall subjected to axial load was proposed, and the calculated results from this formula are in very good agreement with the test results...|$|R
