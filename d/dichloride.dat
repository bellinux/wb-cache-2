5|$|Ruthenium forms a {{wide range}} {{compounds}} with carbon-ruthenium bonds. Grubbs' catalyst is used for alkene metathesis. Ruthenocene is analogous to ferrocene structurally, but exhibits distinctive redox properties.

Ruthenium trichloride reacts with carbon monoxide to give many derivatives including RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and Ru(CO)2(PPh3)3 (Roper's complex). Heating solutions of ruthenium trichloride in alcohols with triphenylphosphine gives tris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium <b>dichloride</b> (RuCl2(PPh3)3), which converts to the hydride complex chlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) (RuHCl(PPh3)3).|$|E

Thermodynamic properties {{of all the}} oxides and trichlorides (LnCl(3)) {{are available in the}} literature. However, data for oxychlorides (LnOCl) and <b>dichlorides</b> (LnCl(2)) are limited. Based on systematic trends in stability of these compounds across the lanthanide series, missing data are estimated to construct the diagrams for 13 Ln-O-Cl systems at 1000 K. All the lanthanide elements form stable LnCl(3) and LnOCl. <b>Dichlorides</b> of Nd, Sm, Eu, Dy, Tm and Yb are stable. For systems in which <b>dichlorides</b> are unstable (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Gd, Tb, Ho, Er), the LnOCl is in equilibrium with the metal (Ln) and the stability field of LnOCl is sandwiched between those of oxides and trichlorides. Stability field diagrams of lanthanide systems forming stable LnCl(2) are of two kinds: in the first kind (Ln = Nd, Dy) the stability fields of Ln and LnOCl are in contact and the stability field of LnOCl separates the fields of chlorides and oxides. In diagrams of the second kind (Ln = Sm, Eu, Tm, Yb) there is a direct equilibrium between the oxides and <b>dichlorides</b> at low partial pressures of oxygen and chlorine. There is no contact between the stability fields of Ln and LnOCl; the stability field of LnOCl intervenes between the oxide and chloride phases only at higher partial pressures...|$|R

One of the ligands was already described in the literature, while the other as well as all the prepared group 4 metallocene complexes are new compounds. Starting materials for these syntheses were 6, 6 -dimethylfulvene and spiro[2. 4]hepta- 4, 6 -diene which, upon a nucleophilic attack by 2 -lithio- 2 -methylpropanenitrile, afforded the corresponding substituted lithium cyclopentadienides, which were characterized by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy.

The salt-metathesis reaction of (Mamx) ECl 2 (E = Al, Ga) with dilithioferrocene and dilithioruthenocene yielded strained [1]ferrocenophanes ([1]FCPs) and [1]ruthenocenophanes ([1]RCPs), respectively, with aluminum and gallium as bridging elements. Galla[1]ruthenocenophane was {{isolated from the}} reaction mixture, while other aluminum- and gallium-bridged [1]FCPs and [1]RCPs spontaneously ring-open polymerized under conditions of their formation reactions and produced metallopolymers. Galla[1]ruthenocenophane was polymerized using Karstedt’s catalyst, which yielded poly(ruthenocenylgallane). Aluminum- and gallium-bridged bis(ferrocenyl) species were prepared by reacting lithioferrocene with respective <b>dichlorides.</b> DFT calculations were performed to study the structure and reactivity of these new [1]metallocenophanes. Particularly, {{the role of the}} bulky Mamx ligand and its influence on the high reactivity of these strained sandwich species was investigated. (Mamx) InCl 2 was reacted with dilithioferrocene and resulted in indium-bridged [1]FCP, [1. 1]FCP and oligomers. However, the reaction of (Mamx) InCl 2 with dilithioferrocene, substituted with two isopropyl groups ortho to lithium atoms, resulted in inda[1]ferrocenophane selectively. However, this inda[1]ferrocenophane could not be isolated as it spontaneously polymerized under conditions of its formation reaction.

These <b>dichlorides</b> were utilized to synthesize group- 13 -bridged [1. 1]FCPs and bis(ferrocenyl) species. Bis(ferrocenyl) species with SiMe 2 - and SiEt 2 -bridges were described as well. Two similar species, bis(1 '-bromoferrocenyl) dialkylsilane (alkyl = Me, Et) were also prepared. The reaction of bis(1 '-lithioferrocenyl) dialkylsilane with tin and gallium <b>dichlorides</b> resulted in unsymmetrically bridged [1. 1]FCPs as well as poly(ferrocene) s with two different elements as altering bridges. These poly(ferrocene) s consist of a series of linear and cyclic species. Using either crystallization or column chromatography, some species were isolated. The reactions of dilithioferrocene with dialkyltin <b>dichlorides</b> also yielded polymers that contained a mixture of linear and cyclic species. Some species were isolated by column chromatography. These [1. 1]FCPs, bis(ferrocenyl) species and other isolated species with heavier group 13 and/or group 14 element bridges contained two or more iron redox centers. The electronic communication between these redox centers were investigated using several electrochemical methods...|$|R
