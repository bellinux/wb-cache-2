40|$|Caseins {{comprise}} make {{up about}} 80 % of the total protein content of milk and present polymorphism with change in the amino acid sequence. Within this abundance of proteins, kappa-casein is noteworthy, since it {{has been associated with}} differences in milk yield, composition and processing. The objective {{of this study was to}} observe the existence of polymorphism in the kappa-casein gene in <b>female</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> For this purpose, blood samples from 115 <b>female</b> <b>buffaloes,</b> collected with vacutainer by needle punctionure of the jugular vein, were used. for genomic DNA extraction was done from blood samples. The PCR-RFLP and SSCP techniques demonstrated that the studied animals were monomorphic for the kappa-casein gene. Only allele B was observed in these animals, which was present in homozygosis. Therefore, it was not possible to quantify the gene action on milk yield and its constituents. The monomorphism observed in the population studied would allow the development of a method to identify mixtures of cow and buffalo milk in mozzarella cheese production, especially because, in cattle, the kappa-casein gene is polymorphic.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in buffalo population in Bangladesh by Caudal Fold Tuberculin (CFT) test using bPPD and also by Comparative Cervical Tuberculin (CCT) test using both bPPD and aPPD. The percentage of reactors was 6. 12 % in CFT, whereas the percentage of positive buffaloes was 4. 08 % by CCT method. The percentage of suspicious buffaloes was 10. 20 % by CFT. On the other hand, all the suspicious cases were proved as misleading-false-reactions in CCT. By CCT method, the male buffaloes (6. 25 %) showed more positivity to tuberculosis than the <b>female</b> <b>buffaloes</b> (3. 03 %) of the same area. In contrast, the result found by CFT method was more or less similar (20 %) for both male and <b>female</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> Young buffaloes (6 - 30 months) were more susceptible to tuberculosis than older buffaloes.

50|$|The wayang {{comes in}} sizes from 25 cm to 75 cm. The {{important}} characters are usually represented by several puppets each. The wayang is usually {{made out of}} water buffalo and goat hide and mounted on bamboo sticks. However, the best wayang is typically made from young <b>female</b> <b>buffalo</b> parchment, cured for up to ten years. The carving and punching of the rawhide, which is most responsible for the character's image and the shadows that are cast, are guided by this sketch. A mallet is used to tap special tools, called tatah, to punch the holes through the rawhide. Making the wayang sticks from horn is a complicated process of sawing, heating, hand-molding, and sanding until the desired effect is achieved. When the materials are ready, the artist attaches the handle by precisely molding {{the ends of the}} horn around the individual wayang figure and securing it with thread. A large character may take months to produce.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if Brucella abortus rough mutant strain RB 51 (SRB 51) is eliminated in buffalo milk. Thirty Brucella-free <b>female</b> <b>buffaloes</b> were used in this study: ten 4 – 5 years old were inoculated with the triple of the recommended calfhood dose of SRB 51 by subcutaneous route, ten 2 – 3 years old at the first lactation were previously vaccinated twice as calves with triple the recommended calf dose of RB 51, while five 4 – 5 years old and five 2 – 3 years old not vaccinated Brucella-free <b>female</b> <b>buffaloes</b> served as controls. Milk samples were taken aseptically on a daily basis for the first 30 days and weekly for the second and third months. The samples were inoculated on selective media for isolation of SRB 51 and incubated for 11 days. Moreover, PCR analysis was also performed directly on milk samples. SRB 51 was isolated from milk samples only during the first week post-vaccination while RB 51 DNA was detected during the first week till the fourth week post-vaccination only in water buffaloes vaccinated as adults. The identification of Brucella RB 51 in milk samples, strongly suggests that this Brucella vaccine could be excreted in milk of buffalo cows vaccinated as adults, while our data demonstrate that the vaccine is safe for use in buffaloes vaccinated as calves in which it was not excreted in milk...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{investigated}} why {{males and females}} segregate spatially in sexually dimorphic species. These studies have focused primarily on temperate zone ungulates in areas lacking intact predator communities, and few have directly assessed predation rates in different social environments. Data on the movement, social affiliation, mortality and foraging of radio-collared African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) were collected from 2001 – 06 in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The vast majority of mortality events were due to lion (Panthera leo) predation, and the mortality hazard associated with being an adult male buffalo in a male-only 'bachelor' group was almost four times higher than for adult females in mixed herds. The mortality rates of adult males and females within mixed herds were not statistically different. Mortality sites of male and <b>female</b> <b>buffalo</b> were in areas of low visibility {{similar to those used}} by bachelor groups, while mixed herds tended to use more open habitats. Males in bachelor groups ate similar or higher quality food (as indexed by percentage faecal nitrogen), and moved almost a third less distance per day compared with mixed herds. As a result, males in bachelor groups gained more body condition than did males in breeding herds. Recent comparative analyses suggest the activity-budget hypothesis as a common underlying cause of social segregation. However, our intensive study, in an area with an intact predator community showed that male and <b>female</b> <b>buffalo</b> segregated by habitat and supported the predation-risk hypothesis. Male African buffalo appear to trade increased predation risk for additional energy gains in bachelor groups, which presumably leads to increased reproductive success...|$|E

40|$|Objective This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the microbiological and cellular milk profile for the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in <b>female</b> <b>buffaloes</b> and to assess risk factors for predisposition of the disease. Methods Analyses were carried out by standard plate count (SPC), identification of species and antibiotic resistance, somatic cell count (SCC), electrical electrical conductivity of milk (ECM), and lactoferrin content in milk. Teat cups were swabbed to evaluate risk factors, observing hyperkeratosis, milking vacuum pressure and cleanliness of the site. Hence, 30 <b>female</b> <b>buffaloes</b> were randomly selected (15 from a group in early lactation and 15 in late lactation). Results The most common bacteria in the microbiological examination were Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp. and Corynebacterium sp. In the antibiotic sensitivity test, 10 (58. 82 %) of the 17 antibiotics tested were sensitive to all isolates, and resistant bacteria were Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus haemolyticus, and Escherichia coli. It was observed that positive samples in the microbiological examination showed total bacterial count between 9. 10 × 103 to 6. 94 × 106 colony forming units/mL, SCC between 42, 000 to 4, 320, 000 cells/mL and ECM ranging from 1. 85 to 7. 40 mS/cm. It was {{also found that the}} teat cups had high microbial counts indicating poor hygiene, and even faults in the cleanliness of the animals’ waiting room were observed. It is concluded that values of SCC above 537, 000 cells/mL and ECM above 3. 0 mS/mL are indications of mammary gland infection for this herd; however, the association of these values with a microbiological analysis is necessary to more accurately evaluate the health status of mammary glands with subclinical mastitis. Conclusion Through phenotypic characterization of bacteria involved in the samples, the genera Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Corynebacterimum bovis were the most prevalent in this study. Faults in environment and equipment hygienization are factors that are directly associated with mastitis...|$|R
