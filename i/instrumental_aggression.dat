50|$|Social {{information}} processing theory {{has also been}} {{used to examine the}} development of aggressive behavior in children in recent years. Theories of aggressive behavior and ethological observations in animals and children suggest the existence of distinct forms of reactive (hostile) and proactive (<b>instrumental)</b> <b>aggression.</b> Toward the validation of this distinction, groups of reactive aggressive, proactive aggressive, and nonaggressive children were identified. Social information-processing patterns were assessed in these groups by presenting hypothetical vignettes to subjects.|$|E
5000|$|Sociometric status, {{commonly}} referred as popularity, {{is one of}} the most significant predictors of victimization or bullying as differences in popularity can be associated with differences in social power. It is commonly believed that aggressive adolescents belong to rejected social groups. However, some research shows that they can be popular among their peers. Rodkin et al. (2000), for example, describes two types of popular boys: [...] "model" [...] boys, who are [...] "physically and academically competent, friendly and neither shy nor aggressive." [...] Second type is described as [...] "tough" [...] and such adolescents are [...] "aggressive, physically competent, and average or below average in friendliness, academic competence, and shyness.". Usually the more popular aggressive adolescents use <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> and not reactive aggression. <b>Instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> is defined as behavior that is deliberate and planned while reactive aggression is unplanned and impulsive.Relational aggression can be greatly instrumental for maintaining the popularity status of a group among other groups, as well specific relationship and status dynamics inside a group. Ojala and Nesdale (2004) found that both victims and bullies normally come from rejected groups. Bullies chose to bully students, who are members of their social out-groups that are similar to their own in- group as a result of threatened distinctiveness. Hence, the need to maintain a unique social identity and status can be one of the causes to engage in bullying.Using relational aggression to maintain a particular social order inside the group has been mostly observed in girl groups: if some member of the group becomes too popular and this causes imbalance in the group, other members might start rumors about the overly popular girl to diminish her status.Amanda Rose (2004) claims that the main purpose of using relational aggression in first place is to enhance or maintain one's social status. Many skills that are needed to be popular are also essential for being [...] "successful" [...] at employing relational aggression, e.g. ability to [...] "read" [...] people and adjust one's behavior accordingly, etc. The researcher suggests that some aggressive boys are popular because they are also good at using relational aggression, and, therefore, their primary reason for popularity is not their physical but relational aggression.|$|E

25|$|Aggression {{can have}} {{adaptive}} benefits or negative effects. Aggressive behavior {{is an individual}} or collective social interaction that is a hostile behavior {{with the intention of}} inflicting damage or harm. Two broad categories of aggression are commonly distinguished. One includes affective (emotional) and hostile, reactive, or retaliatory aggression that is a response to provocation, and the other includes instrumental, goal-oriented or predatory, in which aggression is used as a mean to achieve a goal. An example of hostile aggression would be a person who punches someone who insulted him or her. An <b>instrumental</b> form of <b>aggression</b> would be armed robbery. Research on violence from a range of disciplines lend some support to a distinction between affective and predatory aggression. However, some researchers question the usefulness of a hostile versus instrumental distinction in humans, despite its ubiquity in research, because most real-life cases involve mixed motives and interacting causes.|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{aggression}} (RA) {{refers to}} angry responses to provocation or frustration, while proactive aggression (PA) denotes nonemotional, <b>instrumental,</b> and unprovoked <b>aggression.</b> The current study examined personality-related and cognitive correlates of both aggressive types. Respectively, the predictive values of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), and of hostile interpretation bias, {{which is the}} tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli in a hostile manner, were studied. The sample consisted of n = 37 male adult patients with mixed diagnoses and n = 29 male nonpatients that responded to vignettes and pictures of ambiguous situations, using both open and closed answer formats. ASPD was assessed {{by means of the}} Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II disorders (SCID-II), and the Reactive Proactive Questionnaire (RPQ) measured RA and PA.

The moderating role of moral disengagement (MD) was also tested. The findings from structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that impulsivity/irresponsibility was directly related to reactive but not <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression.</b> Grandiosity/manipulation was related to both types of aggressive behavior. Moreover, MD was a significant moderator of these associations. Specifically, the positive relationship between grandiose-manipulative traits and <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> was stronger at high levels of MD. Impulsive-irresponsible traits were positively related to reactive aggression at only low levels of MD and negatively related to <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> at high levels of MD. Overall, our results highlight the enabling role of MD in aggressive behavior and show that this relationship varies for the different traits associated with psychopathy. 17 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} neurocognitive {{models of}} aggression and relates them to explanations of the antisocial personality disorders. Two forms of aggression are distinguished: reactive aggression elicited in response to frustration/threat and goal directed, <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression.</b> It is argued that different forms of neurocognitive model are necessary to explain the emergence of these different forms of aggression. Impairments in executive emotional systems (the somatic marker system or the social response reversal system) are related to reactive aggression shown by patients with "acquired sociopathy" due to orbitofrontal cortex lesions.

40|$|Aggression, as a {{variable}} of psychological study, has {{the hallmarks of}} a deeply ingrained personality trait. It is related to genetic and physiological factors; it emerges early in life but is influenced and shaped by a child's life experiences; it is consistently associated with gender and is stable or predictable over time and across situations. However, {{it does not follow}} that aggression must be viewed as a drive. On the contrary, in this article we argue that aggression is best represented internally as a collection of specific 'scripts' for social behaviour, emphasizing aggressive responding, and the associative structure relating these scripts to each other, to external cues, and to outcome expectancies. The construction and maintenance of these scripts obey well-understood principles of human information processing. Once established, these networks of scripts may be extremely resistant to change. The result is a set of cognitive structures that promote consistent forms of <b>instrumental</b> and hostile <b>aggression</b> over time and across situations. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{chapters}} {{in this section}} address {{a large group of}} behaviors including psychopathological syndromes, trait dimensions, and a variety of specific deficits. Examples include psychopathy, antisocial personality disorder, substance abuse, impulsivity, externalizing, <b>instrumental</b> and reactive <b>aggression,</b> high-risk sexual behavior, gambling, suicidal behavior, and deficits in empathy, decision making, moral reasoning, planning, insight, set shifting, and perspective taking. Historically, disinhibitory behavior has been ascribed to willful misbehavior and debate continues with respect to the legitimacy of regarding disinhibitory syndromes as psychopathology (Blackburn, 1988, 1995; Harris, Skilling, & Rice, 2002). For many, establishing a link between biologically-based dysfunction and maladaptive behavior is {{the sine qua non of}} psychopathology (Wakefield, 1992). Progress in cognitive and affective neuroscience has made it increasingly compelling to posit psychobiological mechanisms for disinhibitory psychopathology.

It may also clarify the processes associated with disinhibited behavior that reflect primarily situational influences as opposed t...|$|R

The vast majority of psychopathy research has focused on incarcerated offenders, while little is known about those whom exhibit these characteristics in a noncriminal sample.

40|$|Response {{inhibition}} is {{the termination}} or prevention of impulsive motor responses. Impaired response inhibition has been primarily related to disorders with pronounced impulsivity. The current review proposes that response inhibition performance is also {{central to the}} symptomatology of aggressive disorders. Importantly, it is proposed that response inhibition performance is related to increased <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> (or goal-directed aggression), but decreased reactive aggression (or aggression in response to frustration/threat). This is because response inhibition is implicated in emotional and behavioral regulation. Reactive aggression is related to impaired emotional and behavioral regulation, while <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> requires strong emotional and behavioral regulation. The purpose of this review is to explore this hypothesis {{by focusing on the}} relationship of response inhibition with disorders related to of impulsivity and aggression. Strong evidence in favor of the hypothesized relationship will be presented by focusing on studies showing that aggressive disorders hallmarked by <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> are related to improved response inhibition, while disorders with pronounced reactive aggression are related to impaired response inhibition. Furthermore, the current review aims to explore possible neurobiological mechanisms underlying this relationship. Recently the dual-hormone serotonergic (DHS) hypothesis of aggression has been proposed. This states that high testosterone/cortisol ratios predispose to increased general aggression, after which 5 -HT (or serotonin) levels affect the balance between instrumental and reactive aggression by mediating impulsivity. The current review will propose that response inhibition mediates the relationship of 5 -HT with instrumental and reactive aggression...|$|E
40|$|Aggressive {{behavior}} can be classified in hostile and instrumental aggressions (anderson & bushman, 2002). this classification is mostly synonymously used with reactive and proactive aggression, whereas the differences between hostile and <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> lie on three dimensions, the primary goal, amount of anger and planning and calculation(bushman & anderson, 2001). although there are rating instruments and experimental paradigms to measure hostile aggression, there is no instrument to measure <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression.</b> the following study will present an account to measure <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> with an experimental laboratory paradigm. the instrument was firstly tested on two samples of normal young adolescents (n 1 = 100; amage. = 19. 14; n 2 = 60; amage. = 21. 46). the first study revealed a strong correlation with a laboratory aggression paradigm measuring hostile aggression, but no correlations with self-reported aggression in the buss and perry questionnaire. these results were replicated in a second study, revealing an additional correlation with aggressive but not adaptive assertiveness. secondly the instrument {{was part of the}} evaluation of the reasoning and rehabilitation program r&r 2 (ross, hilborn & lidell, 1984) in an institution for male adolescents with adjustment problems in switzerland. the r&r 2 is a cognitive behavioral group therapy to reduce antisocial and promote prosocial cognitions and behavior. the treatment group (n= 16; rangeage = 15 - 17) is compared to a no treatment control group (n= 24; rangeage = 17 - 19) preand post- treatment. further aggressive behavior was surveyed and experimentally measured. hostile rumination, aggressive and adaptive assertiveness, emotional and social competence were included in the measurement to estimate construct validity...|$|E
40|$|Aggression is a {{multifaceted}} phenomenon, with different concepts {{under the same}} term. A lack of agreement in the attempts to categorize its different types explains the overabundance of classifications found in the literature, with a consequent poor conceptual clarity.

40|$|Concurrent (Study 1) and {{longitudinal}} (Study 2) {{associations between}} adolescents’ aggression, victimization, and high status were examined {{to test the}} hypothesis that forms and functions of aggression most likely to affect the status hierarchy will be associated with reputation-based measures of popularity. In Study 1, 235 10 th-grade adolescents’ overt, relational, and reputational forms of aggression and victimization were assessed. Functions of <b>aggression</b> (<b>instrumental,</b> reactive, bullying) within each form were also examined. Results supported the general prediction that aggression is associated with high peer-perceived popularity, but low likability (i. e., social preference) among peers. Significant curvilinear trends revealed a subtle association between aggression and low levels of popularity as well. Regarding forms and functions, results indicated that both the provocateurs and targets of reputational aggression had high levels of peer-perceived popularity; proactive uses of aggression were also associated with high popularity among adolescents, while reactive aggression was associated with low social preference. Longitudinal analyses of the same participants in Study 2 indicated that high peer-perceived popularity and low social preference predicted all forms of aggressive behavior over a 17 -month interval. Overall, the results reveal complex associations between aggression and status that help to explain possible social reinforcement associated with aggression and clarify the pattern of heterogeneous aggressive behaviors exhibited by adolescents at various points along the status continuum...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{the current}} study were to {{investigate}} associations between instrumental and expressive attributions of aggression and locus of control, empathy and impulsivity and to explore the moderating effects of sex differences in such constructs. It was predicted that there would be sex differences in expressions of aggression; that men would view their own aggression more instrumentally and women, more expressively. Instrumental attributions were predicted to be associated with an external locus of control and expressive attributions associated with an internal locus of control. Sex dffferences in empathy were predicted and associations between empathy and instrumental and expressive attributions about aggression. Sex differences in impulsivity were predicted and an association between instrumental attributions and impulsivity. An undergraduate sample of 338 British students (264 females and 74 males) completedfour self report measures of the constructs. Consistent with previous research, men showed higher values than women for instrumental attributions and women showed higher values than men for expressive attributions. Sex dtfferences in the female direction were foundfor empathic response. Age, gender, perspective taking, total empathy and total impulsivity were found to be predictive of <b>instrumental</b> attributions about <b>aggression.</b> Reciprocally, gender, personal distress, fantasy, total empathy and external locus of control were found to be predictive of expressive attributions.

A crucial but largely ignored question is whether automatic social approach-avoidance tendencies may underlie this condition.

We applied a computerized approach-avoidance task (AAT), where participants pushed or pulled pictures of emotional faces using a joystick, upon which the faces decreased or increased in size, respectively. Furthermore, participants completed an emotion recognition task which was used to control for differences in recognition of facial emotions. In contrast to healthy controls (HC), PP patients showed total absence of avoidance tendencies towards angry faces. Interestingly, those responses were related to levels of <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> and the (in) ability to experience personal distress (PD).

40|$|In {{this article}} the author {{analyzes}} the {{mechanisms by which}} violence in the context where children grow (either political or common violence) can promote the learning {{of different kinds of}} aggressive behaviors. These aggressive behaviors can contribute, at their turn, to the reproduction of violence in that context, thus creating a cycle of violence. The article analyzes in particular two trajectories of this cycle, one related to reactive aggression and the other with <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression.</b> It is shown that reactive aggression - produced as a defensive response to a perceived or real aggression - has social, cognitive and emotional dynamics different than those of <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> - used as a mean to reach a goal without a previous provocation. Reactive and instrumental aggressions have also different origins and predict different future violent behaviors. Distinguishing between these two kinds of trajectories allows proposing different kinds of interventions to break the cycle of violence. In this way, it is possible to reduce the reproduction of violence in children even if political and common violence remain present in our context...|$|E

Trait aggression was also assessed, measured by the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ). Consistent with western findings, men showed higher <b>instrumental</b> and physical <b>aggression</b> than women, but they also showed higher expressive beliefs, contrary to previous findings. Both instrumental beliefs and physical aggression were higher at 16 than at 26 years of age. Since reliabilities of the scales were low, the questionnaires were translated into Mizo and presented to another similar sample of 201 participants (101 males; the same age groups as in Study 1). The pattern of mean differences and correlations were similar to Study 1, although the reliabilities increased only slightly. To accommodate the relative independence of the items, both analyses were carried out on the individual items of the various scales, using a MANOVA.

40|$|SummaryAn {{aversion to}} harming others is a core {{component}} of human morality and is disturbed in antisocial behavior [1 – 4]. Deficient harm aversion may underlie <b>instrumental</b> and reactive <b>aggression,</b> which both feature in psychopathy [5]. Past work has highlighted monoaminergic influences on aggression [6 – 11], but a mechanistic {{account of how}} monoamines regulate antisocial motives remains elusive. We previously observed that most people show a greater aversion to inflicting pain on others than themselves [12]. Here, we investigated whether this hyperaltruistic disposition is susceptible to monoaminergic control. We observed dissociable effects of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram and the dopamine precursor levodopa on decisions to inflict pain on oneself and others for financial gain. Computational models of choice behavior showed that citalopram increased harm aversion for both self and others, while levodopa reduced hyperaltruism. The effects of citalopram were stronger than those of levodopa. Crucially, neither drug influenced the physical perception of pain or other components of choice such as motor impulsivity or loss aversion [13, 14], suggesting a direct and specific influence of serotonin and dopamine on the valuation of harm. We also found evidence for dose dependency of these effects. Finally, the drugs had dissociable effects on response times, with citalopram enhancing behavioral inhibition and levodopa reducing slowing related to being responsible for another’s fate. These distinct roles of serotonin and dopamine in modulating moral behavior have implications for potential treatments of social dysfunction that is a common feature {{as well as a}} risk factor for many psychiatric disorders...|$|R

They also claim that crimes within the family are some of the most common crimes committed. The UNICEF report concerning the death of children caused by domestic violence or drastic neglect shows Poland to be in the middle of the ranking of 28 developed countries. The report of the WHO shows that over 1 / 3 of women in the world are victims of violence and majority of them are attacked or harmed by their husbands or partners. This article is an attempt to show the complexity of the domestic violence problem. The author presents in it the forms of violence against children as well as adult family members. Special attention was paid to the very often ignored kind of victimization, namely the children being witnesses of violence between their parents or between other children in the family. The article shows the scale of the domestic violence problem in the light of the empirical research done in Poland and confronted with foreign research results. Special attention was also paid to the situation of a child experiencing violence from his/her relatives. The scale of consequences of the harmful behavior of the parents is wide and their effects are long-lasting. The child’s aggressive environment provides models of behavior and ways of the <b>instrumental</b> usage of <b>aggression.</b> The victims of domestic violence very often became tormentors reaching for the kinds of behavior that caused them pain and humiliatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{insanity}} {{defense has}} been of special interest to psycholegal scholars. Despite its notoriety, the defense is infrequently used and rarely successful. Yet, it is surrounded by myths and misconceptions. These misconceptions put the credibility of our legal system at stake since it can cause biased jurors to judge criminal acts {{based on their own}} misconstruals {{of what it means to}} find a defendant Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity (NGRI). In order to understand and eventually counteract these biases, it is important to first understand what they are. In recent years, developments in aggression research have strengthened the link between psychology and criminal law. Most notably, the reactive/instrumental dichotomy of aggression has been suggested as a model by which both fields can understand and explain behavior. The dichotomy has had many legal applications but has yet to be used to examine the insanity defense. The purpose of the current study was to examine how attributions of reactive and <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> as well as the defendant's level of psychosis and injury to victim affect the outcome of NGRI cases. This study further explored whether police officers would make distinct attributions of reactive and <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression,</b> or assume one general dimension of aggression. Participants were 101 defendants in the state of Wisconsin who had pleaded NGRI. The data were collected during the defendant's competency to stand trial hearings and were based on police reports of the defendant's violent offenses. In the first model, reactive and <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> were treated as separate factors. In the second model, they were combined into one factor of premeditation. Structural Equation Modeling of the data did not reveal good fit, but indicated a few significant pathways. Given these results, further exploratory and confirmatory analyses were run. Results indicated that police officers rated aggressive behavior as one factor (premeditation) and that premeditation was the only significant predictor of outcome. These findings suggest that jurors, and potentially judges, may have certain biases toward defendants whose cases indicate a high level of planning. Possible implications and future directions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Testosterone (T) has {{received}} increasing {{interest in the}} recent years as a probable biological determinant in the etiology of male-biased clinical conditions such as psychopathy (i. e. psychopathy is more prevalent in men and leads to an earlier onset and more severe expression of antisocial and aggressive behavior in men compared to women). In this review, the authors evaluated the potential relationship between T and different constructs closely related to the core characteristics of psychopathy (affective empathy, fear-reactivity, and <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression).</b> After a thorough examination of the literature, it is concluded that high T exposure in utero and high circulating T levels throughout important life phases (most notably adolescence) or in response to social challenges (e. g. social stress, competition) could be an important etiological risk factor in the emergence of psychopathic behavior. Nevertheless, studies consistently indicate that high T is not related to a significantly reduced fear-reactivity and is only indirectly associated with the increased levels of <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> observed in psychopathic individuals. Therefore, psychopathy is likely to arise from an interaction between high T levels and other biological and socio-psychological risk factors, such as a constitutionally based dampened fear-reactivity, insecure/disordered attachment processes in childhood, and social discrimination/rejection in adolescence and/or adulthood...|$|E
40|$|Aggressive {{driving is}} {{considered}} an important road-safety concern for drivers in highly motorised countries. However, understanding of the causes and maintenance factors fundamental to aggressive driving is limited. In keeping with theoretical advances from general aggression research such as the General Aggression Model (GAM), research has begun to examine the emotional and cognitive antecedents of aggressive driving {{in order to better}} understand the underlying processes motivating aggressive driving. Early findings in the driving area have suggested that greater levels of aggression are elicited in response to an intentionally aggressive on-road event. In contrast, general aggression research suggests that greater levels of aggression are elicited in response to an ambiguous event. The current study examined emotional and cognitive responses to two hypothetical driving scenarios with differing levels of aggressive intent (intentional versus ambiguous). There was also an interest in whether factors influencing responses were different for hostile aggression (that is, where the action is intended to harm the other) versus <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> (that is, where the action is motivated by an intention to remove an impediment or attain a goal). Results were that significantly stronger negative emotion and negative attributions, as well as greater levels of threat were reported in response to the scenario which was designed to appear intentional in nature. In addition, participants were more likely to endorse an aggressive behavioural response to a situation that appeared deliberately aggressive than to one where the intention was ambiguous. Analyses to determine if greater levels of negative emotions and cognitions are able to predict aggressive responses provided different patterns of results for <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> from those for hostile aggression. Specifically, for <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression,</b> negative emotions and negative attributions were significant predictors for both the intentional and the ambiguous scenarios. In addition, perceived threat was also a significant predictor where the other driver’s intent was clearly aggressive. However, lower rather than higher, levels of perceived threat were associated with greater endorsement of an aggressive response. For hostile aggressive behavioural responses, trait aggression was the strongest predictor for both situations. Overall the results suggest that in the driving context, <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> {{is likely to be a}} much more common response than hostile aggression. Moreover, aggressive responses are more likely in situations where another driver’s behaviour is clearly intentional rather than ambiguous. The results also support the conclusion that there may be different underlying mechanisms motivating an instrumental aggressive response to those motivating a hostile one. In addition, understanding the emotions and cognitions underlying aggressive driving responses may be helpful in predicting and intervening to reduce driving aggression. The finding that drivers appear to regard tailgating as an instrumental response is of concern since this behaviour has the potential to result in crashes...|$|E
40|$|Psychopathy is a {{personality}} disorder that is exemplified by affective and interpersonal {{characteristics such as}} grandiosity, pathological lying, manipulative use of others, and a profound lack of empathy, guilt, and remorse. Psychopaths also typically demonstrate a constellation of problematic and dangerous behavioral characteristics including sensation seeking, impulsivity, and both <b>instrumental</b> and reactive <b>aggression.</b> Psychopathy and substance use disorders (i. e., abuse and dependence) are significant sources of financial and emotional burden in the United States, as both are strongly linked to severe and repetitive criminal activity. They are also highly comorbid, with psychopaths being about {{two to three times}} more likely to have a drug use disorder than nonpsychopaths. Using structural and functional neuroimaging and cluster analysis, this comorbidity was investigated in a series of studies involving incarcerated adult males and females, incarcerated adolescent males and females, and nonincarcerated adult males and females. Across samples, structural differences related to psychopathic traits were largely consistent, lending support to the idea that a network of regions across the paralimbic system is abnormal, at least structurally. Several of the regions identified in the structural studies were also hypoactive during the viewing of drug cues in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of craving, suggesting a close link between structural and functional abnormalities. Finally, cluster analysis was used to identify typologies of substance users, and differential correlations with personality and individual differences variables were found. These results suggest that substance users are actually a heterogeneous group in terms of severity, drugs of choice, and personality correlates. This heterogeneity also suggests that individual differences should be taken into account when designing substance use treatment strategies. Analogous to the notion of personalized medicine, this philosophy could be at once both more effective and more efficient when applied to substance use treatment. In turn, the extreme financial and emotional burden that psychopathy and substance use disorders cause could be reduced. PsychologyDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} degrees of {{approval}} for different aggressive acts {{in a number}} of instrumental and emotional situations. A nationally-adapted version of the Lagerspetz and Westman questionnaire [1] was administered to 332 university students of both sexes in Spain and Hong Kong. Respondents had to indicate levels of justification of several aggressive acts of different quality and intensity in the context of different social justifications. Our results replicated the general findings of previous research in other cultures: in both samples, more drastic forms of aggression (e. g., killing, torture) were less accepted than non-dangerous forms of such behavior (e. g., hindering, being ironic); aggressive acts more socially justified (in terms of protection of self or other) were clearly more accepted than others with no such justification (problems of communication); and instrumental-motivated aggression was higher justified than emotional-motivated aggression. Some differences in the level of acceptance according to the sex of the participants were found: women were more prone to a higher acceptance of acts and situations more related to emotion. Although both sexes justified aggression in a higher degree for instrumentally motivated situations than for emotional ones, males showed a higher acceptance than females for instrumental situations and a lower one than females for emotional ones. There were also some minor culturally bound differences in these attitudes: Spaniards accepted less than HK students aggression in emotional situations, specially for the cases of punishment and lack of communication, but more emotional acts, such as rage and shouting. Thus, patterns of moral approval of various kinds of aggressive acts are in a large part common to both cultures. Findings also confirmed a two-factor solution and the respective predictive power of justifications for <b>aggression</b> in <b>instrumental</b> vs. emotional motivated situations. The reliability and validity of this brief self-report have been further established by the present study, paving the way for future studies to measure <b>instrumental</b> and emotional <b>aggression...</b>|$|R
40|$|A reduced {{amount of}} {{violence}} in a regional high security psychiatric ward - what happened and how to describe main dimensions of patient aggression? This thesis is based on 17 years of clinical data and experience from a forensic high security psychiatric ward. While description of violence rate in general points to large cultural and historical variation and considerable diversity in expression, the literature on psychiatric inpatient violence rate is sparse and mainly treats aggression as a homogenous phenomenon. Firstly, {{the aim of the}} thesis is to describe changes in ward variables during a period of 18 years and to apply these in exploring plausible explanatory variables for the observed reduction in violence rate during the middle part of this period. Secondly, in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of patient aggression we also tested a 3 -factor model of motivations for violent behaviour in inpatients in a forensic high security unit. Firstly, using historical-documentary methods, we documented a change in regime during the observation period of 17 years, allowing increased patient autonomy. This co-occurred with changes in ward staff and quality of treatment methods. Staff with experience from this part of the 17 -year period, were interviewed about their explanations of the decline in violence rate. They suggested several explanatory variables for this decrease, whereof some of them addressed contextual factors. These where then formally tested by visually comparing the development in each suggested variable with the development in inpatient violence. This approach falsified some of the suggested explanations. Among those not falsified, introduction of procedures of post-incident interviews and increased ratio of female staff were the most frequent mentioned. Secondly, a common feature of the suggestions was more individualized treatment of patients. Confirmatory factor analysis of data based on staff s evaluations of incidents supported the 3 -factor model of patient aggression with factors for irritable, <b>instrumental</b> and defensive <b>aggression.</b> Irritable was the most prevalent type of aggression in this context, followed by instrumental and defensive. The findings indicate that transforming a restrictive ward regime into allowing more patient autonomy quality of treatment can co-occur with reduced inpatient violence, but the research design does not allow us to conclude about causal relationship. Other variables suggested by experience clinicians to be relevant explanatory factors for the reduced violence incidence are staff qualities, improved management of risk situations and violence, promoting staff-patient cooperation, and more individualized treatments. All these factors changed {{at the time of the}} reduced violence incidence, and can thus have caused the reduced incidence of violence. </p...|$|R

30|$|The study {{conducted}} by Bushman and Anderson (2001), titled “Is it time {{to pull the plug}} on the hostile versus <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression</b> dichotomy?”, proposes a discussion of the real need to discriminate between proactive and reactive aggressive behaviors. According to the authors, aggressive behavior is usually hybrid; i.e., it may aim for different goals (concrete and/or subjective) and rely on different motivational factors. Additionally, the aggressor may plan aggression {{and at the same time}} experience anger before or during the aggression. The authors consider the dichotomization of aggressive behavior to undermine scientific advancements seeking to understand aggressive behavior and intervene in the face of it.|$|E
40|$|Analyses of {{criminal}} violence {{often fail to}} draw the important distinction between angry and <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression.</b> The former is directed mainly toward the injury of the intended target, whereas the latter is instrumental to attaining another goal such as social approval. Various conceptions, including the subculture of violence idea, assume that many violent acts are <b>instrumental</b> <b>aggression,</b> although they may actually be, in large part, angry outbursts in-tended primarily to hurt rather than to gain approval. Interviews with sixty-five white British violent offenders are used to document this thesis. The role of ego threats is also discussed. Many behavioral scientists assume that aggression, the intentional injury of another, is often (but not always) carried out {{in an attempt to}} get social re-wards and is frequently reinforced primarily by other people’s approval (see Bandura, 1973). The display of aggression is thus supposedly controlled largely by anticipations of benefits from others. One of the problems with this concep-tion {{is that it does not}} adequately recognize the different kinds of aggression. It especially fails to draw the important distinction between hostile and in-strumental aggression (see Feshbach, 1964). In the latter case, although the actor attempts to hurt someone, he wants more than the injury of his victim. His aggression is actually only instrumental to the attainment of a more impor-tant goal, such as money or social status. Hostile aggression, on the other hand, is governed chiefly by anticipations of the actions ’ injurious outcomes. The aggressor’s major aim in this instance, usually when he is angry, is to har...|$|E
40|$|Three {{complementary}} {{approaches to}} understanding psychopathy have been proposed. The five-factor model approach proposes that psychopathy exists as {{a continuum of}} disorder, characterised by the traits that comprise normal personality functioning (Ross et al, 2004). A second model of psychopathy, complementary to the FFM approach, is proposed by Blair (1995). He suggests a Violence Inhibition Mechanism (VIM) exists, responsible for aggression inhibition and distinguishing moral from conventional rules. He proposes the VIM is defective in clinical psychopaths – such individuals fail to distinguish moral (e. g. hitting another person) from conventional transgressions (e. g. wearing the opposite sex’s clothes). Activation of the VIM {{has been shown to}} be inversely proportional to level of behavioural disturbance in children with psychopathic tendencies, suggesting a continuum of disorder. A third model of psychopathy focuses on aggression: clinical psychopaths exhibit more <b>instrumental</b> and reactive <b>aggression</b> (Cornell et al, 1996). Sub-clinical psychopathy has yet to be linked to aggression; however, the VIM approach predicts that aggression positively correlates with psychopathy, providing support for a model of psychopathy as a continuous disorder. This current study aimed to replicate the proposed relationship between personality and psychopathy (Ross et al, 2004). A further objective was to investigate whether deficits in the moral/conventional would exist in sub-clinical psychopathy, providing support for examining sub-clinical psychopathy through the VIM model. A final aim was to explore whether the aggression model could account for differences in sub-clinical psychopathy. Measures of primary and secondary psychopathy, personality, aggression and the moral/conventional distinction task were administered to 176 participants using a within-subjects design. Supporting the FFM as a measurement tool for sub-clinical psychopathy, primary psychopathy was accounted for by low openness, straightforwardness and tendermindedness and high excitement seeking. Secondary psychopathy was accounted for by low agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to values, and high angry hostility and excitement seeking. Supporting the aggression model approach to sub-clinical psychopathy, primary psychopathy was accounted for by hostility and physical aggression; secondary psychopathy was accounted for by all four aggression sub-traits. Moral transgressions were judged to be less permissible and more serious than conventional transgressions. Following the removal of the rule prohibiting the transgression, conventional, but not moral transgressions were judged to be more permissible. No distinction was made between transgression types in judgements of seriousness following rule-removal. In opposition to the VIM model, neither psychopathy nor aggression showed a significant relationship with the moral/conventional distinction task. Personality, accounted for a small but significant proportion of variance in the moral/conventional distinction. These unexpected findings may result from problems with the construct validity of the moral/conventional distinction. A better understanding of the moral/conventional distinction is needed before it is employed in further study of psychopathy...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{counterproductive}} work behavior (CWB) {{has become an}} increasingly popular topic of study among organizational researchers (Penny & Spector, 2005; Yang & Diefendorff, 2009). The peculiarity of CWB is that they differ from common negative acts since they are not accidental and are intended specifically to damage by purposeful action even if unintentionally (Spector & Fox, 2005). These behaviors may include acts such as direct aggression, theft, purposely failing to follow instructions or to perform work incorrectly, {{in the interest of}} violating significant organizational norms (Spector, Fox, Penney, Bruursema, Goh, & Kessler, 2006), reducing the efficiency and job performance of its members (Hollinger & Clark, 1982), and basically threatening the health and well being of the organizations and its members. The latest financial scandals affecting American and European stock markets, as well as the increase of deviant behavior in organizations have raised questions about the ethics in the working context highlighting the need to understand these occurrences in order to prevent and tackle them (Chappell & Di Martino, 2006; Fox & Spector, 2005; Greenberg, 1997; Vardi & Weitz, 2004; Wellen, 2004). In fact, several studies showed that those behaviors {{are one of the most}} serious problems that organizations are facing in many countries (Chappel & Di Martino, 2006). US studies showed that only theft costs annually billions of dollars to organizations (Camara & Schneider, 1994; Greenberg, 1990, 1997) and the overall losses, caused by other forms of CWB, are bewildering. These behaviors not only affect the productivity but they create also discomfort to individuals or groups, compromise the quality of organizational life and damage property (material damage), hurting organization’s reputation as a whole (Vardi & Weitz, 2004). Overall CWB, both toward organizations and toward people in the organizations, violating organizational norms, harm directly or indirectly, their legitimate interests (Sackett & DeVore, 2002), reduce the efficiency and job performance of its members (Hollinger & Clark, 1982) and basically they threaten the health and well being of the organization and its members. Generally, the literature distinguishes between CWB directed towards organization (CWB-O) and CWB towards people in the organizations (CWB-P; Robinson & Bennett, 1995). Specifically, CWB-O target the organizations. They are acts such as sabotage, fraud and theft or leaving early from work, taking excessive breaks, deliberately working slowly, wasting resources and so on. CWB-P are acts exclusively directed to people working within organizations such as sexual harassment, verbal abuse, stealing among colleagues and even choosing favorites, peddling gossip and insulting colleagues. Although these two categories of behaviors are positively correlated (Judge, Scott, & Ilies, 2006; Lee & Allen, 2002), they have different relations with other variables (e. g. citizenship behaviors, perceived justice, situational constraints, personal traits; Berry, Ones, & Sackett, 2007; Hershcovis, Turner, Barling, Arnold, Dupré, Inness, et al., 2007). Several authors have focused on understanding the antecedents of CWB as well as on the processes that lead to such behaviors. Specifically, researchers have investigated the role in CWB process of both situational and personal factors. Among the theoretical models that focusing on CWB, the stressor-emotion model developed by Spector and Fox (2005) has the merit to consider both these two factors. The situational factors considered are job stressors. In line with this model, any frustrating condition in organizational life interfering with goals and job performance increase the likelihood to act CWB (see Figure 1). Whenever such stressors occur, individuals may experience negative feelings which may in turn, promote people to enact aggressive behavior as a strategy to reduce the emotionally unpleasant condition (Penney & Spector, 2005; Spector, 1998). This model (Chen & Spector, 1992; Fox & Spector, 1999, Spector, 1975, 1978, 1997; Storms & Spector, 1987) describes the processes that foster forms of aggression that are typically impulsive and are performed for the purpose of causing harm and releasing frustration. The literature on aggression has distinguished between impulsive (or reactive) aggression – based on negative affect that may lead to offensive reactions beyond one’s own control – and <b>instrumental</b> (or proactive) <b>aggression</b> – having to do with aggression that is purposefully carried out in accordance with one’s personal goals (see Fontaine, 2007). It seems likely that, CWB may share qualities that are attributed to both impulsive and instrumental subtypes of antisocial behaviors. For example, people who engaged in CWB may act out impulsive anger, but also with an intent of hurting a coworker so that he or she gains leverage in the work hierarchy. Thus, the present dissertation considers the possibility to extend the stressor-emotion model including cognitive processes that could capture the intentional and, sometimes, instrumental nature of CWB. Specifically we integrate two important traditions of research on aggressive behavior: 1) the frustration-aggression hypothesis, focusing on effects that negative emotions and affect regulation exert on aggression, and 2) the social-cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986, 1990), addressing processes that promote or justify aggression. In particular this research proposes moral disengagement (MD) as a specific social-cognitive construct in the organizational context that may intervene in the process from perceived stressors to CWB, by promoting or justifying aggressive responses to frustrating conditions or events. In fact MD construct has proved to be an important variable in deviant and aggressive behaviors. (Bandura, 1986; Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara, & Pastorelli, 1996; Caprara, Fida, Vecchione, Tramontano, & Barbaranelli, 2009). This integrative approach may be extremely productive and promising for defining organizational strategies aimed at discouraging and contrasting CWB. In fact, unlike emotions, MD mechanisms are “malleable” to the reciprocal influences between individuals and context and can be learned (Moore, 2008). On the one hand, this means that it is likely that these individual cognitive maneuvers become crystallized over time when repeatedly dealing with job stressors, legitimizing recourse to aggressive and transgressive behaviors (Paciello, Fida Tramontano, Lupinetti, & Caprara, 2008). On the other hand, it is plausible that a context in which misconduct is frequently enacted through moral cognitive distortions, without being sanctioned, may in turn create a collective MD i. e. a kind of “morally disengaged culture” or “organizational moral disengagement” in which those mechanisms could be socialized, learned and activated, legitimizing CWB (Farnese, Tramontano, Fida, & Paciello, 2011). Furthermore, it is plausible that CWB could be the result of unethical decisions deriving from a distorted interpretation and application of shared norms and in a long-time perspective, these negative models may make easier and obvious the adoption of MD, contributing in turn to the creation of a “organizational moral disengagement”. In this theoretical framework we designed three studies presented as follows. In each study we aimed to predict CWB by understanding the motivational factors preceding it. The aim of the first study is to investigate the psychometric properties, in terms of factorial structure, reliability and pattern of correlations of the Spector and Fox’s CWB inventory and to present the validation of the Italian version of this scale. Specifically, both the factors structure of CWB Checklist and the nomological validity of this measure have been tested using a cross-validation approach and the analysis of correlation. The second study integrating two important traditions of research on aggressive behaviors, the stressor-emotion model (Spector & Fox, 2005) and the social-cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986), aims to test an integrative model of the stressor-emotion model that considers both attitudinal evaluations (Job Satisfaction) and social cognitive mechanisms (Moral Disengagement) as mediators of the relationship between workplace job stressors and both CWB towards organization (CWB-O) and persons (CWB-P). The aim of the third study is to investigate whether a form of an organizational moral disengagement (MD-O) could be measured and then to examine the role of such dimension in the stressor-emotion model tested in my previous study. Specifically, whether organizational moral disengagement affects both personnel moral disengagement (MD-P) and CWB. In particular, we expect that both job stressors and MD-O contribute to a lower job satisfaction that in turn affect CWB both directly and through the agency of MD-P...|$|R
