However, when miners were unable to extract any copper from it, they blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), for besetting the copper. They called this ore <b>Kupfernickel</b> from the German Kupfer for copper. This ore is now known to be nickeline (aka niccolite), a nickel arsenide. In 1751, Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt tried to extract copper from <b>kupfernickel</b> at a cobalt mine in the Swedish village of Los, and instead {{produced}} a white metal that he named after the spirit that had given its name to the mineral, nickel.

The first large-scale smelting of nickel began in Norway in 1848 from nickel-rich pyrrhotite. The introduction of nickel in steel production in 1889 increased the demand for nickel, and the nickel deposits of New Caledonia, discovered in 1865, provided most of the world's supply between 1875 and 1915. The discovery of the large deposits in the Sudbury Basin, Canada in 1883, in Norilsk-Talnakh, Russia in 1920, and in the Merensky Reef, South Africa in 1924, made large-scale production of nickel possible.|$|E

5000|$|The use of azurite and {{malachite}} as copper ore indicators led indirectly to {{the name}} of the element nickel in the English language. Nickeline, a principal ore of nickel that is also known as niccolite, weathers at the surface into a green mineral (annabergite) that resembles malachite. This resemblance resulted in occasional attempts to smelt nickeline in the belief that it was copper ore, but such attempts always ended in failure due to high smelting temperatures needed to reduce nickel. In Germany this deceptive mineral {{came to be known as}} <b>kupfernickel,</b> literally [...] "copper demon". The Swedish alchemist Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt (who had been trained by Georg Brandt, the discoverer of the nickel-like metal cobalt) realized that there was probably a new metal hiding within the <b>kupfernickel</b> ore, and in 1751 he succeeded in smelting <b>kupfernickel</b> to produce a previously unknown (except in certain meteorites) silvery white, iron-like metal. Logically, Cronstedt named his new metal after the nickel part of <b>kupfernickel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Because the ores {{of nickel}} are easily mistaken for ores of silver, {{understanding}} of this metal and its use dates to relatively recent times. However, the unintentional use of nickel is ancient, and {{can be traced back}} as far as 3500 BCE. Bronzes from what is now Syria have been found to contain as much as 2% nickel. Some ancient Chinese manuscripts suggest that [...] "white copper" [...] (cupronickel, known as baitong) was used there between 1700 and 1400 BCE. This Paktong white copper was exported to Britain as early as the 17th century, but the nickel content of this alloy was not discovered until 1822. Coins of nickel-copper alloy were minted by the Bactrian kings Agathocles, Euthydemus II and Pantaleon in the 2nd Century BCE, possibly out of the Chinese cupronickel.In medieval Germany, a red mineral was found in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) that resembled copper ore.

Cronstedt described it as <b>kupfernickel.</b> This name arises because the ore has a similar appearance to copper (kupfer) and a mischievous sprite (nickel) was supposed by miners to {{be the cause of}} their failure to extract copper from it.
