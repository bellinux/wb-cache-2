5|$|Stephen {{responded by}} {{promptly}} moving south, besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle. Stephen then {{agreed to a}} truce proposed by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the agreement are not known, but the results were that Matilda and her household of knights were released from the siege and escorted to the south-west of England, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. The reasons for Matilda's release remain unclear. Stephen may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in his own best interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, seeing Robert, rather than Matilda, as his main opponent {{at this point in}} the conflict. Arundel Castle was also considered almost impregnable, and Stephen may have been worried that he risked tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of chivalry; Stephen had a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.|$|E

I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from {{suburbia}} who sings in this band, but someone older might <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and {{where are we going}} if this is music?... But all those songs we sang were pretty tame, really. People didn't think they were, but I thought they were tame." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} September, with Leopold's recovery, {{the family}} moved back to central London, to lodgings in Thrift Street (later 20 Frith Street), Soho. These lodgings were located {{conveniently}} close to several concert rooms, and to the residences of both J.C Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. Bach, a son of Johann Sebastian Bach, soon became a family friend; Nannerl later recalled Bach and the eight-year-old Wolfgang playing a sonata together, taking turns to play a few bars individually, and that [...] "anyone not watching would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> played by one person alone". There is no record that the Mozarts met Abel, but Wolfgang knew his symphonies, perhaps {{through the medium of}} the annual Bach-Abel concert series, and was much influenced by them.|$|E

500|$|Mary Shelley wrote [...] "Maurice" [...] for Laurette Tighe on 10 August 1820. Shelley's journal {{for that}} day notes: [...] "Thursday 10—Write a story for Laurette—Walk on the mountain—Le Buche delle Fate —The weather is warm & delightful". Claire Clairmont and Laurette had spent Laurette's {{birthday}} together in Pisa and the following day on the coast with Mary Shelley; this excursion may have inspired the story, {{which may have been}} a birthday present. Shelley suggested that her father, philosopher William Godwin, publish Maurice as part of his Juvenile Library, but he refused. He may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too short or that it too closely resembled a story by Caroline Barnard entitled The Fisher-boy of Weymouth that he had just published in 1819. In his article on [...] "Maurice", L. Adam Mekler suggests that Godwin may also have rejected the story because of the [...] "strong biographical parallels" [...] with the history of the Shelleys and the Godwins.|$|E
500|$|Particularly {{after his}} fastball slowed, Young relied upon his control. Young was once quoted as saying, [...] "Some may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{essential}} {{to know how}} to curve a ball before anything else. Experience, to my mind, teaches to the contrary. Any young player who has good control will become a successful curve pitcher long before the pitcher who is endeavoring to master both curves and control at the same time. The curve is merely an accessory to control." [...] In addition to his exceptional control, Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury. For nineteen consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Young was in his leagues' top ten for innings pitched; in fourteen of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games. By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in spring training. [...] "I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it", said Young, [...] "and there wasn't any use wasting them." [...] Young once described his approach before a game: ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} sound, Lee {{described}} [...] "What You Want" [...] as [...] "very danceable" [...] {{and her own}} vocals as [...] "fun and snappy and it gives a cool dynamic [...] ". Lee stated {{that the process of}} recording the song was fun for the band as they had excess time. She said that initially the song was conceived while the band was just recording demo, but as time passed it progressed and grew into something more. She wrote a chorus for [...] "What You Want" [...] and played it on the piano. Lee revealed that she was initially embarrassed when she came up with the lyrics and the melody of the song as she thought the members of her band would think she was Janet Jackson due to the usage of a hook. During an interview with M Music & Musicians Lee revealed that she wouldn't have recorded the song if it had been brought to her before the recording of Evanescence as she would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "stupid".|$|E

500|$|When she {{was four}} years old, she started {{learning}} the violin, and later commented: [...] "I remember asking for a violin, but I don't remember knowing what one was. I might <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a kind of pony for all I know, but I don't remember being disappointed." [...] Four years later, Autumn made her musical debut as a solo violinist performing with an orchestra, and won a competition. At the age of nine or ten, she left regular school {{with the goal of}} becoming a world-class violinist. On her time at the school, she remarked, [...] "I hated it anyway, what with the status as 'weird,' 'antisocial,' and the physical threats, {{there seemed to be no}} reason to go anymore, so I just didn't." [...] She practiced eight or nine hours a day, had lessons, read a wide range of literature, participated in orchestra practice, and was home-schooled. Growing up, she owned a large CD collection of [...] "violin concertos, symphonies, chamber music, opera, and a little jazz". She began writing her own music and poetry at age thirteen or fourteen, though she never planned to sing any of her songs. She studied under various teachers and attended Indiana University in Bloomington, but left after two years there, because she disagreed with the prevailing views on individuality and classical music. She believed that neither the audience nor the original composer would be insulted by the clothing and appearance of the performer.|$|E

2500|$|Who Would <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} novel {{to be written}} in English by a Mexican living in the United States. [...] The book was {{published}} in 1872 by J.B. Lippincott in Philadelphia [...] without the author's name on the title page, but was registered at the Library of Congress under the names of H.S. Burton and Mrs. Henry S. Burton. The book details the struggles of a Mexican-American girl born in Indian captivity, Lola, in an American society obsessed with class, religion, race and gender. [...] "The novel scrutinizes the pettiness and racism of a Northern Abolitionist family and discourses on issues of democracy, liberalism, women's suffrage, imperialism, political opportunism, and religious hypocrisy." [...] Ruiz shows “the fall of ‘republican motherhood,’ that is of ‘moral authority’ of a Yankee matron… [...] the fall of romantic conception of politics and the unmasking of liberal/democratic ideals” (76). Ruiz wants to dismantle perceptions of idealized democracy and justice in the U.S. and prove it to be corrupt and only just {{for the rich and}} powerful.|$|E
25|$|Who Would <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> <b>is</b> a {{historical}} romance.

2500|$|The {{lack of a}} State Government {{contingency}} plan was criticised by Robert Amin, Curtin University's chair of Petroleum Engineering {{and chair of the}} Woodside Research Foundation, who said the Government should have stored enough gas in underground reservoirs to power the state for at least one month, to mitigate a potential crisis. Amin said gas could be stored in parts of the Perth Basin depleted of gas, like Dongara, and companies could be offered tax incentives. Federal Opposition spokesperson for trade, Ian Macfarlane, called for a national audit of all gas pipelines, and highlighted the vulnerability of the single pipeline that carries WA's gas from the North West Shelf. Macfarlane said, [...] "At the very least this event comes as a wake-up call {{for the construction of a}} second pipeline from the North West shelf to supply gas to industry especially in the south-western part of Western Australia." [...] Professor Dong-ke Zhang, Director of the Centre for Petroleum, Fuels and Energy at the University of Western Australia, said, [...] "I would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite silly for a very advanced state like WA that we are not able to cope with an incident like this by not having the ability to divert gas from an LNG plant to the domestic pipeline. At a policy level, the infrastructure needs to be longer term and the Government should encourage major players like Woodside and Chevron to invest in the infrastructure and give the incentives for the industry to come to the party because they get much bigger margins by selling LNG overseas." ...|$|E
