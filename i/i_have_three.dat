500|$|Poulenc's {{major works}} for choir and {{orchestra}} are the Stabat Mater (1950), the Gloria (1959–60), and Sept répons des ténèbres (Seven responsories for Tenebrae, 1961–62). All {{these works are}} based on liturgical texts, originally set to Gregorian chant. In the Gloria, Poulenc's faith expresses itself in an exuberant, joyful way, with intervals of prayerful calm and mystic feeling, and an ending of serene tranquillity. Poulenc wrote to Bernac in 1962, [...] "I have finished Les Ténèbres. I think it is beautiful. With the Gloria and the Stabat Mater, I think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> good religious works. May they spare me {{a few days in}} Purgatory, if I narrowly avoid going to hell." [...] Sept répons des ténèbres, which Poulenc did not live to hear performed, uses a large orchestra, but in Nichols's view it displays a new concentration of thought. To the critic Ralph Thibodeau, the work may be considered as Poulenc's own requiem and is [...] "the most avant-garde of his sacred compositions, the most emotionally demanding, and the most interesting musically, comparable only with his magnum opus sacrum, the opera, Dialogues des Carmélites." ...|$|E
500|$|Friction emerged at McLaren {{over the}} race weekend. Fernando Alonso {{publicly}} criticised the power unit provided by local company Honda. When being overtaken by Max Verstappen on lap 27, Alonso yelled [...] "GP2 engine, GP2!" [...] {{on the team}} radio, comparing his power unit with those of Formula One's feeder series. Alonso elaborated after the race, saying: [...] "I feel embarrassed when I'm racing sometimes because it's frustrating {{when you see the}} other cars making mistakes, going off the racing line, getting sideways. You look in the mirror on the straight to look for them and they are already side by side with you. The deficit we have on power is like another category." [...] Team CEO Ron Dennis in turn criticised Alonso for his outspoken words, saying: [...] "It doesn't show the professionalism I would like all our drivers to show." [...] Jenson Button had expounded the problems of the power unit on team radio as well, lamenting the fact that other cars had been able to pass him into 130R corner. The row in the team, which The Daily Telegraph described as being a [...] "complete meltdown", came amidst speculation about the future of both drivers. Ron Dennis admitted publicly to not having dealt with the question of Jenson Button's role in [...] earlier, following much debate over the driver's future. However, speculation ended when Button was confirmed as a McLaren driver for 2016 just five days later. After the race, Alonso had also left his future with the team open, but made it clear a day later that he intended to end his career with the team, writing: [...] "No one should have any doubt that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> years with McLaren and my career in F1 will end with this team, hopefully winning everything." [...] About his comments on the team radio he said: [...] "We keep working hard. We all want to win and sometimes transmit the team radios, but it should be private chats." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the shooting, {{recordings}} of police radio communications during the event were {{released by the}} Snohomish County Police Staff and Auxiliary Services Center after requests for public records. A timeline was also provided by Marysville police spokesman Robb Lamoureux. According to the timeline and recordings, an anonymous 9-1-1 caller, using a cellphone, first alerted police to the shooting. The school resource officer was the first law enforcement officer {{to make contact with}} the victims, arriving at the scene a minute after the first 9-1-1 call was received. He immediately reported that a fire alarm was going off and that there were students and staff evacuating from the building. A dispatcher then informed him about a report of a possible shooting in the cafeteria. The officer responded, [...] "Ocean 12, it's confirmed. We have a shooter. We have five down." [...] He later said, [...] "Shooter is DOA [...] We have got apparently four [...] " [...] Soon afterward, he said, [...] "Ocean 12, I need aid here. I have two that are still breathing and alive. Looks like <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> possibly deceased." [...] The first paramedics arrived on the scene ten minutes after the first radio dispatch.|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2003 interview, Maida {{explained}} that lyrically, his {{words on the}} album would follow the music and would be very much {{a product of the}} times. [...] "I think it's {{going to be a little}} more raw, a little bit more in your face, not a lot of relationship stuff," [...] he says, noting that fans would get a preview of a couple of the tracks, [...] "Wipe That Smile Off Your Face" [...] and [...] "Walking In Circles", on the current tour. [...] "My head, with what's going on in the world and being able to reflect on all the (stuff) that I've done in the last few years in terms of going to Iraq, working very closely with War Child, I'm in that mode. I'm not angry, but kind of frustrated." [...] After observing the plight in Sudan and Darfur, Maida returned with a different outlook on his lyrics and became more outspoken. “There were some [...] that were way too over the top and preachy,” he admits, “and I had to pull a lot of stuff back. This isn’t a solo record for me, this is Our Lady Peace, so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> people that I contend with in terms of how far I can go with saying things.” Bassist Coutts added [...] "A lot of things he was talking about lyrically were things that we discussed as a band in spending all that time together. I also think that becoming a father also let him deal with issues that he hadn't dealt with before. Although there are some of the darkest lyrics ever on this record, I think there are also some very positive ones as well." [...] The content of the album's lyrics have led it to be classified as a politically charged album, which the band hasn't denied.|$|E
