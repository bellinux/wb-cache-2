40|$|Abstract [...] The {{specific}} surface area, S, of a clay is commonly {{measured by the}} adsorption of <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>monoethyl</b> <b>ether</b> (EGME); however, this method can be tedious and time consuming, especially if the clay is saturated with a monovalent, highly hydrated cation. An alternative method for measuring S was developed involving infrared internal reflectance spectroscopy. This method {{is based on the}} discovery that the ratio of R 1, the reflectance of a clay-HOD mixture at the frequency of O-D stretching, to R 2, the reflectance of the mixture at the frequency of H-O-D bending, is linearly related to S. The correlation coefficient between R~/R 2 and S, as measured by the adsorption of EGME, was 0. 995. Consequently, a calibration curve of R 1 /R 2 versus S was constructed, and the measured values of R~/R 2 for any clay-HOD mixture were referred to it for the determination of S. Results were obtained in triplicate in about an hour; hence, this method of determining S is more rapid and convenient than that involving the adsorption of EGME. Moreover, it applies to clays in a natural condition, i. e., swollen in water.

The mean age was 35. 0 and 33. 9 yr in the two groups, respectively. The mean concentration of the urinary metabolite (ethoxyacetic acid) was 120. 87 mg/g creatinine (geometric mean) in the exposed group, and 2. 71 mg/ g creatinine in the control group. Average RBC count and hemoglobin levels were normal in both groups. However, there were 2 subjects in the exposed group with an RBC count and hemoglobin concentration slightly lower than the standard.

Optimization of topical drug formulations by selected excipients may facilitate the penetration of drugs through the SC into the viable skin cells and ultimately into the systemic circulation.

Both the adsorption isotherm and the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed the preferential adsorption of the 9250 surfactant molecules on the nanoparticle surface, forming a Langmuir-type monolayer adsorption in the given solvents so that a steric stabilization was rendered. An optimal surfactant concentration of 5 wt. % (in terms of the solids weight) was determined experimentally. In addition, the Ag suspensions with {{a broad range of}} solids concentration (phi = 1 - 16 vol. %) showed a shear-thinning flow character over a shear-rate range from 1 to 4000 s(- 1), revealing that an attractive interparticle interaction was operative.

Liver function profiles showed that the AST, ALT, ALP and γGT in {{both male and female}} EGEEA-exposed workers were not significantly different from those in the comparison group.

Skin samples were defrosted and mounted in Franz-type diffusion cells, {{and then one of}} the following formulations, each saturated with lidocaine, was added: sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) 0. 5 % in water, SLS 1 % in water, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) 50 % in water (wt/wt), DMSO 100 %, isopropyl myristate 100 % (IPM), water alone, diethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monoethyl</b> <b>ether</b> (DGME) 50 % in water (wt/wt) and DGME 100 %. The penetration of lidocaine in each skin sample was measured over 8 h. Significantly greater lidocaine skin concentrations and flux (JSS) were achieved with the nonaqueous vehicles, DMSO 100 % (P < 0. 00001 and P < 0. 01, respectively), followed by DGME 100 % and IPM (P < 0. 00001 and P < 0. 01, respectively). The lag time (tlag) for lidocaine penetration in the DMSO 100 % vehicle was significantly shorter (P < 0. 01) compared with all other vehicles except water. Improved transdermal penetration of lidocaine in the DMSO 100 % vehicle was likely due to skin barrier disruption, as determined by differences in pre- and post-treatment transepidermal water loss (TEWL). This study has shown that nonaqueous vehicles enhanced penetration of lidocaine in sheep skin {{to a greater extent than}} aqueous vehicles, which has implications for topically applied local anaesthesia in sheep...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} emulsions containing a penetration enhancer, lipid nanoparticles (LNs) or colloidal silica as systems to improve the topical delivery of the flavonoid quercetin. Methods: The skin penetration of quercetin was investigated in vivo on human volunteers by tape stripping. Quercetin-loaded LNs were prepared using hot high-pressure homogenization and characterized by means of dynamic light scattering and release studies. The location of the silica nanoparticles in the skin was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry assay of silicon in the stratum corneunn strips. Results and Conclusions: The penetration enhancer diethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monoethyl</b> <b>ether</b> did not produce any significant increase in the fraction of the applied quercetin dose permeated in vivo into human stratum corneum (17. 1 +/- 3. 2 %) compared to the control emulsion (18. 1 +/- 2. 3 %). A greater but statistically nonsignificant accumulation of the flavonoid in the human horny layer (21. 2 +/- 2. 9 % of the applied dose) was measured following topical application of quercetin-loaded LNs (mean particle size: 527 nm). On the other hand, the addition of colloidal silica (average particle diameter: 486 nnn) to the emulsion (2 %, w/w) significantly increased the in vivo uptake of quercetin by the human stratum corneum to 26. 7 +/- 4. 1 % of the applied dose, the enhancing effect on permeation being more marked in the deepest horny layer strips. The measured in vivo skin penetration profile of colloidal silica showed that silica particles diffused down to the intermediate region of the human horny layer and hence could act as carrier for quercetin...|$|R
