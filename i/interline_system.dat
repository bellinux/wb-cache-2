2500|$|Frankfurt International Airport {{records for}} December 21, 1988, had been saved, only by chance, by {{computer}} programmer Bogomira Erac, who had kept {{a copy of}} the records {{on the spur of the}} moment [...] "... in memory of the people who were on the plane". These records were to show that an unaccompanied bag had been routed from Air Malta Flight KM 180 out of Luqa Airport to Frankfurt, where it had been loaded onto Pan Am 103A, the feeder flight to London. A properly marked Air Malta baggage tag would have routed the suitcase through the <b>interline</b> <b>system</b> from Malta to Frankfurt, Frankfurt to London, and London to New York City.|$|E
5000|$|The freight <b>interline</b> <b>system</b> is {{a system}} of {{relations}} between trucking companies, rail, and airline networks. Interline freight is cargo that moves between different transportation companies on its journey from origin to consignee. An interline exchange is a contractual transfer of goods from one company to another.|$|E
50|$|A long <b>interline</b> <b>system</b> {{might include}} many companies. For example, a small air carrier might assume {{responsibility}} for the freight from the customer, then transfer it to a rail company, which puts it on a truck to an international airport, where a major air carrier might fly the freight overseas. At another international airport the freight may be transferred to another rail company, which transports the cargo to a hub near the consignee. A trucking company then might collect the freight and deliver it directly to the consignee.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Interline</b> Settlement <b>System</b> - <b>Interline</b> Settlement <b>System</b> (ISS) settles funds monthly between railroads {{to share}} revenue {{generated}} for car movement when {{two or more}} railroads {{are involved in the}} shipment route.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} kinds of shortlines in the U.S.: handling, switch, and ISS (<b>Interline</b> Settlement <b>System).</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{parallel}} to the forensic work, detectives were also tracing the origin of every piece of luggage that had been checked onto PA 103, either in London or through the <b>Interline</b> baggage <b>system.</b> <b>Interline</b> baggage is baggage checked onto a flight in one location and automatically routed by the airline to other locations. It is the weak link in airline security, because provided it is tagged correctly a bag not properly x-rayed by a low-risk airline in a low-risk airport may be routed without further checks through several other airports to high-risk airlines.|$|R

5000|$|Abdelbaset al-Megrahi {{was convicted}} for the Lockerbie bombing {{on the theory}} that he loaded a bomb onto Air Malta Flight KM180 Malta-Frankfurt at Luqa Airport which it is alleged found its way via the <b>interline</b> baggage <b>system</b> onto Pan Am Feeder Flight 103A Frankfurt-London and {{eventually}} onto Pan Am Flight 103 London -New York.|$|R

50|$|In late 2011, it was {{announced}} that the SBS would merge with Lake State, with LSRC being the surviving company. The merger was strictly for railway accounting purposes; LSRC functions today as an <b>Interline</b> Settlement <b>System</b> (ISS) carrier, while SBS functioned as a Junction Settlement (JS) carrier through CSX. Lake State will convert the former SBS lines to ISS. Following the news of the merger, Lake State has stopped painting the Saginaw Bay Southern logo on its locomotives.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{combined}} device for fault current limiting and dynamic voltage restoring. It {{consists of a}} diode bridge superconducting fault current limiter and a dynamic voltage restorer, which both connected together via a common dc link. <b>Interline</b> FCL-DVR <b>system</b> is <b>interlined</b> between two different feeders that connected {{to a point of}} common coupling (PCC) in distribution network. The structure, control strategy and capability of this equipment are discussed in this paper. Effectiveness of proposed configuration is verified through simulation by PSCAD/EMTDC...|$|R
25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} that a bag had been routed onto PA103 via the <b>interline</b> baggage <b>system</b> at Frankfurt, from the station and approximate time at which bags were unloaded from flight KM180 from Malta. Although documentation for flight KM180 indicated that all bags on that flight were accounted for, the court inferred that the bag came from that flight and that it contained the bomb. In 2009, {{it was revealed that}} security guard Ray Manley had reported that Heathrow's Pan Am baggage area had been broken into 17 hours before flight 103 took off. Police lost the report and it was never investigated or brought up at trial.|$|R
40|$|Proliferation of {{electronic}} equipment in {{commercial and industrial}} processes has resulted in increasingly sensitive electrical loads to be fed from power distribution system which introduce contamination to voltage and current waveforms {{at the point of}} common coupling of industrial loads. The unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) is connected between two different feeders (lines), hence this method of connection of the UPQC is called as Interline UPQC (IUPQC). This paper proposes a new connection for a UPQC to improve the power quality of two feeders in a distribution <b>system.</b> <b>Interline</b> Unified Power Quality Conditioner (IUPQC), specifically aims at the integration of series VSC and Shunt VSC to provide high quality power supply by means of voltage sag/swell compensation, harmonic elimination and power factor correction in a power distribution network, so that improved power quality can be made available at the point of common coupling. The structure, control and capability of the IUPQC are discussed in this paper. The efficiency of the proposed configuration has been verified through simulation using MATLAB / SIMULINK. Index terms: Distribution <b>system,</b> <b>Interline</b> unified power quality conditioner (IUPQC), power quality, pwm technique, sensitive load, voltage sag, voltage swell and voltage source converter. 1...|$|R
50|$|The AAR is {{headquartered}} in Washington, D.C. {{not far from}} the Capitol. Its information technology subsidiary, Railinc, is based in Cary, North Carolina. Railinc IT systems and information services, including the Umler <b>system,</b> the <b>Interline</b> Settlement <b>System</b> and Embargoes system {{are an integral part of}} the North American rail infrastructure. Railinc delivers approximately nine million messages each day over its EDI network, including transportation waybills, advance train consists, blocking requests and responses and trip plans. Its applications support railroads, equipment owners and rail industry suppliers along every link of the supply chain. The company maintains the only industry-accepted version of the North American railroad industry's official code tables. Beginning as an information technology department within the Association of American Railroads (AAR), the company was established as a wholly owned, for-profit subsidiary of the AAR in 1999.|$|R
