In the beginning of the century, industrialization and expansion of the factories became the main concern of Iranian big cities. The city of Tabriz in Iran that could hold a large population in it turned to become as one of the <b>industrial</b> <b>poles</b> in the country. Within the years 1967 – 1975, Tabriz city was the subject of new changes and developments. But in the process of industrialization and installation of the manufacturing sites and factories, some decision makers and executive managers did not try to take the geographical and topographical conditions of the city into their considerations; therefore, the city of Tabriz became more and more polluted and the people’s social health and hygiene were endangered (Mojtabazadeh 2005). Establishment of high industrial factories in the west and southwest of Tabriz, such as chemical and petrochemical industries, thermal power plant, and oil refinery, and blowing of wind from west and southwest transferred their pollution to the inner city (Sadr Mousavi and Rahimi 2008). In recent decade, changing the patterns of vehicle use, particularly in urban areas, and increasingly use of private cars instead of urban public transport cause that the vehicles are a significant source of emissions into the atmosphere and Tabriz air pollution.

40|$|The {{affirmation}} of economic systems {{of great importance}} and the extension of economic processes towards new markets have {{had the strength to}} influence those sectors which until that moment have built their economy and their society on small local relationships. In such a structural rural society like that of Sardinia, these processes have involved different economic processes, which are deeply linked to its production history. The entrance on large markets of some local products, the alteration of some productions and the introduction, on the territory, of new <b>industrial</b> <b>poles</b> have largely brought important changes to the rural villages and landscape. The historical Sardinian house model of the rural villages is almost always a farm house. Therefore it is an architectural unit that contains both domestic and work spaces. The modifications of the work spaces are linked, in a very direct way, to the productive dynamics of the territory more than others. In fact, here the manufacturing process that begins with the work outside the villages continues. Studying these minimal devices (which we will call the 'other living') turns out to be extremely interesting to understand the tissue changes that have as their object the urban public space and the house, in its growth and modifications. These devices traditionally regulate the interface between the private and the public space: the permeability degree, the possibilities of access, the relationships between them. In the courtyard house of plains and hills, the curtain wall of the house gets thicker because it contains the 'other living' spaces. This fact generates the continuity and the compactness typical of the Mediterranean historical villages. In the mountain houses that develop in height they are arranged on the ground zero, in close contact with the small court that regulates the access to the house. In these 'other living' spaces, so small on the urban scale but so decisive in the local economy, all those activities, which link different settlement scales, concentrate. Nowadays the interpretation of these micro elements can evaluate how the relationship between the village center and the rural space has changed on a large scale in terms of production processes. On the other hand this research can clarify how the relationship between the way of living and the historical house typology has been transformed on the small scale. What is the value of the typology today? How is it able to absorb new contemporary instances? Does this 'other living' still exist? How are the modifications of the domestic interface regulated? Which is the relationship between them and the public space? What is the contribution of contemporary interventions compared to the urban landscape character? What are the constructive responses to the changes and what are the layers of matter that we find...|$|R
