5|$|Buckinghamshire County Council's architect, Fred Pooley, {{had spent}} {{considerable}} {{time in the}} early sixties developing ideas for a new town in the Bletchley and Wolverton area. He developed a futuristic proposal based on a monorail linking a series of individual townships to a major town centre. The county council published the proposals in 1966, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> influence the government.|$|E

5|$|Chandler {{remained}} {{involved in}} politics throughout his tenure as baseball commissioner. In 1948, he became {{the leader of the}} Dixiecrat movement in Kentucky. He hosted Dixiecrat presidential candidate Strom Thurmond at his home when he visited the state, but did not officially endorse Thurmond's campaign. By the time he had permanently returned to the state in mid-1951, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> influence the gubernatorial contest. He spent the next four years rebuilding his political base in preparation for another run at the office.|$|E

5|$|For their part, the Sassanids {{struggled}} {{to establish a}} stable government. When Kavadh II died only months after coming to the throne, Persia was plunged into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. Ardashir III, Heraclius' ally Shahrbaraz, and Khosrow's daughters Purandokht and Azarmidokht all succeeded to the throne within months of each other. Only when Yazdgerd III, a grandson of Khosrow II, succeeded to the throne in 632 was there stability, but by then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> rescue the Sassanid kingdom.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of bombers only began {{receiving}} their warning and diversion orders at 00:45 hours. Halifaxes of No. 4 Group were finally alerted at this time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> prevent the Ju 88s from sighting, and then homing in on a mass of landing lights. Crews from NJG 2 and NJG 4 were able to deliver beam and Schräge Musik attacks against the unwary crews. Pilots that were alerted in time were {{able to carry out}} a corkscrew manoeuvre, and evade the attack. Some bombers were able to land but were then subjected to strafing attacks and destroyed though the crews were presented with a greater chance to escape.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March the PAVN {{had taken}} Phuoc An, {{eliminating}} {{any hope of}} reaching Buôn Ma Thuột. Darlac Province in its entirety then fell under North Vietnamese control. ARVN forces began to rapidly shift positions {{in an attempt to}} keep the North Vietnamese from quickly pushing eastward to the coastal lowlands. In the final analysis, the blame for the fall of the highlands lies with General Phú, who refused to act on sound intelligence and when he realized his error, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> get reinforcements to the scene.|$|E

5|$|On 9 July the Allies invaded Sicily in Operation Husky. German signals {{intercepted by}} GC showed that even four {{hours after the}} {{invasion}} of Sicily began, twenty-one aircraft left Sicily to reinforce Sardinia. For a considerable time after the initial invasion, Hitler was still convinced that {{an attack on the}} Balkans was imminent, and in late July he sent General Erwin Rommel to Salonika to prepare the defence of the region. By the time the German high command realised the mistake, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> make a difference.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
5|$|Paul finally became sheriff in April 1881, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> reappoint Wyatt Earp {{as deputy}} sheriff because on January 1, 1881, the eastern portion of Pima County {{containing}} Tombstone had been split {{off into the}} new Cochise County, which would need its own sheriff, based in the county's largest city, Tombstone. This position was filled by a political appointment from the governor, and Wyatt and Behan both wanted the job. The Cochise County sheriff's position was worth more than $40,000 a year (about $ today) because the office holder was also county assessor and tax collector, {{and the board of}} supervisors allowed him to keep ten percent of the amounts paid.|$|E

5|$|The {{site was}} {{approved}} in 1934, {{under the supervision}} of CORF (Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiées), the Maginot Line's design and construction agency. Work by the contractor Chanel of Antibes began in 1935 at a cost of 14.5 million francs. A second phase was planned to add an artillery block. This was scaled back to a pair of separate artillery casemates. A separate entrance block was proposed in April 1940, linking to the casemates. As the initial confrontation with Germany was already underway, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> be built, with a projected construction time of 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Whitlam's dismissal, the Labor {{leadership}} {{decided to}} introduce a motion that the Senate pass the appropriation bills. With ALP senators unaware of Whitlam's sacking, that plan went ahead. Senator Doug McClelland, manager of the ALP Government's business in the Senate, informed Coalition Senate leader Reg Withers of Labor's intent at about 1.30. Withers then attended a leadership meeting and learned of Fraser's appointment; he assured the new Prime Minister he could secure supply. When the Senate convened, the ALP Senate leader, Ken Wriedt, made the motion. Even as Wriedt did so, {{he was told that}} the government had been sacked, which he initially refused to believe. Authoritative word did not reach Wriedt until 2.15pm, by which time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> withdraw the motion and instead obstruct his party's appropriation bill to hinder Fraser. At 2.24pm, Labor's appropriation bills passed the Senate, fulfilling Fraser's first promise of providing supply.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{found that}} Train 214 {{had come to}} a stop entirely within the faulty circuit B2-304, making it {{effectively}} invisible to the automatic train control system. Other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum {{to make it to the}} next circuit and resume detection and receipt of speed commands from the ATC system. Train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in manual mode by its operator, and it came to a stop while remaining on circuit B2-304 and was therefore invisible. Train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by the ATC to proceed on the track. The investigation found that the emergency brakes had been applied by the operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> avert the collision.|$|E

5|$|General Pickett had {{received}} orders from Robert E. Lee to, with the Cavalry divisions of Major Generals William Henry Fitzhugh Lee and Thomas L. Rosser, hold the vital railroad crossing at Five Forks at all costs. On April 1, at the Battle of Five Forks, their troops {{were attacked by}} a combined force under Major General Philip Henry Sheridan, which consisted of the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac, commanded by Major General Gouverneur K. Warren, and the Cavalry Corps of the Army, commanded by Brigadier General Wesley Merritt. Pickett, W.H.L. Lee, and Rosser were located behind the lines of their troops {{at the time of}} the attack, enjoying a shad bake while failing to inform their subordinate officers of their location. Meanwhile, Warren's troops overwhelmed their left flank, and the Cavalry troops pinned the Confederates down elsewhere. By the time the Confederate commanders realized the catastrophe, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> prevent the defeat. The result of the battle, as well as that of the Third Battle of Petersburg the following day, forced Lee to abandon his entrenchments at Petersburg, leading to the capture of Richmond and surrender of his army on April 9.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Verona on 18 October 1805, André Masséna led the converged light {{companies}} of his army supported by two infantry divisions in an assault {{crossing of the}} river on Verona's west side. The French stormed across the Castelvecchio Bridge and quickly captured San Giorgio, but Vukassovich threw more infantry and cavalry into the struggle for the heights, which lasted most of the day. A French diversion at Pescantina occupied his right flank brigade, keeping {{it out of the}} fight. Meanwhile, a second diversion at Albaredo d'Adige fooled Charles into thinking it was the main attack. Only {{at the end of the}} day did Count Heinrich von Bellegarde appear with reinforcements, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> stop Masséna from establishing a bridgehead on the hills to the north of the city. Believing that Vukassovich held the riverbank with too few troops, archduke dismissed him from command and appointed Prince Franz Seraph of Rosenberg-Orsini as his replacement. Another account asserts that Vukassovich was sacked because he placed a number of cannons in an exposed position in violation of Charles' orders. At Verona, the Austrians suffered 1,622 casualties and loss of four cannons, while the French only lost about 450 killed and wounded.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City's quarter-final {{was against}} Burnley of the Second Division. City {{took the lead}} early in the match {{following}} a solo goal by Tilson. In the second-half Burnley discarded their passing game in favour of a direct approach, and pressured the Manchester City goal. The City defence stood firm, and the match finished 1–0. City's opponents for the semi-final, held at Leeds Road, Huddersfield, were Derby County. Derby had two chances to score in the first half, but both were missed. A Manchester City counter-attack produced the opening goal, when Brook crossed and Toseland headed in. By midway through the second half Manchester City led by three goals. The second was scored by Tilson, a follow-up after an initial saved shot. McMullan scored the third after dribbling through the Derby defence. Derby mounted a late comeback. A goal by Howard Fabian reduced the deficit to two, and Sammy Crooks added a late second for Derby, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> affect {{the result of the}} match, which ended 3–2.|$|E

5|$|The Athenian {{politician}} Philocrates {{had suggested}} offering Philip peace in 348 BC, during the Olynthian war. However, the Athenian assembly had effectively rejected this proposal by putting Philocrates on trial, {{and by the}} time he was cleared of the charges, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> save Olynthos. The war between Athens and Philip thus continued through 347 BC, as did the Sacred War. In 347 BC, Philip sent privateers to attack Athenians colonies on various Aegean islands. Meanwhile, it was becoming clear that the Sacred War could only be ended by outside intervention. The Phocians had occupied several Boeotian cities, but were running out of treasure to pay their mercenaries; conversely, the Thebans were unable to act effectively against the Phocians. The Phocian general Phalaikos was removed from his command in 347 BC, and three new generals appointed, who successfully attacked Boeotia again. The Thebans appealed to Philip for aid, and he sent a small force to their assistance. Philip sent force enough to honour his alliance with Thebes, but not enough to end the war—he desired the glory of ending the war personally, in the manner of his choosing, and on his terms.|$|E
5|$|When Sickles {{arrived with}} his III Corps, General Meade {{instructed}} {{him to take}} up a position on Cemetery Ridge that linked up with the II Corps on his right and anchored his left on Little Round Top. Sickles originally did so, but after noon he became concerned about a slightly higher piece of ground 0.7 miles (1,100 m) to his front, a peach orchard owned by the Sherfy family. He undoubtedly recalled the debacle at Chancellorsville, where the high ground ("Hazel Grove") he was forced to give up was used against him as a deadly Confederate artillery platform. Acting without authorization from Meade, Sickles marched his corps to occupy the peach orchard. This had two significant negative consequences: his position now took the form of a salient, which could be attacked from multiple sides; and he was forced to occupy lines that were much longer than his two-division corps could defend. Meade was furious about this insubordination, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> do anything about itthe Confederate attack was imminent.|$|E
