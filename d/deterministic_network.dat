By adding key elements from Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) to those already found in Ethernet, and constraining the specification of various options, a highly reliable full-duplex <b>deterministic</b> <b>network</b> is created providing guaranteed bandwidth and quality of service. Through the use of full-duplex Ethernet, the possibility of transmission collisions is eliminated. The network is designed {{in such a way}} that all critical traffic is prioritized using QoS policies so delivery, latency, and jitter are all guaranteed to be within set parameters. A highly intelligent switch, common to the AFDX network, is able to buffer transmission and reception packets. Through the use of twisted pair or fiber optic cables, full-duplex Ethernet uses two separate pairs or strands for transmitting and receiving the data. AFDX extends standard Ethernet to provide high data integrity and deterministic timing.

40|$|Abstract — The <b>deterministic</b> <b>network</b> {{calculus}} {{offers an}} elegant framework for determining delays and backlog {{in a network}} with deterministic service guarantees to individual traffic flows. A drawback of the <b>deterministic</b> <b>network</b> calculus is that it only provides worst-case bounds.

We introduce {{the notion of an}} effective service curve as a probabilistic bound on the service received by an individual flow, and construct an effective service curve for a network where capacities are provisioned exclusively to aggregates of flows. Numerical examples demonstrate that the calculus is able to extract a significant amount of multiplexing gain in networks with a large number of flows. I...|$|E

The gap between the capacities of a Gaussian relay network and a corresponding linear <b>deterministic</b> <b>network</b> can be unbounded. The key reasons are that the linear deterministic model fails to capture the phase of received signals, and there is a loss in signal strength in the reduction to a linear <b>deterministic</b> <b>network.</b> On the positive side, Gaussian relay networks are indeed well approximated by certain discrete superposition networks, where the inputs and outputs to the channels are discrete, and channel gains are signed integers.

30|$|Quite {{a number}} of systems {{may be viewed as}} and are called {{networks}} although their physical appearance is quite different in nature. Most of these systems are results of human civilization and are of great importance for its functioning.

To see the common structure behind these different systems, they must be abstracted from their physical appearance. Then, their underlying structure may be seen as a collection of vertices, which might be road crossings, railway stations, airports, pumping stations and so on, and a collection of lines, which might be roads, canals, telephone cables, etc. connecting all or some of the vertices and every arc has weights or capacities.

In particular, it is shown that the colored noise encountered in amplify-and-forward protocols can be treated as white for the purpose of DMT computation, lower bounds on the DMT of lower-triangular channel matrices are derived and the DMT of parallel MIMO channels is computed.

Direct examination of the correspondence between opportunities for diversification imbedded in such networks and realized diversity is illuminating, but is empirically challenging because both the <b>deterministic</b> <b>networks</b> and phenotypic diversity are modified {{in the course of}} evolution. Here we overcome this problem by directly comparing the structure of a “global” carotenoid network – comprising of all known enzymatic reactions among naturally occurring carotenoids – with the patterns of evolutionary diversification in carotenoid-producing metabolic networks utilized by birds. Results We found that phenotypic diversification in carotenoid networks across 250 species was closely associated with enzymatic connectivity of the underlying biochemical network – compounds with greater connectivity occurred the most frequently across species and were the hotspots of metabolic pathway diversification. In contrast, we found no evidence for diversification along the metabolic pathways, corroborating findings that the utilization of the global carotenoid network was not strongly influenced by history in avian evolution. Conclusions The finding that the diversification in species-specific carotenoid networks is qualitatively predictable from the connectivity of the underlying enzymatic network points to significant structural determinism in phenotypic evolution...|$|R
