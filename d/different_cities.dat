5|$|World of Dance Tour (WOD) {{was founded}} in 2008 by Myron Marten and David Gonzales in Pomona, California. It differs from other {{competitions}} {{because there is no}} final championship.

Each tour stop is a stand-alone competition; they are all related to each other in name only.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{performance}} analysis of Location Aided Routing (LAR) protocol in <b>different</b> <b>city</b> scenarios has been done. The mobility model considered is Manhattan model. This mobility model used {{to emulate the}} movement pattern of nodes i. e., vehicles on streets defined by maps. Our objective {{is to provide a}} qualitative analysis of the LAR protocol in <b>different</b> <b>city</b> scenarios in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks. We have considered three <b>different</b> <b>city</b> scenarios for the analysis of the protocol. The simulation work has been conducted using the Glomosim 2. 03 simulator. The results show that LAR 1 protocol achieves maximum packet delivery ratio is 99. 68 % and maximum average end-to-end delay is 7. 319969 ms when the network is sparsely populated. Further, for densely populated network maximum achieved packet delivery ratio is 87. 58 % and average end-to-end delay is 0. 017684 ms...|$|R

5|$|Despite their celebrated {{success at}} turning {{spectacular}} plays in collaboration, {{relations between the}} teammates {{were said to have}} been often strained. Tinker and Evers feuded for many years. On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken a cab to the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They did not speak for years following this event. According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did not speak to one another again following their fight for 33 years, until they were asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, between the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the other had been invited.

5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in <b>different</b> <b>cities</b> and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
