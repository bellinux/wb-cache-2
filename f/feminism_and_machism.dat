40|$|The popular {{perception}} of <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> multiculturalism as incompatible is strongly rejected; in addition, {{the position that}} <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> multiculturalism are always compatible is challenged. An overview of contemporary definitions of <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> multiculturalism is presented, demonstrating that neither theoretical perspective should be outright rejected. Nevertheless, it is stressed that feminists should resist efforts to balance <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> multiculturalism since the latter frequently supports the preservation of patriarchal structures within minority cultures; indeed, specific problems with Will Kymlicka's (nd) and Ayelet Shachar's (nd) respective attempts to achieve a feminist-multiculturalist balance with regard to minority interests and rights are highlighted. Consequently, a synonymous understanding {{of the connection between}} <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> multiculturalism, one that stresses feminist principles when dealing with minority patriarchies and attempts to reconfigure prevailing notions of <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> multiculturalism, is advanced; potential objections to the proposed feminist-multiculturalist paradigm are also addressed...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{looks to}} examine the view on {{religious}} and non-religious people thoughts on the possible relationship between <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> religion. The essay in itself relies on semi structured interviews conducted with five informants where focus has been centered on the informants main thoughts on the subject. The theoretic basis {{of the study is}} found in post-structuralistic <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> intersectionalism. The result will show that while all the informants believe {{there is a kind of}} relationship between <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> religion, this relationship greatly varies depending on the informants’ preconception of religion <b>and</b> <b>feminism...</b>|$|R
40|$|Against a back-drop {{of ongoing}} hostility between {{sections}} of feminism towards trans communities, and particularly feminist antagonism towards trans women, this paper explores {{the relationship between}} <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> transgender. Through the use of original case study material, gathered by virtual methods, the paper explores events that have occurred since the millennium {{that are used to}} highlight particular epistemological and political tensions between <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> trans. Central themes running through the case studies include the constitution of ‘woman’, the policing of feminist identities and spaces, and questions of bodily autonomy. In conclusion, the paper stresses the importance of rejecting trans-exclusionary <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> of foregrounding the links between <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> transgender as a key social justice project of our time...|$|R
