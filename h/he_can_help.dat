5|$|Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) plans a woodshop {{expansion}} {{in his home}} and seeks the approval of city planner Mark (Paul Schneider). Mark informs Ron that an inspection is needed {{to ensure that the}} facility meets all current zoning code standards, and an obviously lying Ron claims it does, clearly underscoring his vexation with governmental regulations. During the inspection, Mark finds numerous code violations, including oily rags placed above a wood-burning fireplace and a long-outdated fire extinguisher. Later, Mark takes a half-day off so that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> his friend's woodshop meet city code. Ron thanks Mark by building a wooden canoe and leaving it in his office.|$|E

The sheriff then complains that he will now {{have to spend the}} rest of his life in a wheelchair, only to be shot again and killed by Stewie. Paul finally finishes the book and demands Stewie let him go, but Stewie refuses, knowing he could try to turn him/her in to the police and tell them s/he kidnapped him, held him hostage, and fondled him in his sleep, which Paul did not know originally. Paul's ultimate fate is left ambiguous as the story ends with a Magnum, P.I.-style credits roll.|$|E

Before <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> Cole locate the energy cores needed to power the RFI, he is killed by the Militia, who also take Kuo captive. While working to free her, Cole and Zeke meet Roscoe Laroche, a Vietnam veteran who leads a resistance movement opposed to Bertrand, and Nix (Nika Futterman), a shadow-manipulating Conduit who has been waging war on the Militia. Using intelligence gathered by Zeke, Cole and Nix locate a secret lab where Kuo, revealed to be a Conduit, {{has been forced to}} transfer her ice-generating powers to an army of human mercenaries controlled by Bertrand.

During his first few days as coach he benches several players who refuse to follow his rulesâ€”including Bindia Naik (Shilpa Shukla), his most experienced player. In response, Bindia repeatedly encourages the other players to defy Khan. When she finally succeeds, Khan angrily resigns; however, he invites the staff and team to a farewell lunch at McDonald's. During the lunch, local boys make a pass at Mary; Balbir attacks them, triggering a brawl between the boys and the team. Khan, recognizing that they are acting as one for the first time, prevents the staff from intervening; he only stops a man from hitting {{one of the women}} from behind with a cricket bat, telling him that there are no cowards in hockey.

Satisfied, the Joker leaves, intending to detonate bombs placed around the city. Batman revives Bane, who injects himself with a steroid that transforms him into a hulking beast. He loses the ensuing battle to Batman and suffers amnesia as a side effect from the steroid, thus preserving Batman's secret identity. With Gordon's help, Batman locates the Joker in the prison chapel. Dismayed that Bane is still alive, the Joker tries to goad Batman into killing him but Batman subdues him instead. Gordon chooses not to pursue Batman, believing <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> the city.

She reveals that she and the other friendly Mirages unsuccessfully attempted to stop the dark mage Gharnef summoning the Shadow Dragon Medeus into their native realm with a ceremony called the Opera of Shadows. Tiki was banished into the Idolasphere, which acted as an intermediate dimension between the real world and her world, and she was instrumental in preventing Gharnef from performing the Opera of Shadows a second time to enter the real world as his native realm had become drained of artistic energy. His attempt sparked the mass disappearance of five years before, and Tiki shielded both Tsubasa and Yashiro at the cost of her memories.|$|E

5|$|After Jacob's death, the Monster tells Ben {{to fetch}} Richard, {{as he wants}} to speak to him. However, when Ben exits the statue, Richard throws him down beside the corpse of the real John Locke, which has {{been brought to the}} statue by {{survivors}} of the Ajira flight, led by Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson). Ben is forced by Ilana's group to bring them to the imposter Locke. They start shooting at the Monster, but he disappears, then returns in its black smoke form, killing Ilana's group. The Monster returns to Locke's form and mockingly informs Ben of the real Locke's last thoughts, while being strangled by Ben. Afterwards, Ben comforts Ilana when he finds her crying in Jacob's chamber and sets off with her, Sun, and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) to bury Locke before going to the Temple, where they believe they will be safe from the Monster.

500|$|White Dog is a [...] "blunt, highly {{cinematic}} parable {{about race}} relations" [...] that questions whether racism is a curable mental illness or learned behavior, {{or if it}} is an untreatable disease. The unnamed white German Shepherd is the metaphor of racism, with his radically contrasting moments of innocent, typical dog behavior when not around black persons, and his snarling viciousness when he sees a target. Paul Winfield's character Keys, who believes <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> the dog unlearn this behavior, represents the view that racism can be unlearned. Keys's attempts to reprogram the dog become a [...] "bold literalization of the race war," [...] and as the film progresses Keys becomes obsessed with the idea that he can cure the dog. Much like Captain Ahab, he declares that if he fails with this dog, he will find another and another until he succeeds. Keys's counterpart, Carruthers, a white trainer, believes the dog is irredeemable and should be killed, representing the view that racism cannot be cured.|$|E
