5|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} genetic disorder {{that is associated with}} protein misfolding and aggregation. Excessive repeats of the glutamine amino acid at the N-terminus of the <b>Huntingtin</b> <b>protein</b> cause aggregation, and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease. As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure. Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the <b>Huntingtin</b> <b>protein</b> aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with rational drug design methods to stop the aggregate formation. The N17 fragment of the <b>Huntingtin</b> <b>protein</b> accelerates this aggregation, and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact role in this process remains largely unknown. Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease. Since 2008, its drug design methods for Alzheimer's disease have been applied to Huntington's.|$|E
5|$|The <b>huntingtin</b> <b>protein</b> {{interacts with}} over 100 other proteins, {{and appears to}} have {{multiple}} biological functions. The behavior of this mutated protein is not completely understood, but it is toxic to certain cell types, particularly in the brain. Early damage is most evident in the striatum, but as the disease progresses, {{other areas of the}} brain are also more conspicuously affected. Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the striatum and its cortical connections—namely control over movement, mood and higher cognitive function. DNA methylation also appears to be changed in HD.|$|E
5|$|Research {{is being}} {{conducted}} on many {{different approaches to}} prevent Huntington's disease or slow its progression. Disease-modifying strategies can be broadly grouped into three categories: reducing {{the level of the}} mutant <b>huntingtin</b> <b>protein</b> (including gene splicing and gene silencing); approaches aimed at improving neuronal survival by reducing the harm caused by the protein to specific cellular pathways and mechanisms (including protein homeostasis and histone deacetylase inhibition); and strategies to replace lost neurons. In addition, novel therapies to improve brain functioning are under development; these seek to produce symptomatic rather than disease-modifying therapies, and include phosphodiesterase inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|Non-allele {{specific}} {{gene silencing}} using siRNA molecules {{has also been}} used to silence the mutant <b>huntingtin</b> <b>proteins.</b> Through this approach, instead of targeting SNPs on the mutated protein, all of the normal and mutated <b>huntingtin</b> <b>proteins</b> are targeted. When studied in mice, {{it was found that}} siRNA could reduce the normal and mutant huntingtin levels by 75%. At this level, they found that the mice developed improved motor control and a longer survival rate when compared to the controls. Thus, gene silencing methods may prove to be beneficial in treating HD.|$|R

50|$|SETD2 {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with Huntingtin. Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal neurons, is caused by an expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the HD <b>protein</b> <b>huntingtin.</b> SETD2 belongs to a class of <b>huntingtin</b> interacting <b>proteins</b> characterized by WW motifs.|$|R
5|$|All {{humans have}} {{two copies of}} the Huntingtin gene (HTT), which codes for the protein Huntingtin (HTT). The gene is also called HD and IT15, which stands for 'interesting {{transcript}} 15'. Part of this gene is a repeated section called a trinucleotide repeat, which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant <b>Huntingtin</b> <b>protein</b> (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant: mutation of either of a person's HTT alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but {{the length of the}} repeated section of the gene and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.|$|E
500|$|An {{additional}} {{theory that}} explains another way cell function may be disrupted by HD proposes that damage to mitochondria in striatal cells (numerous accounts of mitochondrial metabolism deficiency have been found) and {{the interactions of}} the altered <b>huntingtin</b> <b>protein</b> with numerous proteins in neurons leads to an increased vulnerability of glutamine, which, in large amounts, {{has been found to}} be an excitotoxin. [...] Excitotoxins may cause damage to numerous cellular structures. [...] Although glutamine is not found in excessively high amounts, it has been postulated that because of the increased vulnerability, even normal amounts glutamine can cause excitotoxins to be expressed.|$|E
500|$|HD is {{typically}} inherited from a person's parents, with 10% of cases {{due to a}} new mutation. The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin. This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called [...] "huntingtin". Expansion of CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the <b>Huntingtin</b> <b>protein</b> results in an abnormal protein, which gradually damages cells in the brain, through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Diagnosis is by genetic testing, which {{can be carried out}} at any time, {{regardless of whether or not}} symptoms are present. This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have the right to have their children tested; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results.|$|E

40|$|Huntington’s Disease (HD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} {{disorder that}} is caused by abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine tract in <b>huntingtin</b> (htt) <b>protein.</b> The expansion leads to increased htt aggregation and toxicity. Factors that aid in the clearance of mutant <b>huntingtin</b> <b>proteins</b> should relieve the toxicity. We previously demonstrated that overexpression of ubiqulin- 1, which facilitates protein clearance through the proteasome and autophagy pathways, reduces huntingtin aggregates and toxicity in mammalian cell and invertebrate models of HD. Here we tested whether overexpression of ubiquilin- 1 delays or prevents neurodegeneration in R 6 / 2 mice, a well-established model of HD. We generated transgenic mice overexpressing human ubiquilin- 1 driven by the neuron-specific Thy 1. 2 promoter. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry revealed robust and widespread overexpression of ubiquilin- 1 in the brains of the transgenic mice. Similar analysis of R 6 / 2 animals revealed that ubiquilin is localized in huntingtin aggregates and that ubiquilin levels decrease progressively to 30 % during the end-stage of disease. We crossed our ubiquilin- 1 transgenic line with R 6 / 2 mice to assess whether restoration of ubiquilin levels would delay HD symptoms and pathology. In the double transgenic progeny, ubiquilin levels were full...|$|R

2500|$|The alpha sheet {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a possible intermediate state in the conformational change {{in the formation of}} amyloid fibrils by peptides and proteins such as amyloid beta, poly-glutamine repeats, lysozyme, prion proteins, and transthyretin repeats, all of which are associated with protein misfolding disease. For example, amyloid beta is a major component of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, and polyglutamine repeats in the <b>huntingtin</b> <b>protein</b> are associated with Huntington's disease. These proteins undergo a conformational change from largely random coil or alpha helix structures to the highly ordered beta sheet structures found in amyloid fibrils. Most beta sheets in known proteins are [...] "twisted" [...] about 15° for optimal hydrogen bonding and steric packing; however, some evidence from electron crystallography suggests that at least some amyloid fibrils contain [...] "flat" [...] sheets with only 1-2.5° of twist. An alpha-sheet amyloid intermediate is suggested to explain some anomalous features of the amyloid fibrillization process, such as the evident amino acid sequence dependence of amyloidogenesis despite the belief that the amyloid fold is mainly stabilized by the protein backbone.|$|E

50|$|Gene {{silencing}} {{can be used}} {{to treat}} HD by targeting the mutant <b>huntingtin</b> <b>protein.</b> The mutant <b>huntingtin</b> <b>protein</b> has been targeted through gene silencing that is allele specific using allele specific oligonucleotides. In this method, the antisense oligonucleotides are used to target single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), which are single nucleotide changes in the DNA sequence, since HD patients have been found to share common SNPs that are associated with the mutated huntingtin allele. It has been found that approximately 85% of patients with HD can be covered when three SNPs are targeted. In addition, when antisense oligonucleotides were used to target an HD-associated SNP in mice, there was a 50% decrease in the mutant <b>huntingtin</b> <b>protein.</b>|$|E
40|$|Huntington disease (HD) {{is caused}} by a polyglutamine {{expansion}} in the <b>protein</b> <b>huntingtin</b> (Htt). Several studies suggest that Htt and <b>huntingtin</b> associated <b>protein</b> 1 (HAP 1) participate in intracellular trafficking and that polyglutamine expansion affects vesicular transport. Understanding the function of HAP 1 and its related proteins could help elucidate the pathogenesis of HD. The present review focuses on HAP 1, which has proved to be involved in intracellular trafficking. Unlike huntingtin, which is expressed ubiquitously throughout the brain and body, HAP 1 is enriched in neurons, suggesting that its dysfunction could contribute to the selective neuropathology in HD. We discuss recent evidence for the involvement of HAP 1 and its binding proteins in potential functions...|$|R
40|$|Huntington’s {{disease is}} a late onset {{neurodegenerative}} disease. The condition develops when the <b>protein</b> <b>Huntingtin</b> has a mutated expansion of at least 36 polyglutamine repeats. This causes <b>Huntingtin</b> <b>proteins</b> to aggregate with one another into amyloid fibrils. These aggregates are strongly correlated with the toxicity that leads to neurodegeneration in humans. Recently, Drosophila melanogaster {{has been used to}} study the toxicity and neurodegeneration associated with Huntington’s disease, but much is left to be learned in the study of aggregation in this model organism. This research project aimed to establish Drosophila melanogaster as a suitable model organism to evaluate the effects that two chaperone proteins, Hsp 104 and Hsp 70, might have on Huntingtin aggregation. This problem was studied using a fluorescence microscopy approach. The work focused on the analysis of aggregation present in the 3 rd instar larvae stage. Overall, aggregates from a Huntingtin construct with a long polyglutamine length were intensely concentrated and seen throughout the 3 rd instar larvae; in contrast, aggregates from a Huntingtin construct with a short polyglutamine length were not seen. In addition, Hsp 104 and Hsp 70 reduced the number of aggregates from the former construct, especially in the center and posterior end of the larvae but not as much in the head and tracheal tubes...|$|R
40|$|Huntington {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} dominant neurodegenerative disorder {{caused by the}} pathological expansion of a polyglutamine tract. In this study we directly assess the influence of protein size on the formation and subcellular localization of huntingtin aggregates. We have created numerous deletion constructs expressing successively smaller fragments of huntingtin and show that these smaller proteins containing 128 glutamines form both intranuclear and perinuclear aggregates. In contrast, larger NH 2 -terminal fragments of <b>huntingtin</b> <b>proteins</b> with 128 glutamines form exclusively perinuclear aggregates. These aggregates can form {{in the absence of}} endogenous huntingtin. Furthermore, expression of mutant huntingtin results in increased susceptibility to apoptotic stress that is greater with decreasing protein length and increasing polyglutamine size. As both intranuclear and perinuclear aggregates are clearly associated with increased cellular toxicity, this supports an important role for toxic polyglutamine-containing fragments forming aggregates and playing {{a key role in the}} pathogenesis of Huntington disease...|$|R

HIP 1 -transformed cells, in contrast to RasV 12 -transformed cells, have dysregulation of multiple receptors involved in clathrin trafficking. Examples include upregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the transferrin receptor. Furthermore, accumulation of transferrin and EGF in the HIP 1 -transformed cells was increased, and breast tumors that had EGFR expressed also had HIP 1 upregulated. Thus, HIP 1 overexpression promotes tumor formation and {{is associated with a}} general alteration in receptor trafficking.

40|$|A {{means for}} {{measuring}} levels of soluble <b>huntingtin</b> <b>proteins</b> in clinical samples {{is essential for}} assessing the biological effects of potential mutant huntingtin (mtHtt) modifying treatments being developed for Huntington’s disease (HD). We have optimized a previously described cell-based Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence method that can measure soluble mtHtt and its ratio to the total Htt (tHtt) in blood buffy coats [1]. The results of the optimization and assay qualification indicate the assay to be specific for mtHtt in HD compared to Control subjects, highly sensitive, and technically and biologically reproducible. We therefore generated a Good Laboratory Practice Standard Operating Procedure which we validated, using 30 HD and 8 control buffy coat samples in which significant differences in mtHtt levels were found. We intend to deploy the assay to evaluate sample sets from observational and therapeutic studies enrolling HD subjects to further validate soluble mtHtt measurement by HTRF as a biomarker for HD and to explore its potential uses...|$|R
