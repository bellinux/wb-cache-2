PPT as delivered at meeting [some additional information]Evaluating the student experience of Higher Education {{has become a}} matter of national importance in several countries. For example, in England & Wales the National Student Survey (NSS) is administered on line to all students in the final year of their undergraduate degree. The NSS uses 5 -point Likert scales, giving extent of agreement or disagreement with positive statements. There are 22 questions, covering 6 aspects of student experience. This presentation considers how psychophysical methods based on signal detection theory or Luce?? s choice theory can be used to analyze such data. Such methods can determine how well the questions discriminate different aspects of experience, as well as how favourably the students experience these aspects of their education. Particular emphasis is given to <b>exploring</b> <b>discipline</b> differences together with the effects of recent technologies, such as managed learning environments and web 2. 0 social software...|$|E

The festival features diverse local and international multimedia artists working with sound including noise artists, sound artists, improvisers, experimental musicians, composers, avant-garde musicians, vocalists, electroacoustic musicians, classical musicians and rock musicians. The festival focuses on new and unusual performances and art works, often in untraditional environments. Soundwave primarily showcases [...] "sound art," [...] but also <b>explores</b> <b>disciplines</b> such as music, dance, and installation. It’s an art experience out of the unexpected to explore important ideas and issues of our time.|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} literature on learning organizations emphasize that leadership and strong organizational culture {{are central to}} their successful development. Whereas schools continue to face government control, accountability, and financial restraints, they are also working diligently to engage in ongoing school improvement practices to provide learning opportunities for all students. Existing literature supports a link between culture and leadership and the academic achievement of high-poverty and high-performing schools. However, this theoretical construct required further investigation to <b>explore</b> <b>disciplines</b> for creating an optimum learning organization and, in turn, its impact on student achievement. 	The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate the disciplines evident within two Illinois schools identified with both high-student poverty and high-performance rates. This qualitative study particularly investigates disciplines contributing to the overall school environment impacting student performance. Moreover, this case study provides an in-depth examination of the disciplines present in high-poverty schools that are demonstrating high-student achievement...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} questions in many archaeological sites is to elucidate where the livestock was kept, and which and how many animals were herded. This is particularly compelling in Late Prehistory, when many sites were heavily fortified, and all the space intramuros seemed to be occupied by domestic buildings. Some disciplines, such as micromorphology and palynology, help to answer some of these questions. In this paper, we will provide a perspective from zooarchaeology, {{which is one of the}} least <b>explored</b> <b>disciplines</b> to detect were the living animals were. Together with a review of the archaeological and zooarchaeological literature for Late Prehistory in the Western Mediterranean, we will provide the results of a present-day experiment with pig dung. The objective of this experiment is to analyse whether the accumulation of digested bones could testify of the presence of pig enclosures, a hypothesis raised for the Iron Age levels of Althiburos (Tunisia; Portillo et al 2012).

40|$|Issues around {{e-learning}} {{and student}} use of ‘new’ {{technologies such as}} computers, email, the internet, mobile phones and other mobile devices {{have been the subject}} of much recent research. However, learner perspectives of e-learning are under-represented in the literature. Research in e-learning is usually focused on technological or pedagogical issues, and so far, students have been largely overlooked. This paper explores the experiences of adult students in using new technologies, on a series of distance education course. These Openings courses are designed for a widening participation audience, which, in this context, refers to groups under-represented in Higher Education, particularly adults with low previous educational qualifications. The results presented in this paper summarise initial findings within an eighteen-month project. The project focuses particularly upon mathematics and science, although humanities are included, to <b>explore</b> <b>discipline</b> variations. The first round of survey and interview data provides insights into the realities of the students’ experience of technologies, which may inform policy and practice decisions within the widening participation arena. ...|$|R

40|$|Students and {{teachers}} rarely come together, {{at least in}} a meaningful way, outside the confines of the school environment. Seeing your students at Wal-Mart does not constitute “meaningful interaction”. This fact alone makes the GEAR UP Summer Enrichment Academy (SEA), held at California State University, San Bernardino in the summer of 2006, an epic event. The SEA brought students {{and teachers}} from the Rialto and Coachella school districts together with faculty from CSUSB for an intensive, enriching learning experience. Selected bright, young students were given opportunities to <b>explore</b> <b>disciplines</b> far outside of the range of their normal classroom experiences and a chance to immerse themselves in college life. College professors and community experts were given the chance to touch young minds and sharpen their teaching skills with students who were younger and very different from their usual charges. Middle school teachers were given a chance to focus on students instead of teaching and managing, as well as a chance to learn many new things themselves.
