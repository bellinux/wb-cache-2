40|$|This thesis {{critically}} examines {{federal environmental}} regulation of Australian forestry operations, particularly the effective exclusion of forestry operations in regional forest agreement [RFA] regions from Australia’s omnibus environmental statute, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) [EPBC Act]. The thesis tests the official rationale for this exclusionary policy, termed ‘RFA exceptionalism’, {{and where it}} leaves Australia’s compliance with key international environmental treaty obligations. Australia’s federal and State Governments and industry have asserted that RFAs (governed by the Regional Forest Agreement Act 2002 (Cth)) provide equivalent environmental protection {{to that of the}} EPBC Act. Therefore, they say, <b>forestry</b> operations <b>undertaken</b> in RFA regions do not require assessment under the EPBC Act. This thesis tests this justification for RFA exceptionalism, a policy embedded in both the EPBC Act and RFA Act. In particular, it assesses the Tasmanian RFA’s legal protection against two key objects of the EPBC Act (with equivalent goals in Australia’s National Forest Policy Statement 1992), to: • ‘provide {{for the protection of the}} environment, especially matters of national environmental significance’; and • ‘assist in the co-operative implementation of Australia’s international environmental responsibilities’. The schemes of the EPBC Act (applicable to all other industries which significantly impact matters of national environmental significance) and RFA Act are examined in Chapters 2 and 3 respectively. Research questions and hypotheses are then developed to test the Tasmanian RFA against the above two statutory aims...|$|R

30|$|Three major {{research}} initiatives involving durable eucalypts in New Zealand have been initiated {{in the last}} two decades. The Forest Research Institute (Scion) and the New Zealand <b>Forestry</b> Association <b>undertook</b> a series of trials on eucalypts with stringy bark. However, these were either discontinued {{due to a lack of}} funding or have a narrow genetic base (van Ballekom and Millen 2017). The New Zealand Dryland Forests Initiative (NZDFI) has been working since 2008 to establish a eucalypt forest industry producing naturally durable timber based on a large scale-breeding programme of three species E. bosistoana F.Muell., E. quadrangulata H. Deane & Maiden and E. globoidea (Millen 2009). This breeding programme took a range of wood-quality traits into account (including low growth-stress). While primarily chosen for the natural durability of their heartwood, these species also produce wood of high stiffness - up to 20  GPa (Bootle 2005). Demand for engineered timber products with exceptional stiffness has been generated by the emergence of high-rise timber buildings (Van de Kuilen et al. 2011). These species also have naturally durable heartwood so it may be possible to produce preservative-free durable LVL (McKenzie 1993; Page and Singh 2014). Some information on the wood properties of E. bosistoana, E. quadrangulata and E. globoidea is available from old-growth resources in Australia (Bootle 2005), but only young plantation-grown E. globoidea has been studied previously in New Zealand. Eucalyptus globoidea has been reported to be well suited for plantation forestry with good tree health, growth and adaptability combined with favourable timber properties of good stiffness and natural durability (Barr 1996; Haslett 1990; Millner 2006). Additionally, it is easy to dry and has relatively low growth-stress levels (Jones et al. 2010; Poynton 1979). No information on peeling parameters, veneer drying or bonding has been reported for this species, however.|$|R

The programme is undertaking an international comparative analysis of cases of forest product development, and a series of thematic case-based research projects designed to answer specific questions. An example is provided from a case study in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, where a traditional rattan cultivation system has been severely stressed by a combination of policy and economic factors. Government policies designed to encourage the domestic processing industry and monopsonistic manufacturing association have sharply depressed demand and prices. Other factors such as development of roads, industrial plantations, mining, and other economic activities offered alternatives that have led some rattan farmers to shift to new activities. And, recent wide spread of forest fires have destroyed large areas of rattan gardens, effectively forcing some rattan farmers out of business. This set of conditions offers a good opportunity to study people's responses and to analyse wheter and under what circumtances this particular intermediate forest product management system is a viable economic option now and in the future. As rattan remains an important commodity in Indonesia and internationally, and as the current farm-gate price for rattan appears to be artificially low, {{due in large part to}} the prevailing policy environment, the rattan garden system may remain viable, at least in the medium term...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{emissions}} from deforestation and forest degradation and enhancing forest carbon stocks (REDD+) is gaining traction in Cameroon. However, given the deep-rooted trans-sectoral drivers of forest loss, enforcing REDD+ policies will require major policy change and reform {{both within and}} beyond the forestry sector. In this paper, we view the REDD+ policy arena in Cameroon within a political economy framework and conduct policy network analysis to explore the factors that will enable or hinder efforts to implement the broad policy change required to realize REDD+. As the REDD+ context is shaped by the history of Cameroon's forestry sector, we draw lessons for REDD+ from the <b>forestry</b> law reform <b>undertaken</b> in 1994. We focus our analysis on three factors considered necessary for REDD+ success: (i) autonomy of the nation state from interests behind deforestation and forest degradation, (ii) national ownership over reform processes, and (iii) inclusiveness of policy processes. We find that the REDD+ policy process in Cameroon is repeating the weaknesses of the earlier forestry law reform, {{as seen in the}} minimal ownership of REDD+ by national actor groups and low inclusiveness among domestic actors at both national and local levels, as well as the absence of a national coalition for REDD+. Furthermore, politics and private agendas are compromising state agencies' autonomy in making decisions about forest resources. Our findings suggest that responses to these weaknesses, as well as to inconsistencies between sectoral policies and to competition over forest resources, will determine whether REDD+ can induce change within and beyond Cameroon's forestry sector...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the great}} social, {{economic}} and environmental diversity in countries of Africa South of Sahara (SSA), forestry research issues and advances are quite similar. This is partly influenced by historical facts relating to forest resource ownership and management. In most countries, governments own and manage forest resources. Forestry research institutes are in many countries tiny departments or units tucked under huge ministries or agricultural research organisations. Their visibility, much less their effectiveness, is barely significant, because they are poorly staffed and financed. The little available forestry research capacity is poorly managed. The few competent researchers are increasingly involved in administrative functions and looking for greener pastures. Economic policies imposed by global financial institutions constrain the recruitment of young scientists to <b>undertake</b> <b>forestry</b> research {{now and in the}} future. Although universities are much better resourced, their efforts are rarely linked with national research issues. They operate independently, far removed from real world issues. Through the intervention of some global stakeholders, some research institutes have developed their research agendas, but these have largely remained on the shelf for lack of implementation resources. Most ongoing work is donor-driven. There is a serious gap between forestry research and development. Research institutes do not have the capacity to extend their findings and are not properly linked with agricultural extension services or NGOs to get their messages to stakeholders, especially farmers. This delimits the usefulness of the little that could trickle from forestry research. This paper briefly discusses these issues and makes some recommendations. It is clear that SA countries and the global community {{have a role to play}} to redress the situation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the incidence, nature and determinants of non-fatal occupational injuries in British agriculture. METHODS: As {{part of a}} postal survey, data on lifetime histories of work in agriculture and occupational accidents were obtained from men born between 1933 and 1977 and residing in three rural areas of England and Wales. Incidence rates for different categories of accident were compared with those derived from statutory reporting. Associations with risk factors were explored by Poisson regression, and summarised by incidence rate ratios (IRRs). RESULTS: Of the 10 765 responders (response rate = 31 %), 3238 (30 %) reported at least one occupational accident at the ages of 14 - 64 years, leading to absence from work for >or= 3 days, including 1492 accidents that could be linked to a specific job listed {{in the history of}} agricultural work. The reported incidence of injuries in agriculture was markedly higher than that derived from statutory reporting, particularly for self-employed farmers. During 1996 - 2003, the highest rates of agricultural accidents were from handling, lifting or carrying (4. 9 / 1000 person-years), falls from a height (4. 6 / 1000 person-years) and injury by animals (3. 4 / 1000 person-years). After adjustment for calendar period and age, the risk of accidents was elevated in men who had only recently entered agricultural work (IRR 3. 7, 95 % CI 2. 7 to 5. 1 for men who had worked in agriculture for up to 1 year relative to those who had entered the industry > 25 years earlier), and in those who carried out forestry (IRR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 5 to 1. 9). CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the substantial underascertainment of serious accidental injuries in agriculture through statutory reporting, particularly for the self-employed. The risk of accidents is highest in new recruits to the industry and in those <b>undertaking</b> <b>forestry,</b> and these groups should be a target for further preventive action...|$|R
40|$|In a {{situation}} of language endangerment, communities express a strong need for the documentation and preservation of their language which is increasingly threatened as the older generations of monolinguals pass away. This paper presents the documentation project of Innu, an endangered Algonquian language spoken by roughly 13, 000 people in 11 communities spread out over Northeastern Quebec and Labrador in Canada. It will specifically address the issues related to retrieving and converting {{a large body of}} existing linguistic materials into digital format, and making old language records available {{for the benefit of the}} people in their efforts of revitalization. Since the beginning of the 20 th century, hydroelectric, mining and <b>forestry</b> projects are <b>undertaken</b> on the ancestral lands of the Innus. Many of these projects were carried out without their consent. However, since the late seventies, strategies for successful negotiations with government and private developers include discussions with the Innus to ensure a constructive dialogue with the province's economic development partners. Innu Elders play a critical role in these exercises by providing traditional ecological knowledge, e. g. about waterways, and documenting where people hunt, fish, trap, gather and camp. The outcome of these surveys constitutes precious information about the Innu culture, traditions, as well as language, since many of the Elders were monolinguals. As an illustration, in the early eighties, the Attikamek-Innu Council led a major investigation on territorial use and occupancy. The collected material comprises the testimony of more than 400 Innus and over one thousand hours of recordings. This documentation and all other existing analog records are precious for the collective memory and history of the Innu communities, and need to be located, retrieved, digitalised, and archived for the long-term sustainability of the language. We undertook this enterprise in partnership with the Innu Cultural Institute. With the constitution of an archive comprising old records and original materials, the Innu language documentation project aims to make an important contribution to the ongoing developments in language documentation research and a major step in building a valuable tool for language maintenance and revitalization...|$|R

Much <b>forestry</b> work was <b>undertaken</b> during the period 1915-1919 but there was still very little to show yet except {{beautiful}} clumps of lilies and cannas on the hillsides. Grave mounds, or [...] "pimples", as they were known, plus innumerable jars of human bones, existed on many of the fairways, but these were for the most part removed in 1920 {{as the result of a}} generous grant through Sir Henry May of $50,000, which was paid out as compensation to the families owning them. There was a particularly large number of the [...] "jars" [...] at the base of the [...] "saddle" [...] or, as it is known today, [...] "Tommy Tucker" [...] (derived from the Cantonese [...] "Mm ta-ka (唔得㗎)" [...] - don't strike). These jars unfortunately were in direct line from the tee and got broken one by one by duffed tee-shots. The penalty for picking out was one stroke but the picking was usually left to the caddie. Trees were conspicuous by their absence, but then so was the grass on the fairways which were more rolled mud than anything else. This made the fairways very dusty especially on a windy day. The Greens were turfed with local grass, much of it 'cabbage', which made putting difficult whilst a great deal of trouble was constantly experienced from worms which fed upon the young fresh roots and didn't give the Green keepers a chance.

Greenhill to work out with Mr. Kerr (who had been general manager of the Club since 1914 and resided in the Orme Bungalow) on a new lay out and new bunkering.
