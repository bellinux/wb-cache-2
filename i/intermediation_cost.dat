Non-existence of equilibrium in economies without intermediation costs with price dependent assets is well-known: the price-dependence of return permits a drop in rank of the income-transfer mapping.

Further the competitive equilibra without intermediation costs can be obtained by a suitable choice of a non-zero intermediation costfunction...|$|E

40|$|This paper studies quantitatively how <b>intermediation</b> <b>costs</b> affect {{household}} consumption {{loans and}} welfare. Agents face uninsurable idiosyncratic shocks to labor productivity in a production economy with costly financial intermediation and a natural borrowing limit. Reducing <b>intermediation</b> <b>costs</b> leads to two effects: First, {{for a given}} interest rate, borrowing costs decrease, which improves the ability of agents to smooth consumption overtime. Second, the demand for loans increases, which increases the interest rate. The aggregate welfare gain of reducing <b>intermediation</b> <b>costs</b> from 3. 927 percent (US level) to 1 percent is about 1. 14 percent of equivalent consumption in the baseline economy for an endogenous interest rate and and 1. 90 for an exogenous interest rate.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a search-theoretic model {{to study the}} interaction between banking and monetary policy and how this interaction affects the allocation and welfare. Regarding how banking affects the welfare costs of inflation: First, we find that, with banking, inflation generates smaller welfare costs. Second, we show that, lowering inflation improves welfare not just by reducing consumption/production distortions, but also by avoiding intermediation costs. Therefore, understanding the nature of <b>intermediation</b> <b>cost</b> is critical for accurately assessing the welfare gain of lowering the inflation target. Regarding how monetary policy affects the welfare effects of banking: First, banking always improves efficiency of production, but the banking technology has to be efficient to improve welfare (especially in low inflation economy). Second, welfare effects of banking depend on monetary policy. For low inflation, banking is not active. For high inflation, banking is active and improves welfare. For moderate inflation, banking is active but reduces welfare. Owing to general equilibrium feedback, banking is supported in equilibrium even though welfare is higher without banking.

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} {{the existence of}} a stationary equilibrium and a procedure to compute solutions to a class of dynamic general equilibrium models with two important features. First, occupational choice is determined endogenously as a function of heterogeneous agent type, which is defined by an agent’s managerial ability and capital bequest. Heterogeneous ability is exogenous and independent across generations. In contrast, bequests link generations and the distribution of bequests evolves endogenously. Second, there is a financial market for capital loans with a deadweight <b>intermediation</b> <b>cost</b> and a repayment incentive constraint. The incentive constraint induces a non convexity. The paper proves that the competitive equilibrium can be characterized by the bequest distribution and factor prices, and uses the monotone mixing condition to ensure that the stationary bequest distribution that arises from the agent’s optimal behavior across generations exists and is unique. The paper next constructs a direct, non-parametric approach to compute the stationary solution. The method reduces the domain of the policy function, thus reducing the computational complexity of the problem. ...|$|E

40|$|I build {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} financial accelerator model that incorporates an explicit {{technology for the}} intermediary sector. A credit multiplier emerges because of a borrowing constraint that {{is a function of}} asset prices, internal funds and lending rates. With this financial friction I show that small changes in the productivity and <b>intermediation</b> <b>costs</b> of banks generate large and persistent fluctuations in economy activity. The transmission channel relies on the role that assets and internal funds play as collateral. After a negative shock hits financial intermediation productivity, the resulting credit crunch and economic slowdown induce a fall in asset prices and internal fund accumulation. This further modifies the present and future volume of collateral, thereby amplifying and propagating the initial shock. I argue that changes in banking regulation in Colombia in the late 1990 's increased <b>intermediation</b> <b>costs,</b> reduced banking productivity and induced a credit channel story that fits the theoretical model presented here. This new regulation enhanced the credit crunch and economic slowdown that was already underway.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{financial}} sector restructuring started in Pakistan during early 1990 s. For this purpose, international financial institutions, like World Bank and ADB, provided technical and financial resources. The {{objective of this}} exercise was to let financial system play its role in economic growth {{and development of the}} country in an efficient and competitive way. A lot of policy decisions have been made and implemented during the last decade to reduce distortions and to develop competitive price mechanism in the financial markets. The process of restructuring is still going on and it is a bit earlier to say some final words about its success, however, we are able to say, {{on the basis of the}} trend the financial and other indicators are following, that we have been partially successful in achieving the set objectives. The competition among financial institutions has been intensified during the restructuring period. Some positive developments have also been witnessed on the front of money and foreign exchange markets. Though there are some improvements, yet there is a lot to do for strengthening of insurance sector, capital market and bond market. The whole exercise remained less effective in increasing financial deepening, and in reducing <b>intermediation</b> <b>cost</b> (i. e., interest rate spread). Until end of 1990 s, policy of privatization of NCBs and drive for recovery of NPLs could not be pursued vigorously and NPLs continued to grow. During the last three years some considerable efforts have been made for privatization of NCBs. Only recently, the size of the NPLs has started to stabilize due to some intensified recovery efforts and better quality of new loans. The size of the NPLs is primarily responsible for the deteriorated health of financial institutions. The overall macroeconomic outcome is also against the expectations. Macroeconomic stability as well as proper sequencing of restructuring measures are necessary preconditions to the success of the whole exercise. In Pakistan, the financial restructuring process was introduced in an environment of large budget deficit and high and variable inflation i. e., in an atmosphere of macro-economic instability. Frequent changes in political set up of the country during 1990 s also adversely affected this process. However, in the present milieu of political and economic management, it is expected that financial sector will be able to play its due role in economic growth and efficiency as the governance structure is improving, consistency in economic policies is being ensured, and political stability is envisaged. ...|$|E

Occupational choice and firm size are determined endogenously, and depend on agent type (wealth and ability) and the credit market frictions. The mo deI shows that differences across countries in <b>intermediation</b> <b>costs</b> and enforcement generate differences in occupational choice, firm size, credit, output and inequality. Counterfactual experiments are performed for Latin American, European, transition and high growth Asian countries. We use empirical estimates of each country's financiaI frictions, and United States values for all other parameters. The results allow us to isolate the quantitative effect of these financiaI frictions in explaining the performance gap between each country and the United States.
