5|$|The {{attack on}} Orsonga began at 3:30pm, {{following}} a half-hour artillery bombardment, and marked the battalion's first battle on Italian soil. Although initially some progress was made, the Germans {{managed to hold}} Orsonga throughout December amidst intense <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting.</b> Finally, the Māoris were withdrawn from the line {{on the night of}} 15/16 January 1944 when they were relieved by an Indian unit. Over the course of the battle, they had lost 11 men killed and 222 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{heaviest}} Allied {{losses were}} {{suffered by the}} British infantry of XX Corps (which lost 116 killed in action), although {{the total number of}} the British force killed during the battle was 171. The 4th Light Horse Brigade suffered a total of 35 killed and 39 wounded; of these, the 12th Light Horse Regiment suffered 20 killed and 19 wounded. Most of the wounded light horsemen fell during the charge, with the high percentage of killed-to-wounded occurring during <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> in the trenches.|$|E
5|$|The savage <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> in {{the railway}} {{buildings}} and sidings lasted {{for more than}} an hour before the light horsemen captured the area. Over 20 Ottoman and German soldiers were killed in the station buildings alone during the fighting. At the same time, 'C' Squadron, of the 11th Light Horse Regiment, and/or one squadron of the 12th Light Horse Regiment, moved up into the village of Samakh and captured the town during less severe fighting.|$|E

50|$|The {{remaining}} soldiers repel {{a massive}} frontal assault, inflicting grievous losses on the attacking Japanese, ultimately <b>fighting</b> <b>hand-to-hand</b> with bayonets fixed on their M1903 Springfield rifles. Epps and Feingold are killed. Only Dane, Todd and a wounded Purckett are left.|$|R

5|$|El-Qantarah {{also saw}} heavy {{fighting}} as {{troops from the}} 18th Division engaged Israeli forces within and around the town. By early morning the division commander, Brigadier General Fuad 'Aziz Ghali, was able to set up his command post there. Close quarter combat and even <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> took place as the Egyptians cleared the ghost town building by building. Fighting was intense, {{and by the end}} of October 7, the town and its outskirts as well as two nearby fortifications of the Bar Lev Line were under Egyptian control.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December, the 16th Battalion Devonshire Regiment, 229th Brigade, 74th (Yeomanry) Division recaptured Beit Ur el Foqa. This {{infantry}} {{attack was}} launched {{from the head}} of the Wadi Zeit at 01:00, and by 03:30 the village had been captured, along with 17 prisoners and three machine guns. The position was impossible to hold, as it was overlooked by Ottoman positions on higher ground. Bombing and <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> continued all morning, and the battalion withdrew, suffering 300 casualties. It has been claimed that on 3 December the Ottoman Army had abandoned their counterattacks and that fighting in the Judean Hills ceased.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate army {{made several}} other {{attempts}} {{to cross the}} trench during the night but repeatedly failed. Although the confederates could have deployed their infantry over the whole length of the trench, they were unwilling to engage the Muslims at close quarter as the former regarded the latter as superior in <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting.</b> As the Muslim army was well dug in behind the embankment made from the earth which {{had been taken from}} the ditch and prepared to bombard attackers with stones and arrows, any attack could cause great casualties.|$|E

50|$|Black {{soldiers}} from the British Empire rarely saw front-line action during the First World War; they were usually assigned logistical or support roles for their white comrades. Blackman, however, saw action against the Germans and the Turks, <b>fighting</b> <b>hand-to-hand</b> in many cases, before returning to Barbados via the British base in Taranto, Italy.|$|R
5|$|German {{infantry}} {{were spotted}} advancing towards the brigade box and were bombarded by heavy artillery, which repulsed the attack. Around 09:00, more infantry attacked {{the box and}} came too close for artillery fire. <b>Hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> began and a British platoon was overrun before a tank-infantry counter-attack repulsed the German infantry and restored the position. The Germans resorted to harassing fire, sniping, mortar bombardments and heavy artillery fire. After a long artillery bombardment, simultaneous attacks by tanks and infantry were made at 19:00, {{from the north and}} south, which broke into the box and closed on the brigade headquarters, before being driven back around 22:30.|$|E
5|$|Mackay {{graduated}} from the University of Sydney in 1904 and taught physics there from 1910 until 1914, {{when he joined the}} Australian Imperial Force shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. He served with the 4th Infantry Battalion at Gallipoli, where he distinguished himself in <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> at the Battle of Lone Pine. In April 1916, he assumed command of the 4th Infantry Battalion on the Western Front and led it at the Battle of Pozières, Battle of Bullecourt and Battle of Broodseinde. He was promoted to brigadier general in June 1918, and led the 1st Infantry Brigade at the Battle of Hazebrouck, the Battle of Amiens and in the attack on the Hindenburg Line.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough {{now had to}} {{turn his}} {{attention}} from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> gradually forced the French towards the village centre, {{in and around the}} walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvière. Colonel Belville's Hanoverians were fed into the battle to steady the resolve of the dragoons, and once more went to the attack. The Allied progress was slow and hard, and like the defenders, they suffered many casualties.|$|E

60|$|That very evening an {{opportunity}} occurred for Rob to win glory {{in the eyes}} of his new friends. Just before sundown the gates of the city flew open and a swarm of Turks, mounted upon fleet horses and camels, issued forth and fell upon their enemies. The Tatars, who did not expect the sally, were scarcely able to form an opposing rank when they found themselves engaged in a <b>hand-to-hand</b> conflict, <b>fighting</b> desperately for their lives. In such a battle, however, the Turks were at a disadvantage, for the active Tatars slipped beneath their horses and disabled them, bringing both the animals and their riders to the earth.|$|R
50|$|The Thing is an {{exceptionally}} skilled pilot, {{due to his}} time spent as a test pilot in the United States Air Force and as {{a founding member of}} the Fantastic Four. He is also a formidable and relentless <b>hand-to-hand</b> combatant. His <b>fighting</b> style incorporates elements of boxing, wrestling, judo, jujitsu, and street-fighting techniques, as well as hand-to-hand combat training from the military.|$|R
5|$|The {{substantial}} two storied station building, solidly build of stone, made {{an effective}} strong redoubt for the garrison, {{with the windows}} used by the defenders to fire their automatic rifles and throw their grenades from. At this time several white flags were reported at the station, but when the light horsemen approached they were fired on, {{and it was in}} this way that most of the light horsemen who died during the battle were killed. Once they succeeded in entering the station buildings, <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> from room-to-room with rifles, bayonets, and swords, followed. Other groups of defenders deployed in the locomotives, tenders and carriages standing in the railway sidings, were also attacked.|$|E
5|$|To recover lost ground, the PVA 45th Division {{commander}} Cui Jiangong {{attempted a}} sneak attack with three infantry companies by 7 pm. When flares broke the night cover, the attackers launched bayonet charges and <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> ensued. The UN forces responded with heavy artillery fire, but the determined Chinese assault troops marched through both Chinese and UN artillery screens {{to reach the}} UN positions – a strange sight that made some American observers believe that the attackers were {{under the influence of}} drugs. The intense fighting prevented UN forces from receiving any resupply, and the UN defenders were forced to give up all captured ground after running out of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge 2 is a {{role-playing}} {{game where}} the player's choice of answers during conversations with non-player characters affects how the player is regarded amongst the game's four factions. The player character is an apprentice Shaper, a feared and secretive group who can create life. Players create a character {{from one of}} three character classes and explore the area surrounding Drypeak, a failing Shaper colony, solving quests and gaining experience. Each of the three character classes has a particular playing style and can approach tasks in different ways. Guardians are fighters who excel in standard combat skills, especially <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting.</b> They are capable of shaping creations, but have little affinity for magic. Agents are the game's version of rogues, and excel in spell casting and are capable of hand-to-hand combat. The Shaper is a summoner, capable of creating living creatures by using their own life essence. Shapers rely on their creations for protection. Players can also convince certain non-player characters to join them.|$|E
50|$|Burgundy {{ordered the}} assault, which landed on Prussian cavalry squadrons under Dubislav Gneomar von Natzmer. Although hard {{fighting}} ensued, {{the attack was}} dispersed. Then, Vendôme made a dubious decision and led an attack of twelve regiments, <b>fighting</b> <b>hand-to-hand</b> with a half-pike. This meant that while one commander (Burgundy) was in his headquarters, with no view of the battle, the other was fighting, with no possibility of control.|$|R
25|$|Charlie Company's Third Platoon, {{holding the}} {{sector of the}} {{perimeter}} marked by Bunkers 9-13, also took heavy losses. The platoon leader, 1LT Barry McGee, was killed <b>fighting</b> <b>hand-to-hand</b> with sappers, and the teams coming through that sector moved on to attack both the 155mm howitzer position on the high ground to the northwest and the supply elements near the main resupply helipad. The sappers destroyed a number of structures near the pad, killing or wounding a number of Headquarters personnel in the process.|$|R
50|$|Though in {{some ways}} the same as The Adventures of Robin Hood, a brave bowman {{fighting}} against a tyrant, this was a harder show with crossbow bolts killing people and Tell <b>fighting</b> <b>hand-to-hand,</b> which often resulted in the death of the bad guy. Unlike the courtly Sheriff of Nottingham, Gessler was a pig of a man, unshaven, often eating or drinking without manners and throwing his metaphorical as well as literal weight around. The series was re-run well into the 1960s.|$|R
5|$|Howe {{fired his}} signal guns at 09:00 and the Hessians began to attack up Battle Pass, while the main army came at Sullivan from the rear. Sullivan left his advance guard {{to hold off}} the Hessians while he turned {{the rest of his}} force around to fight the British. Heavy {{casualties}} mounted between the Americans and the British, and men on both sides fled out of fear. Sullivan attempted to calm his men and tried to lead a retreat. By this point, the Hessians had overrun the advance guard on the heights and the American left had completely collapsed. <b>Hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> followed, with the Americans swinging their muskets and rifles like clubs to save their own lives. Many of the Americans who surrendered were bayoneted by the Hessians. Sullivan, despite the chaos, managed to evacuate most of his men to Brooklyn Heights though he himself was captured.|$|E
5|$|The 2/14th Battalion {{had been}} {{dispatched}} from Myola on foot on 25 August, with orders {{to relieve the}} 39th. A company reached their position at Isurava {{in the middle of}} the afternoon on 26 August, while others deployed to Alola and Templeton's Crossing. However, the 39th was forced to remain in location while the 2/14th's companies moved into position one by one, as several times the Japanese threatened to break through the perimeter. It was not until last light on 27 August that the 39th moved into a reserve location to the rear of Isurava. Throughout the day, heavy close quarters fighting had taken place around Isurava, while on the right flank <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> had seen both the Australians and Japanese assume cautious defensive postures. Probing attacks continued around Isurava that night as the Japanese sought to test the Australian defences for weaknesses amidst a heavy torrential downpour.|$|E
5|$|The South Africans and Rhodesians {{launched}} a two-pronged {{assault on the}} German positions over the road to Bologna at 22:30 on 15 April 1945. The Cape Town Highlanders' advance up the steep cliffs of Monte Sole was obstructed by a German minefield that guarded the peak. The Rhodesian officer commanding the leading platoon, Second Lieutenant GB Mollett, took a section of men and dashed through the minefield to the summit; for this he later received the Distinguished Service Order. <b>Hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> on Monte Sole continued until dawn, when the Germans withdrew. The Witwatersrand Rifles meanwhile took Monte Caprara. The Cape Town Highlanders took Monte Abelle late on 16 April, advancing under heavy artillery fire to the summit before clearing it of Germans. The regiment lost 31 killed and 76 wounded during these actions, including three Rhodesians killed and three wounded.|$|E
50|$|Toad's primary mutant {{ability is}} a superhuman leaping ability {{that allows him}} to leap many times higher and farther than an {{ordinary}} human. He possesses some degree of superhuman strength and endurance, primarily concentrated in his lower torso and legs, which grants him his superior leaping abilities. His vertebral column and skeletal structure are unusually flexible, enabling him to remain in a constant crouching position and contort his body into unusual position without injury or strain. In his first appearances, Toad had very little knowledge of <b>hand-to-hand</b> combat, <b>fighting</b> mainly by kicking wildly and by leaping about and attempting to land on his opponents (as Toad once weighed over 250 lbs this could be potentially harmful). Recently, he has demonstrated a better sense of combat and a leaner physique, using both his leaping ability and his elongated prehensile tongue to his advantage.|$|R
25|$|The Kentuckians {{began to}} flee down the hill, <b>fighting</b> <b>hand-to-hand</b> with Indians who had flanked them. McGary rode up to Boone's company {{and told him}} {{everyone}} was retreating and that Boone was now surrounded. Boone ordered his men to retreat. He grabbed a riderless horse and ordered his 23-year-old son, Israel Boone, to mount it. He then turned {{to look for a}} horse for himself. Israel suddenly fell to the ground, shot through the neck. Boone realized his son was dead, mounted the horse and joined in the retreat.|$|R
50|$|Hit-Girl {{has been}} trained to take a bullet (while wearing a {{bulletproof}} vest), {{as well as in}} <b>hand-to-hand</b> combat and <b>fighting</b> with both blunt and bladed weapons. She has also been taught about guns, inventors of guns, and even action movies and action movie stars. The nature of Hit-Girl's training has made her particularly brutal and remorseless in combat. Her physicality and skill set are, {{with the possible exception of}} Mother Russia, virtually unmatched by any character since Big Daddy's demise, making Hit Girl the most powerful and skilled character in the Kick-Ass universe.|$|R
5|$|The first {{operation}} {{involving the}} 6th Airlanding Brigade followed two attacks by the Palmach on coastguard stations over {{the night of}} 24/25November. Palestine Police Force dogs tracked the attackers to the settlements of Rishpon and Sidna Ali. In the following cordon and search operation, the police were stoned by the inhabitants, and the soldiers on the cordon had to prevent reinforcements from other settlements reaching the villages. The next day, 26November, the police were involved in <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> with the villagers and eventually withdrew, calling on the brigade to enter the settlements and enforce law and order. Leaving some men behind on the cordon {{to hold back the}} estimated 3,000 crowd, the remainder of the brigade entered the settlements. Here they carried out several baton charges {{and for the first time}} used tear gas to disperse the crowds. In the cleanup operation, 900 persons were later arrested.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of Magaw's outer lines {{to the south and}} east of the fort, the general American retreat towards the perceived safety of the fort took place. To the south, the third defensive line had never been completed so Cadwalader had nowhere left to retreat to except the fort. To the north, the riflemen under Rawlings still held, but barely, as there were fewer riflemen than before and because the increased amount of firing had jammed some of the men's weapons, some of the men were forced to push boulders down the hill at the attacking Hessians. The American battery at Fort Washington was silenced by Pearl. By this time, the riflemen's fire had almost ceased, and the Hessians slowly advanced up the hill and engaged the Americans in <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting.</b> Overpowering the Americans, the Hessians {{reached the top of the}} hill and swarmed into the redoubt with a bayonet charge, capturing it quickly.|$|E
5|$|Yet {{even as the}} Americans were {{attempting}} to clear the tunnels, heavy <b>hand-to-hand</b> <b>fighting</b> broke out above ground and Haldane was later awarded the Silver Star for his actions when he rushed a bunker while under fire armed only with a pistol, {{in order to give}} first aid to a number of wounded soldiers. His courage inspired his men to complete the assault, and ultimately helped ensure the successful evacuation of the casualties and the capture of their objective. That evening the battalions of US 3rd Infantry Brigade had completed searching their assigned area of operation, and the following morning they were withdrawn from the operation. The brigade's involvement in Crimp had been limited, losing six killed and 45 wounded, while 22 Viet Cong had been killed. It was subsequently redeployed on Operation Buckskin.|$|E
