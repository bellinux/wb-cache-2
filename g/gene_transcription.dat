5|$|Late LTP (L-LTP) is {{the natural}} {{extension}} of E-LTP. Unlike E-LTP, which is independent of protein synthesis, L-LTP requires <b>gene</b> <b>transcription</b> and protein synthesis in the postsynaptic cell. Two phases of L-LTP exist: the first depends upon protein synthesis, while the second depends upon both <b>gene</b> <b>transcription</b> and protein synthesis. These phases are occasionally called LTP2 and LTP3, respectively, with E-LTP referred to as LTP1 under this nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{sequences}} (siRNA and miRNA) {{that are}} complementary {{to parts of}} a promoter can increase <b>gene</b> <b>transcription,</b> a phenomenon dubbed RNA activation. Part of the mechanism for how these RNA upregulate genes is known: dicer and argonaute are involved, possibly via histone demethylation. miRNAs have been proposed to upregulate their target genes upon cell cycle arrest, via unknown mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of <b>gene</b> <b>transcription,</b> while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E

40|$|Transcription of both {{nuclear and}} plastid genes {{encoding}} components of photosynthetic apparatus {{is subjected to}} redox regulation. The origin of redox signals mediating this regulation is chloroplast electron transport chain (ETC) itself. Up to date the effects of redox state of individual ETC components on chloroplast <b>genes</b> <b>transcription</b> rate was demonstrated only for some selected genes and only in isolated chloroplasts. In the present work ETC inhibitors was used for in vivo modulations in plastoquinone pool redox state, and run-on transcription approach {{was used to evaluate}} the plastid <b>genes</b> <b>transcription</b> rate. We have demonstrated that plastoquinone redox state has impact on transcription rate of wide range of Arabidopsis chloroplast genes. Treatment by DCMU (plastoquinone pool is oxidized) lead to increase of transcription rate of the majority of plastid genes studied. Treatment by DBMIB (plastoquinone pool is reduced) lead to decrease of plastid <b>genes</b> <b>transcription</b> rate. Simultaneous treatment by one of photosynthesis inhibitors and KCN (mitochondrial respiratory complex IV inhibitor) lead to decrease of transcription rate of plastid genes in most cases.

5|$|The type-IV {{secretion}} apparatus also injects the cag PAI-encoded protein CagA {{into the}} stomach's epithelial cells, where it disrupts the cytoskeleton, adherence to adjacent cells, intracellular signaling, cell polarity, and other cellular activities. Once inside the cell, the CagA protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues {{by a host}} cell membrane-associated tyrosine kinase (TK). CagA then allosterically activates protein tyrosine phosphatase/protooncogene Shp2. Pathogenic strains of H. pylori {{have been shown to}} activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a membrane protein with a TK domain. Activation of the EGFR by H. pylori is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis. A C-terminal region of the CagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) has also been suggested to be able to regulate host cell <b>gene</b> <b>transcription,</b> independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. A great deal of diversity exists between strains of H. pylori, and the strain that infects a person can predict the outcome.|$|E
5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal <b>gene</b> <b>transcription.</b> If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E

Here, we report that murine bone marrow HPCs activation by the vascular Notch Delta 4 ligand maintains a significant proportion of cells specifically in the G 0 state. Furthermore, Delta 4 /Notch pathway limits significantly the loss of the in vivo short-term reconstitutive potential upon transplantation of Delta- 4 activated HPCs into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Both effects are directly correlated with the decrease of cell cycle <b>genes</b> <b>transcription</b> such as CYCLIN-D 1, − D 2, and -D 3, and the upregulation of stemness related <b>genes</b> <b>transcription</b> such as BMI 1, GATA 2, HOXB 4 and C-MYC.

In particular, the group focussed on the accumulation of nicotinic receptors in the post-synaptic region upon development, concommitent to a switch of receptor identity. They were able to decrypt the different signalling pathways involved in the response to synaptic activity, showing that the accumulation resulted from an inhibition of <b>gene</b> <b>transcription</b> outside the synaptic region due to electrical activity triggering an uptake of calcium and activation of PKC, and a stimulation of <b>gene</b> <b>transcription</b> at the synapse by the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) activating PKA and the ARIA (heregulin) activating tyrosine kinase cascades.|$|E

50|$|An Alarmone is an {{intracellular}} signal molecule that {{is produced}} due to harsh environmental factors. They regulate the <b>gene</b> expression at <b>transcription</b> level.
