40|$|Quality {{problem or}} issue: In 2005 we were {{informed}} {{about the possibility of}} a systemic error in pathology diagnoses of ~ 7400 histological tests done between 4 and 6 years earlier. Initial assessment: We determined to undertake a lookback and apply principles of open disclosure to inform the affected community of ~ 200, 000 people. Choice of solution: The lookback included subjecting all cases to <b>independent</b> pathology <b>review.</b> The public announcement of the review included an unreserved apology and took place before the results of the re-examination of the pathology specimens were known. Implementation: The lookback involved the simultaneous implementation of five critical elements: leadership and governance, risk assessment and planning, implementation of the <b>independent</b> <b>review,</b> <b>procedures</b> for patient care and communication and open disclosure. Protocols were developed to care for those patients whose original test results were found to be incorrect. Evaluation: The original result for > 200 patients was incorrect, and 38 had experienced clinical consequences. There was no public panic as a result of the wide open disclosure. Few related legal claims or complaints were made. The impact of the pathology diagnostic error has continued to 2011 for some patients. Lessons learned: Openly disclosing a risk of widespread error meant the community could be supported with information and medical management as needed. Credentialing and peer-review processes for senior staff must be precise and collegiate. Sometimes action has to take place even when the risk is ill defined. There are five critical elements in planning and implementing a large-scale lookback...|$|R

40|$|The Companies Act of 2008 {{introduces}} the <b>independent</b> <b>review</b> of financial statements of certain non-public interest companies {{as an alternative}} to the conventional audit. The audit of financial statements can only be performed by a Registered Auditor and is currently still required for all companies. The objective of the study is to determine the perceptions of Chartered Accountants (South Africa) regarding <b>independent</b> <b>reviews.</b> A questionnaire was used in order to obtain the perceptions of Chartered Accountants (South Africa) regarding <b>independent</b> <b>reviews.</b> This questionnaire covered the nature of an <b>independent</b> <b>review,</b> determinants of audit exemption, performing an <b>independent</b> <b>review,</b> and practitioners deemed competent to perform an <b>independent</b> <b>review.</b> The study also evaluated whether Chartered Accountants (South Africa), who are not allowed to perform audits, do in fact qualify to perform <b>independent</b> <b>reviews.</b> The respondents confirm the need for a principle-based stand-alone set of <b>independent</b> <b>review</b> standards as this is likely to clarify the terminology and to enhance the quality of reviews. The study also reveals that Chartered Accountants (South Africa) meet the requirements to perform <b>independent</b> <b>reviews.</b> However, the <b>Independent</b> Regulatory Board for Auditors should oversee the regulation of Chartered Accountants (South Africa) performing <b>independent</b> <b>reviews</b> to ensure that <b>independent</b> <b>reviews</b> are also performed in the public interest.

40|$|One of the {{provisions}} in the Companies Act 2008 which is particularly significant to the auditing profession in South Africa is {{the introduction of the}} <b>independent</b> <b>review</b> of financial statements of certain non-public interest companies {{as an alternative to the}} conventional audit of financial statements which is currently required for all companies. The Companies Act 2008 provides for regulations regarding <b>independent</b> <b>reviews</b> to be drawn up by the Minister. This article presents a background study and analysis of what constitutes an <b>independent</b> <b>review</b> in order to provide a better understanding of this alternative to an audit of a company’s annual financial statements. It seems that the Draft Regulations regarding which companies should be audited and which independently reviewed will achieve the Act’s primary objective of the protection of the public interest as they are primarily based on a company’s activities and not on quantitative thresholds such as turnover and assets. A robust and well designed set of assurance standards for <b>independent</b> <b>reviews</b> is needed to provide the necessary guidance to practitioners who will conduct <b>independent</b> <b>reviews.</b> Contrary to the requirements in the Draft Regulations, it is suggested that an <b>independent</b> <b>review</b> should be performed by a person who is a member in good standing of a professional body accredited by the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors, and no...|$|R
