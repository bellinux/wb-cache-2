25|$|The {{second point}} of {{contention}} between freewill and open theists is exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events. Freewill theists have traditionally affirmed {{what is known as}} simple foreknowledge according to which God, prior to creation, just “sees” or knows all that will ever happen in history. Sanders argues that the simple foreknowledge view has conflicts with types of biblical texts mentioned below and has two philosophical problems. The first problem is the old debate about whether or not divine foreknowledge entails determinism. Open theists argue that exhaustive definite foreknowledge is incompatible with the freewill of creatures. The other problem with simple foreknowledge is that it is useless for God to possess it since once <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> {{what is going to happen}} God cannot change it from happening. Sanders argues that simple foreknowledge cannot explain such things as prophecy, divine guidance, or why God did not prevent particular evils. Instead, open theists affirm “dynamic omniscience” (a term coined by Sanders). <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> all that has happened in the past and all that is happening in the present. <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> those future events that are determined to occur and <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> all that could possibly happen but does not know as definite what creatures with freewill will do. God has anticipatory knowledge (foresight) of what we are likely to do so God is not caught off-guard.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{note here}} that, for example, in Christianity (and {{even more in}} Judaism, where God is {{represented}} as talking to Job and explaining why he is just), God is already believed to have exposed himself very distinctly: for example to the Apostles who saw his resurrection. One theistic explanation of this might be that <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> some people wouldn't believe anyway but if <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> this before creating, {{there is a problem}} about God's liability for what is created. More fundamentally in relation to Murray's argument, there is the problem for orthodox believers of explaining the existence of Satan, a fallen angel who is obviously aware of God and yet, according to theistic scriptures, freely chose to rebel against God.|$|E

25|$|Many {{philosophers}} developed {{arguments for}} the existence of God, while attempting to comprehend the precise implications of God's attributes. Reconciling some of those attributes generated important philosophical problems and debates. For example, God's omniscience may seem to imply that <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> how free agents will choose to act. If God does know this, their ostensible free will might be illusory, or foreknowledge does not imply predestination, and if God does not know it, God may not be omniscient.|$|E
25|$|Over the centuries, many Christian {{scholars}} {{wrestled with}} {{the conflict between the}} belief in free will and its implied randomness, and the idea that <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> everything that happens. Saints Augustine and Aquinas tried to reach an accommodation between foreknowledge and free will, but Martin Luther argued against randomness and took the position that God's omniscience renders human actions unavoidable and determined. In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas viewed randomness not {{as the result of a}} single cause, but of several causes coming together by chance. While he believed in the existence of randomness, he rejected it as an explanation of the end-directedness of nature, for he saw too many patterns in nature to have been obtained by chance.|$|E

25|$|Although only twenty-five prophets are {{mentioned}} by {{name in the}} Qur'an, a hadith (no. 21257 in Musnad Ibn Hanbal) mentions that there were (more or less) 124,000 prophets in total throughout history. Other traditions place the number of prophets at 224,000. Some scholars hold that there are an even greater number {{in the history of}} mankind, and only <b>God</b> <b>knows.</b> The Qur'an says that God has sent a prophet to every group of people throughout time, and that Muhammad is the last of the prophets, sent for the whole of humankind. The message of all the prophets {{is believed to be the}} same. In Islam, all prophetic messengers are prophets (such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad) though not all prophets are prophetic messengers. The primary distinction is that a prophet is required to demonstrate God's law through his actions, character, and behavior without necessarily calling people to follow him, while a prophetic messenger is required to pronounce God's law (i.e. revelation) and call his people to submit and follow him. Muhammad is distinguished from the rest of the prophetic messengers and prophets in that he was commissioned by God to be the prophetic messenger to all of mankind. Many of these prophets are also found in the texts of Judaism (The Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings; collectively known as the Old Testament to Christians) and Christianity.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his life, Wrigley was an [...] "inveterate note-taker" [...] who {{compiled}} extensive documentation {{concerning the}} {{theory and practice of}} air power, on which he lectured among colleagues in the RAAF during the 1920s. The concepts that he propagated included air superiority, the need for an air force to be separate from the other branches of the armed services, control of the air as a means of carrying out offensive strikes, and the substitution of aerial forces for ground troops. While arguing for the independence of the air arm, Wrigley was quick to dispel any notion that it would simply [...] "arrive from <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> where, drop [...] bombs <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> where, and go off again <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> where"; rather it should act in concert with the army and navy in furtherance of government policy. He is thus credited with laying the foundations for the RAAF's modern air power doctrine, which would eventually be codified as the Air Power Manual in 1990. Wrigley's widow bequeathed twenty volumes of his writings, maps and photographs to the RAAF Museum at Point Cook after his death; they were edited and published by Air Commodore Brendan O'Loghlin and Wing Commander Alan Stephens in 1990 as The Decisive Factor: Air Power Doctrine by Air Vice-Marshal H.N. Wrigley. In 1996, Wrigley's former residence as commanding officer of RAAF Station Laverton prior to World WarII was christened Wrigley House in his honour. His name is also borne by Henry Wrigley Drive, approaching Darwin International Airport. In March 2010 the Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Mark Binskin, established the AVM H.N. Wrigley Prize for air power analysis, as part of the annual Chief of Air Force Essay Competition.|$|E

Fister ended up getting {{a job in the}} rotation (as did Vargas). On April 19, Fister took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the Baltimore Orioles until it was broken up by Nick Markakis' leadoff single. Although the Mariners suffered early season woes, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer praised Fister and fellow starter Jason Vargas as reasons for why the Mariners were not doing worse, stating, [...] "If Doug Fister and Jason Vargas hadn't been excellent at the back end of the rotation, <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> where this club would be." ...|$|E
500|$|After Alberta's {{two most}} {{prominent}} Liberals, Peter Talbot and Frank Oliver, {{made it clear}} that they were not interested, DeVeber considered himself as a possible candidate.

[...] DeVeber's belief that he may be appointed premier does not appear to have been well-founded: his opposition to the introduction of party lines earned him the enmity of some Liberals, not least because it aligned him with Haultain, a Conservative. [...] In the estimation of historian L. G. Thomas, DeVeber's fellow Liberals [...] "were not inclined to take him too seriously" [...] as a potential premier.|$|E
500|$|Although {{he was a}} striker, Dickov {{was better}} known for his {{tenacity}} than his goal-scoring exploits.

I am not the sort who gets the ball and is then going to beat five or six players and stick it in the top corner from <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> where. But, whether I'm playing well or not, the one thing you will get from me is 110 per cent, upsetting defenders and basically giving them pain." [...] Rio Ferdinand was mentioning his name as the biggest headache to deal with on the pitch. His combative approach resulted in Manchester City manager Joe Royle naming him [...] "The Wasp", and during his time at Leicester he was known as [...] "The Pest".|$|E

500|$|By 8 May a {{continuous}} southerly gale had driven the ship northwards, still {{locked in the}} ice, out of McMurdo Sound and into the open Ross Sea. In his diary for 9 May Stenhouse summarised Aurora's position: [...] "...fast in the pack and drifting <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> where [...] We are all in good health [...] we have good spirits and we will get through." [...] He recognised {{that this was the}} end of any hope of wintering the ship in McMurdo Sound, and expressed concern for the men at Cape Evans: [...] "It is a dismal prospect for them [...] we have the remaining Burberrys, clothing etc for next year's sledging still on board." [...] During the next two days the winds reached a force that made it impossible for the men to work on deck, but on 12 May the weather had moderated sufficiently for a temporary wireless aerial to be rigged, and Hooke began trying to contact the men ashore. His Morse messages failed to reach Cape Evans. Although the transmitter's range was normally no more than , Hooke attempted to raise the radio station at Macquarie Island, more than [...] away, again without success.|$|E
500|$|The pair {{initially}} traveled mainly over flat snowfields.

On 22 March a sextant observation showed that the pair had travelled [...] towards the pole at a daily average of over nine nautical miles (17km; 10mi). This had been achieved despite very low temperatures, typically around , and small scale mishaps including {{the loss of the}} sledgemeter that recorded mileage. However, as the surfaces became uneven and made skiing more difficult, their speeds slowed. A sextant reading on 29 March of 85°56′N indicated that a week's travel had brought them [...] nearer to the pole, but also showed that their average daily distances were falling. More worryingly, a theodolite reading that day suggested that they were at only 85°15′N, and they had no means of knowing which of the readings was correct. They realised that they were fighting a southerly drift, and that distances travelled did not necessarily equate to northerly progression.
