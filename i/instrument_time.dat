2500|$|In {{the first}} year of the airlift, inexperienced {{officers}} of the Services of Supply often ordered planes loaded until they were [...] "about full", ignorant of gross weight limitations or center of gravity placement, while most pilots were reserves recently called up from the airlines with little military transport experience and accustomed to civilian safety standards. As the airlift grew in size and scope in 1943, demands of tactical units and the failure of airline-conducted ATC training programs to produce sufficient multi-engined pilots limited nearly all reinforcement pilots to those just out of flight school or single-engine rated pilots from training fields who had relatively little <b>instrument</b> <b>time.</b> In December 1942, one-third of the 102 technical sergeant (non-commissioned officer) pilot training graduates of the Lubbock Field Class 42-I were immediately sent to India to fly the Hump as replacement co-pilots. This collective inexperience required ICW to create an in-theater OTU near Karachi to qualify new arrivals, taking 16 experienced pilots and eight to ten aircraft away from the airlift. CNAC pilots, while accustomed to a variety of aircraft, also had little instrument experience, and most were unfamiliar with the large American transport aircraft used in the airlift. Not until 1944, when the ATC recruited high hour civilian flight instructors released by the AAF in pilot training program cutbacks, and the 3rd OTU at Reno AAF (Nevada) turned out a growing number of C-46 crews, were highly qualified replacements more readily available for the airlift.|$|E

50|$|Note: Hours {{can often}} be earned {{concurrently}} and are cumulative. For example, after acquiring a private certificate, a pilot can get an instrument rating with an additional 30-40 hours of training (if, e.g., 10 hours of <b>instrument</b> <b>time</b> was logged during private training, which would count towards total aeronautical experience gained). In {{the course of the}} commercial pilot training, most pilots also receive their high-performance and complex endorsements, as well as get a multiengine rating before applying for the Airline Transport Pilot license.|$|E
50|$|This rating {{requires}} {{highly specialized}} training by a certificated flight instructor (CFI) {{with a special}} instrument instruction rating (CFII), and completion of an additional written exam, oral exam, and flight test. Pilots applying for an instrument rating must hold a current private pilot certificate and medical, have logged at least 50 hours of cross-country flight time as pilot-in-command, and have at least 40 hours of actual or simulated <b>instrument</b> <b>time</b> including at least 15 hours of instrument flight training and instrument training on cross-country flight procedures.|$|E
