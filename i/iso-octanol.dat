40|$|Blending of {{oil stocks}} with {{hydrocarbons}} form non-ideal mixtures, for which excess volumes can bepositive or negative depending {{to the nature}} of species. Gas oil mixed with nine petroleum fractions orindividual hydrocarbons consisting of aromatics, and paraffinic nature in addition to an alcohol anda ketone. The systems have been subjected to density measurements at two temperatures (25 and 35 °C). Binary mixtures of gas oil with the paraffinic spikes, light naphtha, heavy naphtha, kerosene and nhexadecaneproduce negative excess volume values. This maximum shrinkage occurs for the lowestboiling spike. Where n-hexadecane results in very small negative excess volume and seem to formnearly ideal volumes with gas oil. The spiking of gas oil with, toluene, xylene, MEK or reduced crude show positive excess volume,indicating that such spikes are affected as “structure breaking” materials leading to expansion. Thespiked gas oil with <b>iso-octanol</b> shows an expansion. The excess volume values increases as the massfraction of <b>iso-octanol</b> increased. Methyl ethyl ketone with some base oil stocks of different boilingrange show positive excess volume. This expansion is greatest for lowest boiling stock...|$|E
40|$|Shipping of {{edible fats}} and oils into Europe is {{permitted}} in bulk tanks, in which substances, included in a positive list, had been previously transported. The European Commission requested EFSA to evaluate the list of substances in the Annex to Commission Directive 96 / 3 /EC as acceptable previous cargoes for edible {{fats and oils}}, taking into account its review of the Scientific Committee on Food criteria for acceptable previous cargoes and criteria proposed by the Codex Committee for Fats and Oils. This is the third and last scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) on this topic, in which sixteen of these substances or groups of substances have been evaluated. The CONTAM Panel concluded that sodium silicate (water glass) solution, <b>iso-octanol,</b> iso-nonanol, iso-decanol, 1, 3 -propanediol, isobutyl acetate, sec-butyl acetate, tert-butyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, propylene tetramer, paraffin wax, candelilla wax, white mineral oils and glycerol would not be of health concern as previous cargoes. The CONTAM Panel concluded that carnauba wax was not acceptable as a previous cargo because of its insolubility in water and high melting point, which raise concerns regarding the efficiency of tank cleaning. There was insufficient information available on the composition of montan wax for the CONTAM Panel to conclude {{that it would be}} of no health concern when used as previous cargo and hence it does not meet the criteria for acceptability as previous cargo. The CONTAM Panel made several recommendations regarding {{the way in which the}} substances are described in the Annex to Commission Directive 96 / 3 /EC, to correct inaccuracies and to better reflect current transport practices...|$|E
40|$|Many agrichemical sprays, in {{particular}} some herbicides and insecticides, {{result in a}} strong odour when applied by either ground or aerial spraying techniques. This odour may be evident downwind from the application site for several hundreds of metres or even kilometres. The detection of the odour alerts people {{to the presence of}} chemicals in the air, and in many cases those affected think that they are being exposed to harmful levels of the active ingredient of the spray. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the levels of odour generated during the application of several common herbicides, the level of exposure of the general public when the odours are detected, and the potential risk of adverse health effects resulting from that exposure. In addition, the hypothesis that the majority of the odour associated with many agrichemicals is due to manufacturing impurities and/or additives in the commercial formulations was tested. Commercial formulations of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic (2, 4 -D) acid in the form of the butyl ester (2, 4 -D butyl ester), ethylhexyl ester (2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester) and triethanolamine salt (2, 4 -D amine) were studied because of current concerns regarding their use. A common alternative, 4 -methyl- 2 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) was also studied. A commercial formulation of 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester was used to test the hypothesis that the majority of the odour associated with many agrichemicals is due to manufacturing impurities and/or additives. Using dynamic dilution olfactometry, pure 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester was determined to be odourless. 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, which has an intense odour, was identified as a manufacturing impurity in the formulation. An estimate of its odour threshold (1. 95 ppb) was measured using the technique of dynamic dilution olfactometry. Other significant odorants in the formulation were <b>iso-octanol</b> and an aromatic solvent. The aromatic solvent is responsible for the majority of the odour associated with the 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester formulation, assuming no significant masking or synergistic effects between the odorants. The odour concentrations generated from the spraying of the herbicides under simulated aerial application conditions were measured using dynamic dilution olfactometry. The mean odour concentrations for 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester (22, 350 OUc/m³) and MCPA (23, 400 OUc/m³) were about 2 -fold higher than the values for 2, 4 -D butyl ester (12, 070 OUc/m³) and 2, 4 -D amine (10, 000 OUc/m³). Chemical analysis of the odours determined that the calculated level of airborne active ingredient when the odour of each herbicide was "just detectable" (the odour threshold) were all lower than 0. 2 µg/m³. The calculated odour safety factor between the concentration of active ingredient at the odour threshold for each herbicide and its Threshold Limit Value - Time Weighted Average were all high and of a similar magnitude, ranging from 58, 100 for 2, 4 -D butyl ester to 80, 600 for MCPA. It was concluded that detection of faint or even strong odours from the herbicides as a result of spray drift will not result in exposures of toxicological significance to members of the public. kilometres.
