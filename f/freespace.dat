5|$|Fans of the <b>FreeSpace</b> series {{have created}} {{modifications}} (mods) of <b>FreeSpace</b> 2. The first mods were just custom campaigns, with series of missions created through FRED2, the mission editor freely packaged with <b>FreeSpace</b> 2. One such mod which gained notability was Inferno, which sets its story {{decades after the}} conclusion of <b>FreeSpace</b> 2. Released in July 2003, the mod was hosted on established sites, such as GameSpot and CNET, {{as part of their}} <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 contents.|$|E
5|$|Apogee Software {{announced}} on December 12, 1997 {{that they would}} be exclusively publishing <b>FreeSpace</b> for the first three months before handing the publishing rights back to Interplay Entertainment. This was part of their agreement with Interplay for the latter's purchase of the rights to Descent, and Apogee decided to release <b>FreeSpace</b> as shareware, with themselves as the merchant of the registered version. Interplay, however, bought the full rights to <b>FreeSpace</b> from Apogee in late April, 1998, keeping the ownership of the game solely to themselves.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 sold 26,983 copies by April 2000.|$|E
5|$|The news of <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 {{being in}} {{development}} was confirmed in a chat on November 6, 1998. <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 {{was developed in}} less than one year. The Volition team revealed they had written up a story and will be targeting high-end hardware with dogfights for {{a greater number of}} ships and even larger and more deadly capital ships. The team set themselves the goals of setting new standards for both single-player and multiplayer space combat simulations, and started to modify the <b>FreeSpace</b> game engine for <b>FreeSpace</b> 2. This team was the same team which had worked on Descent: <b>FreeSpace,</b> plus several new members. In order to flesh out the story, Volition hired Jason Scott as a full-time writer before work even started. The linear mission structure was adopted as it was decided it would help the immersion factor of the story greatly. As the relations between the Terrans and Vasudans dominated the first game, it was decided to scale the focus down to a personal level with Admiral Bosch and his decisions to rebel. Scott's close work with the designers, and co-ordination of the voice recording process helped to tightly integrate the story into the missions, giving a more sophisticated feel to the story.|$|E
5|$|Descent: <b>FreeSpace</b> {{was well}} {{received}} as a single-player space simulation that integrated all the desired features of its genre, from competent AI wingmen, {{to the presence of}} large capital ships that not only dwarf the fighters piloted by the player, but also explode spectacularly when destroyed. However, the game's multiplayer mode was criticised, as it was plagued by lag and inaccurate tracking of statistics. An expansion for the game, which was less well received, was also released in 1998 under the title of Silent Threat, and focuses on events after the main game's campaign with the player working for an intelligence branch of the Terrans' armed forces that later attempt to overthrow the Terran government. A sequel to Descent: <b>FreeSpace</b> entitled <b>FreeSpace</b> 2, was released in 1999 to critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|<b>FreeSpace</b> 2 {{takes place}} entirely in outer space. The playing area is vast when {{compared}} to the small starfighters piloted by the player and the effective range they have. This space is populated with interstellar bodies such as stars, planets, asteroids, etc. The implementation of nebulae as an interactive environment {{is one of the most}} distinctive and crowning aspects of <b>FreeSpace</b> 2. Flying through a nebula involves impaired vision, and occasional disruptions to flight electronics. Nebulae have become known as an eerie and suspenseful arena of play.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Volition {{released}} the source code {{for the game}} engine under a non-commercial license. This code became {{the core of the}} <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 Source Code Project, which continuously improves it and enables new features. In cooperation with the <b>FreeSpace</b> Upgrade Project the game's graphics are kept up to date. The improved game engine is also used by various mod projects, for example The Babylon Project and Diaspora which are based on the science fiction series Babylon 5 and Battlestar Galactica respectively.|$|E
5|$|On December 14, 1999, Hyperion Entertainment {{announced}} their {{acquisition of the}} license to port <b>FreeSpace</b> to the Amiga system. The publisher was changed to Haage & Partner Computer on October 18, 2001. Despite the game's official release being announced for December 2001, the approval to do so could only be gotten on January 7, 2002. The game was shipped without a printed manual, but had additional German and French language support. Hyperion had stated they would port over Silent Threat if the <b>FreeSpace</b> port sold well. To date, Silent Threat {{has yet to be}} ported over to the Amiga platform.|$|E
5|$|Volition {{aimed for}} a quality release, {{and promised to}} deliver a product without major bugs. Minor bugs would be fixed in a prompt manner. The shipped game, however, had {{deficiencies}} admitted by the team, such as problems with the multiplayer code, and a few design issues. The game underwent four patches, which resolved most of the bugs, and improved the multiplayer performance. Complaints about an online mission giving unfair scores led to Volition removing the mission from scoring play. Another patch allowed EAX capability to be enabled for Creative Sound Blaster sound cards. Interplay played its part in drumming up the community's interest by holding contests, and expanding material for the <b>FreeSpace</b> universe. Meanwhile, Volition created official star maps, and released Vasudan voice clips and story development notes. Interplay hired science-fiction writers such as Fred Saberhagen, Simon Hawke, and Jeff Grubb to write weekly <b>FreeSpace</b> stories for two months. Preparing for Silent Threats release, Interplay held a contest from July 28 to August 25, 1998, in which the submitted fan-designed missions could win their authors prizes such as free copies of Silent Threat, <b>FreeSpace</b> apparel, and gaming hardware. Entries were judged by a panel from PC Gamer, and qualified entries constituted half of the missions in Silent Threat.|$|E
5|$|Descent: <b>FreeSpace</b> – The Great War, {{also known}} as Conflict: <b>FreeSpace</b> – The Great War in Europe, is a 1998 space combat {{simulation}} IBM PC compatible computer game developed by Volition, when it was split off from Parallax Software, and published by Interplay Productions. In 2001, it was ported to the Amiga platform as FreeSpace: The Great War by Hyperion Entertainment. The game places players {{in the role of}} a human pilot, who operates in several classes of starfighter and combats against opposing forces, either human or alien, in various space-faring environments, such as in orbit above a planet or within an asteroid belt. The story of the game's single player campaign focuses on a war in the 24th century between two factions, one human and the other alien, that is interrupted in its fourteenth year by the arrival of an enigmatic and militant alien race, whose genocidal advance forces the two sides into a ceasefire in order to work together to halt the threat.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have the}} option of making their own {{missions}} through use of the free editor bundled with the game - <b>FreeSpace</b> Editor (FRED for short). The editor allows players to have the same capabilities as Volition's development team in making their own missions, with the ability to import personal audio and 3D animation files.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of the game engine's source code, the {{possibilities}} of changing the game greatly opened up, and the fan community made use of the code to update the game using recent technology. Led by Edward Gardner and Ian Warfield, the <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 Source Code Project was formed to standardize changes and maintain a core engine for others to take advantage of. Using the new fan-updated engine, projects such as Beyond the Red Line, based on the new Battlestar Galactica, and The Babylon Project, based on Babylon 5, have become possible. PXO, the free Internet gaming service handling SquadWar, was initially acquired by THQ in their 2002 acquisition of Outrage Entertainment (renamed as Outrage Games). The service was continued until July 2003, when Outrage Games was dissolved and PXO terminated. The components of its website were, however, later handed over to the <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 Source Code Project to help them create a similar service in tracking statistics and rankings.|$|E
5|$|<b>FreeSpace</b> 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster recharge of shields, afterburners, and weapons {{at the expense}} of other subsystems. These features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay. The mission parameters are not rigidly fixed, as there is an allowance for the failures of some primary objectives. When the mission is concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss the mission, and the performance of the player, before the next mission can be taken on.|$|E
5|$|<b>FreeSpace</b> 2s {{story is}} brought out via {{narrative}} pre-rendered cutscenes, the pre- and post-mission briefings, {{as well as}} in-game chatter between non-player characters, and scripted mission events. The structure for the story is linear without any branching paths for alternate storylines, though there are optional covert missions which can further flesh out the story. The story can only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through the campaign. However, players are given the option to skip a mission if they have failed it five times in a row. This gives those {{who are interested in}} the story, but less skilled, the chance to continue on with the story without frustration.|$|E
5|$|Opinions were {{generally}} favorable towards <b>FreeSpace</b> 2s multiplayer implementation. SquadWar received favorable {{responses from the}} reviewers who were impressed by its persistent nature and statistics tracking. While the required registration with PXO was considered a troublesome process by a few, the gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no lag at all. Other reviewers' experiences with lag were different. Reynolds of Combatsim.com said Internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places, but LAN gaming was smooth sailing. GameSpy's reviewer said lag became more apparent on a dial-up connection during a multiplayer mission with four or more players. FiringSquad's reviewer's experience was similar {{but he said the}} lag was not enough to hinder his enjoyment of the multiplayer action.|$|E
5|$|The game {{continues}} {{on the story}} from Descent: <b>FreeSpace,</b> once again thrusting the player {{into the role of}} a pilot fighting against the mysterious aliens, the Shivans. While defending the human race and its alien Vasudan allies, the player also gets involved in putting down a rebellion. The game features large numbers of fighters alongside gigantic capital ships in a battlefield fraught with beams, shells and missiles in detailed star systems and nebulae. Free multiplayer games were available via Parallax Online which also ranked players by their statistics. A persistent galaxy was also available as SquadWar for players to fight with each other over territories.|$|E
5|$|The game begins 32 {{years after}} the events in Descent: <b>FreeSpace.</b> Following {{the end of the}} Great War, both the GTA and PVE {{cemented}} their alliance by combining together to form the Galactic Terran–Vasudan Alliance (GTVA)—a single entity formed to cement the alliance between the Terran and Vasudan races after the destruction of Vasuda Prime by the Lucifer and the subsequent collapse of all subspace nodes to the Sol system {{as a result of the}} superdestroyer's destruction inside the Sol–Delta Serpentis jump node. Despite this alliance, however, opposition still exists to this union in the form of a faction of Terrans led by Great War veteran, Admiral Aken Bosch, who leads the rebel group under the banner of the Neo-Terran Front (NTF). The NTF's rebellion led to the faction gaining control over the Sirius, Polaris and Regulus star systems, while engaging the GTVA for 18 months, before launching attacks on the Vasudan systems of Deneb and Alpha Centauri.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: <b>FreeSpace</b> as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Hillcrest Labs {{introduced}} the Loop pointer, {{a remote control}} that used Hillcrest's <b>Freespace</b> motion control technology to allow users to control their televisions with natural gestures. The Loop had just four buttons and a scroll wheel. Freespace-enabled remote controls use radio waves to communicate with a USB antenna connected to a computer that is also connected to the television, so {{they do not need}} to be pointed at the PC, or even have a direct line of sight.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this is mouse gesture trackings, where the motion of the mouse is {{correlated}} to a symbol being drawn by a person's hand, as is the Wii Remote or the Myo armband or the mForce Wizard wristband, which can study changes in acceleration over time to represent gestures. Devices such as the LG Electronics Magic Wand, the Loop and the Scoop use Hillcrest Labs' <b>Freespace</b> technology, which uses MEMS accelerometers, gyroscopes and other sensors to translate gestures into cursor movement. The software also compensates for human tremor and inadvertent movement. AudioCubes are another example. The sensors of these smart light emitting cubes can be used to sense hands and fingers as well as other objects nearby, and can be used to process data. Most applications are in music and sound synthesis, but can be applied to other fields.|$|E
500|$|<b>FreeSpace</b> 2 was {{released}} on September 30, 1999, one month ahead of schedule. However, the team [...] had to quickly come up with and release a patch (version 1.01) for a software bug which prevented recognition of a CD during the installation process. Three months later, they released the next and final patch (version 1.20) to fix several other bugs. The release of <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 was considerably muted compared to its predecessor Descent: <b>FreeSpace.</b> Its publisher, Interplay, did not organize contests for it, nor did they generate pre-release hype {{up with the same}} drive as before. They also posted the incorrect system requirements for the game on their site. <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 was also placed on less-visible shelves than Descent 3. However, when GameSpot awarded <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 the [...] "Sci-Fi Simulation of the Year" [...] award, Interplay pushed out the [...] "Sci-Fi Sim of the Year Edition" [...] to capitalize on it.|$|E
500|$|Despite Volition's {{interest}} {{and desire to}} develop add-ons and expansions for <b>FreeSpace</b> 2, Interplay told them to stop. Volition was then acquired by THQ in 2000. As Interplay owns {{the rights to the}} <b>FreeSpace</b> series (as well as the Descent series) and Volition's owners, THQ, is only interested in pursuing development on what they own, Volition was unable to continue developing the <b>FreeSpace</b> franchise. Faced with source code which became practically useless to them, Volition released the source code for only game engines to the public under a noncommercial license on April 25, 2002. Mike Kulas, the President of Volition, said this was to give those outside the game industry {{a chance to look at}} the code of a commercial software product, a desire he and Matt Toschlog had when they were not yet in the industry. In the years since, no sequels to <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 have been made and Interplay has only published a limited re-release of it on February 2, 2004, to commemorate the company's 20th anniversary. [...] Interplay, by that time, was in financial trouble, failing to pay rent and wages to its workers. [...] Seeking investors to inject it with funds, Interplay changed business strategies: instead of developing and publishing single-player games, it sold licenses to those games and looked towards developing massive multi-player online games. Derek Smart, creator of Battlecruiser 3000AD, had casually mentioned his interest in the <b>Freespace</b> license, but nothing significant came out of this. In 2013, Interplay acquired the remaining rights to the <b>FreeSpace</b> franchise for $7,500 after THQ went to bankruptcy court.|$|E
500|$|GameSpot, in electing <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 {{as one of}} the [...] "Greatest Games of All Time", {{pointed out}} that while most of the game's {{features}} could be found in its predecessor or peers, its [...] "sheer quality of presentation and gameplay" [...] was the key reason for their choice. Computer and Video Games has acknowledged it as offering the best dogfighting among the space combat classics. Ars Technica also posed <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 as the last significant stage in evolution of the space combat genre [...]|$|E
500|$|<b>FreeSpace</b> 2 has {{garnered}} {{high praise}} from most established reviewers. <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 received numerous [...] "Game of the Year" [...] awards for 1999, and {{was nominated for}} [...] "Computer Simulation Game of the Year" [...] in the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, 2000. Every review praised <b>FreeSpace</b> 2s graphics. From the ships to the backgrounds, the reviewers were pleased with the details Volition had paid attention to, such as the thematic differences in the ship designs between the races, the textures and clarity of the backdrops, and even the realism of the explosions, though FiringSquad pointed out explosions from torpedo strikes were lower in quality. The nebulae feature was also praised for its rendered atmosphere, which reviewers described as tense and paranoia-inducing as they keep expecting enemy ships to appear out of the gases in a deadly ambush. Even though a couple of reviewers wrote that the nebulae made them dizzy, they still liked the feature. Combatsim even claimed <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 was unrivaled among its space combat peers in the graphics department. The graphical standards were such that when XGP reviewed the Anniversary Edition in 2004, Wehbi found the graphics to stand up quite well to the recent games then.|$|E
500|$|<b>FreeSpace</b> was Volition's first project {{after the}} split from Parallax Software, which also spawned Outrage Entertainment. It {{is not part}} of the canon of the Descent {{computer}} game series, and contained none of its ideas and only small portions of its code. It was only prefixed with Descent to avoid trademark issues with Mijenix Corporation's [...] "FreeSpace", a disk compression utility. Volition also used the term [...] "FreeSpace" [...] in the game to initially describe what became later known as subspace. The game was conceived by Adam Pletcher, with all the features of space simulator games his team had found to be fun. The games [...] and Wing Commander were their primary inspirations, and those influences made their way into the game's flight model, along with the influence of historical WWII dogfights. Themes from the fiction of Star Wars, , and Ender's Game form a part in shaping the background and story of the <b>FreeSpace</b> world. The chaotic battles between masses of ships commonly found in science-fiction anime became one of the features of <b>FreeSpace.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>FreeSpace</b> 2 is a 1999 space combat {{simulation}} {{computer game}} developed by Volition as the sequel [...] to [...] It was completed {{ahead of schedule}} {{in less than a}} year, and released to very positive reviews.|$|E
500|$|<b>FreeSpace</b> 2 allows {{multiplayer}} {{games to}} be played across a local area network (LAN) or over the Internet via the free services provided by Parallax Online (PXO). The player can communicate with the other network players vocally through <b>FreeSpace</b> 2s own voice chat capability. LAN play allows the players to play the standard player versus player modes such as deathmatch, or cooperate to complete multiplayer missions. They can even join in games which are already underway. The same can be done over PXO but with the added incentive of having the players' statistics of kills and deaths being tracked on a ladder (ranking) system. Players can also form up or join [...] squadrons in SquadWar, an online persistent galaxy hosted by Volition on PXO, where squadrons fight each other for territories.|$|E
500|$|Descent: <b>FreeSpace</b> was {{a finalist}} for Computer Games Strategy Pluss [...] "Sci-Fi Simulation of the Year" [...] and Computer Gaming Worlds [...] "Best Space Sim" [...] awards in 1998, both of which {{ultimately}} went to I-War. The editors of Computer Gaming World called it [...] "an excellent game, featuring {{some of the best}} wing-man AI to hit the genre, but it was too derivative of previous space sims." [...] PC Gamer US nominated it as the year's best action game, and its editors wrote that [...] "Freespace came from nowhere to wrest the 3D space combat crown from the Wing Commander series with style." [...] However, this award went to Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.|$|E
500|$|<b>FreeSpace</b> 2s {{gameplay}} {{involves the}} player piloting a starfighter using mounted weapons to destroy enemy starfighters, performing reconnaissance behind enemy lines, or escorting other starships. Its flight model {{is based on}} a looser interpretation of space physics instead of realistic Newtonian physics. Hence, the ships are weightless and feel more responsive, though they require constant application of engine power to move. The result is that the game plays more like a [...] "WWII dogfight simulator" [...] unaffected by gravity. Although joysticks are the recommended controller for this game, the mouse is a viable alternative. Single player mode is executed {{in the form of a}} campaign, which follows a story as a linear sequence of missions are executed.|$|E
500|$|The {{setting of}} the {{expansion}} takes place some time {{after the end of}} the [...] "Great War", with both the GTA and PVE working together to rebuild their systems, while dealing with remnants of the Shivan Armada. In the story, the player takes on the role of a pilot of the GTA (whether they are the same pilot from the main campaign, is unclear---it is rumored that this pilot may be Aken Bosch from <b>Freespace</b> 2), who works within one of the fleets of the Terrans' intelligence service, dubbed Galactic Terran Intelligence (GTI), which consists of three branches - Research & Development (R), Intelligence, and Special Operations, the latter of which the pilot is assigned to.|$|E
500|$|Descent: <b>FreeSpace</b> {{received}} generally {{good reviews}} following its launch, with PC Gamer UK placing it 20th in its 1999 Top 100 Awards. However reviewers were split on {{several aspects of}} the game. While many praised the graphics of the game, some approving of how well rendered an in-game asteroid stood out before the background of softly glowing nebulae, galaxies and stars, others felt the 3D effects were not [...] "spectacular" [...] {{to those of the}} software rendered version, commenting that rendered nebulae were unconvincing and that the models of in-game ships lacked detail and had blurry textures. Despite the differences between them, all reviewers unanimously agreed that the explosions effects in the game, including the many small details of the capital ships upon breaking up, were the most impressive they had seen (at the time).|$|E
500|$|The game's {{expansion}} Silent Threat, received {{generally less}} favourable reviews. While its stand-alone missions were complemented well for being conceived {{as part of}} a contest by the game's developers - Volition put in a call to the <b>FreeSpace</b> community to stop creating [...] "Battle of Endor"-type missions through FRED, and instead create missions based on Volition's Jason Hoffoss' Zen philosophy of accomplishing more with less - the expansion was judged as decent but uninspiring, with many noting that the campaign missions lacked variety than those of standard escort or destroy missions, and offering no new equipment which were unable to compete against the older equipment, with some feeling that the story was worse than the main game due to its [...] "cold and inhuman" [...] briefings and non-player characters.|$|E
500|$|Journeys between star {{systems are}} {{achieved}} by [...] "jumping" [...] through jump nodes and traveling through subspace, while shorter intra-system distances are done by [...] "hopping" [...] into subspace at any time. All ships in a mission either [...] "jump" [...] or [...] "hop" [...] {{to make their}} entries and exits. The game's starship designs are clearly distinguishable between the three races. Terran starships tend to be plain and practical, the Vasudans' starships are artistic with sleek lines and curves, and the enemies' ships—the Shivans—are sharp, pointy and asymmetrical in insidious black and red colors. <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 also features humongous capital ships, hundreds of {{times larger than the}} fighters, and armed to the teeth with beam weapons and flak guns. These ships are commonly scripted to seek each other out and engage in massive duels.|$|E
500|$|<b>FreeSpace</b> 2s key {{attraction}} is its dogfights. CNN.com said the close-ranged dogfights make for engrossing, and exciting skirmishes. FiringSquad {{described it as}} a [...] "total thrill" [...] to be among 20 fighters flying in between opposing capital ships with beams, missiles, and flak all around and warnings going off, as they try to seek out and destroy their opposite numbers, a view which GameSpot agreed with. The game's AI was judged adequate to provide for such fights, being cunning enough to trick others to crash into the walls of narrow openings, and good enough to detect and warn their wingmen of enemies coming up directly behind them. There are those who expressed minor disappointments with the AI tending to collide too often with other objects. While the dynamic mission objectives were celebrated for coming up with twists and turns to spice up the story, there were a few who found these [...] "in-game red herrings" [...] overused instead.|$|E
500|$|Sharky Extreme praised <b>FreeSpace</b> 2 {{for having}} the {{enormous}} capital ships, as this burst the [...] "trapped in a bubble" [...] trend in Wing Commander- and - type games. Instead of the action simply coming to the player, it flows all around, and the player {{is the one who}} has to go and seek it. The scenes of these giant ships duking it out, with many gnat-like fighters swarming around in their little dances of death, have led reviewers to feel a sense of epicness, comparable to reliving battles in science fiction series like Babylon 5 and Star Wars. Similarly, PC Gamer praised the scaling of ships and battles and said that they [...] " [...] as close to creating the feeling of a World War II naval battle in space as any game has ever come" [...] and that [...] "That's what fighter combat, in space or on Earth, should be all about.".|$|E
500|$|Descent 3 is {{the first}} project {{developed}} by Outrage Entertainment. The company was founded when Parallax Software, creators of previous Descent games, decided to split in two: Outrage Entertainment and Volition. Volition would focus on creating the combat space simulator <b>FreeSpace</b> games, while Outrage would continue with the Descent series. Development on Descent 3 began in November 1996 {{with a team of}} eight people. According to programmer Jason Leighton, one of the major problems during the game's development cycle was a lack of direction and control. He explained that the team had [...] "No code reviews, no art reviews, [...] no way of saying, 'This is bad and we should be going in a different direction'". This [...] "anarchistic" [...] development environment worked for Descent and Descent II because they were developed by small groups that worked closely together and often in the same room. However, as Outrage started to grow from eight people to almost 20 {{by the end of the}} project, the developers did not introduce enough management to control the process. As Leighton recalls, [...] "we literally had to build the team and company at the same time we started production on the game".|$|E
