5|$|The {{first five}} locomotives, Nos. 6220–6224, {{were built in}} 1937 at the LMS Crewe Works at an average cost of £11,641 each. They were all {{intended}} to haul the Coronation Scot, so the locomotives and the special trainsets bore a common livery. The locomotives were streamlined and painted Caledonian Railway blue with silver horizontal lines along <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locomotive. The special trainsets that they hauled were painted the same shade of blue and the silver lining was repeated along <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coaches.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{the main}} scoreboard, the {{ballpark}} has three more LED displays. A display in the left-center field wall is used for showing player introductions, in-game pitching statistics, upcoming batters, and advertisements. LED ribbon boards are installed on the facings of <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper deck; these are used to display the inning, score, count, player introductions, and advertisements. The stadium's three pitch clocks—part of professional baseball's pace-of-game initiatives implemented in Triple-A and Double-A baseball games in 2015— are located on the straightaway center field wall and on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> backstop.|$|E

5|$|Preserved {{images of}} Szczerbiec from various {{points in time}} {{indicate}} that the decorative plates were several times dismounted and placed again on the hilt in variable configurations. The current composition, with the symbols of the Evangelists duplicated on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hilt, matches that known from the earliest preserved depiction drafted by Johann Christoph Werner in 1794. It is possible, though, that the original placement of the golden plates was different, with the symbols of Saints John and Matthew on the obverse of the grip, so that <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hilt displayed the symbols of {{all four of the}} Evangelists.|$|E

5|$|As Bristol {{expanded}} {{in the early}} 20th century, {{the need for a}} new station to serve the outskirts grew, and on 29 August 1927, the Great Western Railway opened a station at Parson Street, named Parson Street Halt. There were two platforms, one on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two running lines. There was a wooden shelter on the westbound platform, and a metal shelter on the eastbound platform. The platforms were made of wood, with access from the main road via steps. No goods facilities were provided.|$|E
5|$|At {{the angle}} of each aisle, a spiral {{staircase}} – still visible on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surviving east wall – gave access to a passage inside the walls and to secondary stairs within the angles of the main gable enabling access to {{all parts of the}} building for maintenance and cleaning without requiring scaffolding.

5|$|Ferugliotheriids {{are known}} {{from a few}} dozen {{isolated}} teeth and a questionably allocated jaw fragment. Most fossils are referred to Ferugliotherium; Trapalcotherium and Argentodites were each described {{on the basis of}} a single tooth. Their precise dental formula is unknown, but incisors, premolars, and molariform teeth have been identified. Gurovich suggested that Ferugliotherium had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower and upper jaws.|$|E

Postern gates were built into towers or near them to allow sorties.|$|E
