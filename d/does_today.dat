5|$|Highway3 {{originally}} {{ended at}} the Honeymoon Bridge in Niagara Falls; it continued east of Chambers Corners along Forks Road (Regional Road23) rather than south through Wainfleet as it <b>does</b> <b>today.</b> It then travelled north through Welland and east along Lundys Lane. Highway58 and Highway20 would later follow portions of this route.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, 1966, after {{over twenty}} years of cosignage, SH-32 was {{truncated}} to its current western terminus in Ryan. Everything west of Waurika was now solely US-70. After the truncation of 1966, SH-32 had the same route that it <b>does</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

5|$|NY80 {{originally}} continued {{much farther}} north than it <b>does</b> <b>today.</b> When it was assigned {{in the late}} 1920s, it continued north from Fort Plain, Montgomery County, to NY54 in Arietta by way of modern NY10. The Arietta– Fort Plain portion of NY80 {{was replaced by a}} realigned NY10 as part of the 1930 renumbering.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} New Albany to north of Center Village first {{appeared}} on maps in 1924. In 1929, the road was extended to connect to Condit. SR 605 was designated in 1937, following the alignment from US 62, to a junction with the US 36/SR 3 concurrency in Condit. By 1994, jurisdiction of the portion of SR 605 between SR 37 and the US 36/SR 3 concurrency was transferred from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to Delaware County, who renamed the road to County Road 605. As {{a result of this}} move, SR 605 took on the routing that it <b>does</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the reign}} of Henry VII the cathedral was complete, {{appearing}} much as it <b>does</b> <b>today</b> (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit {{was placed in the}} nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.|$|E

5|$|M-79 {{was formed}} as a state {{trunkline}} by July 1, 1919 along part of its present routing. At the time, it ran between Hastings and Nashville as it <b>does</b> <b>today.</b> From Nashville, the trunkline turned south and west to end at the contemporary M-17 in Battle Creek. By 1927, the southernmost section of M-79 was truncated when M-78 was extended to Battle Creek. In late 1930, the southernmost section was shortened once again as a new M-14 designation replaced M-79 south of Nashville. An eastward extension of M-79 {{at the same time}} carries the highway designation to Vermontville.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{pressure}} {{is believed to}} be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it <b>does</b> <b>today,</b> but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the oldest}} sectors of Dubrovnik was {{constructed}} around a Late Antique castle by the sea, which stretched landwards {{a bit more than}} it <b>does</b> <b>today.</b> It was constructed {{on the site of the}} Pre-Romanesque cathedral and the Rector's Palace, thus encircling the city's harbour. The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Miličević in the late 15th century. Notably, the harbour was noticeably painted on the palm of St. Blaise in a triptych painted by the artist Nikola Božidarević around 1500.|$|E

5|$|The coastal lowlands, {{particularly}} surrounding Charleston and New Orleans {{and which}} also included {{much of the}} Acadian French regions of Louisiana and the surrounding area, more varied diet was heavily influenced by Africans and Caribbeans, {{as well as the}} French. Rice played a large part in the diet. In addition, unlike the uplands, the lowlands' protein came mostly from coastal seafood and game meats. Much of the diet involved the use of peppers, as it still <b>does</b> <b>today.</b> Although the English had an inherent disdain for French food as well as many of the native foods, the French had no such disdain for indigenous foodstuffs. In fact, they expressed an appreciation for native ingredients and dishes.|$|E
5|$|The {{piece of}} NY167 between Richfield Springs and Paines Hollow, a small hamlet {{southwest}} of Little Falls, was originally {{part of an}} unsigned legislative route in the early 20th century. Farther north, the segment between Little Falls and Dolgeville {{was added to the}} legislative route system in 1910. In 1924, the Richfield Springs–Paines Hollow route became part of NY28; however, that route was altered as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to follow a new alignment to the west. NY28's former routing between Richfield Springs and Paines Hollow became part of the new NY167, which continued north through Little Falls to Dolgeville as it <b>does</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it <b>does</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

5|$|The town of Norwich {{was created}} on January19, 1793, {{comprising}} {{a much larger}} area than it <b>does</b> <b>today.</b> On April2, 1806, part of the town was split off {{to form a new}} town named Preston. A charter on April8, 1808, established the Norwich and Preston Turnpike, a turnpike connecting the town of Preston in the west to the town of Norwich in the east. The Norwich and Preston Turnpike was privately owned and maintained, as most turnpikes in New York were at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} soil where the Valley of the Kings is located are an {{alternating}} sandwich of dense limestone and other sedimentary rock (which form the cliffs {{in the valley}} and the nearby Deir el-Bahri) and soft layers of marl. The sedimentary rock was originally deposited between 35–56 million years ago {{during a time when}} the precursor to the Mediterranean Sea covered an area that extended much further inland than it <b>does</b> <b>today.</b> During the Pleistocene the valley was carved out of the plateau by steady rains. There is currently little year-round rain in this part of Egypt, but there are occasional flash floods that hit the valley, dumping tons of debris into the open tombs.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that ancestors of the fisher migrated to North America during the Pliocene era between 2.5 and 5 million years ago. Two extinct mustelids, M. palaeosinensis and M. anderssoni, {{have been found in}} eastern Asia. The first true fisher, M. divuliana, has only been found in North America. There are strong indications that M. divuliana is related to the Asian finds, which suggests a migration. M. pennanti has been found as early as the Late Pleistocene era, about 125,000 years ago. There are no major differences between the Pleistocene fisher and the modern fisher. Fossil evidence indicates that the fisher's range extended farther south than it <b>does</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

5|$|When NY3 was {{assigned}} in 1924, it followed a significantly different routing through the North Country than it <b>does</b> <b>today.</b> NY3 entered Franklin County near Hogansburg and served Malone, Paul Smiths, Gabriels, and Harrietstown {{before leaving the}} county near Saranac Lake. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY3 was rerouted east of Watertown to follow its modern alignment through the North Country. The portion of NY3's former routing from Harrietstown to a junction southeast of Gabriels was designated as NY408 while the segment between Paul Smiths and the vicinity of Gabriels became part of NY192, an east–west highway extending from Paul Smiths to the realigned NY3 in Bloomingdale.|$|E
5|$|When {{the highway}} was first {{designated}} {{in the late}} 1910s, it extended farther south than it <b>does</b> <b>today</b> and ended well short of its current northern terminus. The southern end was added to another state highway, truncating M-18's length to roughly its current southern terminus in 1926. The northern end was also simultaneously extended {{for the first time}} with these revisions to the highway's routing. In the 1940s, the northern extension was reversed and then reinstated. M-18's course was last changed with the opening of three different freeways in the area in the 1960s and 1970s. The last extension in 1973 supplanted the M-144 designation from Roscommon north to Luzerne.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce (MACOC) took over the Peach Bowl. The bowl {{executive}} director {{at the time was}} Dick Bestwick, and he encouraged the Chamber to step up its support of the game over what had been provided by the Lions Club. In 1986, the Peach Bowl had no contractual obligations with college football conferences, as its successor, the Chick-fil-A Bowl, <b>does</b> <b>today.</b> Team selections were made by the Peach Bowl committee, a board of Atlanta community members, business leaders, and organizers of the Peach Bowl. To form one half of the matchup, the committee selected second-place Atlantic Coast Conference team NC State, which accepted the bowl bid on November 22, 1986, the day of their final regular-season game. The other half of the matchup was Virginia Tech, a football independent that had finished with nine wins, one loss, and one tie during the regular season and received its invitation one week after the regular season concluded.|$|E
