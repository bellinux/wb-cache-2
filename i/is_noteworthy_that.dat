5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It <b>is</b> <b>noteworthy</b> <b>that</b> even those {{officers}} who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E
5|$|Equally, Gaudí {{stood out}} as {{interior}} decorator, decorating {{most of his}} buildings personally, from the furnishings to the smallest details. In each case {{he knew how to}} apply stylistic particularities, personalising the decoration according to the owner's taste, the predominant style of the arrangement or its place in the surroundings—whether urban or natural, secular or religious. Many of his works were related to liturgical furnishing. From the design of a desk for his office {{at the beginning of his}} career to the furnishings designed for the Sobrellano Palace of Comillas, he designed all furnishing of the Vicens, Calvet, Batlló and Milà houses, of the Güell Palace and the Bellesguard Tower, and the liturgical furnishing of the Sagrada Família. It <b>is</b> <b>noteworthy</b> <b>that</b> Gaudí studied some ergonomy in order to adapt his furnishings to human anatomy. Many of his furnishings are exhibited at Gaudi House Museum.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the authors}} of the New Testament showed little {{interest}} in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in , the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it <b>is</b> <b>noteworthy</b> <b>that</b> the Gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of Jesus.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} colors {{used in the}} film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and unlikeness to each other. Color differentiation can be traced {{as far back as}} Nemo's childhood, where three girls sit on a bench. They are his possible future wives: Jeanne, Elise, and Anna; one in yellow, the other in blue, and the third in a red dress. In his life with Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, themes associated with the color blue. Choosing Jeanne, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence: yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this. The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It <b>is</b> <b>noteworthy</b> <b>that</b> the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world. White contains all colors of the visible spectrum; this supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. By the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor). This way we can see that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started, the point at which everything is possible.|$|E
