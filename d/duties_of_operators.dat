40|$|At he {{beginning}} of my thesis some basic notions are explained {{and there is a}} brief survey and conditions of the creation of legislation regulating the discussed problems, i. e. emergency laws, laws regarding dangerous substances handling and Nuclear Act above all. In the second part I analyze the readiness of state and community bodies for non-military critical situations (emergency legislation, documents of emergency planning) and for the solution of extraordinary events, I emphasize the task and activities of the integrated emergency system. In the following text I focus in detail on the legislation related to the way of securing and handling dangerous substances and radioactive substances. These are the following acts above all: Act on the Prevention of Serious Accidents (<b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>operators</b> handling dangerous substances, participation of public and its informing, state administration), Act on Chemical Substances and Chemical Agents (classification, testing and registration, marking and packaging of chemical substances and agents, transport of dangerous substances), Act on Waste and problems of nuclear energy and ionizing radiation are regulated by the Nuclear Act (nuclear safety and readiness for accidents, measures in the zone of emergency planning). This legislation is completed and detailed by some orders and regulations. The practical part is focused mainly on realizing the level of public knowledge and public awareness, mostly in the surroundings of institutions handling dangerous substances, about the risks connected with the operation of these institutions and about the suitable behaviour of inhabitants {{in case of an emergency}} connected with dangerous substances leakage. In the introduction of the practical part I state the characteristics of the survey as a whole, I define the basic file of respondents (from the point of view of identification marks), I describe methods used. In the next part I briefly state the examined regions from the point of view of the occurance of emergencies of dangerous substances leakage. I used the form of a questionnaire for handling this. The questionnaire was focused on questions about real knowledge (toxic effects of some substances, marking dangerous substances, emergency numbers knowledge, axioms of the behaviour of public in case of en emergency of dangerous substances leakage, nuclear problems). In an enclosure to the questionnaire I ask about the interest of the respondents in these problems and their preferences as for a suitable way to be informed about the risks connected with the operation of these institutions. The results of the survey are detailed in the chapter with this title. At the end of my thesis I state some recommended forms how to improve the know-how of public in emergency of dangerous substances leakage. The end of my thesis and the discussion focus on results summary and comparison of the results of my thesis with the results of other authors...|$|E

5000|$|During the 1870s through 1890s, the {{mechanically}} automated [...] "automatic" [...] {{turret lathe}} {{was developed and}} disseminated. These machines can execute many part-cutting cycles without human intervention. Thus the <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> the <b>operator,</b> which were already greatly reduced by the manual turret lathe, were even further reduced, and productivity increased. These machines use cams to automate the sliding and indexing of the turret and the opening and closing of the chuck. Thus, they execute the part-cutting cycle somewhat analogously {{to the way in}} which an elaborate cuckoo clock performs an automated theater show. Small- to medium-sized automatic turret lathes are usually called [...] "screw machines" [...] or [...] "automatic screw machines", while larger ones are usually called [...] "automatic chucking lathes", [...] "automatic chuckers", or [...] "chuckers".|$|R
5000|$|As the law then stood, to find {{negligence}} proved, {{there must}} be a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care, the defendant must have breached that duty, and that breach must have caused the loss or damage sustained by the plaintiff.

In Hall v Brooklands Auto Racing Club (1933) 1 KB 205, it was held that it was the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> the <b>operators</b> to ensure that the racing track they had designed was as free from danger as reasonable care and skill could make it, but that they were not insurers against accidents which no reasonable diligence could foresee. Similarly, in Glasgow Corporation v Muir (1943) 2 AER 44, a defendant was not negligent in allowing a group to enter a tea room to escape bad weather, because the [...] "reasonable man" [...] would not have foreseen that these invitees would be injured (scalded) upon entering the tearoom.|$|R

40|$|Over 264 {{million people}} visit public {{swimming}} pools and aquatic facilities {{each year in}} Australia, and these people place their safety in the hands <b>of</b> <b>operators</b> and lifeguards. Research undertaken by the Royal Life Saving Society Australia examined the legislative <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> public pool <b>operators</b> in each state and territory.

These Criteria, validated through an industry survey, included personal protective equipment, risk management/risk assessment, emergency plans, and water quality. The duties within each criterion were applied to relevant water safety-related legislation. The study found that there were inconsistencies in the legislation regarding terminology and definitions, and that minimum standards were prescribed rather than a best practice approach to ensuring health and safety. To improve operators' understanding of the legislative requirements and thus compliance, it is recommended that nationally consistent legislation should be drafted which uses clear and consistent terminology and which prescribes a best practice approach...|$|R

50|$|Concerning the {{obligations}} and <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> the <b>operator</b> <b>of</b> a search engine, the Court held {{that in the}} present case Article 7(f) of the Directive, relating to legitimacy of processing, requires a balancing of the opposing rights and interests of the data subject (González) and the data controller (Google), taking into account the data subject's rights deriving from Articles 7 (respect for private and family life) and 8 (protection of personal data) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Article 14(a) of the Directive, relating to the data subject's rights, allows the data subject, at least in the cases covered by Articles 7(e) and 7(f), to object at any time on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation to the processing of data relating to him, save where otherwise provided by national legislation. Article 12(b) of the Directive, relating to the data subject's right of access to the data, allows the data subject to request erasure of the data. Such request may be made directly of the controller, who must then duly examine the merits of the request. If the request is not granted, the data subject may then direct the request to a supervisory authority or the judicial authority so that it carries out the necessary checks and orders the controller to take specific measures accordingly.|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{networks}} for anomalies {{is a typical}} <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> network <b>operators.</b> The conventional monitoring tools available today tend to almost ignore the topological characteristics of the whole network. This thesis takes a different approach from the conventional monitoring tools, by employing the principle of Eigenvector Centrality. Traditionally, this principle is used to analyse vulnerability and social aspects of networks. The proposed model reveals that topological characteristics of a network {{can be used to}} improve the conventional unreliability predictors, and to give a better indicator of its potential weaknesses. An effective expected adjacency matrix, k, is introduced in this work to be used with centrality calculations, and it reflects the factors which affect the reliability of a network, for e. g. link downtimes, link metrics, packet loss, etc. Using these calculations, all network backbone routers are assigned values which correspond to the importance of those routers in comparison {{to the rest of the}} network nodes. Furthermore, to observe how vulnerable each node could be, nodes are ranked according to the importance values, where the nodes with high ranking values are more vulnerable. This model is able to analyse temporal stability of the network, observing and comparing the rate of change in node ranking values and connectivity caused by the network link failures. The results show that the proposed model is dynamic, and changes according to the dynamics of the topology of the network, i. e. upgrading, link failures, etc. Master i nettverks- og systemadministrasjo...|$|R

40|$|Most {{people would}} {{acknowledge}} the importance <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, {{but the same}} is not true <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. Historically, the corporate law <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care has been underenforced at best, and arguably unenforced entirely. Some scholars do not consider the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care to be a fiduciary duty at all, {{and there are those}} who would do away with it entirely. In this paper, I intend to provide a comprehensive defense of the corporate law fiduciary <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. I hope to show that the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care is not simply an ill-fitting appendage to the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, but rather an essential aspect of the singular fiduciary concept that also encompasses the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. Simply put, a fiduciary has the duty to act {{in the interests of the}} beneficiary in all relevant respects. Once the breadth of this singular fiduciary concept is properly understood, it is revealed to be much more than any <b>of</b> the individual <b>duties</b> that it comprises. Far from being streamlined or focused, fiduciary law would be impoverished if it were limited to the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. However, I do not intend to argue for a more robust <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. Rather, I will defend the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care as it currently exists in corporate law (more or less) — deliberately and advisedly underenforced, but not entirely unenforced.
