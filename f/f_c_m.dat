40|$|NOUN STEMS AND THEIR HIERARCHY IN THE NORTHERN ŠIRVINTIŠKIAI SUBDIALECT Summary In the Northern Širvintiškiai subdialect, a noun stem {{is treated}} as {{independent}} if it differs from other stems in at least the ending of one case form. With regard to this condition, the i stem and the consonant stem are subdivided into the masculine and feminine gender stems. In the subdialect, tradi­tional stems have been better retained in nouns having mobile stress. Due to shortening of unstressed long vowels, partial stress retraction and other reasons, barytone nouns have deviated {{to a great extent}} from the primary paradigms. In the Northern Širvintiškiai subdialect, the number of noun stems is lower than that in standard Lithuanian and in the majority of its dialects, as i̯u, i̯a 1 and i̯a 2 stem nouns are inflected in a totally homogeneous way, i. e. according to the i̯a 2 stem implicative model. Nouns of mobile stress have a, i̯a 2, u, ā, i̯ ā, ē, i m, i <b>f,</b> <b>C</b> <b>m</b> and C f stems. Barytone stress nouns only have six stems, i. e. a, i̯a 2, u, ā, ē, and i f stems. The i̯ ā stem has coincided with the ē stem. Meanwhile, the i m, C m and C f stems are not found in words with barytone stress. Hierarchic stem grouping “trees” that are produced using three methods (the maximum, minimum and average methods) indicate existence of three different types of noun declension: the masculine model (embracing the a, i̯a 2 and u stems), the feminine model (the ā and i̯ ā stems) and the mixed model (the i m, i <b>f,</b> <b>C</b> <b>m</b> and C f stems). The ē stem is isolated: it embraces feminine gender nouns, yet according to declension there is a tendency towards the mixed declension type to a slightly greater extent. The a, i̯a 2, ā, i̯ ā and ē stems are stable. They do not decline or rarely decline from their implicative models, and have no additional (complementary) paradigms. They are all (except for the i̯ ā stem) highly productive, open, constantly enriched with words from standard Lithuanian, other dialects and languages, and also with words having unstable stems. Unstable stems are as follows: u, i m, i <b>f,</b> <b>C</b> <b>m</b> and C f. They are unproductive, and often have complementary paradigms and lose part of words belonging to them. </p...|$|E

S. public health service has {{set a limit of}} 45 ppm for human consumption. This paper illustrates how chemical hydrographs were used in a study of nitrates in the groundwater of the Fresno-Clovis metropolitan area (<b>F.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>M.</b> A.) of semiarid central California. The area comprises about 145 square miles, with a population of 310, 000. Urban water use is entirely derived from wells, whereas the surrounding agriculture relies on surface and ground water. In 1965, the California department of water resources noted nitrate concentrations in the <b>F.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>M.</b> A. were exceeding the safe limit. A number of sources of error in chemical analyses of water quality are noted. A measure of the accuracies of analyses and a method of double-checking anomalous results is furnished by plotting chemical hydrographs of individual wells. Seasonal changes in nitrate were consistent for many parts of the area, and were related to hydrogeologic factors and parameters directly affecting nitrification. Nitrate hydrographs were monitored by chloride hydrographs. The highest nitrate concentrations were in the shallower parts of the aquifer, and well deepening and changes in water level, pumping patterns and recharge rates complicated interpretations. However, the hydrographs helped to pinpoint the source of nitrate in areas where several possible sources were present...|$|E
40|$|In this brief, simple {{noncoherent}} {{detection methods}} for chaos-shift-keying (CSK) modulation are proposed. By exploiting some deterministic {{property of the}} two chaotic maps, the proposed methods recover the digital message through simple decision algorithms. Specifically, the proposed methods exploit {{the difference in the}} return maps of the signals representing the digital symbols. Two specific algorithms are discussed, namely a regression-based algorithm and a probability-based algorithm. Simple tent maps are used for illustration. The bit-error-rate under additive white Gaussian noise is studied by computer simulations. Department of Electronic and Information EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: C. K.

40|$|In {{the study}} of Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, most {{researchers}} are interested in their bit error rate performance. However, BLock Error Rate (BLER) is another important measure of the system performance because it provides {{the rate at which}} the blocks/packets need to be re-sent again - the smaller the better. In this paper, we apply a simple feedback technique to the decoding of LDPC codes. Extensive simulations have been performed. Results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the BLER of the codes at the waterfall region while not degrading the BER performance at the high SNR region.

40|$|Assuming ideal {{synchronization}} at the receivers, {{an approach}} to calculating the approximate theoretical bit-error rate (BER) of a coherent chaos-shift-keying (CSK) digital communication system under an additive white Gaussian noise environment is presented. The operation of a single-user coherent CSK system is reviewed and the BER is derived. Using a simple cubic map as the chaos generator, it is demonstrated that the calculated BERs {{are consistent with those}} found from simulations. A multiuser coherent CSK system is then defined and the BER is derived in terms of the noise intensity and the number of users. Finally, the computed BERs under a multiuser environment are compared with the simulation results. Department of Electronic and Information EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: W. M.

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{modulation}} schemes proposed for chaos-based digital communications, chaos-shift keying (CSK) and differential chaos-shift keying (DCSK) {{have been most}} thoroughly analyzed and considered for practical implementation. One important aspect of performance of any communication system {{is the ability to}} resist jamming. This area of study, however, is not available in the literature. In this paper, an analysis of antijamming performance of the coherent CSK and noncoherent DCSK systems is presented. The study includes performance analysis for the two types of systems in terms of the bit error probability under different levels of noise power, jamming power, jamming frequency and spreading factor. Computer simulations are used to verify the analytical results.

Single crystal structure determinations were realized using X-ray diffraction. Each sample crystallizes in a monoclinic cell related to the d-Bi 2 O 3 fluorite-type cell, through the relationship: a m = 3 / 2 a F + 3 / 2 b F + 3 c F, b m = 3 / 2 a F - 3 / 2 b <b>F,</b> <b>c</b> <b>m</b> = 2 a F + 2 b F - 4 c F.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} spherically symmetric general fluids with heat flux, motivated by causal thermodynamics, {{and give the}} appropriate set of conditions that define separating shells defining the divide between expansion and collapse. To do so we add the new requirement that heat flux and its evolution vanish at the separating surface. We extend previous works with a fully nonlinear analysis in the 1 + 3 splitting, and present gaugeinvariant results. The definition of the separating surface is inspired by the conservation of the Misner-Sharp mass, and is obtained by generalizing the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equilibrium and turnaround conditions. We emphasize the nonlocal character of these conditions as found in previous works and discuss connections to the phenomena of spacetime cracking and thermal peeling. The work of M.
