5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2005–06 season, Emery had won nine-straight games during the regular season as the back-up to Dominik Hašek. When Hašek injured <b>his</b> <b>groin</b> during the 2006 Winter Olympics, Emery became the team's de facto starter, with Mike Morrison, claimed off of waivers from the Edmonton Oilers, as Emery's backup. Emery would be the starting goaltender {{for the rest of the}} season, leading the Senators to the second round of the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs.|$|E
5|$|By August 1997, the Tiger-Cats were {{struggling}} with several injuries to their receivers. After Ted Long reinjured <b>his</b> <b>groin,</b> the Tiger-Cats signed Alford to their practice squad {{with the intention}} of using him to replace Long in the lineup. Alford made his debut with the Tiger-Cats on August 8, 1997 and went on to play three games with the club. In late August, Alford was released from the team.|$|E
5|$|He {{suffered}} major {{injuries in}} both of his final two seasons with Vancouver. On November 20, 2014 he tore <b>his</b> <b>groin</b> during {{a game against the}} Anaheim Ducks. On December 9, 2015 during a match against the New York Rangers, his face was struck by a Dan Boyle slapshot, breaking his jaw. Both injuries resulted in him missing two months' worth of games.|$|E

60|$|His phrase {{was greeted}} by a strange laugh from a student who lounged against the wall, his peaked cap down on his eyes. The laugh, pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscular frame, seemed like the whinny of an elephant. The student's body shook all over and, to ease his mirth, he rubbed both his hands delightedly over <b>his</b> <b>groins.</b>|$|R

5|$|Hunt's {{coaching}} staff have speculated {{him to make}} an experimental shift into the midfield (as centreman or ruck rover), however he was again selected at fullback for the match against the Box Hill Hawks. In the match Hunt had just three kicks, three handpasses and two marks before straining <b>his</b> <b>groin</b> in the final minutes and missed following games through injury.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2001–02 season began, Salo injured <b>his</b> <b>groin</b> in an {{exhibition}} game against the Toronto Maple Leafs in September. In addition to missing the first three games of the season, he was later sidelined {{for a total of}} 13 more contests due to separate cases of the flu, a broken finger and back spasms. He recorded 18 points in 66 games. In the proceeding off-season, Salo underwent shoulder surgery. Becoming a free agent, he accepted an $880,000 qualifying offer from the Senators on 31 July 2002. Nearly two months later, he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for forward Peter Schaefer on 21 September.|$|E
5|$|During the 2013 season, Zakuani {{made only}} nine {{appearances}} across all competitions before being sidelined with a sports hernia. In that time, he recorded one assist in league play, and assisting in the game-winning goal against Mexico's Tigres UANL in the CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinals. He was later placed {{on injured reserve}} and twice underwent surgery {{on each side of}} <b>his</b> <b>groin.</b> Zakuani's contract was allowed to expire, effectively ending his five-year career with the Sounders, during which he started in 67 of 78 appearances in league play. At the time, he was the club’s third-leading scorer with 17 goals.|$|E

40|$|A 40 -year-old {{gentleman from}} West Bengal, {{who is a}} farmer by profession, {{presented}} with easy fatigability, significant loss of weight, and asymptomatic, progressive nodulo-ulcerative lesions on <b>his</b> <b>groins</b> of 1 year duration. He gave no history of exploring caves or exposure to any large areas contaminated with bird droppings. General examination revealed firm, non-tender, discrete cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopa-thy. Systemic examination was within normal limits. Cutaneous examination showed dull erythematous, non-tender, and firm papules and nodules, few with central ulceration on both groins (Figures 1 and 2). There were no other skin lesions seen. The differentials considered were cutaneous tuberculosis, gumma-tous syphilis, atypical mycobacterial infection, nocardiosis, blastomycosis, sporotrichosis, and histiocytosis.

5|$|England {{then started}} their reply, and Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in <b>his</b> <b>groin</b> again after {{delivering}} his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through the pain. Seeing that Lindwall {{was able to}} bowl through the pain, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller for the second over to see if Miller could bowl. However, Miller threw the ball back, indicating that his body {{would not be able}} to withstand it. This resulted in media consternation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season Hašek injured <b>his</b> <b>groin</b> {{after playing}} just 14 games. On January 9, {{he and the}} team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Hašek privately told general manager Ken Holland {{that he would not}} accept any pay while he was injured. On February 10, he {{announced}} {{that he was not going}} to continue to play that season, surprising the Red Wings management. He eventually revealed that he refused about $3 million of his $6 million salary. In April 2004, he underwent groin surgery in Prague, and returned to his hometown of Pardubice to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on <b>his</b> <b>groin</b> rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
50|$|He {{has had a}} {{slow start}} to season 2008, having a {{modified}} pre-season training program due to <b>his</b> nagging <b>groin</b> injuries and played 5 games for his WAFL side Perth, playing 2 reserves games and 3 senior games. He was given a week off before making {{his return to the}} Eagles senior side against Sydney in Round 11.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, due to {{the groin}} injury {{suffered}} in Atlanta, Baghdatis was forced {{to pull out of}} the events following Atlanta, except for Winston-Salem (first round loss to Pierre-Hugues Herbert).

5|$|On September 14, 2014, West ejected Jonathan Papelbon for the lewd act of {{adjusting}} <b>his</b> <b>groin,</b> {{resulting in}} a confrontation where West grabbed Papelbon's jersey. MLB subsequently suspended Papelbon for seven games for his lewd act and West for one game for initiating contact with Papelbon, marking the first umpire suspension since Fieldin Culbreth's May 2013 suspension for misapplication of baseball rules and the first on-field misconduct suspension of an umpire since Bob Davidson's May 2012 suspension for situation handling violations related to his ejection of Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel. West later claimed Papelbon had initiated first contact, but Major League Baseball determined that the video replay showed West was not correct, and that the contact was initiated by West.|$|E
5|$|The Australians then {{proceeded}} to play Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. Loxton bowled only one over, which was a maiden, before pulling <b>his</b> <b>groin</b> while trying to attain more pace, as the hosts were bowled out for 71. He was unable to bat or bowl again in the game as Australia replied with 101 and then removed the hosts for 89 to leave themselves a target of 60 for victory. Australia came closest to losing for the whole tour. They fell to 6/31, effectively seven down with Loxton unable to bat, before scraping home without further loss, although both batsmen at the crease survived chances. Due to his injury, Loxton was rested {{for the next two}} matches against Surrey at The Oval in London and Cambridge University. Australia won both matches by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Washbrook and Hutton then {{strode to}} the crease as England faced a short burst of Australian pace before the lunch break. Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in <b>his</b> <b>groin</b> after {{delivering}} the first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered, and his first over was a maiden. Seeing Lindwall struggle through the pain barrier, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller at the start off the second over {{to see if he}} could lift and bowl as well. However, Miller threw the ball back to his captain, indicating that his body would not be able to withstand the strain. This resulted in media speculation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the season}} progressed, Tulowitzki {{required}} surgery on <b>his</b> left <b>groin</b> {{that would leave}} him unavailable {{for all of the}} 2012 campaign. The injury happened on May 30, during a doubleheader with the Houston Astros. It started to appear that Tulowitzki would be able to return before the season came to a close, but it would not be the case. The injury limited him to 47 games, in which he batted [...]287 with 8 home runs and 27 RBI.|$|R
40|$|Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a multisystemic, {{metabolic}} and {{autosomal recessive}} inherited disorder affecting especially elastic fibers of skin, retina and blood vessels. The prevalence varies from 1 : 25, 000 to 1 : 100, 000. The {{average age of}} onset is 13. 5 years. Yellowish papules 1 - 3 mm in diameter and plaques merging as linear or reticular pattern are mostly on antecubital fossae, popliteal fossae, inguinal region, lower clavicle, neck, axilla, flexural regions as umbilicus and trauma sites. Of the patients, 85 % have eye involvement. The first symptom of eye involvement is spot retinal pigmentation. Cardiovascular complications occur usually in adults. The most common and early cardiovascular complication is intermittent claudication. There is no specific treatment for skin signs. Lifestyle changes may have important effects on prognosis. A male patient with 3 -year history of yellowish papules on his neck and 1 -year history of yellowish papules on <b>his</b> <b>groins,</b> was presented in this case report.

5|$|Lesnar {{had a great}} showing at the NFL Combine, but on April 17 {{a minivan}} {{collided}} with his motorbike and he suffered a broken jaw and left hand, a bruised pelvis and a pulled groin. Several NFL teams expressed interest in watching Lesnar work out. The Minnesota Vikings worked out Lesnar on June 11, but he was hampered by the groin injury suffered in the April motorcycle accident. On July 24 {{it was reported that}} he was nearly recovered from <b>his</b> <b>groin</b> injury. He signed with the Vikings on July 27 and played in several preseason games for the team. He was released by the Vikings on August 30. Lesnar received an invitation to play as a representative for the Vikings in NFL Europa, but declined due to his desire to stay in the United States with his family. He had several football cards produced of him during his time with the Vikings.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{took the}} new ball and felt pain in <b>his</b> <b>groin</b> again after {{delivering}} his first ball. He persevered {{through the pain}} and removed Washbrook in his fourth over. Hutton then fell to Johnson to leave England at 32/2. Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich before doing the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later. England were 46/4 and Australia were firmly in control. Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes. After the tea break, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball. Compton edged Johnston to be out for 53. One run later, Lindwall bowled Yardley to leave England at 134/6 with their skipper dismissed for 44. Johnson then removed Evans for nine, before Coxon and Laker added 41 for the eighth wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Johnston removed both. England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9/207.|$|E
5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} in low-income neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating <b>his</b> <b>groin</b> with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E
50|$|Having {{recovered}} from <b>his</b> debilitating <b>groin</b> injury in 2010, O'Keefe returned to {{very strong and}} consistent form in 2011.

50|$|St Peter's, Vauxhall (1864), was <b>his</b> first <b>groined</b> church, and {{the first}} of a series of {{buildings}} which brought Pearson to the forefront among his contemporaries. In these he applied the Early English style to modern needs and modern economy with unrivalled success. St. Augustine's, Kilburn (1871), St John's, Red Lion Square, London (1874), St Alban's, Conybere Street, Birmingham (1880), St Michael's, Croydon (1880), St John's, Norwood (1881), St Stephen's, Bournemouth (1889), and All Saints Church, Hove (1889), are characteristic examples of his mature work.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the 1989–90 season, Hextall became unhappy {{that his}} eight-year, $4million {{contract}} was only earning him $325,000 a year, and hired a confrontational agent, Ritch Winter, to renegotiate his contract. The Flyers refused {{to deal with}} the agent, and at a tearful press conference, Hextall declared his contract invalid and announced that he would not take part in the team's training camp. After negotiations about which neither side revealed details, Hextall returned to practice with the team on October20, 42days later. Hextall suffered a slight groin pull during his first game back, and in his second, he hurt his left hamstring. Just under a month later, while playing for the Hershey Bears in an attempt to establish his fitness, he was carried off the ice after once more hurting <b>his</b> <b>groin.</b> In total that season, Hextall appeared nine times; once for the Bears in the AHL, and eight times for the Flyers. In the NHL, he recorded a GAA of4.15, the highest he averaged during any single season of the NHL.|$|E
5|$|A month {{into the}} 2008–09 season, Luongo began a shutout streak that lasted three {{games against the}} Nashville Predators, Phoenix Coyotes, and the Minnesota Wild, akin to the feat he {{accomplished}} in the same month of November the previous year. His overall shutout streak was snapped at 242:36 minutes, in a 2–1 shootout loss against the Colorado Avalanche, surpassing the Canucks record he set the previous season. Later that month, on November 22, Luongo left a game versus the Pittsburgh Penguins after suffering an adductor strain in <b>his</b> <b>groin.</b> Initially listed as week-to-week, he attempted what was considered an early comeback within {{two weeks of the}} injury, but suffered a setback during a team practice on December 10, leaving early in discomfort. After missing 24 games, Luongo made his return on January 15, 2009, in a 4–1 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes. While injured, Luongo was chosen for the fourth time to the NHL All-Star Game in 2009 as the lone Canucks representative. Despite speculation he would have to miss his second straight All-Star Game, Luongo recovered in time and took part in a 12–11 shootout loss to the Eastern Conference. He finished the season with back-to-back shutouts in the final two games against the Los Angeles Kings and Colorado Avalanche to establish a new career-high of nine shutouts on the season, breaking Dan Cloutier's previous franchise single-season shutout record of seven, set in 2001–02.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{retained}} the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge. Ian Johnson was retained despite taking match figures of 1/85, as was Bill Brown, the opener who was batting {{out of position}} in the middle-order. Brown had scored 25, 26 and 17 in his three innings in the middle-order during the tour. O'Reilly criticised the selection of Brown, who had appeared to be noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He said that despite Brown's unbeaten double century in his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey had better claims to selection. Following <b>his</b> <b>groin</b> injury at Trent Bridge, Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury. Before the toss, Bradman had spent an unusually long time inspecting the wicket, and after correctly predicting {{the side of the}} coin, he looked at the surface for another period before announcing Australia's decision to bat. The all-rounder Keith Miller played, but was unfit to bowl.|$|E
25|$|Gerrard {{made his}} {{international}} debut against Ukraine on 31 May 2000.

Gerrard scored his first international goal in the famous 5–1 victory over Germany in a 2002 World Cup qualifier in September 2001, and while England qualified, Gerrard was forced {{to pull out of}} the squad due to <b>his</b> ongoing <b>groin</b> problems after pulling up in Liverpool's final match of the season against Ipswich.|$|R
