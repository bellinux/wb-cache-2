40|$|Abstract. Among other mechanisms, the Chilean fishing act {{established}} {{a system of}} extraordinary fishing permits (EFP) to access the fisheries in stage of recovery or incipient stage of development. The EFP entitles its holder the right to catch during 10 years {{a fraction of the}} <b>global</b> <b>annual</b> <b>quota.</b> The right is obtained through auction where one tenth of the global quota is offered annually. Auction results show concentration of the ITSQ for squat lobster in few firms and there is also evidence of cooperation among them within this market. Although the fleet capacity is somewhat less than in previous periods under free access, the fishing season is now longer; fishing firms look for maximizing the value of the catch by distributing the fishing effort throughout the season to obtain the highest fishing yields. The fishery resource has kept high level of biomass since the ITSQ were introduced, but {{it is not possible to}} assert that there is a correlation between the two...|$|E
50|$|The {{industry}} commenced in South Australia in 1991 with an <b>annual</b> catch <b>quota</b> of 1,000 tonnes. In 2003, the fishery's <b>annual</b> <b>quota</b> {{was set at}} 36,000 tonnes. By 2014, the <b>annual</b> <b>quota</b> {{had increased}} to 38,000 tonnes. The fishery's total landed catch peaked at 56,952 tonnes in the financial year 2004-05 stabilising at around 32,000 tonnes per annum thereafter.|$|R

40|$|PresentationITQ systems {{generate}} ITQ prices. For {{any given}} ITQ-managed species there are typically two prices. One {{is for the}} <b>annual</b> (or seasonal) <b>quota,</b> the other is for the longer lasting ITQ-share. In well-functioning ITQ markets, these prices reveal important information about the fishery. In the single species framework, prices of <b>annual</b> <b>quotas</b> measure the current profitability of fishing and prices for ITQ-shares reflect the expected future profitability of fishing under the ITQ system. Trading arbitrage leads to a determinate functional relationship between the prices of <b>annual</b> quantity <b>quotas</b> and that of TAC-shares. In the multi-species framework, if the ability to select the species composition of the harvest is less than perfect, the information content of the ITQ-prices is much less straight-forward. For instance the price of <b>annual</b> <b>quotas</b> for a given species may, under not uncommon circumstances, far exceed its landings price or, alternatively, be approximately zero. This paper explores these issues. It derives explicit expressions ITQ prices under various circumstances including the multi-species context with imperfect selectivity, discarding possibilities and ITQ-noncompliance. To illustrate the issues, empirical data on ITQ prices in Iceland are presented...|$|R
