40|$|The {{event of}} ruin (bankruptcy) {{has long been}} a core concept of risk {{management}} interest in the literature of actuarial science. There are two major research lines. The first one focuses on distributional studies of some crucial ruin-related variables such as the deficit at ruin or the time to ruin. The second one focuses on dynamically controlling the probability that ruin occurs by imposing controls such as <b>investment,</b> <b>reinsurance,</b> or dividend payouts. The content of the thesis will be in line with the second research direction, but under a relaxed definition of ruin, for the reason that ruin is often too harsh a criteria to be implemented in practice. Relaxation of the concept of ruin through the consideration of "exotic ruin" features, including for instance, ruin under discrete observations, Parisian ruin setup, two-sided exit framework, and drawdown setup, received considerable attention in recent years. While there has been a rich literature on the distributional studies of those new features in insurance surplus processes, comparably less contributions have been made to dynamically controlling the corresponding risk. The thesis proposes to analytically study stochastic control problems related to some "exotic ruin" features in the broad area of insurance and finance. In particular, in Chapter 3, we study an optimal investment problem by minimizing the probability that a significant drawdown occurs. In Chapter 4, we take this analysis one step further by proposing a general drawdown-based penalty structure, which include for example, the probability of drawdown considered in Chapter 3 as a special case. Subsequently, we apply it in an optimal investment problem of maximizing a fund manager's expected cumulative income. Moreover, in Chapter 5 we study an optimal investment-reinsurance problem in a two-sided exit framework. All problems mentioned above are considered in a random time horizon. Although the random time horizon is mainly determined {{by the nature of the}} problem, we point out that under suitable assumptions, a random time horizon is analytically more tractable in comparison to its finite deterministic counterpart. For each problem considered in Chapters 3 [...] 5, we will adopt the dynamic programming principle (DPP) to derive a partial differential equation (PDE), commonly referred to as a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the literature, and subsequently show that the value function of each problem is equivalent to a strong solution to the associated HJB equation via a verification argument. The remaining problem is then to solve the HJB equations explicitly. We will develop a new decomposition method in Chapter 3, which decomposes a nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) into two solvable nonlinear first-order ODEs. In Chapters 4 and 5, we use the Legendre transform to build respectively one-to-one correspondence between the original problem and its dual problem, with the latter being a linear free boundary problem that can be solved in explicit forms. It is worth mentioning that additional difficulties arise in the drawdown related problems of Chapters 3 and 4 for the reason that the underlying problems involve the maximum process as an additional dimension. We overcome this difficulty by utilizing a dimension reduction technique. Chapter 6 will be devoted to the study of an optimal investment-reinsurance problem of maximizing the expected mean-variance utility function, which is a typical time-inconsistent problem in the sense that DPP fails. The problem is then formulated as a non-cooperative game, and a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is subsequently solved. The thesis is finally ended with some concluding remarks and some future research directions in Chapter 7...|$|E

30|$|Compared to {{the study}} on optimal <b>investment</b> and <b>reinsurance</b> for maximizing {{expected}} utility, papers concentrating on minimizing ultimate ruin probability are relatively few. Usually, if one wants to find optimal policies for minimizing the ultimate ruin probability, {{it is difficult to}} prove the regularity of the value function. It is also very difficult to obtain an explicit solution to the HJB equation and the optimal policies. This {{may be one of the}} reasons that prevent us from progressing the study on minimizing ultimate ruin probability by <b>investment</b> or <b>reinsurance.</b> When the explicit expression of ruin probability is invalid, it is meaningful to find an accurate upper bound estimation of ruin probability. Due to this fact, the upper bound estimation of ruin probability has become one of the three main topics in the classical risk model (cf. Grandell [21]). In the classical risk model, an upper bound for ruin probability is also called Lundberg inequality. Hu and Zhang [22] studied optimal reinsurance for minimizing the upper bound of ultimate ruin probability in a correlated risk model with common shocks. The results in [22] show that the upper bound of the ruin probability in the model with reinsurance chance is less than the one in the model without reinsurance chance. Thus, under the correlated risk model, reinsurance business can really reduce the exposure of the insurance company, and this impact can be quantified by comparing the upper bound. Hu and Zhang [22] only considered reinsurance business, it is natural to take both <b>reinsurance</b> and <b>investment</b> into account. It is well known that if the claim sizes have exponential moments (i.e., the so-called small claim case), the ruin probability decreases exponentially with the increase in the initial surplus (cf. Assussen and Albrecher [23]). However, Kalashnikov and Norberg [24], Frolova et al. [25] found that, even if the claim sizes are small, if the insurance company invests all of its surplus into a risky market, the ruin probability decreases only with some negative power function of the initial surplus. Thus, for large capital, investing more than the surplus into the risky market cannot be optimal. Then, one interesting problem is: What is the minimal ruin probability that it can obtain? Particularly, can it do better than keeping the funds in the bond? And if yes, how much can it do better? Hipp and Plum [26] and Gaier et al. [27] considered this problem when the surplus process is the compound Poisson process and found that when the insurance company can adjust its investment amount to reduce the risk exposure, a constant investment amount is the optimal policy, regardless of the change of surplus of the insurance company. This paper extends the study of [22] by incorporating the investment business into the decision process. But the method applied in this paper relies on the dynamic programming principle and HJB equation. As a result, we also find that the optimal polices for minimizing the upper bound of ruin probability are constant investment amount and constant reinsurance ratio, respectively. Numerical examples show the following: under optimal constant investment policy, an upper bound of the ultimate ruin probability is less than the corresponding one in [22]; when the correlation coefficient of each component risk process increases, the impact of investment on the upper bound of ruin probability inequality is less significant; when the claims are heavy-tailed, reinsurance plays a more important role for the insurance company than the investment.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the utility {{optimization}} {{problem for a}} general insurance model is studied. The reserve process of the insurance company is described by a stochastic differential equation driven by a Brownian motion and a Poisson random measure, representing the randomness from the financial market and the insurance claims, respectively. The random safety loading and stochastic interest rates are allowed in the model so that the reserve process is non-Markovian in general. The insurance company can manage the reserves through both portfolios of the <b>investment</b> and a <b>reinsurance</b> policy to optimize a certain utility function, defined in a generic way. The main feature of the problem lies in the intrinsic constraint {{on the part of}} reinsurance policy, which is only proportional to the claim-size instead of the current level of reserve, and hence it {{is quite different from the}} optimal investment/consumption problem with constraints in finance. Necessary and sufficient conditions for both well posedness and solvability will be given by modifying the ``duality method'' in finance and with the help of the solvability of a special type of backward stochastic differential equations. ...|$|R

We further assume that when the surplus level becomes negative, the company can borrow to continue financing. The ultimate objective is to seek an optimal investment strategy that minimizes the probability of absolute ruin, i. e. the probability that the liminf of the surplus process is negative infinity.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} the surplus of a non-life insurance company and assume that it follows either the classical Cramér-Lundberg model or its diffusion approximation. That is, we consider a continuous time model, where premiums are cashed at a constant rate and claims occur randomly with random sizes modelled by a compound Poisson process. In actuarial mathematics the risk of an insurance company is traditionally measured by the probability of ruin, where the time of ruin {{is defined as the}} first time when the surplus becomes negative. Using the ruin probability as a risk measure has been criticised because it is unrealistic to assume that an insurance company is ruined as soon as the surplus becomes negative. In this thesis, we assume that the insurer is not ruined although the surplus becomes negative. In order to avoid ruin, penalty payments occur, depending on the level of the surplus. For example, penalty payments occur if the insurance company needs to borrow money. In {{the first part of this}} thesis {{we consider the}} diffusion approximation to the Cramér-Lundberg model and we aim to determine a dividend strategy that maximises the difference between the expected discounted dividend and penalty payments, where penalty payments are either modelled by an exponential, linear or quadratic function. We show that the optimal strategy is a so-called barrier strategy and calculate the optimal barrier. The second part studies the analogous problem where the surplus process of an insurance company is given by a Cramér-Lundberg model. Here, similar results are obtained. In conclusion, we consider the problem where we have to determine an optimal <b>investment</b> and <b>reinsurance</b> strategy and the surplus follows the diffusion approximation. The insurance company can invest in several risky assets and reduce the insurance risk either by excess of loss or proportional reinsurance.

It makes {{extensive use of}} reinsurance facilities and is free from the pervasive premium, product, <b>investment,</b> and <b>reinsurance</b> controls that have bedeviled the insurance markets of so many developing countries around the world. Total premiums amounted in 2001 to 4. 1 percent of GDP, while insurance company assets were equivalent to 18 percent of GDP. Life insurance, which has been favored by generous tax incentives and has also benefited from the growth of pension business and housing finance, represents 61 percent of total premiums. Nonlife business is also well organized. Large industrial and commercial risks are reinsured with top international companies, while motor insurance, {{which is the largest}} class of business with 45 percent of total nonlife premiums, does not suffer from high loss ratios or unduly long delays in settlement. Investment limits are generally sound and, with some small but important exceptions, effectively nonbinding. There is no minimum requirement for investment in government securities. Investment in overseas assets is limited to 25 percent of total assets, except for foreign life companies and general insurance business which are not allowed to invest in overseas assets.

Despite the high level of concentration, the {{insurance industry}} appears to be competitive, operating with high efficiency and re Despite the high level of concentration, the insurance industry appears to be competitive, operating with high efficiency and reasonable profitability. Large and medium-size companies have strong reserves, appropriate reinsurance arrangements, and good profitability. However, several of the smaller companies have weak financial ratios and suffer from long delays in settling claims. Insurance regulation and supervision is entrusted to the Financial Services Commission (FSC). The current regulatory framework has many strong elements, including reliance on solvency monitoring, prudent asset diversification, international accounting standards, and actuarial methods. But there are some important gaps in corporate governance, internal controls, and risk management. In addition, solvency ratios are below international standards and do not include modern risk-based capital requirements. These gaps are already being addressed in two new draft insurance bills which contain many highly modern provisions. Implementing regulations on solvency and actuarial standards need to be developed. Insurance supervision has been invigorated since the creation of the FSC, but further strengthening is required. It needs to emphasize risk management and internal controls, to develop an early warning system, and to establish clear procedures for early and effective intervention. The FSC should require actuaries to report on the reinvestment risk faced by insurance companies and their exposure to a large and persistent fall in interest rates.
