5|$|A {{central part}} of Macdonald's case {{concerned}} the redistribution of wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument {{was based on the}} premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, so that they could pay <b>for</b> <b>government</b> services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.|$|E

After leaving Temple Sinai, he became chaplain at San Quentin State Prison.|$|E

Former National Security Agency director Mike McConnell is on Fortinet Federal’s board, and 12 of the 15 U.S. Cabinet departments use Fortinet products.

5|$|Kelsey Munro {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, suggesting that it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope. But he says pessimism {{is not the same}} thing as fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need <b>for</b> <b>government</b> intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro also points out that some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late.|$|E

5|$|Residential school {{deaths were}} common {{and have been}} linked to the {{persistence}} of poorly constructed and maintained facilities. The actual number of deaths remains unknown due to inconsistent reporting by school officials and the destruction of medical and administrative records in compliance with retention and disposition policies <b>for</b> <b>government</b> records.

James IV visited Dunstaffnage on two occasions.|$|E

5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always {{see eye to eye}} with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready <b>for</b> <b>government</b> service, there was always the factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E
5|$|After the ASTP {{mission was}} completed, Lunney became {{manager of the}} Shuttle Payload Integration and Development Program. During this period, it was {{anticipated}} that NASA's space shuttle fleet would be flying very frequent missions, and carrying commercial payloads as well as flying missions <b>for</b> <b>government</b> {{organizations such as the}} Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads could best be physically accommodated within the cargo bay of the shuttle. During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations.|$|E
