Because of his work on the State Building act, Laybourne Smith sat on the Board of Referees responsible for adjudicating disputes, and his position on the Architects Board of South Australia was a <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> his involvement {{in the creation of the}} Architects Act.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} (p, q)-Bernstein Durrmeyer operators. We define (p, q)-beta integral {{and use it}} {{to obtain}} the moments of the operators. We obtain uniform convergence of the operators by using Korovkin’s theorem. We estimate <b>direct</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> the operators by means of modulus of continuity and Peetre K-functional.

5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on CT scanning {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with traumatic brain injury. Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion. It usually happens in the setting of other forms of traumatic brain injury and has been linked with a poorer prognosis. It is unclear, however, if this is a <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy {{is awarded}} {{annually}} to the National Hockey League player who best exemplifies {{the qualities of}} perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to ice hockey. It is named after Bill Masterton, the only player in NHL history to die as a <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> injuries suffered during a game. The winner is selected by a poll of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association after each team nominates one player in competition. It is often awarded to a player who has come back from career– or even life-threatening illness or injury.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack at}} Sinsinawa Mound, {{compounded}} by other incidents around the region, helped {{contribute to the}} fear gripping the settlers. The people of Platteville, in present-day Wisconsin, contemplated fleeing to Galena, about 25 miles (40 km) south, as a <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the Sinsinawa Mound raid. Colonel Dodge dispatched one of his men, Frederick Hollman, to Platteville to reassure its nervous residents. However, by the time Hollman arrived the settlers had already been informed that the local Native American Ho-Chunk tribesmen were friendly. This and the subsequent delivery of promised supplies from Galena further placated Platteville's residents, and the threatened exodus was called off.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} {{context of the}} event, coupled {{with a variety of}} curious circumstances (for instance, the Russian agent Kim Philby was head of counter-intelligence for MI6 in Gibaltar at the time), immediately gave rise to numerous speculation that Sikorski's death had been no accident, and may have been the <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a Soviet, British, or even Polish conspiracy. Some modern sources note that the accident is not fully explained However, as Roman Wapiński noted in his biographical entry on Sikorski in the Polish Biographical Dictionary in 1997, no conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing has been found, and Sikorski's official cause of death is listed as an accident.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{landscape}} of the cities changed dramatically during this period. The Praetorian Building in Dallas (1907) and the Amicable Life Insurance Company building in Waco (1911) {{were among the first}} skyscrapers in Texas. The Perlstein Building in Beaumont was the first skyscraper built as a <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the boom. Beaumont's downtown grew rapidly during the first decade after the 1901 strike. After a second major strike at Spindletop in 1925, Beaumont had the largest skyline of any city between Houston and New Orleans {{by the end of the}} decade. The twenty–two story Edson Hotel, completed in 1929, was the tallest hotel building in Texas for several years.|$|E
5|$|When the Marlborough term began, an {{arrangement}} was made whereby City of London boys had lessons during games for Marlborough College pupils and vice versa. The difficulties at the Marlborough location ranged from finding a study for Headmaster Dale to finding enough kitchen staff to prepare food for both schools. Resources were limited and outbreaks of influenza and rubella were common. Like many other schools evacuated into the countryside, the City of London School's enrolment fell from 700 to 430 during the war, although no pupil was killed or injured as a <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> enemy fire.|$|E
