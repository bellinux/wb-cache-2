5|$|Germany is {{a global}} leader in science and {{technology}} as its achievements in the fields of science and technology have been significant. Research and development efforts form {{an integral part of the}} economy. The Nobel Prize has been awarded to 107 German laureates. It produces the second highest number of graduates in science and engineering (31%) after South Korea. In the beginning of the 20th century, German laureates had more awards than those of any other nation, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sciences</b> (physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine).|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} department, Syme was succeeded by Peter Brunt. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>sciences,</b> Dr John Baltrop was {{sometime}} Bursar; Bryan Birch, Professor of Arithmetic {{and co-author of}} the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture; and Nicholas Kurti, Vice-President of the Royal Society. Overall, although the immediate post-War staff remained traditional– if not overly conservative in nature– with a third drawn from Brasenose itself, the late sixties signalled a change on this front. Then, a wave of new face emerged: among them, Laszlo Solymar (later Professor of Applied Electromagnetism), Vernon Bogdanor (Professor of Government), Robert Evans (Regius Professor of Modern History) and Graham Richards, Oxford's Chairman of Chemistry.|$|E
40|$|Argumentation is {{a crucial}} part of {{discourse}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scientific field, but is rarely found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> classroom. This raises the questions of why teachers are not using argumentation, as well as what benefits argumentation provides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> classroom. Argumentation is not widely used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> education field due to lack of teacher knowledge about integration techniques and teachers’ fear of unruly class discussions. However, research shows that students benefit in many ways from argumentation based learning by allowing students to work through real world problems to develop higher level thinking skills. This paper discusses the importance of argumentation in science learning, ways to increase argumentation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> education field, and specific techniques of argumentation that can be implemented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> classroom...|$|R

5|$|She {{was elected}} a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1989. McClintock {{received}} the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sciences</b> of the American Philosophical Society in 1993. She was awarded 14 Honorary Doctor of Science degrees and an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. In 1986 she {{was inducted into}} the National Women's Hall of Fame. During her final years, McClintock led a more public life, especially after Evelyn Fox Keller's 1983 biography of her, A Feeling for the Organism, brought McClintock's story to the public. She remained a regular presence in the Cold Spring Harbor community, and gave talks on mobile genetic elements and the history of genetics research for the benefit of junior scientists. An anthology of her 43 publications The Discovery and Characterization of Transposable Elements: The Collected Papers of Barbara McClintock was published in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The FSU Young Scholars Program is a {{competitive}} residential {{science and mathematics}} program for 40 Florida high-school students with potential for careers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sciences,</b> engineering, and health professions. Admission to the FSU YSP generally requires completing the eleventh grade and scoring at least 90% on a national standardized examination such as the SAT or PSAT. The PSAT math average is approximately 96% and the PSAT verbal average is approximately 94%. Many students are first in their class at their home schools, with 79% being in the top ten of their class.|$|E
5|$|Professional {{programs}} {{during the}} interwar period {{were limited to}} just theology and nursing. By the 1940s the McMaster administration was under pressure to modernize and expand the university's programs. During the Second World War and post-war periods the demand for technological expertise, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sciences,</b> increased. This problem placed a strain on the finances of what was still a denominational Baptist institution. In particular, the institution could no longer secure sufficient funds from denominational sources alone to sustain science research. Since denominational institutions could not receive public funds, the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec decided to reorganize the university, creating two federated colleges. The arts and divinity programs were reconstituted as University College and science was reorganized under the newly incorporated Hamilton College as a separate division capable of receiving provincial grants. Hamilton College was incorporated in 1948 by letters patent under The Companies Act, although it remained only affiliated with the university. The University traditionally focused on undergraduate studies, and did not offer a PhD program until 1949.|$|E
