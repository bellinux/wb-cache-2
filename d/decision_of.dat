40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Church Polity)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. According to the {{tradition}} of the Reformed church polity, believers commit themselves on grounds of their common faith and confession to certain matters. The critical question which has to be answered in this study, is: To what extent do believers commit themselves to the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church and {{what are the implications of}} such a commitment? The central theoretical argument of this study is: The mutual agreement between believers to commit themselves to <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church is 'n voluntary commitment, because believers consider themselves as devouted to the Scriptures, confession and church order on which grounds <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church are taken. Chapter 2 investigates the origin and leading thought of the binding and commitment to <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church. Then there is a short historical overview on the shaping of the concept "binding and commitment to <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church". Subsequently the scope of this binding agreement to <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church as well as the role of fundamental and indifferent matters are explored. Chapter 3 focuses on the way in which believers commit themselves to the confession and also on the conflict surrounding the binding agreement to the confession. Furthermore the importance of church denomination and the negative consequences when the binding agreement to <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church are ignored, are examined. In the last instance, the way in which churches should bind themselves to the church order and the positive results of such a binding, are investigated. Chapter 4 highlights the main problems which lead to a misconception in the understanding of the binding agreement to <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church. Then the history of deviation from the binding agreement to the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church, is reviewed. Furthermore the conflict in South-Africa about the binding to the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church, especially within the Reformed Churches in South-Africa, is looked at. In chapter 5 the misconceptions about binding to the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church are pointed out. Next, the distinctive character of the binding to the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church is dealt with. Subsequently the demands and commitments which arise from the binding to the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church are explored, as well as the positive results obtained when maintaining the binding agreement to the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church. The final part emphasizes the responsibility to extend and to bring to the attention of believers the concept of binding to the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> the church. Doctora...|$|R

5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts.

One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin IV died {{in early}} 1185. His successor, the child BaldwinV died {{in late summer}} 1186.

However, Sybilla's uncle, JoscelinIII of Courtenay, took control of Jerusalem {{with the support of}} Raynald and other {{influential}} prelates and royal officials. Raynald urged the townspeople to accept Sybilla as the lawful monarch, according to the Estoire de Eracles. The bailli, RaymondIII of Tripoli, and his supporters tried to prevent her coronation and reminded her partisans of the <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> the High Court. Ignoring their protest, Raynald and Gerard of Ridefort, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, accompanied Sybilla to the Holy Sepulchre, where she was crowned. She also arranged the coronation of her husband, although he was unpopular even among her supporters. Her opponents tried to persuade Raynald's stepson, Humphrey, to claim the crown on his wife's behalf, but Humphrey deserted them and swore fealty to Sybilla and Guy. Raynald headed the list of secular witnesses in four royal charters issued between 21October 1186 and 7March 1187, showing that he had become a principal figure in the new king's court.|$|E
