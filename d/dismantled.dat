40|$|Abstract. In {{accordance}} with the increased awareness of resource depletion and environmental pollution, the importance of eco-friendly disposal and recycling of vehicles as a potentially valuable resource is emphasized; in particular, {{this is important as}} automobile production and demand continues steadily. In this paper, a systematic <b>dismantling</b> system is proposed to minimize the quantity of ASR by <b>dismantling</b> End-of-Life Vehicles(ELVs) rationally and efficiently. An adaptive layout design system is also provided to aid for the effective implementation of the proposed <b>dismantling</b> system to industrial applications. The proposed <b>dismantling</b> system is based on eco-friendly <b>dismantling</b> and improves not only the recyclability of ELVs, but also the efficiency of the <b>dismantling</b> operations. The adaptive layout design system is a software tool, which allows a layout of a <b>dismantling</b> plant according to the specific requirements of the customers, and estimates the overall figures and capacity of an intended plant by simulation of the <b>dismantling</b> process. This interactive design system can be useful for testing alternative layouts of a <b>dismantling</b> plant customized to meet particular recycling needs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, a {{large number}} of toxic and {{hazardous}} substances were discharged into environment because of the simple landfill and accumulation of vehivle <b>dismantling</b> waste. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} develop the recycling technology of vehivle <b>dismantling</b> waste for the harmless, stability, reduction and resource utilization of vehivle <b>dismantling</b> waste. In this paper, the compositions of vehicle <b>dismantling</b> waste from two different <b>dismantling</b> processes were investigated by manual sorting, infrared spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, experimental results showed that the vehicle waste from manual <b>dismantling</b> contained more polyurethane, foamed plastic and rubber with low value and the size of waste is lager, the vehicle waste from mechanical <b>dismantling</b> contained more metal and brittle polymer and their size was smaller. The concentration of metal in two kinds of wastes are less than 1 %, the total concentration of carbon and hydrogen reach about 70 %, so vehicle <b>dismantling</b> waste was suital for recovering ernergy, but the pollution of chlrone from polyvinyl chloride need to be prevented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract After {{decades of}} pushing for {{deregulation}} and regulatory reform in its Member States, has the European Union itself become a locus for policy <b>dismantling</b> – i. e. {{leading to a}} weakening of its policies? This thesis offers a first systematic study of policy <b>dismantling</b> at EU level. It focuses on environmental policies, {{an area in which}} EU action has repeatedly been criticised by politicians for harming competitiveness and not respecting national sovereignty. It combines for the first time insights from comparative politics studies of <b>dismantling</b> with EU governance literature, to offer a theoretical framework specially configured to explaining <b>dismantling</b> at EU level. It investigates which EU environmental policies have been targeted for policy <b>dismantling,</b> by whom, why and how, from the early 1990 s {{to the end of the}} second Barroso Commission in 2014. It reveals how the EU has changed, from a driver of policy <b>dismantling</b> in its Member States to a locus of <b>dismantling</b> in its own right. <b>Dismantling</b> attempts (from the reduction of administrative burdens to the repatriation of competences) have been made by key EU actors – which for some, such as the European Commission, goes against the conventional wisdom in EU studies. These attempts have been justified in terms of criticisms of the EU’s legislative outputs – subsidiarity and proportionality – and of European integration itself. But they have not resulted in significant policy <b>dismantling.</b> <b>Dismantling</b> has been the least frequent outcome of legislative reform amongst the many pieces of legislation earmarked for <b>dismantling.</b> This pattern indicates the resilience – until now – of the EU’s “green state” (Klyza and Sousa, 2013), but <b>dismantling</b> attempts have markedly changed the way the EU legislates on environmental issues and further hindered policy expansion. This thesis contributes to the renaissance of <b>dismantling</b> studies in comparative politics by revealing how <b>dismantling</b> strategies and effects at EU level differ from the existing literature which focuses almost exclusively on nation states. Looking at the EU from a policy <b>dismantling</b> perspective, this thesis also questions foundational assumptions in EU studies – on what drives EU actors, on where the EU is headed. Finally it offers a different reading of the history of EU environmental policy, stressing the role that contestation in general, and <b>dismantling</b> in particular, have played in shaping the environmental acquis...|$|R
40|$|Defence date: 9 June 2016 Examining Board: Professor Youssef Cassis, EUI (Supervisor); Professor Anne Deighton, Oxford University (External Supervisor); Professor Federico Romero, EUI; Professor Gabriele Clemens, Hamburg University. The {{programme}} of <b>dismantling</b> German factories for reparations {{caused the}} biggest {{crisis in the}} relationship between British and the Germans during the apost-Second World War occupation years. By 1949, the peak year for <b>dismantling</b> in the British Zone, the Germans were convinced that the British, alone among the Allies, were pushing for continued <b>dismantling,</b> and that they were doing so for purely commercial reasons. The <b>dismantling</b> campaign has been almost exclusively by economic historian, with the consensus being that its effect was limited. This raises the question of why it turned into such a bitter political conflict. My thesis explores the <b>dismantling</b> programme from this angle. I show that the renewed <b>dismantling</b> programme from 1947 onwards caused rifts inwards in the British occupation apparatus, as the punitive aspects of the <b>dismantling</b> campaign and the strong German reaction against it started threatening what the British saw as their positive mission in Germany, re-educating the Germans. It caused a rift between the Allies, as the US Congress started a massive campaign to end <b>dismantling</b> in connection with the Marshall Aid, and with the French vacillating between ending and continuing <b>dismantling.</b> In Germany itself, the <b>dismantling</b> programme became an issue where the political parties, industry groups and labour unions sought to exploit the groundswell of popular discontent against <b>dismantling</b> for their own, wider political goals, often with a troublesome nationalistic rhetoric. <b>Dismantling</b> as a major political issue ended with the Petersberg agreement in November 1949. By this time the conflict over <b>dismantling</b> had festered for so long that it was relatively easy for the Adenauer government to sideline the British and focus their attentions on rapprochement with France and European economic integration. The most original part of the research focuses on how British debates on whether to proceed or end <b>dismantling,</b> and how British <b>dismantling</b> policies were shaped by other occupation goals focused on a particular British conception of power. The British increasingly saw <b>dismantling</b> as influencing British prestige, meant to compensate for lagging relative power. I define what the British meant by their prestige in this question, its imperial origins and how it failed...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} how {{the transition to}} a more multi-level system of water governance in Britain has affected the way in which <b>dismantling</b> was conceived of and pursued.

The analysis emphasizes two broader points: First, research that seeks to study <b>dismantling</b> in heavily Europeanized sectors should account for the EU's role (direct and indirect) in <b>dismantling</b> activities at both levels of governance. Second, examining <b>dismantling</b> as a discrete, time-bound event runs the risk of overlooking the importance of deeper historical processes and longer-term dynamics.
