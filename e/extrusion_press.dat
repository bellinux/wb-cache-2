40|$|In this article, {{failure in}} {{lightning}} tests and the overcoming of its destructive effects by improving {{the new generation}} of optical grounding wire (OPGW) are presented. The designed composite structure for transmission lines in Turkey is composed of six galvanized steel wires, one stainless steel tube with multiple glass fibres and 12 aluminium alloy AA 6101 wires. Test samples from prototype OPGW successfully passed short circuit requirements but failed in tests of lightning strikes. Consequently, a material modification was applied by feeding 3 % AlB 2 master alloy as a 9. 5 mm rod into molten metal in the tundish when the metal flows from the melting furnace to the vertical log casting mould. Logs cast from AA 6101 are used to manufacture feedstock by means of <b>extrusion</b> <b>press.</b> Impaired electrical conductivity of the AA 6101 due to the presence of heavy metal impurities such as Ti, Cr and V should be increased to pass the tests. Following this, the transition metals were transformed into insoluble borides from solution after inoculation with AlB 2. As a result, the conductivity of wires drawn from feedstock produced by <b>extrusion</b> <b>press</b> with the modified AA 6101 billets was increased from 52. 5 to 57 % IACS.

40|$|This {{article has}} been {{published}} in the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science [© PEP]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] optimization procedure for minimizing the shaking force harmonics of machinery is described. Because of constraints imposed by the specification, optimization is unlikely to make any significant reduction in the fundamental, machine frequency, term of the shaking force. That term, normally the largest, must be substantially reduced by other means for the procedure described here to be cost effective. Earlier work describing methods of reducing the fundamental term are cited. An <b>extrusion</b> <b>press</b> machine incorporating two planar mechanisms, one crank driven and one cam driven, provides an example. Two designs of the cam-driven mechanism, referred to here as cams 1 and 2, are in use in installed <b>extrusion</b> <b>press</b> machines. Harmonic analysis of the shaking force as a function of time shows that cam 2 produces smaller amplitudes of shaking force harmonics. The ten variables used in the optimization process are the amplitudes and angles of the first five terms of a trigonometric series defining the acceleration of a reciprocating mass driven by a hypothetical third cam, cam 3, which is similar to cam 2 but stripped of all harmonics of order higher than the fifth. The objective function is the sum of the amplitudes of the horizontal components of the second to fifth shaking force harmonics on the machine as a consequence of accelerations of the moving parts of both mechanisms. Several equality and inequality constraints must be met. For the <b>extrusion</b> <b>press</b> machine the result is a reduction in the amplitudes that would be created if cam 3 were to be used by approximately 10, 75, 65 and 100 per cent respectively. The improvement over cam 1 is greater. The procedure is particularly suited as a retrofit measure where the number of installed machines is large in relation to the future rate of production of new machines: a cam that has been removed from one machine can be re-cut for use on another machine...|$|E

It was also found that, as long as there are adequate normal forces and treated contact surfaces, this kind of separated structure has the ability to resist detachment and parallel slide. The height of the notch and radius of the contact zone are the foremost indexes affecting the application of the bumpy-ridge technique, and these parameters are influenced by several factors, such as the shape of the ridges, the curvature of the contact point, the distance between neighbouring ridges, etc. The elastic contact of the ridge can be solved completely by the use of theoretical calculation and graphical method.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{industrial}} process, the moisture of the clay sheet obtained by <b>extrusion</b> and <b>pressed</b> {{to form a}} tile varies in time. It depends on the nature and the mixing of the raw materials during the production. In order to model and understand {{the influence of the}} moisture on the pressing step, it is necessary to determine the parameters of the rheological and tribological laws. A study of the rheological behaviour, based on free compression tests on cylinder samples, allowed to use an elasto-visco-plastic behaviour for the extruded clay paste. The different constitutive parameters were estimated by an inverse analysis based on the experimental force/displacement curves. The identification was performed with the optimisation algorithm implemented in the commercial software Forge ® 2009. The influence of the water content in the paste on the rheological parameters was identified and fitted using linear models. To understand the influence of the moisture, we simulated a compression test, using Forge ® involving the shaping of a tile lug. This geometry is representative of the state of stress during the pressing of the tile, in an area currently subjected to defects.
