2500|$|An {{electric}} violin is {{a violin}} {{equipped with an}} electronic output of its sound. The term most properly refers to an instrument intentionally made to be electrified with built-in pickups, usually with a solid body. It can also refer to a violin fitted with an <b>electric</b> <b>pickup</b> of some type, although [...] "amplified violin" [...] or [...] "electro-acoustic violin" [...] are more accurate in that case.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{original}} {{aim of the}} resonator was increased volume, some modern instruments incorporate <b>electric</b> <b>pickups,</b> and players add pickups to non-electric instruments, and use the resonator purely for its distinctive tone.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{electric}} basses were upright electric basses {{built in}} the 1930s by fitting an otherwise normal double bass with <b>electric</b> <b>pickups,</b> and so had a scale length of about 43" [...] (109 cm).|$|R
50|$|Archtop 4-string bass guitars {{have been}} {{manufactured}} since {{the use of}} <b>electric</b> <b>pickups</b> became popular. The most famous example is the Höfner violin bass used by Paul McCartney. Warwick makes a range of archtop 4, 5, and 6 string bass guitars. Framus also makes a range of archtop bass guitars.|$|R

50|$|A semi-acoustic guitar or hollow-body {{electric}} {{is a type}} {{of electric}} guitar that originates from the 1930s. It has both a sound box and one or more <b>electric</b> <b>pickups.</b> This {{is not the same as}} an acoustic-electric guitar, which is an acoustic guitar with the addition of pickups or other means of amplification, added by either the manufacturer or the player.|$|R

50|$|A solid-body musical {{instrument}} is a string instrument {{such as a}} guitar, bass or violin built without its normal sound box and relying on an <b>electric</b> <b>pickup</b> system to directly receive the vibrations of the strings.|$|E
5000|$|A vital {{accessory}} in {{the past}} was the nyenyemo, a leaf-shaped plate of tin or brass with wire loops threaded around the edge. Clamped to the bridge, it produced sympathetic sounds, serving as an amplifier since the sound carried well in the open air. In today's environment players usually prefer or need an <b>electric</b> <b>pickup.</b>|$|E

50|$|Though the {{original}} {{aim of the}} resonator was increased volume, some modern instruments incorporate <b>electric</b> <b>pickups</b> and related technology. Many modern makers produce instruments with one {{of a variety of}} pickup types—and some players retrofit pickups to non-electric instruments. Most commonly, resonator guitars use piezoelectric pickups (contact type transducers) placed under the bridge or elsewhere on the instrument, or use specialized microphones placed inside the instrument or {{directly in front of the}} cone to preserve the resonator's distinctive tone.|$|R

50|$|In early 2009, Phoenix Motorcars {{introduced}} a test fleet of their all-electric SUT (Sports Utility Truck) to Maui. One {{of the surviving}} electric vehicles from the late 1990s is the Chevy S-10 <b>electric</b> <b>pickup</b> truck. Many other vehicles from this era, such as the General Motors EV1 were recalled and destroyed. A newcomer is the Miles Electric Vehicles ZX40ST electric truck now available in the United States. Miles Electric Vehicles is based in Santa Monica, California.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} twenties, {{the idea for}} {{electrified}} string instruments had been around for some time, and experimental banjo, violin and guitar pickups had been developed. George Beauchamp had himself been experimenting with electric amplification as early as 1925, but his early efforts involving microphones did not produce the effects he desired. Along the way Beauchamp also built a one-string test guitar made out of a 2X4 piece of lumber and an electric phonograph pickup. As the problems at National became more apparent, Beauchamp's home experiments took on a more rigorous shape, {{and he began to}} attend night classes in electronics as well as collaborating with fellow National employee Paul Barth. When the prototype <b>electric</b> <b>pickup</b> they were developing finally worked to his satisfaction, Beauchamp asked former National shop craftsman Harry Watson to make a wooden neck and body to which the electronics could be attached. It was nicknamed the frying pan because of its shape, though Rickenbacker liked to call it the pancake. The final design Beauchamp and Barth developed was an <b>electric</b> <b>pickup</b> consisting of a pair of horseshoe-shaped magnets that enclosed the pickup coil and completely surrounded the strings.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cars are}} powered by {{three-phase}} 575-volt alternating current rectified {{to drive a}} [...] direct current motor. <b>Electric</b> <b>pickups</b> are fixed {{on both sides of}} each car, which connect to electrified rails on one, or both, sides of the guideway. The vehicles' wheels steer slightly toward whichever side is powered, so the cars stay in firm electrical contact with the rails. Each car has four-wheel steering to help negotiate the tight turns in the PRT trackways, especially around stations.|$|R
50|$|Rock violin {{is played}} on solid body {{electric}} violins or on violins fitted with <b>electric</b> <b>pickups.</b> These are {{mounted on the}} bridge, on the sound post or stuck onto the body much as is done with acoustic guitar. Sizzling effects are achievable using aggressive bowing technique and runs high up the neck up {{to the limits of}} human hearing range. Due to the typical accompaniment of electric guitar, bass and rock drums, playing into the microphone may lead to impossibly high levels of feedback.|$|R
50|$|The P-90 is {{a single}} coil <b>electric</b> guitar <b>pickup</b> {{produced}} by Gibson since 1946. Gibson is still producing P-90s, and there are outside companies that manufacture replacement versions.|$|R

50|$|Various musicians {{have been}} {{suggested}} as the originators of tapping on the guitar. While {{one of the earliest}} players to use the technique was Roy Smeck (who used a tapping style on a ukulele in the 1932 film Club House Party, <b>electric</b> <b>pickup</b> designer Harry DeArmond developed a two-handed method as a way of demonstrating the sensitivity of his pickups. One of DeArmond's students, Jimmie Webster, made recordings in the 1950s using a two-handed tapping method he described in theinstructional book Touch Method for Electric and Amplified Spanish Guitar, published in 1952.|$|E
50|$|A lowebow is a {{variation}} of the cigar box guitar, created by John Lowe in the 1990s. It involves a cigar box with two wooden rods projecting from it. Each wooden rod typically holds one string: a bass string attached to one rod and a standard acoustic guitar string attached to the other. This allows the player to pluck a one-string bass and a one-string guitar at the same time. Each of the two strings has its own <b>electric</b> <b>pickup</b> that feeds into an amplifier. Some variations contain multiple strings on the treble neck, similar to standard cigar box guitars. The lowebow was created with the one-man band in mind.|$|E

[...] In addition to designing and producing extraordinary archtop, solid-body electric, and lap steel guitars, Jason is a noted authority on <b>electric</b> <b>pickups</b> and builder of hand-wound electro-magnetic pickups.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, Gibson {{released}} the L5CES, an L5 {{with a single}} cutaway body and two <b>electric</b> <b>pickups,</b> equally playable as either an acoustic guitar or an electric guitar. This innovation was immediately popular, and while purely acoustic archtop guitars such as the Gibson L-7C remain available to this day, they have become the exception. In 1958, the L5CES was redesigned with humbucking pickups; most, but certainly not all, subsequent archtop guitars conform loosely to the pattern set by this model. The electric archtop was particularly popular with jazz musicians Tal Farlow, Barney Kessel and Johnny Smith.|$|R
5000|$|Fully {{acoustic}} instruments {{with either}} a pressed laminate wood or hand carved top. One example in the latter category, almost cello-like in construction, is the Gibson L-5. For amplified use, these guitars are fitted with floating pickups in the neck position attached either {{to the base of}} the fingerboard or the edge of the pickguard. The finely tuned soundboard is left to vibrate freely as no hardware other than bridge posts come into contact with it. Today's carvedtops may also incorporate piezo <b>electric</b> <b>pickups.</b> These instruments have a full-size body and a powerful acoustic tone suitable both for chords and for melody work.|$|R
