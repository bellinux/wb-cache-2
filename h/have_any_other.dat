He claims that there are no black metal influences. He says that describing Celestiial's music as folk is a bad idea, as folk is such a broad, vague description as to make it meaningless. He says that what he is creating is neither folk, nor traditional, and even the harp songs are not traditional works, though they are influenced by the traditional music of the United Kingdom and traditional Irish music.|$|E

5|$|Duke {{regards the}} rivalry as far less {{significant}} than the Carolina–Duke rivalry. The Duke–Michigan rivalry {{is fueled by}} the fact that both institutions strive to be premier academic institutions with solid reputations for producing scholars and student athletes rather than just athletic powerhouses. Duke and Michigan have played one another in men's basketball 30 times. The teams have played twice in the same season three times: 1963–64, 1991–92, and 2008–09. Michigan has played Duke more times than they <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> school outside of the state of Michigan that has never {{been a member of the}} Big Ten Conference. In turn, Duke's 30 games against Michigan are the most they have played any other school outside of the Maryland-Virginia-North Carolina-South Carolina region that has never been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Eight of the meetings between Duke and Michigan have featured opponents both ranked in the top ten in the AP Poll; six times both teams were ranked in the top five. Michigan has not faced any of its fellow conference members as many times with both participants so highly ranked.|$|E
5|$|The two {{roots of}} any {{quadratic}} equation {{may be of}} three possible types: two different real numbers, two identical real numbers (i.e., a degenerate double root), or a pair of complex conjugate roots. The first case corresponds to the usual situation; each pair of roots corresponds {{to a pair of}} solutions that are related by circle inversion, as described below (Figure6). In the second case, both roots are identical, corresponding to a solution circle that transforms into itself under inversion. In this case, one of the given circles is itself a solution to the Apollonius problem, and the number of distinct solutions is reduced by one. The third case of complex conjugate radii does not correspond to a geometrically possible solution for Apollonius' problem, since a solution circle cannot have an imaginary radius; therefore, the number of solutions is reduced by two. Interestingly, Apollonius' problem cannot have seven solutions, although it may <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> number of solutions from zero to eight.|$|E

Breuning was in excellent health, walking unaided and refusing to use the elevator to reach his second floor apartment until he broke his hip. Breuning began to slow down physically in his last year, requiring first a walker and then a motor scooter to get around although his mental state was undiminished to the end.|$|E

25|$|After 1479–1480 much of Giovanni's {{time and}} energy must also have been taken up by his duties as {{conservator}} of the paintings in the great hall of the Doge's Palace. The importance of this commission can be measured by the payment Giovanni received: he was awarded, first the reversion of a broker's place in the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, and afterwards, as a substitute, a fixed annual pension of eighty ducats. Besides repairing and renewing the works of his predecessors he was commissioned to paint {{a number of new}} subjects, six or seven in all, in further illustration of the part played by Venice in the wars of Frederick Barbarossa and the pope. These works, executed with much interruption and delay, were the object of universal admiration while they lasted, but not a trace of them survived the fire of 1577; neither <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> examples of his historical and processional compositions come down, enabling us to compare his manner in such subjects with that of his brother Gentile.|$|E

500|$|During this period, Pierce {{worked as}} set {{decorator}} on films The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Cheap Detective (1978). The year after The Town That Dreaded Sundown, Piece directed and co-wrote Grayeagle, a Western {{based on a}} Cheyenne legend of a white man whose child (with an Indian wife) is kidnapped by a young warrior named Grayeagle. Pierce appeared in the film as Bugler, a half-insane white man who takes on a Shoshone identity. He then wrote and directed The Norseman (1978), which starred Lee Majors as a Viking prince who traveled to America to rescue his father from Indians. Working with a multimillion-dollar budget, Pierce shot the film in the Florida locations Hillsborough River State Park and New Port Richey. The next year he co-wrote and directed The Evictors (1979), another documentary-style horror film about a young couple who move into a rural Louisiana farmhouse and find their lives endangered {{by a series of}} strange events. Pierce was inspired to write the script after reading a true story in a detective magazine about a Kansas family who murdered somebody trying to evict them from the property. In order to match the late-evening sunlight in his cinematography at the farmhouse set, Pierce set up reflectors outside and deflected the sunlight through the windows, which were fitted with sheer white curtains to give the actors an eerie glow. The Evictors was little-seen and did not do financially well, which was a disappointment to distributor American International Pictures, but Pierce believed it one of his better films. He also considered it his most downbeat film, and said of the unhappy ending, [...] "I probably just didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way to end it." ...|$|E
500|$|Producers of Mad Men {{approached}} January Jones {{to portray}} Betty Draper, Don's {{wife and the}} mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. [...] "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there’s this other role, of the wife." [...] Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." [...] Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. [...] "It’s such a testament to his ability," [...] Jones stated. [...] "He just took something out of thin air, which makes me think now that he had to have had an idea that the wife was {{going to be part of}} the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When you sign a seven-year contract, you want to make sure you’re in the show." [...] Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. [...] "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> big shows—why would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past—let's go with the really good script this time.'" ...|$|E
