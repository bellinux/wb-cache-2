40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} {{study was conducted}} in a sixth-grade mathematics class located in a South Georgia middle school, where <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> were utilized for mathematics instruction. The study sought to answer three research questions: (a) What effect does the use of <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> have on student achievement? (b) What are student perceptions of using <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> for mathematics instruction? and (c) What are the experiences of a mathematics teacher when using <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> for instruction? Data were collected from attitude surveys, mathematics test scores and grades, teacher lesson plans, a teacher interview, and classroom observations. The results of the study show no change in student mathematics achievement as measured by course grades, even though students liked using the <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> and remained engaged while using them. The teacher’s experiences while using <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> for classroom instruction were mostly positive; however, some difficulties were encountered during the implementation of the intervention. Some positive teacher experiences included: an appropriate approach for integrating technology with the mathematics content, satisfaction from increased student involvement, and reduced disciplinary incidents. A few of the difficulties in using the <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> were the time required for training and the absence of readily available handheld activities to address content lesson plans...|$|R

25|$|Bill Gates {{claimed that}} the Apple II family with a Z-80 SoftCard was the single most-popular CP/M {{hardware}} platform. Many different brands of machines ran the operating system, some notable examples being the Altair 8800, the IMSAI 8080, the Osborne 1 and Kaypro luggables, and MSX computers. The best-selling CP/M-capable system of all time was probably the Amstrad PCW. In the UK, CP/M was also available on Research Machines educational computers (with the CP/M source code published as an educational resource), and for the BBC Micro when equipped with a Z80 co-processor. Furthermore, it was available for the Amstrad CPC series, the Commodore 128, TRS-80, and later models of the ZX Spectrum.

In particular, CADC with handheld comput-ers may improve data quality, reduce turnaround time, and enhance research capacity for community-academic partnerships. Here, we describe our experiences using <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> for the Healthy Environments Partnership’s Neighborhood Observational Checklist, an instrument for systematic observation of the social and physical environ-ments. We discuss hardware and software considerations, observer training and imple-mentation strategies, and observer attitudes toward using handhelds in the field.

Most healthcare centers are using some kind of electronic journals for their patient´s data today, but there are still a number of clinics that are usingthe old paper-system. On a few places in Sweden the use of <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> at the clinics has already started, but in the United States the use of <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> in the medical area is already widespread and from this we can see a lot of different situations where it is useful and effective to work with <b>handheld</b> <b>computers.</b> The security demands on patient´s journals are high and regulated in both Swedish law and regulations from the National Swedish Board of Health and Welfare. The law does not have any substantial demands, but states that there should be an adequate security level based on the nature of the information and the costs. The conclusions of this report is that this level of security can be achieved in <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> if additional software is installed and used in combination with the security features in the operating system. It is also necessary to have a good method for user identification that is adjusted to fit the situation in the clinic...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> {{have yet}} to take theirplace {{alongside}} the stethoscope and the reflex ham-mer as essential tools in the practising doctor’s ar-mamentarium, they are becoming increasingly popular in medical practice. According {{to a recent survey}} of 834 US physicians, about 26 % of physicians now use handhelds and an estimated 50 % will use the devices by 2005. 1 Physicians are using <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> in their practices today for a variety of routine tasks: from accessing medical textbooks and making medical calculations using laboratory test re-sults to tracking patient data and billing for patient encoun-ters. Recent data suggest that <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> may not only enable clinicians to practise more efficiently, 2 they may even reduce medical errors and improve patient out-comes.

40|$|Introduction <b>Handheld</b> <b>computers</b> such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and {{smartphones}} {{are playing}} an increasing role to improve healthcare services by making information {{available at the}} point of care. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate how medical interns and residents retrieve information when using handheld devices. Furthermore, This study investigates the benefits and barriers of using <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> in clinical activities, and factors affecting adoption <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> among medical interns and residents. Methodology We conducted this qualitative study, using a semi-structured interview protocol. We selected the subjects of the study, using the purposive snowball sampling method. We carried out in-depth interviews with 21 medical interns and residents from May through September 2011. NVivo Software was use to codify and analyze the data. Findings Participants usually used PDAs and smartphones for web search, personal information management and communication in daily activities. They also used <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> for searching medical databases and drug references, reading electronic books and web search. Participants believed that usefulness, ease of use, education, organizational factors, individual features, social influences, observability, compatibility and job characteristics were the main factors affecting the adoption of these devices in medical settings. It was found that the most important benefits of using <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> included easy access and instant delivery of health information, medical errors reduction, access to evidence based and up-to-date medical information, portability, improving clinical decision makings and treatment quality. Three limitation categories of usage were also identified upon data analysis: Limitations related to <b>handheld</b> <b>computers,</b> individual barriers, and external limitations. Conclusion Significant development and effective changes are taking place in the field of medicine by the emergence of <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> in clinical settings; but in developing countries like Iran it is in its childhood period and needs more attention. It is important to use supportive tools like mobile technologies in healthcare organizations for better patient care. Healthcare managers and policy makers can use findings of current study for a better integration of <b>handheld</b> <b>computers</b> in medical settings. They can apply encouraging factors in hospitals, medical centers and clinics to make mobile technologies as popular devices among healthcare professionals. ...|$|R
