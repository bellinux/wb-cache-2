40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we wish to}} extend the {{empirical}} content of the "credit-cost channel" of monetary policy that we proposed in Passamani and Tamborini (2005). In the first place, we replicate the econometric estimation of the model for Italy, to which we add Germany. We find confirmation that, in both countries, firms' reliance on bank loans (“credit channel”) makes aggregate supply sensitive to bank interest rates (“cost channel”), which are in turn driven by the <b>inter-bank</b> <b>rate</b> controlled by the central bank plus a credit risk premium charged by banks on firms. The second extension consists of a formal econometric analysis {{of the idea that}} the interest rate is an instrument of control for the central bank. The empirical results of the CCC model that, according to Johansen and Juselius (2003), innovations in the <b>inter-bank</b> <b>rate</b> qualify this variables as a "control variable" in the system. Hence we replicate the Johansen and Juselius technique of simulation of rule-based stabilization policy. This is done for both Italy and Germany, {{on the basis of the}} respective estimated CCC models, taking the inter-bak rate as the instrument and the inflation of 2 % as the target. As a result, we find confirmation that inflation-targeting by way of <b>inter-bank</b> <b>rate</b> control, grafted onto the estimated CCC model, would stabilize inflation through structural shifts of the "AS curve", that is, the path of realizations in the output-inflation space.

First, we document that liquidity holdings of the large settlement banks in the UK experienced on average a 30 % increase in the period immediately following 9 th August, 2007, the widely accepted date of money-market "freeze" during the sub-prime crisis. Second, we show that following this structural break, bank liquidity had a precautionary nature in that it rose on calendar days predicted to have a large amount of uctuations in payment and settlements activity and more so for banks that made larger losses during the crisis. Third, using the payment and settlements activity as an instrument, we establish a causal e ect of bank liquidity on overnight <b>inter-bank</b> <b>rates,</b> in both secured and unsecured markets, an e ect that is virtually absent in the period before the crisis. Importantly, precautionary hoardings by some settlement banks raised lending rates for all settlement banks, suggestive of a contagion-style systemic risk operating through <b>inter-bank</b> <b>rates.</b> Finally, variability in overnight <b>inter-bank</b> <b>rates</b> appears to have a ected rates and volumes in household as well as corporate lending. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{liquidity}} management under uncertainty predicts that, under certain conditions, commercial banks will accumulate {{minimum reserve requirements}} linearly over the reserve maintenance period.

The empirical analysis suggest that idiosyncratic liquidity uncertainty is much higher than aggregate liquidity uncertainty.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find out the impact of {{monetary}} policy on commercial bank lending rate with a view of implementation of the Kenya Bankers' Reference Rate (KBRR). The key components of the KBRR; The 91 day T-Bill rate and the Central Bank Rate were the main focus of this study along with the <b>inter-bank</b> lending <b>rate.</b> This paper used an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Model to estimate the short run and long run impact of the 91 day Tbill Rate, Central Bank <b>Rate</b> and <b>Inter-bank</b> Lending <b>Rate</b> on the average commercial bank lending rate. Time series data from the Central Bank of Kenya was used for the period July 1991 -May 2015.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effectiveness of monetary policy on economic growth and inflation in Nigeria over the period 1970 to 2011. The lag selection criteria all indicated an optimum lag length of one, therefore a VAR (1) model was estimated using GDP, INTR, CPI, and M 2 as endogenous variables. The model was dynamically stable and showed no evidence of serial correlation. Estimation results showed that {{in the short run}} it is output and inflation that drives monetary growth, while output growth is affected by inflation only. Results from the impulse response and variance decomposition showed that monetary policy variables may not have an instantaneous impact on output, but are key determinants of output growth in the long–run. Furthermore, in the short–run the level of production is more important in controlling inflation, but it is monetary policy variables that matter in the long–run. Therefore, there is the need to differentiate between short and long run monetary policy targets. It was recommended that, policy makers should concentrate on short-run output expansion policies and put measures in place to sustain growth in the long-run to control inflation. But to maintain long-run output expansion, monetary authorities should aim at adjusting the <b>inter-bank</b> <b>rate</b> but with caution as this can instead cause the problem it is meant to solve...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{empirical}} {{analysis of the}} "credit-cost channel" (CCC) of monetary policy transmission. This model combines bank credit supply, as a means whereby monetary policy affects economic activity ("credit channel"), and {{interest rates on loans}} as a cost to firms ("cost channel"). The thrust of the model is that the CCC makes both aggregate demand and aggregate supply dependent on monetary policy. As a consequence a) credit market conditions (e. g. risk spreads) are important sources and indicators of macroeconomic shocks, b) the real effects of monetary policy are larger and persistent. We have applied the Johansen-Juselius CVAR methodology to Italy and Germany in the "hard" EMS period and in the EMU period. The short-run and long-run effects of the CCC are detectable for both countries in both periods. We have also replicated the Johansen-Juselius technique for the simulation of rule-based stabilization policy for both Italy and Germany in the EMU period. As a result, we have found confirmation that inflationtargeting by way of <b>inter-bank</b> <b>rate</b> control, grafted onto the estimated CCC model, would stabilize inflation through structural shifts of the stochastic equilibrium paths of both inflation and output.

40|$|Excessive {{fluctuation}} {{of exchange}} rate has {{negative impact on}} domestic economy as uncertainty rises. High fluctuations of the exchange rates also make domestic prices, interest rates and other macroeconomic variables more volatile as well. If exchange-rate volatility is persistent, {{there should be a}} systematic and measured policy to mitigate the foreign exchange fluctuations and to minimize the fluctuations as well as to drive it to its fundamental value. This dissertation involves four main parts to be investigated. The first part measures the persistence of exchange rate volatility in Indonesia. Therefore, in this research, the appropriate tool is needed to measure how persistent the exchange rate fluctuation in Indonesia thus the central banks are able to perform appropriate monetary policy especially in determining their policy interest rate or implementing foreign exchange intervention to stabilize the exchange rate. To model the fluctuation/volatility of USD/IDR, TGARCH approach is implemented. The central bank‘s response with foreign-exchange intervention is also investigated within this model. The results reveal that, USD/IDR volatility in Indonesia is persistent. Meanwhile, foreign-exchange sale intervention by Bank Indonesia has positive impact on USD/IDR return which can be interpreted as, an increase in foreign-exchange sale intervention causes Indonesian Rupiah Return to increase. However, Bank Indonesia‘s efforts to exert a stabilizing effect of foreign exchange interventions, the results do not gain a success. In the second part, this study elaborates the behavior of exchange rate expectation in the perspective of foreign-exchange trader‘s rules (i. e. fundamentalist and chartist). To see the impact of foreign exchange intervention to exchange rate expectation by the heterogeneous market trader, regime switching model is used. Therefore, this dissertation contributes to the noise trading channel by allowing foreign exchange intervention to influence the exchange rate expectation both forecasting rules of chartists and fundamentalists. In fact, this dissertation supports both chartists and fundamentalist regimes. It is shown that the two regimes are persistent significantly. Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia‘s foreign-exchange intervention has been able to drive the USD/IDR to its long-run fundamental ‗UIP‘ value within fundamentalist rule. However, Bank Indonesia efforts to exert a stabilizing effect of foreign-exchange interventions, the result does not show a success as its conditional variance has been increased. This finding may be caused by several external factors such as global financial shocks which could not be controlled by Bank Indonesia or caused by speculative transactions,‗disorderly markets‘ i. e. high fluctuation that may halt the effectiveness of foreign-exchange intervention operations. In the third part, this dissertation investigates the monetary responses to exchange rate dynamics. The deviation of exchange rate from the fundamental ‗desired‘ value would push the central bank to adjust its policy interest rate. To investigate whether the policy rate has been adjusted in responding to the exchange rate dynamics, a Structural Vector Auto Regression (S-VAR) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approachs are applied. By implementing the methods in Indonesia, this dissertation finds that exchange rate dynamics of USD/IDR shock has ambiguous effect on policy interest rate reflected by overnight <b>inter-bank</b> <b>rate</b> fluctuations in the short run. Meanwhile, in the long run, the increase (decrease) of real USD/IDR exchange rate will push the central bank to raise (decrease) policy interest rate slightly (reflected by increased (decreased) domestic real o/n interbank interest rate) in order to halt further exchange-rate depreciation (appreciation) though it is not significant. In the final part, the governance aspect of foreign exchange interventions by Bank Indonesia will be elaborated. Several main issue regarding governance implementation in exchange rate intervention policy such as to whom or which authority that has powers to formulate objectives and to implement exchange-rate policy. Another important aspect concerns on how decision-making process on interventions applied at the operational level. In this part, information on governance arrangements guiding foreign exchange interventions, on Bank Indonesia related communications policies, and on the accountability of central banks for their intervention decisions, is provided. As USD/IDR exchange rate volatility is driven by various factors, relying solely on Bank Indonesia‘s FX intervention and interest rate policy to mitigate foreign-exchange volatility and misalignment, is not always sufficient. By combining with other policies called ‗policy mix‘ and implementing governance principles, the stability of the exchange-rate is hopefully achieved effectively. Furthermore, beyond of that the foreign-exchange intervention combined with other policies should also be consistent with achieving the inflation target and supporting sustainable domestic economic growth.

This paper documents these developments and, using a no-arbitrage model of the term structure, tests various explanations, including increased risk and greater liquidity demands, while controlling for expectations of future interest rates. We show that increased counterparty risk between banks contributed to the rise in spreads and find no empirical evidence that the TAF has reduced spreads.

Then, exploiting the fact that short-term nominal in-terest rates declined almost monotonically during the early 1990 s, tests of structural breaks constructed by Hansen [14] and Kuo [18] allow us to identify the rate of in-terest below which money demand is extremely interest-elastic. We find that money demand curves with such high interest-rate semi-elasticity have been observed since the Bank of Japan started to guide overnight call rates below 0. 5 % in 1995.

The rationality of forecasts varies across maturities and forecast horizons with short horizon and short maturity forecasts exhibiting more rationality.

LIBOR, EURIBOR, JIBAR, etc., that were once deemed to be default-free, or at least close proxies thereof, are now deemed to be credit risky. In response to this, global financial markets have adopted a credit and liquidity homogenous multi-curve interest rate framework. The risk-neutral {{valuation of financial instruments}} has also been fundamentally altered, following the acceptance of a new proxy for a default-free discounting curve - this being the Overnight Indexed Swap (OIS) curve. Major financial markets, like the U. S. and the Euro zone, have swiftly developed liquid OIS markets, and have therefore adopted OIS discounting. The lack of consensus on, and the inaccessibility of, a tradable overnight rate in South Africa has hindered the development of an OIS market. Nonetheless, there is still a need for a South African default-free discounting curve, as the prevalent South African defined <b>inter-bank</b> JIBAR <b>rates</b> also carry an element of credit risk.
