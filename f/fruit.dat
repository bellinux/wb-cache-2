5|$|<b>Fruit</b> eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe <b>fruit,</b> pulling it off the trees with their teeth. They fly back to their roosts to eat the <b>fruit,</b> sucking out the juice and {{spitting}} the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. This helps disperse the seeds of these <b>fruit</b> trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and numerous species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal.

5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian <b>fruit</b> {{is ready}} to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of <b>fruit</b> within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the <b>fruit</b> to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the <b>fruit</b> to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the <b>fruit</b> to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of time and under the {{appropriate}} environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. <b>Fruit</b> body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As <b>fruit</b> bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the <b>fruit</b> bodies are produced is long lasting, and will continue to produce successive generations of <b>fruit</b> bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.|$|E
