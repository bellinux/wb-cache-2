50|$|First, a photon is {{shot through}} a {{specialized}} nonlinear optical device: a beta barium borate (BBO) crystal. This crystal converts the single photon into two entangled photons of lower frequency, {{a process known}} as spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). These entangled photons follow separate paths. One photon goes directly to a detector, while the second photon passes through the double-slit mask to a second detector. Both detectors are connected to a coincidence circuit, ensuring that only entangled photon pairs are counted. A stepper motor moves the second detector to scan across the target area, producing an <b>intensity</b> <b>map.</b> This configuration yields the familiar interference pattern.|$|E
50|$|With {{multiple}} beacons per room trilateration {{can be used}} {{to estimate}} a users' position to within about 2 meters. Bluetooth beacons are capable of transmitting their Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value in addition to other data. This RSSI value is calibrated by the manufacturer of the beacon to be the signal strength of the beacon at a known distance, typically one meter. Using the known output signal strength of the beacon and the signal strength observed by the receiving device an approximation can be made about the distance between the beacon and the device. However this approximation is not very reliable, so for more accurate position tracking other methods are preferred. Since its release in 2010 many studies have been connected using Bluetooth beacons for tracking. A few methods have been tested to find the best way of combining the RSSI values together for tracking. Neural networks have been proposed as a good way of reducing the error in estimation. A Stigmerigic approach has also been tested, this method uses an <b>intensity</b> <b>map</b> to estimate a users location.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{electron}} microscopes that have been specifically designed for use in Auger spectroscopy; these are termed scanning Auger microscopes (SAM) and can produce high resolution, spatially resolved chemical images. SAM images are obtained by stepping a focused electron beam across a sample surface and measuring the intensity of the Auger peak above the background of scattered electrons. The <b>intensity</b> <b>map</b> is correlated to a gray scale on a monitor with whiter areas corresponding to higher element concentration. In addition, sputtering is sometimes used with Auger spectroscopy to perform depth profiling experiments. Sputtering removes thin outer layers of a surface so that AES can be used to determine the underlying composition. Depth profiles are shown as either Auger peak height vs. sputter time or atomic concentration vs. depth. Precise depth milling through sputtering has made profiling an invaluable technique for chemical analysis of nanostructured materials and thin films. AES is also used extensively as an evaluation tool on and off fab lines in the microelectronics industry, while the versatility and sensitivity of the Auger process makes it a standard analytical tool in research labs. Theoretically, Auger spectra can also be utilized to distinguish between protonation states. When a molecule is protonated or deprotonated, the geometry and electronic structure is changed, and AES spectra reflect this. In general, as a molecule becomes more protonated, the ionization potentials increase and the kinetic energy of the emitted outer shell electrons decreases.|$|E

40|$|High-frequency, {{high-resolution}} imaging of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) {{effect is}} an important technique to study the complex structures of the atmospheres of merging galaxy clusters. Such observations {{are sensitive to the}} details of the electron spectrum. We show that the morphology of the SZ <b>intensity</b> <b>maps</b> in simulated galaxy clusters observed at 345 GHz, 600 GHz, and 857 GHz are significantly different because of SZ relativistic corrections. These differences can be revealed by high-resolution imaging instruments. We calculate relativistically corrected SZ <b>intensity</b> <b>maps</b> of a simulated, massive, merging galaxy cluster and of the massive, merging clusters 1 E 0657 - 558 (the Bullet Cluster) and Abell 2219. The morphologies of the SZ <b>intensity</b> <b>maps</b> are remarkably different between 345 GHz and 857 GHz for each merging cluster.

In this study, the whole south India is divided into several grids of size 1 (o) x 1 (o) and the intensity at each grid point is calculated using the regional intensity model for the maximum earthquake magnitude at each of the eight zones. The intensity due to earthquakes at these zones is mapped and thus eight seismic intensity maps are prepared. The final seismic <b>intensity</b> <b>map</b> of south India is obtained by considering the maximum intensity at each grid point due to the estimated earthquakes.

The behavior of nonradiative recombination at TDs depends on the dislocation type: the screw type of TDs shows stronger effect on the nonradiative recombination activity than the edge type, evidencing a larger local reduction of PL emission intensity. Furthermore, the contrast of TDs in the μ-PL <b>intensity</b> <b>map</b> greatly depends on the carrier lifetimes of the 4 H-SiC epilayers.

40|$|In {{radiation}} therapy, intensity maps involving margins {{have long}} been used to counteract the effects of dose blurring arising from motion. More recently, intensity maps with increased intensity {{near the edge of}} the tumour (edge enhancements) have been studied to evaluate their ability to offset similar effects that affect tumour coverage. In this paper, we present a mathematical methodology to derive margin and edge-enhanced intensity maps that aim to provide tumour coverage while delivering minimum total dose. We show that if the tumour is at most about twice as large as the standard deviation of the blurring distribution, the optimal <b>intensity</b> <b>map</b> is a pure scaling increase of the static <b>intensity</b> <b>map</b> without any margins or edge enhancements. Otherwise, if the tumour size is roughly twice (or more) the standard deviation of motion, then margins and edge enhancements are preferred, and we present formulae to calculate the exact dimensions of these intensity maps. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to include scenarios where the parameters of the motion distribution are not known with certainty, but rather can take any value in some range.

40|$|Abstract Maximum seismic {{intensity}} maps for Japan {{are constructed using}} the recorded intensity data from 1498 to 2007 and are {{used to test the}} probabilistic seismic hazard map (PSHM) by the Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion, Japan. The historical intensity maps are compared with the hazard maps of probable max-imum {{seismic intensity}} for a 475 -yr return period, assuming a Poisson distribution (10 % in 50 yrs). We look at cases that include all events, only subduction zone earth-quakes, and all events excluding subduction zone earthquakes. The megathrust earth-quakes in the subduction zones produce large bands of high intensities along the Pacific coast side, while onshore crustal earthquakes create a patchy distribution of large intensities over all of Japan. The maximum recorded <b>intensity</b> <b>map</b> for the past 500 yrs and the maximum predicted <b>intensity</b> <b>map</b> for the ∼ 500 -yr return period from the PSHM are very similar for the cases including all events and the subduction zone earthquakes, while there is poor correlation for the third category that includes mostly onshore crustal earthquakes. If we consider only the amount of area, not the specific locations, the recorded <b>intensity</b> <b>map</b> and the PSHM (using the maximum case) have a high degree of correlation for Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) intensity higher than 4 for all of the cases. Statistically, the present hazard maps for Japan seem to agree with the past intensity distributions and can be regarded as appropriate hazard maps, even though there may be strong dependencies on uncertain model parameters for the PSHMs...|$|E

More significant measurements (≲ 10 σ) will be possible by combining <b>intensity</b> <b>maps</b> from the SKA with these of DESI or Euclid, and an even higher significance measurement (≲ 100 σ) may be made by combining observables completely internally to the SKA.
