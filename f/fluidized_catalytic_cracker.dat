In addition to standard attrition tests described in the literature, the possibility that thermal conditions could lead to catalyst fracture and fines production has been explored. Samples of fresh and used (equilibrium or e-cat) type catalysts were heated up to 600 àand mixed with cold samples to determine the impact of thermal shock on particle stability. It was found that significant fracture occurs under these conditions, leading to loss of larger catalyst particles in the bed and significant gain in the amount of fine particles. Agglomeration of particles was also evident, in some cases leading to an increase in the quantity of larger particles appearing to be present in the catalyst sample. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} {{for the resolution}} of the problem of input saturation in nonlinear multivariable process control by means of elementary nonlinear decoupling (END). Input saturation can have serious consequences particularly in multivariable control because it may lead to very undesirable system behaviour and quite often system instability. Many authors have searched for systematic techniques for designing multivariable control systems in which saturation may occur in any of the control variables (inputs, manipulated variables). No generally accepted method seems to have been presented so far which gives a solution in closed form. The method of elementary nonlinear decoupling (END) can be applied directly to the case of saturation control variables by deriving as many control strategies as there are combinations of saturating control variables. The method is demonstrated by the multivariable control of a simulated <b>Fluidized</b> <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Cracker</b> (FCC) with very convincing results...|$|E

The solution of the relevant equations is effected by an efficient finite-difference procedure. It is concluded that effects of gas-injection geometry on flow field and temperature distribution inside the reactor can be predicted realistically.

40|$|In {{this project}} work, we report Aspen-plus {{simulation}} of a cracking reaction viz. conversion of ethane to ethylene and hydrogen using plug flow reactor system. Ethane, which {{is produced in}} refineries isn’t stored under normal temperature and pressure and is often sold at a cost lower than its production cost. However, cracking of ethane produces two very important compounds viz. ethylene and hydrogen which has very wide range of applications. Generally, in industry, cracking {{takes place in a}} <b>fluidized</b> bed <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker.</b> In this work, the performance of plug flow reactor was studied to evaluate the process. Two contrastingly different routes were followed leading to the simulation. The first involved was the simulation of an adiabatic plug flow reactor at different operating conditions viz. feed flow rate, feed temperature, reactor temperature and pressure. The variation of diameter and length of the reactors were also studied in the overall performance of the system. Similarly, simulation studies were carried out for isothermal system as well. The performances of both the reactors were compared. It was observed that under a given set of conditions, isothermal plug flow reactor performed comparatively much better than its adiabatic counterpart...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of fines in a <b>fluidized</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> unit (FCCU) due to catalyst attrition and fracture {{is a major}} source of catalyst loss. In addition to the generation of fine particles, a significant amount of aerosols have been identified in the stack emission of FCCUs. To determine the source of these aerosols, samples of fresh and equilibrium (e-cat) type catalysts were heated up to 600 àand mixed with cold samples, simulating the thermal shock and particle fracture, which occurs inside an FCCU when catalyst is added. The thermal shock in the experiments produced fine particles and aerosols, which were captured on filters and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging and atomic absorption tests. It was found that significant quantities of metal rich aerosols were generated by the thermal shock. This production of fine particles and aerosols is a new phenomenon that can help explain excessive catalyst emissions from operating FCCUs. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|A {{fluidized}} bed model using several elutriation correlations {{was developed and}} tested against an operating {{fluidized bed}} used in a <b>Fluidized</b> <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Cracker</b> Unit (FCCU) and a 1 : 8. 5 scale laboratory system.

Although total emission rates were predicted with reasonable accuracy, the actual volatility and fluctuations seen in real fluidized beds emissions were not predicted. When the model was used to predict particle emission from the industrial FCCU, they preformed poorly, grossly overestimating the actual levels. It was determined that the attrition terms used in emission modeling were inappropriate and that the model preformed better without them, but still overestimated the actual emissions. This overestimation was greater in the industrial system compared with the smaller laboratory system. It was also found that the older elutriation terms were better for predicting industrial emissions compared with those of the smaller scale units. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fluidized</b> <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Cracker</b> Units (FCCU) {{are used}} in the oil {{refining}} industry to convert long chained hydrocarbons into shorter ones. At normal operations there is little concern regarding catalyst particle emission into the atmosphere from these devices. However, when the unit is started, higher than normal emission rates are common. FCCU stack emissions were tested and categorized in terms of metal composition and were compared with the operational conditions experienced under start up conditions. It was found that excessive emissions can be explained due to fluctuations in cyclone performance, the production of fine particles via attrition processes and the thermal fracture of particles. In addition to particle emissions, levels of emitted metals also fluctuate during the start up period, with the highest levels being experienced at the moment oil is re-fed into the unit. The current paper summarises stack testing results as well as the operational conditions in order to identify the key causes of start up emissions and provide recommendations to reduce and manage particle emissions from refineries.

40|$|Large-scale {{chemical}} process systems {{are characterized by}} highly nonlinear behavior and the coupling of physico-chemical phenomena occurring at disparate time scales. Examples include <b>fluidized</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>crackers,</b> distillation columns, biochemical reactors as well as {{chemical process}} networks {{in which the individual}} processes evolve in a fast time-scale and the network dynamics evolve in a slow time-scale. Traditionally, the design of advanced model-based control systems for chemical processes has followed the centralized paradigm in which one control system is used to compute the control actions of all manipulated inputs. While the centralized paradigm to model-based process control has been successful, when the number of the process state variables, manipulated inputs and measurements in a chemical plant becomes large - a common occurrence in modern plants -, the computational time needed for the solution of the centralized control problem may increase significantly and may impede the ability of centralized control systems (particularly when nonlinear constrained optimization-based control systems like model predictive control-MPC are used), to carry out real-time calculations within the limits set by process dynamics and operating conditions. One feasible alternative to overcome this problem is to utilize cooperative, distributed control architectures in which the manipulated inputs are computed by solving more than one control (optimization) problems in separate processors in a coordinated fashion. Motivated by the above considerations, this dissertation presents rigorous, yet practical, methods for the design of distributed model predictive control systems for nonlinear and two-time-scale process networks. Beginning with a review of results on the subject, {{the first part of this}} dissertation presents the design of two, sequential and iterative, distributed MPC architectures via Lyapunov-based control techniques for general nonlinear process systems. Key practical issues like the feedback of asynchronous and delayed measurements as well as the utilization of cost functions that explicitly account for economic considerations are explicitly addressed in the formulation and design of the controllers and of their communication strategy. In the second part of the dissertation, we focus on the design of model predictive control systems for nonlinear two-times-scale process networks within the framework of singular perturbations. Both centralized and distributed MPC designs are presented. Throughout the thesis, the applicability, effectiveness and computational efficiencyof the control methods are evaluated via simulations using numerous, large-scale chemical process networks...|$|R

They show high degrees of ef-ficiency, little pollution and the ability of combined heat and power generation, and moreover they are modularly built. As a fuel they need hydrogen, but the infrastructure of its supply is much worse than necessary. So, at least for a time of transition, hydrogen must be produced from hydrocarbon fuels.
