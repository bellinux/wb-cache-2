40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Inflammatory muscle disease (myositis) is characterised by inflammation and a gradual increase in muscle weakness. Diagnosis typically requires a range of clinical tests, including magnetic resonance imaging of the thigh muscles to assess the disease severity. In the past, this has been measured by manually {{counting the number of}} muscles affected. In this work, a computer-aided analysis of inflammatory muscle disease is presented to help doctors diagnose and monitor the disease. Methods to quantify the level of oedema and fat infiltration from magnetic resonance scans are proposed and the disease quantities determined are shown to have positive correlation against <b>expert</b> <b>medical</b> <b>opinion.</b> The methods have been designed and tested on a database of clinically acquired T 1 and STIR sequences, and are proven to be robust despite suboptimal image quality. General background information is first introduced, giving an overview of the medical, technical, and theoretical topics necessary to understand the problem domain. Next, a detailed introduction to the physics of magnetic resonance imaging is given. A review of important literature from similar and related domains is presented, with valuable insights that are utilised at a later stage. Scans are carefully pre-processed to bring all slices in to a common frame of reference and the methods to quantify the level of oedema and fat infiltration are defined and shown to have good positive correlation with <b>expert</b> <b>medical</b> <b>opinion.</b> A number of validation tests are performed with re-scanned subjects to indicate the level of repeatability. The disease quantities, together with statistical features from the T 1 -STIR joint histogram, are used for automatic classification of the disease severity. Automatic classification is shown to be successful on out of sample data for both the oedema and fat infiltration problems...|$|E

Biomechanical analysis, objectifications of permanent consequences after injury and objectification, whether such injuries influence life activities of an injured person, {{should be the}} basics for preparation of <b>expert</b> <b>medical</b> <b>opinion.</b> To make a necessary distinction from the previous injuries or illnesses that might have influence on current health state of a patient and its treatment, analysis of all medical records of a certain injured person is needed.

Thirteen typical data have been analysed and evaluated on the basis of objective evidences.

It has been noticed the most obvious deviation in biomechanical analysis (95 %), in records of decreased life activities (90 %), in all medical records of an injured person (65 %) and in objectification of permanent consequences after injuries (55 %). Conclusions: As results of analysis demonstrate, there are significant differences in preparations of expert and medical opinions in Slovenia, particularly when basic principles are analysed that need to be considered when writing such opinions. Irrational avoidance of basic principle of objectification, nomination of experts without licence in certain fields of medicine, avoidance of objectification of subjective statements of injured people and lack of experience or consequences of disrespect of basic principles in preparation of expert opinion all lead towards curtailment of those who pay the claims, especially in cases of banal injuries. Such opinions often mislead injured persons as well and also the ones who order such opinions and especially judges in court proceedings. In the whole European area anybody who prepares expert or medical opinion should respect basic principles of professional and expert literature.

40|$|Traditionally, in the United Kingdom and Europe, {{the surgeon}} was {{generally}} not troubled by litigation from patients presenting as elective as well as emergency cases, but this aspect of custom has changed. Litigation by patients now significantly affects surgical practice and vicarious liability often affects hospitals. We discuss some fundamental legal definitions, a must to know for a surgeon, and highlight some interesting cases. Review <b>Expert</b> <b>medical</b> <b>opinion</b> is essential in helping the courts to assess {{whether or not the}} surgeon has exercised a standard level of care under the circumstances. Depending on the testimony of those professionals, the court should decide if the defendant achieved that standard; in other words: negligent or not [1]. Of course the defendant surgeon standard of care will be compared to the standard of care in the same surgical discipline [2]. Civil law and clinical negligence The civil law of negligence is designed to provide compensation for one individual injured by another’s negligence. Negligence can be determined by a threefold test. Initially, a duty of care must be established, a breach to that duty has occurred and this has caused harm to that person [3]. In a surgical setting, it is automatically assumed that the examining or the operating surgeon has a duty of care; difficulty arises where a person has not been accepted as a patient. English law does not oblige anyone to be a Good Samaritan [4]. When that standard of care provided by that surgeon falls below the standard of a “responsible body of medical/surgical men ” and leads to harm to the patient, here the surgeon is found negligent [5]. The “custom test ” is usually applied to assess the surgeon’s standard of care. A surgeon is considered to have deviated from normal practice if it was proved that there is a usual and normal practice, this practice was not adopted by the surgeon and the surgeon adopted...|$|E

For a medical video, assessing quality in terms of "diagnostic" value rather than "perceptual" quality is more important. We present a diagnostic-quality-oriented video quality metric for quality evaluation of cardiac ultrasound videos. Cardiac ultrasound videos are characterized by rapid repetitive cardiac motions and distinct structural information characteristics that are explored by the proposed metric. Cardiac ultrasound video quality index, the proposed metric, is a full reference metric and uses the motion and edge information of the cardiac ultrasound video to evaluate the video quality.

40|$|ABSTRACT-As {{people have}} {{interests}} in their health recently, development of medical domain application {{has been one}} of the most active research areas. One example of medical domain application is detection system for heart disease based on computer-aided diagnosis methods, were the data are obtained from some other sources and are evaluated based on computer based applications. At the earlier time, the use of computer is to build knowledge based clinical decision support system which uses knowledge from <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> and transfers this knowledge into computer algorithms manually. This process is time consuming and really depends on <b>medical</b> <b>expert’s</b> <b>opinion</b> which may be subjective. To handle this problem, machine learning techniques have been developed to gain knowledge automatically from examples or raw data. Here, a weighted fuzzy rule-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) is presented for the diagnosis of heart disease, automatically obtaining the knowledge from the patient’s clinical data. The proposed clinical decision support system for risk prediction of heart patients consists of two phases, (1) automated approach for generation of weighted fuzzy rules, and (2) developing a fuzzy rule-based decision support system. In the first phase, we have used the mining technique, attribute selection and attribute weightage method to obtain the weighted fuzzy rules. Then, the fuzzy system is constructed in accordance with the weighted fuzzy rules and chosen attributes. Finally, the experimentation is carried out on the proposed system using the datasets obtained from the UCI repository and the performance of the system is compared with the neural network-based system utilizing accuracy, sensitivity and specificity...|$|R
