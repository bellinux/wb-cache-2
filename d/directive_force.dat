60|$|For {{some years}} now an {{intellectual}} reverie {{had been playing}} an increasing part in the good doctor's life. He was writing this book of his, writing it very deliberately and laboriously, THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A NEW AGE, but much more was he dreaming and thinking about this book. Its publication was to mark an epoch in human thought and human affairs generally, and create a considerable flutter of astonishment in the doctor's own little world. It was to bring home to people some various aspects of one very startling proposition: that human society had arrived at a phase when the complete restatement of its fundamental ideas had become urgently necessary, a phase when the slow, inadequate, partial adjustments to two centuries of changing conditions had to give place to a rapid reconstruction of new fundamental ideas. And it was a fact of great value in the drama of these secret dreams that the <b>directive</b> <b>force</b> towards this fundamentally reconstructed world should be the pen of an unassuming Harley Street physician, hitherto not suspected of any great excesses of enterprise.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the reign}} of Richard II, the Chamber had re-established its {{seniority}} within the Household, and the Wardrobe then 'ceased to be the <b>directive</b> <b>force</b> of the household, remaining simply as the office of household accounts'. Rather than being a separate department, the Wardrobe and its officers now came {{under the authority of}} the Steward, and before long, even within the Household, the Wardrobe began to lose its separate identity: by the late 14th century, its senior officers were more often than not referred to as the Treasurer of the Household, Controller of the Household and Cofferer of the Household (rather than as [...] "Treasurer/Controller/Cofferer of the Household Wardrobe"). Despite this gradual demise of the Wardrobe, these three officers remained (and two of them still remain) as senior officers of the Household who are also members of the Government. A vestige of the Wardrobe's former significance is seen in the 15th century, when in time of conflict the Treasurer of the Household was also frequently appointed 'Treasurer of Wars'.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, it {{is argued}} that the use of the imperatival infinitive (or, infinitivus pro imperativo) can be {{explained}} by means of the notion of procedure. The imperatival infinitive refers to the appropriate action that is to be carried out as part of a practical or conventional social procedure (script, frame) which is evoked in the discourse or by the extra-linguistic situation of the interlocutors. Unlike the imperative proper, the imperatival infinitive does not involve a direct appeal of the speaker to the hearer. As its <b>directive</b> <b>force</b> depends on the appropriateness of the action within a particular procedure, the imperatival infinitive {{can be seen as a}} more indirect type of directive expression. The functional differences between the imperative and the imperatival infinitive can be clarified by reference to the notions of finiteness and grounding. As imperatival infinitives are not finite, they do not invoke the ground (i. e. the speech event, its participants, and its immediate circumstances), but merely designate a type of action which is not epistemically located with respect to time or reality. Unlike the imperative, therefore, the <b>directive</b> <b>force</b> of the imperatival infinitive is not anchored in the ground, but, instead, it is pragmatically implicated by the procedure at hand. © 2010 Brill Academic Publishers...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an account of}} the cross-linguistic variation in the availabil-ity of negative imperatives. By imperatives, I refer to sentences with a distinctive imperative morphology on the main verb and/or a distinctive syntax. In many lan-guages (e. g., Italian, Modern Greek, and Spanish), imperatives cannot be negated. Instead, negative commands are expressed with negative subjunctives and/or in-finitivals. However, in German, French, English, Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian, imperatives can be negated. I argue that some languages rule out negative im-peratives because the syntax of the language derives a structure which maps onto an incoherent interpretive representation. The analysis I propose builds on the intuition that the <b>directive</b> <b>force</b> contributed by the imperative mood cannot be negated. The negative imperative Don’t call! means I require that you not call; it does not mean I do not require that you call. This judgment was already noted by Frege, consequently positing that illocutionary force operators cannot be negated. Pursuing this idea further, I propose that negative imperatives are unavailable in some languages because the syntax derives a structure in which the operator en-coding <b>directive</b> <b>force</b> arrives within the c-command domain of negation, where it is interpreted as being negated. As this is incoherent, the structure is ruled impos-sible. The proposed analysis has implications for the mapping between syntax and semantics of imperatives in particular. In general, it provides evidence that the set of available syntactic structures in a language is restricted by uniform mechanisms for semantic interpretation across languages. 1. I am grateful to Anthony Kroch for his encouragement and many valuable discussions on this topic. I have also benefited from comments at various stages from Robin Clark, Luis López...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a cross-linguistic {{investigation into}} the structure and interpretation of imperatives and related constructions. We identify universal morphosyntactic principles of imperatives and explain variations in the syntax of imperatives {{as a consequence of}} the interaction between the universal principles and the morphosyntactic system of a particular language. Based on these conclusions, we develop a model for the interpretation of imperatives. We show that the syntax of imperatives across languages includes an imperative operator, which is a set of morphosyntactic features. The interaction between a formal universal for the imperative operator and the syntax of a language correctly predicts the cross-linguistic variation in the availability of negative imperatives. We also account for the apparent peculiarity in the syntactic evolution of imperatives in the history of English. The results of our analysis confirm the postulated presence of an imperative operator and provide support for the presence of particular functional projections in the clausal phrase structure in English. We also propose that the morphosyntactic features of the imperative operator have interpretational consequences. We argue that the imperative operator includes a feature that encodes <b>directive</b> <b>force,</b> and another feature that encodes modality of unrealized interpretation. We also argue that subjunctives and infinitivals have an operator whose feature content is in a proper subset relation with that o...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that some {{psychological}} verbs, like 'frapper' ('strike') or 'méduser' ('astound') cannot be used in imperatives (cf. '??Méduse-moi!', '??Astound me!'). According to the traditional account, the problem {{is due to the fact}} that the entity denoted by the subject of the verbs at hand does not exhibit the agentive properties that the addressee of an imperative is supposed to have. However, it is not clear that the subject of all object Experiencer psych-verbs acceptable in imperatives (cf. 'Etonne-moi!', 'Surprise me!') is more agentive thant the one of problematic verbs. Besides, some stative verbs are acceptable in imperatives ('Sois belle!' 'Be beautiful!'), which casts further doubts on the idea that imperatives really diagnose agentivity. The author starts from the observation that verbs which are less acceptable in imperatives are superlative predicates: they express an event of a very high degree, and their adjectival participle is not compatible with 'très' (cf. '*très médusé', 'very astounded', versus 'très surpris', 'very surprised'). According to the analysis proposed, the problem of 'superlative imperatives' comes from the fact that superlative predicates have an expressive component which tends to be interpreted in the scope of the directive illocutionary operator. Therefore, ungrammaticality does not result from a lack of agentivity, but from a conflict between the expressive value of superlative imperatives and the illocutionary <b>directive</b> <b>force</b> of imperatives...|$|E

However, longer follow-up may possibly show a higher rate of degenerative arthritis of the knee and ankle joint. Theoretically, distraction for lengthening or segmental transport is directed in line with the mechanical axis. Application of a monolateral fixator may introduce, in addition to the distraction vector, a varus or valgus <b>directive</b> <b>force.</b> This especially applies when the monolateral fixator is not exactly parallel to the mechanical axis. Paley described the problem of axis deviation when using a ring fixator, due to imbalance between muscle forces on different sides of the bone. He found that osteotomies of the proximal femur tended to go into varus and procurvatum, whereas osteotomies of the distal femur tended to go into valgus and procurvatum. In comparison, osteotomies of the proximal tibia tended to go into valgus and procurvatum and the distal tibia into varus and procurvatum [2]. The distraction system used in this study did not allow for correction of mechanical axis deviation during distraction, but newer systems do offer this option. Recently, fixator-assisted lengthening over an intramedullary nail was described [10, 11]. Kocaoglu et al. [11] concluded that the duration of external fixation was reduced compared with that required for classic treatment and the patients’ comfort improved. In addition, the intramedullary nail prevented deformation of the regenerated bone. This technique of distraction osteogenesis may prevent mechanical axis deviation as well.|$|E
40|$|Marketing {{theory has}} {{traditionally}} sought explanation of commodity consumption based upon psychological and economic assumptions of needs, utility and exchange value, a paradigm of understanding that {{is becoming increasingly}} problematic. An alternative perspective of commodity consumption is presented, drawing on contemporary social and cultural theory where the commodity form constitutes a cultural and social logic; a discourse of communication which consumers use to mediate and participate in daily life. Instead of defining commodities in terms of use value and economic value, the commodity is seen {{in terms of a}} specific subject-object relation experienced in late capitalism, manifest as sign value and sign exchange. Taking the case of the museum, a context that it increasingly applying the terminology of the market, consumer and commodity; a qualitative research project is undertaken to asses the credibility of the cultural theoretical approach. It is proposed that the museum functions as a site of commodification, presenting history and culture as a set of commodities for visitors consumption. Whilst sign value is a useful concept in explaining commodity consumption, it is suggested a clear distinction between use value, exchange value and sign value is unworkable in practice and that utility and exchange value can be most accurately represented as cultural conditions rather than economic ones. The study suggests that consumption should be conceptualised as a constructive, active and productive process which involves the consumer in a continual exchange, use and manipulation of signs.

40|$|Academic course {{descriptions}} (ACDs) are {{an institutional}} genre with an orientational-regulatory goal: presenting information and imposing requirements. The analysis of 100 ACDs from 10 disciplines (40, 000 words) {{reveals that the}} orientational goal of the ACDs is achieved through {{the outline of the}} topics, methods and disciplinary backgrounds of courses, while the regulatory one through reference to their logistics/requirements and goals/outcomes. Courses are authoritatively represented as non-negotiable arrangements through the recurrent use of the simple present and will future. However, the implicit <b>directive</b> <b>force</b> of these tense choices is downtoned by the frequent representation of courses as external agents responsible for choices about educational contents and aims, while teachers are seldom mentioned and hardly ever depicted as potentially confrontational addressers. The imposition of requirements follows the same encoding pattern as above in the 63 ACDs consisting of one paragraph, and in the main sections of the longer ones (called Description or Aims), but is characterized by a more marked presence of, especially deontic, modality (e. g. may, should), and a more frequent reference to students as addressees (i. e. you’s) in the other sections of the longer ACDs (e. g. Assignments, Grading). Overall, the texts are oriented toward communicative effectiveness, that is, the provision of accurate directions, which prevent misunderstandings and raise the right expectations in the supposedly self-motivated readership. However, in (the sections of) the ACDs with a strong referential function, this authoritative confidence is softened by the negative politeness strategy of indirectness (i. e. avoiding representing teachers and students as direct interlocutors, the former deciding things for the latter). Instead, in the sections with a strong conative function (e. g. Policies, Requirements) precision and thoroughness take priority over concerns for the negative face of the addressees – aware of having to meet requirements – and this leads to a clear indication of roles, rules and expectations. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} the formal oral Indonesian register ‘Bahasa Indonesia ragam lisan formal’ (hereinafter {{referred to as}} BIRLF) used in open examinations from syntactical-pragmatic perspective. In general, this study aims at analyzing the grammatical-pragmatic elements of the formal oral register used in open examinations; in particular, it aims at analyzing the forms of speech acts and the forms of politeness used in the open examinations held at the University of Airlangga ‘Universitas Airlangga’ (Unair) and the State University of Surabaya ‘Universitas Negeri Surabaya’ (Unesa). The theories used were the structural theory and the theory of pragmatics. The structural theory was {{used to analyze the}} grammatical structures of the sentences used in the dialogues taking place in the open examinations. The theory of pragmatics used in this study refers to the theory of politeness proposed by Lakoff (1972), Leech (1983), Brown and Levinson (1987), and the theory of speech act developed by Austin (1962) and Searle (1975). The data analysis showed that, based on the direction of extension in which the verb was the center, and the extending components, eleven types of imperative sentences were found. The extension took place to the left, to the right and to the left and to the right from the verb simultaneously. The extending components included words, phrases, clauses and combinations of phrases and clauses. The interrogative sentences used were both the close interrogative sentences and the open interrogative ones. The declarative sentences used were the complex coordinative and subordinative ones. Deletion, pronominalization,, and repetition characterized the two types of sentences. To identify politeness, the layers of the components constructing the sentences were analyzed. The imperative politeness was expressed grammatically and lexically. Grammatically, the grammatical politeness was shown by passivizing the verb, shifting moods, and changing sequences.
