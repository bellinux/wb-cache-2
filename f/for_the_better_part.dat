Trajan's successor Hadrian granted Napoca the status of municipium as municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napocenses. Later, in the 2nd century AD, the city gained the status of a colonia as Colonia Aurelia Napoca. Napoca became a provincial capital of Dacia Porolissensis and thus the seat of a procurator.

5|$|As {{one of the}} company's major offerings, {{the chicken}} fries are {{sometimes}} the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the nu metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on a new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups.

40|$|This thesis {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the field of positioning technology. The contents of the thesis is based on information gathered from articles, the internet, meetings and interviews as well as experiences learned as a project participant. The goal of the thesis is to investigate what trends exist in the application of positioning technology today. Several technologies are described, both for indoor and outdoor use. In describing technologies used for outdoor positioning it will be made clear that GPS and RFID are two of the most significant technologies. As <b>for</b> indoor use, <b>the</b> wireless network technologies WLAN and Bluetooth as well as ultrasound based technologies will stand out as the most central. Specific system descriptions will also be given. The various technologies and systems have a vast number of potential combined applications. The thesis describes a selection of these applications. Some of the examples given are established applications that are widely used, while other examples are for new applications and even some that are still in development. The thesis gives an indication of {{the focal point of the}} technologies and applications. This will show that outdoor applications are dominant and that GPS and RFID are the two technologies given the most attention. This thesis was originally part of a project at the telecom and computer department at SINTEF in Oslo. The project aimed to investigate posibilities and shortcomings of using ultrasound <b>for</b> indoor positioning. <b>The</b> project, called "Maurtua", carried on <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>parts</b> of six months before being closed down for financial reasons. This project is described in a separate chapter of the thesis. This chapter shows the great potential of using ultrasound for indoor positioning, but also comes to the realization that the use of these systems are marginal at best. Large expenses in contrast to the believed benefits is shown to be one of <b>the</b> main reasons <b>for</b> this. <b>The</b> use of positioning technology oftes raises questions concerning rights to privacy. The thesis explains the central parts of the legislation, namely "Personopplysningsloven" and the department, "Datatilsynet" which regulates the use of positioning technology in Norway...|$|R

As the French historian Marcel Launey has shown, the title is applied to Patroclus only once in ancient sources, by the 2nd-century geographer Pausanias; all contemporary or later literary and epigraphical sources refer to him as strategos (general), which must have been his actual title. Indeed, according to the German classicist Hans Hauben, his Macedonian origin seems to argue for a previous career in the army {{rather than in the}} navy. The actual extent of Patroclus' authority is a matter of dispute in current scholarship, {{but it is clear that}} he enjoyed broad powers over the other Ptolemaic commanders and their allies in the Aegean Sea.|$|R

It was pleasant in the summer forenoons--when the fervent heat, that almost liquefied the rest of the human family, merely communicated a genial warmth to their half torpid systems--it was pleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry, a row of them all tipped against the wall, as usual; while the frozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out, and came bubbling with laughter from their lips. Externally, the jollity of aged men has much in common with the mirth of children; the intellect, any more than a deep sense of humour, {{has little to do with}} the matter; it is, with both, a gleam that plays upon the surface, and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the green branch and grey, mouldering trunk.

40|$|There are {{few things}} that are purely American. On that short list are {{baseball}} and the two-year community college. Bill Jason Priest possessed skill and acumen <b>for</b> both. <b>The</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of his life was spent developing and defining the junior college into the comprehensive community college. His contributions earned him a prestigious place {{in the annals of}} higher education, but his personality was not one of a stereotypical stodgy educator, nor is the story of his life a dry read. After working his way through college, Priest played professional baseball before serving in Naval Intelligence during World War II. His varied experiences helped shape his leadership style, often labeled as autocratic and sometimes truculent in conservative convictions. The same relentless drive that brought him criticism also brought him success and praise. Forthright honesty and risk-taking determination combined with vision brought about many positive results. Priest’s career in higher education began with the two-year college system in California before he was lured to Texas in 1965 to head the Dallas County Junior College District. Over the next fifteen years Priest transformed the junior college program into the Dallas County Community College District (DCCCD) and built it up to seven colleges. He performed major roles in the evolution of nursing education, the founding of a telecommunications center <b>for</b> <b>the</b> production of televised courses, the delivery and acceptance of vocational education, and in greater breadth in noncredit courses. After his retirement in 1981, he continued to serve as Chancellor Emeritus until 2003. Drawing from archives as well as from numerous interviews with Priest and his personal and professional associates, Kathleen Krebbs Whitson presents the life of a giant in Texas education and reveals his lasting influence upon the community college movement...|$|R
