5|$|Dunstan's first Premiership was eventful, with {{a steady}} stream of reform and {{attempts}} to end the depression. The latter half of 1967 saw the beginnings of a slight recovery, with unemployment dipping and industrial capacity steadying. The 1967–68 budget ran into deficit, allocating funds to energise the economic engine whilst Dunstan lambasted the <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> <b>for</b> neglecting the South Australian economy, demanding it take a degree of responsibility for its ills.|$|E

In March 1933, he offered the lowest bid of $3,745 for a contract that supplied certificates of land title in Kanawha and Fayette counties within the Huntington federal engineering district. The lands within the federal engineering district were to be utilized by the <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> river work.|$|E

5|$|The {{volcanic}} risk {{is somewhat}} mitigated by lahar warning sirens and escape route signs in Pierce County. The more populous King County {{is also in}} the lahar area, but currently has no zoning restrictions due to volcanic hazard. More recently (since 2001) funding from the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> lahar protection in the area has dried up, leading local authorities in at-risk cities like Orting to fear a disaster similar to the Armero tragedy.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, food and clothing was brought to towns isolated by the storm. In Culiacán, churches, schools, and a baseball stadium served as temporary shelters for displaced persons. Rescue workers also searched for bodies of victims of both Lidia and the subsequent Hurricane Norma, which hit the same area a few days later. Due to the damage wrought by both Lidia and Norma, the Governor of Sinaloa, Antonio Toledo Corro, declared his state a disaster area. He also asked the Mexican <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> <b>for</b> aid.|$|E

Savimbi paid Black, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly, a lobbying firm based in Washington, D.C., $5million to lobby the <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> aid, portray UNITA favorably in Western media, and acquire support among politicians in Washington. Savimbi was highly successful in this endeavour.|$|E
5|$|Many American {{newspapers}} criticized Missouri for the Haun's Mill massacre and the state's {{expulsion of}} the Latter Day Saints. Illinois accepted Mormon refugees who gathered {{along the banks}} of the Mississippi River, where Smith purchased high-priced, swampy woodland in the hamlet of Commerce. Smith also attempted to portray the Latter Day Saints as an oppressed minority, and unsuccessfully petitioned the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> help in obtaining reparations. During the summer of 1839, while Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo suffered from a malaria epidemic, Smith sent Brigham Young and other apostles to missions in Europe, where they made numerous converts, many of them poor factory workers.|$|E
5|$|The Manitoba Schools Question {{showed the}} deep {{divergence}} of cultural {{values in the}} territory. The Catholic Franco-Manitobans had been guaranteed a state-supported separate school system in the original constitution of Manitoba, but a grassroots political movement among English Protestants from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools. In 1890, the Manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for French Catholic schools. The French Catholic minority asked the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> support; however, the Orange Order and other anti-Catholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them.|$|E

5|$|The {{consequences}} of continued control of Alberta's resources {{by the federal}} government extended beyond the merely financial. As Alberta's smaller towns and rural areas were being connected to the electrical grid, Calgary Power made an application to the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> hydroelectric rights on the upper Bow River. Not wanting these rights to fall into private hands, Brownlee made an application of his own on behalf of the Alberta government. It was denied by Charles Stewart, federal Minister of the Interior and the Premier of Alberta whom the UFA had defeated in 1921.|$|E
5|$|The march {{originally}} was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition {{of blacks in}} the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to denounce the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. However, the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.|$|E
5|$|These roads proved {{inadequate}} {{to the needs}} of the military during the War of 1812. Territorial Governor Lewis Cass lobbied the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> road construction funding to bolster defensive needs as well as aid in settlement of the territory. Military roads debuted in 1816 with the construction of the Detroit–Fort Meigs Road to Toledo as a response to transportation needs. More roads were built with Congressional appropriations in the 1820s and 1830s connecting Detroit to Port Huron, Saginaw, Grand Rapids and Chicago.|$|E

5|$|An example {{may be a}} {{local school}} system in the United States. It {{receives}} {{a grant from the}} its local state government to support a new special education initiative, another grant from the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> a school lunch program, and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report to a federal agency about the school lunch program, and a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, each with its own chart of accounts.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s Indiana's Republican party, whose adherents {{tended to}} favor the temperance movement, began {{challenging}} the state's Democrats, who supported personal freedom and a limited <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> <b>for</b> political power. Early temperance legislation in Indiana earned only limited and temporary success. In 1853 Republicans persuaded the state legislature to pass a local option law that would allow township voters to declare their township dry, but it was later deemed unconstitutional. In 1855 a statewide prohibition law was passed, but it met the same fate as the local option. In the decades to come Protestant churches, especially the Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Disciples of Christ, Quakers, and women's groups would continue to support temperance efforts and gave strong support to the mostly dry Republican Party. The Catholics, Episcopalians and Lutherans stood opposed and gave strong support to the wet Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, {{construction}} {{began on}} a new concrete and brick-faced building to house the library. Completed in 1938, the building housed a collection that grew to 35,000 volumes in 1940. Now known as Smullin Hall, the library building was designed by architect Pietro Belluschi in the Georgian style of architecture. In 1965, the school received a $450,000 loan from the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> the library. Congressman Al Ullman worked to secure status as a Federal Depository Library in the late 1960s, with status conferred in 1969. In 1980, Willamette began a multi-year fund raising campaign intended to raise funds to renovate academic halls and build a new library, with $18 million total raised during the funding drive. At the time the library held a collection of 143,000 volumes.|$|E

5|$|In 1978 Robert Randall {{sued the}} <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> arresting him for using {{cannabis}} to treat his glaucoma. The judge ruled Randall needed cannabis for medical purposes and required the Food and Drug Administration {{set up a}} program to grow cannabis on a farm at the University of Mississippi and to distribute 300 cannabis cigarettes a month to Randall. In 1992 George H. W. Bush discontinued the program after Randall tried to make HIV/AIDS patients eligible for the program. Thirteen people were already enrolled and were allowed to continue receiving cannabis cigarettes; today the government still ships cannabis cigarettes to four people. Irvin Rosenfeld, who became eligible to receive cannabis from the program in 1982 to treat rare bone tumors, urged the George W. Bush administration to reopen the program; however, he was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the flooding in St. John's, Newfoundland, the city mayor activated the city's Emergency Preparedness Program. On September 27, {{about a week after}} the passage of the storm, the Emergency Measures Organization began accepting applications for flood-related damage. By about a month after the storm, 169 applications were processed, with an additional 1,762 received by the Emergency Measures Organization. Eligibility for the disaster assistance included restoration to property or household items of an essential nature. A few days after the passage of the storm, the government of Newfoundland appealed to the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> federal disaster relief fund; the government later approved. Ultimately, disaster relief assistance totaled $6.3million (2001 CAD), primarily to individual assistance.|$|E
5|$|Many of the government-operated {{residential}} {{schools were}} run by churches of various denominations, {{with the majority}} administered by Roman Catholics. Between 1867 and 1939, the number of schools operating at one time peaked at 80 schools in 1931. Of those schools, 44 were operated by Roman Catholics; 21 were operated by the Church of England / Anglican Church of Canada; 13 were operated by the United Church of Canada, and 2 were operated by Presbyterians. The approach of using established school facilities set up by missionaries was employed by the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>for</b> economic expedience: the government provided facilities and maintenance, while the churches provided teachers and their own lesson-planning. As a result, the number of schools per denomination was less a reflection of {{their presence in the}} general population, but rather their legacy of missionary work.|$|E
