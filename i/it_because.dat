The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46–53 vote. Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives. The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.|$|E
5|$|Brooker {{originally}} {{wrote the}} episode in an apocalyptic setting, {{but when the}} script {{was about to be}} filmed at a former U.S. Air Force base, he changed <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of a fence he saw there. He rewrote the story in two days, removing some details he considered useful for a sequel story. The main change was the addition of a plot twist {{at the end of the}} script, which was noted as the most impressive aspect of the episode by several reviewers.|$|E

5|$|Corrective rape is on {{the rise}} in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit. It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in fear of being sexually assaulted, as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of corrective rape are less likely to report <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E
