40|$|A {{low-temperature}} {{study of}} the mechanical behaviour of a metastable semi-austenitic stainless steel was carried out. This class of stainless steels is found to show a characteristic hump followed by softening in their stress–strain curves, especially at low temperatures, much like dynamically recrystallizing steels. Experiments are carried out at sub-zero temperatures to examine this phenomenon. Samples are subjected to various metallographic, X-ray and transmission electron microscopy techniques to identify {{the evolution of the}} different phases. The presence of an intermediate phase <b>e-martensite</b> is detected which might cause a softening in the stress–strain behaviour, comparable with the formation in other low stacking fault energy stainless steels.

40|$|In-situ neutron {{diffraction}} during cyclic tension-compression loading (þ 3. 5 % to 2. 8 %) of a 17 Mn- 3 Al- 2 Si- 1 Ni- 0. 06 C steel that exhibits concurrent transformation and twinning -induced plasticity effects {{indicated a significant}} contribution of intragranular back stresses to the observed Bauschinger effect. Rietveld analysis revealed {{a higher rate of}} martensitic transformation during tension compared to compression. Throughout cycling, a 0 -martensite exhibited the highest phase strains such that it bears an increasing portion of the macroscopic load as its weight fraction evolves. On the other hand, the <b>e-martensite</b> strain remained compressive as it accommodated most of the internal strains caused by the shape misfit associated with the c!e and/or e!a 0 transformations...|$|E
40|$|Stacking fault {{energy of}} high {{manganese}} alloys (marked as TWIP and TRIPLEX) {{is an important}} parameter determining deformation mechanism type realized in above mentioned alloys. Stacking fault energy level can be asserted with a) gliding of partial and/or full dislocations, b) gliding mechanism and twinning deformation process in connection with increasing of fracture deformation level (deformation elongation) and with increasing of simultaneously realized work hardening proces., c) gliding mechanism and deformation induced <b>e-martensite</b> formation. In contribution calculated stacking fault energies are presented for various chemical compositions of high manganese alloys. Stacking fault energy dependences on manganese, carbon, iron and alluminium contents are presented. Results are confronted with some accessible papers. The aim of work is to deepen knowledge of presented data. The TWIP and TRIPLEX alloys can be held for promissing new automotive materials...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{techniques}} {{were used to}} study the deformation mechanisms induced by fatigue tests in a metastable austenitic stainless steel AISI 301 LN. Observations by Atomic Force Microscopy were carried out to study {{the evolution of a}} pre-existing martensite platelet at increasing number of cycles. The sub-superficial deformation mechanisms of the austenitic grains were studied considering the cross-section microstructure obtained by Focused Ion Beam and analysed by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy. The results revealed no deformation surrounding the pre-existing martensitic platelet during fatigue tests, only the growth on height was observed. Martensite formation was associated with shear bands on austenite, mainly in the { 111 } plane, and with the activation of the other intersecting austenite { 111 } slip system. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy results showed that the nucleation of <b>e-martensite</b> follows a two stages phase transformation (¿fcc¿ehcp¿a'bcc).
