5|$|Karnan {{was filmed}} with an {{estimated}} budget of 4 million (valued at about US$840 000.84 in 1964).

Permission from the government was sought, cavalry and infantry <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> Army {{were brought to the}} locations at Kurukshetra and the first rows of the charging armies on horses and elephants had soldiers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> Army.

5|$|After the Coast Guard Act 1978 {{came into}} force on 19 August 1978, the first Director General was {{appointed}} {{on the same}} day. Vice Admiral V. A. Kamath, deputed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> Navy, served as the first DG ICG. Appointed on 19 August 1978, {{he served in the}} capacity until 31 March 1980. Traditionally, appointees to the DG position have come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> Navy, although the current office holder, Rajendra Singh, is a direct entry Coast Guard officer. While several previous Directors General have come from the Coast Guard stream – such as Rameshwar Singh and P. Paleri – they have all initially been commissioned into the Indian Navy before later being permanently deputed to the Coast Guard service. As such, Singh has the distinction of being the first regular direct entry officer of the Indian Coast Guard to be promoted to the position of ADG and to achieve three-star rank, doing so on 11 January 2013. He was later appointed as the DG, taking over this position in early 2016. Singh succeeded Vice Admiral H. C. S. Bisht on 1 March 2016. Besides the distinction of being the first three-star rank officer of the Indian Coast Guard, Rajendra Singh is the first Coast Guard officer to become the Director General.|$|E
