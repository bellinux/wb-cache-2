25|$|Porter's 1985 {{description}} of the value chain refers to the chain of activities (processes or collections of processes) that an organization performs in order to deliver a valuable product or service for the market. These include functions such as <b>inbound</b> <b>logistics,</b> operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and service, supported by systems and technology infrastructure. By aligning the various activities in its value chain with the organization's strategy in a coherent way, a firm can achieve a competitive advantage. Porter also wrote that strategy is an internally consistent configuration of activities that differentiates a firm from its rivals. A robust competitive position cumulates from many activities which should fit coherently together.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} decision problem during the layout {{phase of a}} cross dock {{is related to the}} arrangement of inbound and outbound operations within a terminal. Either one side of the terminal is exclusively dedicated to inbound and the other to outbound destinations (vis-à-vis policy) or inbound and outbound destinations can facultatively be assigned all around the terminal (mix policy). The latter policy promises more flexibility, when finally assigning dock doors to truck destinations during operational planning, but comes for the price of ambiguous material flows and potential congestions inside the terminal. Both policies are compared with regard to their impact on operational planning, where deterministic, stochastic and unknown inbound loads are differentiated. Our results show the mix policy being superior in most cases except for unknown <b>inbound</b> loads. <b>logistics,</b> cross docking, door-layout...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground;Despite of the {{significant}} role of packaging within logistics and supply chain management, packaging is infrequently studied as focal point in supply chain. Most of the previous logistics research studies tend to explain the integration between packaging and logistics through logistical packaging. In very rare cases, the studies mentioned about customer value. Therefore the major disadvantage of these studies is that, they didn’t consider logistical packaging and customer value delivery as related matters. As a result customers incur significant cost in repairing damages incurred during <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>logistics</b> operations because of poor packaging. Purpose;To explore how packaging solution manufacturers accounts for packaging requirements and delivers customer value through logistical packaging {{in order to enhance}} the efficiency in the customer’s <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>logistics</b> operations. Method;Through a qualitative research method combined with abductive research approach, a case study at Stora Enso packaging was conducted. Logistical packaging concept and customer value equation model has been introduced in this thesis. Then, data were collected and analyzed in the context of how does Stora Enso derives packaging requirements from customers so that it deliver customer values which ultimately enhance customers’ inbound and outbound logistic operations. Conclusion;The results after the analysis showed that, the packaging solution really affects performance of different activities in a logistics chain. Moreover, it showed how Stora Enso takes into consideration logistics requirements from customers and deliver value to these customers through logistical packaging. By delivering customer values such as light, strong and durable, flexible and cost efficient, having many fields of use, and completely renewable, a Stora Enso packaging solution enhance customer’s <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>logistics</b> operations by ensuring efficient transportation, maximum product protection, smooth handling, optimal warehouse space usage and less waste to the environment during disposal. In this way, Stora Enso delivers value to its customers by manufacturing a packaging solution that is tailored to their logistics chain requirements...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Today's {{globalized world}} and cutthrought {{competition}} distribution costs {{play an important}} part in entire logistic network. From <b>inbound</b> to outbound <b>logistics,</b> everywhere focus seems to be on minimizing the distribution cost of goods. Highlighting the cost minimization issue, routing of the logistic activities is very important. In other words a reconfigurable logistic system can help reducing the cost to a significant level in a supply chain. In this paper,we have addressed the important issue of the consolidation and quantity allocation where optimal combination of the goods of diverse nature is achieved. This optimal combination is dependent on variables such as weight and volume of the products and capacity of the trucks. The trucks are distinguishable {{on the basis of their}} carrying capacities and have distinct hiring costs associated, i. e. different types of vehicle incur distinct fixed cost for each trip from the warehouse to retailer. It is assumed that retailer has a deterministic demand pattern over a finite planning horizon. Finally, the case is validated through a fast moving consumer good's company where anheuristic approach is used for the optimization. The heuristic provide feasible and effective solution for the mentioned multi-variable problem...|$|R
40|$|Greening {{the supply}} chain is {{increasingly}} a concern for many business enterprises and a challenge for logistics management in the 21 st century. Of particular concern is how to arouse organizational environmental awareness and put environmental activities into practice in the logistics activities of their supply chains. This paper investigates the correlation of two major factors, organizational learning and management support, with the extent of adoption of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices in Chinese manufacturing firms, where their <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>logistics</b> activities are potential polluters to the environment. Organizational and operational learning {{was derived from the}} firm's experience with programs such as total quality management and environmental management systems.

40|$|In {{the present}} day {{business}} scenario, instant changes in market demand, different source of materials and manufacturing technologies force many companies to change their supply chain planning in order to tackle the real-world uncertainty. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to develop a multi-objective two-stage stochastic programming supply chain model that incorporates imprecise production rate and supplier capacity under scenario dependent fuzzy random demand associated with new product supply chains. The objectives are to maximise the supply chain profit, achieve desired service level and minimise financial risk. The proposed model allows simultaneous determination of optimum supply chain design, procurement and production quantities across the different plants, and trade-offs between inventory and transportation modes for both <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>logistics.</b> Analogous to chance constraints, we have used the possibility measure to quantify the demand uncertainties and the model is solved using fuzzy linear programming approach. An illustration is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Sensitivity analysis is performed for maximisation of the supply chain profit with respect to different confidence level of service, risk and possibility measure. It is found that when one considers the service level and risk as robustness measure the variability in profit reduces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an empirical research program devoted to investigate how complexity can affect a manufacturing company???s performances, and those of its supply chain. In-depth industry case studies involving 14 Italian companies at different stages in the household appliances industry are here presented: more than 200 numerical data and 50 descriptive questions were asked to eight different key managers within each company, focusing on sales, <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>logistics,</b> product and process engineering, production and organisational issues. Empirical evidence confirms that the way companies handle their operations system complexity has a deep effect on how well they perform. Relying on these first evidences, a research refinement is proposed by means of a careful classification of complexity sources on one side and of complexity control levers on the other. Then, a first interpretative and theory building attempt is done to set relationships among the operating context, the adopted managerial levers and the operating performances achieved. The model suggests that the ability to control complexity within manufacturing and logistic systems can be regarded as a core competence in order to jointly improve efficiency and effectiveness at a supply chain wide scale...|$|R
