Steel and aluminium can be joined by laser <b>braze</b> <b>welding.</b> As in other types of thermal joining, inter-metallic phases may weaken the joint.

50|$|<b>Braze</b> <b>welding</b> {{has many}} {{advantages}} over fusion welding. It allows the joining of dissimilar metals, minimization of heat distortion, and {{can reduce the}} need for extensive pre-heating. Additionally, since the metals joined are not melted in the process, the components retain their original shape; edges and contours are not eroded or changed by the formation of a fillet. Another effect of <b>braze</b> <b>welding</b> is the elimination of stored-up stresses that are often present in fusion welding. This is extremely important in the repair of large castings. The disadvantages are the loss of strength when subjected to high temperatures and the inability to withstand high stresses.|$|R

This paper describes a method, called laser <b>braze</b> <b>welding,</b> which is a suitable process to realize this structure. The main problem with thermal joining of steel/aluminum assembly with processes such as TIG or MIG is the formation of fragile intermetallic phases, which are detrimental to the mechanical performances of such joints. <b>Braze</b> <b>welding</b> permits a localized fusion of the materials resulting in a limitation on the growth of fragile phases.

40|$|AbstractThe thermal joining of Aluminum and Copper is a {{promising}} technology towards automotive battery manufacturing. The dissimilar metals Al-Cu {{are difficult to}} weld due to their different physicochemical characteristics {{and the formation of}} intermetallic compounds (IMC), which have reduced mechanical and electric properties.

50|$|Monel metal is an alloy of {{approximately}} two-thirds nickel and one-third copper. It {{is similar to}} platinum in color. Monel pioneered many of the present uses of stainless steel. The first architectural use of Monel was for roofing the Pennsylvania Railroad Terminal in New York City in 1909.

Its advantages as a roofing material included its ability to be <b>brazed,</b> <b>welded,</b> or soldered in place to provide a watertight, continuous cover. Monel was popular during the Art Deco periods. During World War II large quantities of nickel and copper were diverted to the war effort, and the supply of Monel was greatly reduced.
