5|$|Counsel for the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor {{presented}} {{evidence that}} the Amana was on fire before it first struck trees. Counsel for the widow {{of one of the}} victims suggested the crash may have been caused by the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> tab jamming in the diving position.|$|E
25|$|Investigation of {{the crash}} {{uncovered}} some errors in the information {{used to determine the}} position of the aircraft's centre of gravity. It became clear that the aircraft had taken off with its centre of gravity slightly outside the approved limits. Investigators also found evidence that the takeoff may have been performed with the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> tab still set for landing. If the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> tab had not been set for takeoff this would have been exacerbated by the incorrect position of the centre of gravity and the aircraft would have been uncontrollable.|$|E
25|$|The PT-22 {{fuel system}} {{consists}} of a single tank mounted forward of the front cockpit. Fuel is gravity fed to the carburetor. The oil system is a dry-sump type, with all oil stored in a tank located on the front side of the firewall in the upper section of the fuselage. The wing flaps are mechanically operated from a lever located {{on the left side}} of each cockpit. Adjustable <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> is provided via an <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> tab controllable from a handwheel mounted {{on the left side of}} each cockpit. In its original configuration, the aircraft was not equipped with an electrical system. Hydraulic brakes are provided for each wheel, controllable via the rudder pedals in each cockpit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{commission}} {{responsible for}} investigating the accident concluded that:"An emergency situation could {{be created by}} unintentional activation of the electric control with the <b>elevator</b> <b>trimmer,</b> {{as well as the}} trimmer aileron, although the latter is less dangerous than the inclusion of the <b>elevator</b> <b>trimmer.</b> As for the inadvertent loss of the rudder, the aircraft will still flyable, although it will significantly complicate the piloting of the aircraft. If the elevator is turned off after turning on the autopilot, and the balance of the aircraft is maintained by the trim tabs, then an emergency situation may occur if the autopilot is turned off."It is worth noting that the civil commission was not allowed to review materials falling under the classification [...] "Military Secret". This has led to so theories that the aircraft could have been accidentally shot down by a surface-to-air missile launched from the Litovko military base.|$|R
50|$|When a {{servo tab}} is employed, it is {{moved into the}} {{slipstream}} opposite to the control surface's desired deflection. For example, in order to <b>trim</b> an <b>elevator</b> to hold the nose down, the <b>elevator's</b> <b>trim</b> tab will actually rise up into the slipstream. The increased pressure {{on top of the}} trim tab surface caused by raising it will then deflect the entire elevator slab down slightly, causing the tail to rise and the aircraft's nose to move down. In the case of an aircraft where deployment of high-lift devices (flaps) would significantly alter the longitudinal trim, a supplementary trim tab is arranged to simultaneously deploy with the flaps so that pitch attitude is not markedly changed.|$|R
50|$|On many aircraft, the {{tailplane}} assembly {{consists of}} a fixed surface fitted with a hinged aft <b>elevator</b> surface. <b>Trim</b> tabs {{may be used to}} relieve pilot input forces; conversely in some cases, such as small aircraft with all-moving stabilizers, anti-servo tabs are used to increase these forces.|$|R
25|$|Developmental {{evolution}} of the Parrot to include common engine cowling, nose gear and rudder assemblies with the PS-28 Cruiser, plus the addition of rear windows, larger <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> tab, removal of rudder horn and the empty weight was reduced. First flown 6 December 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{design team}} also {{attempted}} to minimize {{changes in the}} aircraft's trim at varying speeds, thus reducing the pilot's workload. They were so successful in this regard that they found in-flight-adjustable aileron and rudder trim tabs were not necessary. Small, fixed tabs were fitted to control surfaces and adjusted for proper balance during initial test flights. Only the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> needed to be adjusted in flight (a feature common to all aircraft). This was accomplished by tilting the entire horizontal tailplane with an electric motor, with an angle of incidence ranging from −3° to +5°.|$|E
25|$|With the {{information}} obtained from Learmonth’s radio commentary the problem plaguing the Australian-built Beauforts was {{traced to a}} component in the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> tab actuating unit. All the RAAF Beauforts were grounded until they were modified to eliminate the problem. Learmonth is credited with supplying the vital information that was necessary to identify the problem and eventually solve it. A secret World War II landing field at Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, known only by the code-name Potshot, was eventually developed into a permanent military base and named RAAF Learmonth in honour of Wing Commander Charles Learmonth.|$|E
50|$|The {{tail unit}} was metal framed and fabric covered. The {{tailplane}} was externally braced and the <b>elevators</b> carried <b>trim</b> tabs. The fin was straight edged but the rudder, which {{extended to the}} bottom of the fuselage and worked in a cut-out between the elevators, had a full, curved trailing edge.|$|R
25|$|Aerodynamic balance {{for control}} {{surfaces}} was by geared tab on the IIIa and b, but on IIId, f, and g the outer flap had a 20% Frise nose which also countered adverse yaw: out-of-balance aerodynamic loads on the <b>elevators</b> were <b>trimmed</b> by a rubber bungee trimmer with the trim datum {{set by the}} pilot.|$|R
25|$|As {{well the}} new engines, the AX2000 differs chiefly from the AX3 {{in having a}} {{completely}} double surface wing of reduced area and modified structure, a change of alloy for the main keel beam, a revised and lightened fuselage with new undercarriage, an increased fuel capacity {{and the addition of}} an <b>elevator</b> anti-balance <b>trim</b> tab.|$|R
25|$|Flight testing {{began in}} 1938 using an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley II, serial number K7243, during which cooling {{problems}} were encountered with the rear row of cylinders. This problem was solved by a 'reversed-flow' cooling system, {{in which a}} large air duct {{at the rear of}} the cowling took in air and directed it forward to exit behind the propeller. The project suffered a severe setback when the Whitley crashed on takeoff in March 1940, fatally injuring its crew. The accident was attributed to an incorrect <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> setting and was not related to the engines. A single prototype Deerhound III was built and ran, and survived until the late-1970s before being scrapped. Development work on the early engines was cancelled by the Air Ministry on 23 April 1941, but running of the Mk III was allowed to continue until 3 October 1941; at this point all records were ordered to be handed over to Rolls-Royce.|$|E
25|$|During {{his seven}} years in flight test, Chilstrom flew 147 {{different}} aircraft including X, Y, and production models from the United States, Germany, and Japan. Many German and Japanese aircraft captured during World War II were sent to Wright Field, and Chilstrom {{had the opportunity to}} fly and evaluate over twenty different models including the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, the Messerschmitt Me 262, the A6M Zero, and the Kawasaki Ki-45 Nick. He flew the Fw 190 extensively and during his tenth flight on February 24, 1945, a malfunctioning trim switch nearly killed him. Chilstrom was landing at Wright Field when the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> switch malfunctioned causing the nose to pitch up while the Fw 190 was dangerously close to the ground. After regaining control and climbing to a safe altitude, he identified the problem and determined the trim could also be driven to a full nose-down position. With full nose-down trim, Chilstrom had just enough control to successfully land the aircraft. Other Fw 190 pilots were not as fortunate as electrical problems in the trim switch caused or were suspected to have caused a number of crashes.|$|E
25|$|Test flights {{revealed}} problems initially {{believed to}} be tail flutter. During high-speed flight approaching Mach0.68, especially during dives, the aircraft's tail would begin to shake violently and the nose would tuck under, steepening the dive. Once caught in this dive, the fighter would enter a high-speed compressibility stall and the controls would lock up, leaving the pilot {{no option but to}} bail out (if possible) or remain with the aircraft until it got down to denser air, where he might have a chance to pull out. During a test flight in May 1941, USAAC Major Signa Gilkey managed to stay with a YP-38 in a compressibility lockup, riding it out until he recovered gradually using <b>elevator</b> <b>trim.</b> Lockheed engineers were very concerned at this limitation but first had to concentrate on filling the current order of aircraft. In late June 1941, the Army Air Corps was renamed the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF), and a total of 65 Lightnings were finished for the service by September 1941 with more on the way for the USAAF, the Royal Air Force (RAF), and the Free French Air Force operating from England.|$|E
50|$|Aerodynamic balance {{for control}} {{surfaces}} was by geared tab on the IIIa and b, but on IIId, f, and g the outer flap had a 20% Frise nose which also countered adverse yaw: out-of-balance aerodynamic loads on the <b>elevators</b> were <b>trimmed</b> by a rubber bungee trimmer with the trim datum {{set by the}} pilot.|$|R
50|$|The PL.3 had a {{low wing}} built entirely of wood, covered with plywood, {{tapering}} uniformly both in chord and thickness from wide, deep roots to rounded tips. The tail was conventional, the tailplane set at mid-fuselage with straight swept leading edges and carrying <b>elevators</b> with <b>trim</b> tabs. The fin was triangular, with a rounded rudder ending above the fuselage.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} wind tunnel evaluation of an SMA based smart trim tab for a typical two seater civil aircraft. The SMA actuator was housed in the port side of the elevator {{for the purpose of}} actuating the trim tab. Wind tunnel tests were conducted on a full scale horizontal tail model with <b>elevator</b> and <b>trim</b> tab at free stream speeds of 25, 35 and 45 m...|$|R
500|$|On {{learning}} of the crash at nearby Seven-Mile Beach employees of Australian National Airways raced from Cambridge aerodrome to lend assistance. [...] About 11:15pm the rear fuselage came to the surface a short distance off-shore. Donald Butler, one of the employees, feared the air hostess might still be trapped in her seat {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. [...] He took a length of rope, swam out to the floating piece of structure, attached the rope to the tailwheel and then swam back to the beach. [...] A motor lorry was used to drag the rear fuselage ashore but there was no-one inside. The right tailplane, elevator and trim tab were almost undamaged. [...] The <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> tab was still set appropriately for a shallow climb after take-off.|$|E
500|$|In March 2015, {{additional}} {{details of the}} improvement package were published in Aviation Week & Space Technology. [...] The 777-300ER is to shed 1,800lb. [...] Boeing will replace the fuselage crown with tie rods and composite integration panels, {{similar to those used}} on the 787. New flight control software is to eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the tail off the runway surface regardless {{of the extent to which}} pilots command the elevators. [...] Boeing is also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing. The outboard raked wingtip is to have a divergent trailing edge, described as a"poor man's airfoil" [...] by Boeing; this originally developed for the McDonnell Douglas MD-12 project. [...] Another change involves <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> bias. [...] These changes are to increase fuel efficiency and allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane, increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5%.|$|E
2500|$|DF 2000 Plus: 75kW (100hp) Rotax 912 ULS engine, {{composite}} 3-bladed propeller with ground-adjustable pitch. Electrical <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> {{control and}} flap actuation, flap hinge fairing, partial cabin ventilation and additional instrumentation. [...] Wheel spats and landing light.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{conventional}} single-engine low-wing monoplane, seating two in tandem. The wings are wooden structures with fabric covering. They carry 5° of dihedral and are braced with struts {{running from the}} upper fuselage longerons to the upper wing surface. There are no flaps. The tail surfaces are also built of wood, with fabric covering. The fin and rudder are tall, tapered and straight edged. The <b>elevators</b> carry <b>trim</b> tabs.|$|R
50|$|Plywood-skinned low-set {{tailplane}} and {{fin with}} fabric-covered built-up wooden elevators and rudder {{are at the}} tail end of the fuselage, the <b>elevators</b> fitted with <b>trim</b> tabs, one for longitudinal trim and one to compensate for pitch-up with operation of the airbrakes.|$|R
50|$|A {{single piece}} canopy covers the tandem seats, with {{the rear seat}} higher than the other. Behind the cockpit the {{fuselage}} line falls to the tail. The tailplane is straight edged with rounded tips and carries marked anhedral. The fin and rudder are also straight edged but swept; {{there is a small}} additional ventral fin. <b>Elevator</b> has <b>trim</b> tabs. The Master has a tricycle undercarriage, the nosewheel retracting rearwards and the main legs inwards into the wings. The track is 2.01 m (6 ft 7 in).|$|R
2500|$|In {{its report}} the panel stated the {{accident}} {{was caused by the}} aircraft being loaded so its centre of gravity was behind the rear limit. [...] The report also stated that incorrect setting of the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> tab may have been a contributory cause.|$|E
2500|$|The 1981 and 1982 {{models were}} {{designated}} as the Tomahawk II. They incorporated improved cabin heating and windshield defroster performance, an improved <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> system, improved engine thrust vector, 100% airframe zinc-chromate anti-corrosion treatment, better cockpit soundproofing, larger 6" [...] wheels and tires for greater propeller ground clearance and improved performance on grass and dirt runways, among other enhancements.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had been}} in daily civil operations in Australia since November 1946 so the investigators assumed {{there must have been}} numerous flights with the centre of gravity significantly more than 39% of Mean Aerodynamic Chord. [...] It was necessary for the investigators to find something unique about the fatal flight of VH-BAG that would explain its sudden climb immediately after take-off and the pilot's inability to regain control and prevent the aircraft crashing. [...] The aircraft's tailplane {{was one of the few}} parts of the aircraft not destroyed by fire. [...] The position of the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> tab spool appeared to be in the normal position for landing rather than a typical position for take-off. The investigators concluded that on the final takeoff it was likely that the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> tab was still set for landing. [...] This, coupled with the aircraft being tail-heavy and longitudinally unstable after undercarriage retraction, caused the aircraft to pitch nose-up so strongly that the pilot was unable to retain control or prevent the aircraft stalling.|$|E
50|$|The CAMS 52 had a conventional, fabric covered tail, with a broad, near-triangular fin and a rectangular, wire-braced tailplane. The {{elevators}} and rudder, {{the latter}} reaching {{down to the}} keel, were narrow, straight-edged and balanced. Both rudder and <b>elevators</b> had inflight-adjustible <b>trimming</b> surfaces along their entire trailing edges.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{tail unit}} incorporated a variable incidence tailplane with rudder and <b>elevators</b> all with <b>trim</b> tabs and servo tabs. Hydraulically actuated ailerons operated {{in conjunction with}} upper surface spoilers inboard of the ailerons and forward of the outer flap segment. All powered controls were also to be provided with manual cable-operated backups.|$|R
50|$|A {{single centre}} stick {{controls}} the ailerons and <b>elevators.</b> Electrical pitch <b>trim</b> {{is controlled by}} two buttons {{on the top of}} the stick, operated by the thumb. A push to talk button is on the front of the stick, operated by the index finger, together with a vertical hand operated brake lever similar to a motorcycle front brake lever.|$|R
2500|$|The Griffon {{airframe}} {{is constructed}} from aluminum tubing, with {{the wings and}} tail covered with doped aircraft fabric. The wing {{is supported by a}} [...] "V" [...] strut and utilizes jury struts. It features a three tube tail that allows the pusher propeller to be located in between the tail booms. Standard features supplied included brakes, electric starting, wheel pants, <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> system and a plastic cockpit pod fairing with a windshield. The wings and tail surfaces can be folded for trailering or storage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} structure {{is made from}} a combination of 1050, 2024, 3130 and 6164 aluminum tubing, with the main beam, cockpit pod and main landing gear made from composites. The landing gear is pyramidal in design. Its all-metal wing employs composite flaperons. Controls are actuated by push-pull cables, while the <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> is electric. The nosewheel is steerable. The aircraft's recommended engine power range is [...] and standard engines used include the [...] Hirth F-23, the [...] Rotax 503 and the [...] Rotax 582 two-stroke powerplants. Construction time from the supplied standard kit is estimated as 350 hours, although a quick-build kit is also available.|$|E
2500|$|The Delta first flew on 11 March 1939, {{registered}} as G-AFPX. On 14 May 1939, piloted by A.N. Kingwill, it was demonstrated at the Royal Aeronautical Society's garden party fly-in at Great West Aerodrome, also at Heston Aerodrome. On 10 July 1939, it crashed near Bicester, killing the pilot Hugh Olley and the Delta's designer, Percival Willoughby. [...] The crash was not {{attributed to the}} novel configuration but to an ill-designed <b>elevator</b> <b>trim</b> tab that sent the Delta into a dive. [...] Nonetheless, {{with the death of}} the designer and the coming of war, no more was heard of this type of flying wing.|$|E
50|$|Fitted with an American 260 hp engine, cockpit air conditioning, {{electrical}} instruments, and electric/manual <b>elevator</b> and rudder <b>trim,</b> {{the aircraft}} {{has been developed}} to meet FAR part 23 certification in normal, utility and aerobatics categories. It has a spacious side-by-side cockpit allowing good contact between the pilot and the co-pilot/observer or between the student and the instructor.|$|R
25|$|The {{fuselage}} and empennage have {{a wooden}} structure and carbon fibre skin. The engine is 73.5 kW (98.6 hp) Rotax 912S flat-four, driving a variable pitch propeller. The cabin {{is over the}} wings, with two pairs of side-by-side seats. Entry is by two upward-opening doors {{and there is a}} baggage space behind the rear seats. At the rear the vertical surfaces are straight-edged and swept, with a long dorsal strake. The horizontal surfaces are approximately trapezoidal in plan, with an unswept leading edge.Both the rudder and elevators are fabric covered. The rudder is balanced and both it and the port <b>elevator</b> carry <b>trim</b> tabs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} was a metal monocoque, with a {{port side}} passenger door aft of six windows [...] on each side, one per seat. Though the standard seat arrangement was for twelve, two seats could be removed {{to allow the}} installation of chaises-longues for longer flights. The pilots' cabin was enclosed, with side by side dual control seating. The tail unit carried twin vertical endplate fins, slightly oval on a tailplane that had strong dihedral. The balanced rudders and elevators were metal structures with the only fabric covering used on the aircraft. The <b>elevators</b> carried <b>trim</b> tabs. There was a small tailwheel, the main undercarriage retracting into the inner engine nacelles.|$|R
