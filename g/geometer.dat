5|$|Generalizing this problem, one can ask {{how many}} lines {{can be drawn}} on a quintic Calabi–Yau manifold, {{such as the one}} {{illustrated}} above, which is defined by a polynomial of degree five. This problem was solved by the nineteenth-century German mathematician Hermann Schubert, who found that there are exactly 2,875 such lines. In 1986, <b>geometer</b> Sheldon Katz proved that the number of curves, such as circles, that are defined by polynomials of degree two and lie entirely in the quintic is 609,250.|$|E
5|$|In its {{broadest}} definition, mimicry {{can include}} non-living models. The specific terms masquerade and mimesis are sometimes used when the models are inanimate. For example, {{animals such as}} flower mantises, planthoppers and <b>geometer</b> moth caterpillars resemble twigs, bark, leaves or flowers. Many animals bear eyespots, which are hypothesized to resemble the eyes of larger animals. They may not resemble any specific organism's eyes, {{and whether or not}} animals respond to them as eyes is also unclear. Nonetheless, eyespots are the subject of a rich contemporary literature.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{a number}} of other books and pamphlets, Wright {{translated}} John Napier's pioneering 1614 work which introduced the idea of logarithms from Latin into English. This was published after Wright's death as A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes (1616). Wright's work influenced, among other persons, Dutch astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snellius; Adriaan Metius, the <b>geometer</b> and astronomer from Holland; and the English mathematician Richard Norwood, who calculated the length of a degree on a great circle of the earth using a method proposed by Wright.|$|E

5|$|Mathematically, tessellations can be {{extended}} to spaces other than the Euclidean plane. The Swiss <b>geometer</b> Ludwig Schläfli pioneered this by defining polyschemes, which mathematicians nowadays call polytopes. These are the analogues to polygons and polyhedra in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the Schläfli symbol notation {{to make it easy}} to describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}. The Schläfli notation makes it possible to describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, so its Schläfli symbol is {6,3}.|$|E

A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the <b>geometer</b> of the world, and that therefore the world's geometry is sacred, as seen in artworks such as William Blake's The Ancient of Days.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} what are the students' opinions about learning the geometry subjects of primary 7 th grade with <b>Geometer's</b> Sketchpad dynamic geometry software. In order to determine the students' opinions, computer-assisted teaching method using <b>Geometer’s</b> Sketchpad was used. For this purpose, application related to <b>Geometer's</b> Sketchpad software and computer-aided materials were carried out with totally 42 7 th grade students. In the study, data on students' opinions about learning the geometry subjects with <b>Geometer’s</b> Sketchpad dynamic geometry software was collected by using semi-structured interview form. Descriptive analysis method was used to analyze the qualitative data obtained. The students stated that studying with GSP dynamic geometry software facilitated the learning, made students more active, increased their interest in geometry and desire to succeed; they learned collaboration, group work, and sharing. The negative opinions of the students were formed because of lack of time to study and program's being English...|$|R
5|$|Leaves of Ficus obliqua {{serve as}} a food source for the larvae of the {{butterfly}} species the common crow (Euploea core), the no-brand crow (Euploea alcathoe), and the <b>Geometer</b> moth species Scopula epigypsa. The thrips species Gynaikothrips australis feeds {{on the underside of}} new leaves of F. obliqua, as well as F. rubiginosa and F. macrophylla. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue. A gall results and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips remain in the galls at night and wander about in the daytime before returning in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and the life cycle is around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding or pupate sheltered in the bark.|$|E

A survey questionnaire was used to measure students’ perception on the usage of <b>Geometer’s</b> Sketchpad in the learning of Geometry and some other topics of mathematics. In the study, the experimental groups used <b>Geometer’s</b> Sketchpad-based topics and worksheets and for each student there is an access computer/plasma equipped with the Sketchpad software.
