5|$|Prior to forming Taxiride, Tim Watson, Tim Wild, Jason Singh, and Dan Hall {{had each}} played in cover bands across Melbourne. Watson and Wild began writing {{together}} in 1997 in Camberwell, Melbourne, and soon recruited Singh {{as an additional}} vocalist. The trio invited Hall, whom Wild first encountered busking, to join the group, and he accepted. The band named themselves Taxiride because they had given some of their early work {{to a friend of}} theirs, a taxi driver, who had tested these songs on passengers. The group produced a demo at Melbourne's Secret Sound Studios, and used it to land a contract with Warner in Australia. Meanwhile, a friend of the group passed their work onto a Sire Records <b>executive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S., who signed them despite the group being unknown.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal held {{further that}} as the {{discretion}} conferred by section 8 of the ISA involved national security, {{the issue of whether}} detention was necessary should be left solely to executive discretion. However, the Court referred to two United Kingdom decisions which stood for the principle that courts are not precluded from determining whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Therefore, the court could still determine whether the matters relied on by the <b>executive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exercise of discretion were indeed within the scope of section 8.|$|E

During the training, est personnel utilized jargon to convey key concepts, and participants had to agree to certain rules which remained in effect {{for the duration of the}} course. Participants were taught that they were responsible for their life outcomes, and were promised a dramatic change in their self-perception.|$|E
5|$|Following {{through on}} the CEO's opinion that the company needed a {{consistent}} marketing plan and management team to succeed, the company began its moves by replacing its chairman and CEO Jerry W. Levin with its own choice of executives, Barry J. Gibbons, {{chairman and managing director}} of Grand Metropolitan Retailing, Ltd., as chief executive and Ian A. Martin, Grand Met's top <b>executive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, as chairman. The moves came to no surprise to Wall Street analysts and franchisees, as they were expected due to reservations about Levin after his appointment by the outgoing management at Pillsbury. Grand Met's first major restructuring move was the dismantling of Burger Kings 50-year-old purchasing and distribution arm, Distron. Unhappy with the distribution group, the company originally thought to dispose of the division after the purchase but instead decided to reorganize it into two separate groups, one for procurement (Burger King Purchasing or BKP) and another for distribution (Burger King Distribution Services or BKDS). With the restructuring, the company eliminated many positions and ended up laying off over a hundred staff members as a consequence.|$|E

5|$|Until 1707, The Privy Council met {{in what is}} now the West Drawing Room at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. By {{the early}} modern period the Privy Council was a {{full-time}} body and critical to the smooth running of government. Its primary function was judicial, but it also acted as a body of advisers to the king and as a result its secondary function was as an <b>executive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence or minority of the monarchy. After James VI departure to England in 1603, it functioned as a subservient executive carrying out his instructions from London. Although the theoretical membership of the council was relatively large, at around thirty persons, most of the business was carried out by an informal inner group consisting mainly of the officers of state. After the Restoration, Charles II nominated his own privy councillors and set up a council in London through which he directed affairs in Edinburgh, a situation that continued after the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89. The council was abolished after the Act of Union on 1 May 1708.|$|E

5|$|The Privy Council's primary {{function}} was judicial, {{but it also}} acted as a body of advisers to the king {{and as a result}} its secondary function was as an <b>executive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence or minority of the monarchy. Although the monarch might often attend the council, their presence was not necessary for the council to act with royal authority. Like parliament, it had the power to issue acts that could have the force of law. After James VI's departure to England in 1603, it functioned as a subservient executive carrying out his instructions from London. Although the theoretical membership of the council was relatively large, at around 30 persons, most of the business was carried out by an informal inner group, consisting mainly of the officers of state. Before 1610 the council was presided over by the Lord Chancellor, but in 1610 James VI decreed that the President of the College of Justice should preside in the Chancellor's absence, and by 1619 the additional title of President of the Privy Council had been added. The two presidencies were separated in 1626 as part of Charles I's reorganisation of the Privy Council and Court of Session. The Lord President of the Council was accorded precedence as one of the King's chief officers in 1661. After the Restoration, Charles II nominated his own privy councillors and set up a council in London through which he directed affairs in Edinburgh, a situation that continued after the Glorious Revolution of 1688–9. The council was abolished after the Act of Union on 1 May 1708.|$|E
