30|$|Ammonia is {{the most}} {{important}} water quality parameter that affects fish growth and production after dissolved oxygen. It causes stress and damages gills and other tissues, even in small amounts (Francis-Floyd et al. 2009). The present study showed that unionised ammonia increased both during the <b>day</b> and <b>night.</b> However, the rate of increase was lower during the <b>day</b> than <b>night.</b> The <b>levels</b> of 0.08 – 0.26  mg/l for unionised ammonia reported in this study are much higher than 0.05 – 0.1  mg/l recommended for aquaculture pond waters (Boyd 1990; Boyd and Tucker 1998; Francis-Floyd et al. 2009) and the levels of 0.002 – 0.026  mg/l reported by Alam and Al-Hafedh (2006). However, {{the results of the present}} study are corroborated by findings of Oz′orio et al. (2001).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Objective: The pineal hormone {{melatonin}} plays {{a crucial}} role in immunomodulation, mainly by effecting T cells. The aims of the present study were to compare the melatonin levels in patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) and healthy controls and to find out if it associates with interferon(IFN) � and interleukin(IL) - 10. Materials and Methodology: Twenty five patients with FMF and 16 healthy donors were enrolled into the study. Melatonin, IFN � and IL- 10 measurements were assayed by using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method. Results: Serum melatonin levels at 03. 30 am in both patients during attack-free phase and healthy controls were significantly higher than those levels of corresponding groups measured at 10. 00 am. The melatonin levels at 03. 30 and 10. 00 am in patients during attack-free phase were higher than those levels measured in healthy controls at the same time points. IFN � and IL- 10 did not show any <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> rhythm in both patients and healthy controls. In addition, there was no association among <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> <b>levels</b> of melatonin, IFN � and IL- 10. Conclusions: We conclude that melatonin {{may play a role in}} FMF pathogenesis. However, its modulatory effect on immune response most likely does not depend on T cells. Further comprehensive studies should be performed in order to reveal the role of melatonin in the pathogenesis of this disease...|$|R
40|$|Background: Alterations in the sleep-wake cycle {{leads to}} {{decreased}} melatonin secretion {{and it may}} be associated with sleep disorders and cancer risk. Exposure of light at night and rotating night shift decrease the melatonin production due to acute suppression of pineal melatonin secretion during night work has been suggested to increases cancer risks. Aims & Objectives: The objectives of the present study were to investigate the effect of light exposure at night on circadian pattern of 6 -Sulfatoxy melatonin <b>levels</b> in <b>night</b> shift nursing professionals. Material and Methods: 62 healthy nursing professionals of both genders performing <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> shifts (continuous 9 <b>days</b> <b>night</b> shift with alternate day shifts) were recruited. Urine samples were collected at around 8 hour intervals (afternoon sample: between 13 : 00 to 15 : 00, night samples between 22 : 00 to 01 : 00 and morning samples between 05 : 00 to 08 : 00) while they were performing night duties and repeated when they were assigned <b>day</b> duties. <b>Night</b> melatonin <b>level</b> was decreased as compared to morning melatonin. Results: <b>Night</b> melatonin <b>level</b> was found declined as compared to morning level and this pattern was significant when compared night melatonin between night (16. 71 ± 11. 98) vs day shift (22. 71 ± 13. 25) and morning melatonin <b>level</b> between <b>night</b> (20. 07 ± 14. 13) vs day shifts (28. 26 ± 14. 14) (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Light exposure at night disrupts the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion during night shift leads to internal desynchronization...|$|R
40|$|Kriging with {{external}} drift {{allows for the}} estimation of a spatial variable when this is driven by an external parameter, through a response function only known up to constants. This is advantageous when {{the effect of the}} parameter exists or is postulated but is not known precisely. A postulated day/night effect on catch rates in trawl survey data can be accounted for even when the <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> <b>levels</b> are poorly known. Similarly, the effect of time of day on catch rates can be accounted for supposing, for instance, that it varies as a cosine but with unknown coefficients. The methods are illustrated on catches of age 1 to 3 haddock in the North Sea from the first quarter International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) 1983 – 1997, where daylight effects exist without being precisely known. A cross-validation on data values is used to measure the improvement of the methods over Ordinary Kriging. It reveals excessive variations in the parameters of individual annual variograms. Using a generic variogram appears an improvement, though not changing the global abundance. The results of kriging {{with external}} drift are compared to Ordinary Kriging, IBTS standard indices and the assessment made by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown {{different}} sensitivities to noise exposure for <b>day,</b> evening and <b>night,</b> in particular for railway and air traffic. Lden has been accepted as a good indicator for predicting noise annoyance. In the same way, time of day is considered here as a factor affecting the impact of vibration in communities as measured by annoyance. The current British Standard BS 6472 - 1 : 2008 recommends using the Vibration Dose Value (VDV) as a vibration descriptor. VDV takes into account the number of events and their duration, and recommends limit values for <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> <b>levels.</b> However, there are no penalties applied in its calculation for different times of the day. This paper presents data from case studies (N= 931) comprised of face-to-face interviews and internal measurements of vibration exposure. The aim of the present paper is to identify the times of day during which vibration causes the greatest annoyance, to measure the differences between annoyance responses for different time periods, and to obtain estimates of the values of the time-of-day penalties. In addition, information about nighttime responses (annoyance and sleeping disturbance) is presented. This work will be of interest to policy makers and environmental health practitioners involved in the assessment of vibration complaints, as well as to planners and acoustic consultants involved in the design of buildings.

30|$|Conclusions: Our results {{indicate}} that circadian rhythm is desynchronized in ICU patients, {{as indicated by the}} missing MT peaks during the night, the absence of the normal 24  h rhythm of MT release and by the poor correlation between illumination and MT levels. This first observation suggests that absence of darkness at night and the missing contrast of <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> light <b>levels</b> can rapidly destruct the rhythm of MT release. The cause(s) of our second observation, namely that patients in septic subgroup showed lower MT variances and higher MT levels in general needs to be elucidated by studies focusing on this phenomenon, conducted in larger patient population. Based on these observations, future trials on light/dark conditions and patient outcomes could lead to redesigned healthcare environments, which may help restore circadian rhythmicity and reach health benefits.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the methodology and experimental {{results of the}} study of human eye sensitivity in central and peripheral vision field to the visible light pulses. The experimental results show that transmission systems based on visible rays can work in hidden mode. Conditions providing hidden transmission differ significantly for <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> light <b>levels.</b> At low light <b>levels</b> (at <b>night)</b> the non-perceptive nature of the pulsed light which is applied in the information transfer process should be used. In this case an optical transmitter is perceived as «usual» illuminant. In daylight, light pulse can be invisible at certain values of duration and frequency of the light pulses for central and peripheral vision. For example, light pulses with the duration of 5 • 10 – 6 s in the range from 20 to 200 Hz are «invisible»...|$|R

50|$|In early 2015, McMahon and his {{graduate}} students, Jeff Jones and Michael Tackenberg, found that circadian rhythms in mice could be shifted by artificial stimulus to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) using a laser and optical fiber. Using optogenetics, the Vanderbilt researchers {{were able to}} change the firing rate of neurons in the SCN so that their firing resembled their normal <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> activity <b>levels.</b> Subsequently, altering the firing rate of the SCN neurons reset the biological clocks of the mice. Prior to this experiment, firing rate {{was thought to be}} strictly an output of the SCN. However, the results from this experiment suggest that firing rate is a more complex mechanism that is yet to be fully understood. Although not ready for direct human use, optogenetic stimulation techniques such as the one used by McMahon could potentially be used to treat seasonal affective disorder, reduce the adverse health effects of working a night shift, and even alleviate the symptoms of jet lag.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} growth in cod (Gadus morhua) aquaculture, {{relatively}} {{little is known about}} the fundamental aspects of cod behavior within net pens. To investigate some aspects of their behavior, we used a high resolution ultrasonic telemetry system that makes it possible to continuously and accurately monitor the position of multiple fish, in 3 D, for days at a time. The data presented in this manuscript were obtained from a total of 32 cod (29. 3 ± 4. 9 cm, range: 22. 5 – 43. 0 cm), tracked under a variety of conditions, inside a net pen located 13 km off the coast of New Hampshire, USA. Typically, cod exhibited clear diurnal rhythms, with the highest swimming activity during daytime hours (mean swimming speed = 17. 8 ± 5. 5 cm/s; 0. 6 ± 0. 2 body lengths per sec (BL/s)) compared with nighttime hours (6. 6 ± 0. 5 cm/s; 0. 2 ± 0. 03 BL/s). Analysis of net pen utilization revealed that: a) the entire volume of the net pen was not utilized (volumes used by individuals overlapped); and b) there was a spatial preference for the lower half of the net pen. Adding lights and increasing stocking densities elicited dramatic changes in behavior. When lights were turned on at dawn and dusk, to extend the day photoperiod, cod increased their swimming activity by 66. 4 % and 202. 6 %, compared to <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> <b>levels,</b> respectively. When the density of cod reached high levels (~ 48. 5 kg/m 3) as they grew, their typical diurnal pattern of independent swimming changed to schooling behavior, with no significant difference in <b>day</b> and <b>night</b> activity. The results of this study could be used to optimize various aspects of cod aquaculture including: net pen geometry, feeding schedules, stocking densities, and the use of artificial lights. Implementation of these modifications could increase production efficiency and animal welfare...|$|R

40|$|Noise levels around {{airports}} and airbases in the United States arc computed via the FAA's Integrated Noise Model (INM) or the Air Force's NOISEMAP (NMAP) program. These models were originally developed {{for use in}} the vicinity of airports, at distances which encompass a <b>day</b> <b>night</b> average sound <b>level</b> in decibels (Ldn) of 65 dB or higher. There is increasing interest in aircraft noise at larger distances from the airport. including en-route noise. To evaluate the applicability of INM and NMAP at larger distances, a measurement program was conducted at a major air carrier airport with monitoring sites located in areas exposed to an Ldn of 55 dB and higher. Automated Radar Terminal System (ARTS) radar tracking data were obtained to provide actual flight parameters and positive identification of aircraft. Flight operations were grouped according to aircraft type. stage length, straight versus curved flight tracks, and arrival versus departure. Sound exposure levels (SEL) were computed at monitoring locations, using the INM, and compared with measured values. While individual overflight SEL data was characterized by a high variance, analysis performed on an energy-averaging basis indicates that INM and similar models can be applied to regions exposed to an Ldn of 55 dB with no loss of reliability...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{noise and}} air {{pollution}} {{have been associated with}} cardiovascular health effects. Until date, only a limited amount of prospective epidemiological studies is available on long-term effects of road traffic noise and combustion related air pollution. This study investigates the relationship between road traffic noise {{and air pollution}} and hospital admissions for ischemic heart disease (IHD: International Classification of Diseases (ICD 9) 410 - 414) or cerebrovascular disease (cerebrovascular event [CVE]: ICD 9 430 - 438). We linked baseline questionnaire data to 13 years of follow-up on hospital admissions and road traffic noise and air pollution exposure, for a large random sample (N = 18, 213) of inhabitants of the Eindhoven region, Netherlands. Subjects with cardiovascular event during follow-up on average had higher road traffic noise <b>day,</b> evening, <b>night</b> <b>level</b> (L den) and air pollution exposure at the home. After adjustment for confounders (age, sex, body mass index, smoking, education, exercise, marital status, alcohol use, work situation, financial difficulties), increased exposure did not exert a significant increased risk of hospital admission for IHD or cerebrovascular disease. Relative risks (RRs) for a 5 th to 95 th percentile interval increase were 1. 03 (0. 88 - 1. 20) for L den; 1. 04 (0. 90 - 1. 21) for particulate matter (PM 10); 1. 05 (0. 91 - 1. 20) for elemental carbon (EC); and 1. 12 (096 - 1. 32) for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) in the full model. While the risk estimate seemed highest for NO 2, for a 5 th to 95 th percentile interval increase, expressed as RRs per 1 μg/m 3 increases, hazard ratios seemed highest for EC (RR 1. 04 [0. 92 - 1. 18]). In the subgroup of study participants with a history of cardiovascular disease, RR estimates seemed highest for noise exposure (1. 19 [0. 87 - 1. 64] for L den); in the subgroup of elderly RR seemed highest for air pollution exposure (RR 1. 24 [0. 93 - 1. 66] for NO 2) ...|$|R
