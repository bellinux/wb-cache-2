5|$|Lukić {{notes that}} the {{mortality}} rate among the children at Jastrebarsko was much {{lower than that of}} children at Stara Gradiška and Sisak <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> Firstly, that almost half the children at Jastrebarsko were older children more able to cope with the harsh conditions. More importantly, that from the end of July, twenty-six volunteer nurses from the teachers' school at Rude near Samobor, along with several doctors and other medical personnel, under the leadership of Marinić, began to intervene with the camp administration and Ustaše guards to improve the health of the children. The Ustaše propaganda soon took advantage of the improved condition of the children.|$|E
5|$|Geometric {{designs on}} pottery {{of the eighth}} century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle, {{as well as the}} adventures of Heracles. These visual {{representations}} of myths are important <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> Firstly, many Greek myths are attested on vases earlier than in literary sources: of the twelve labors of Heracles, for example, only the Cerberus adventure occurs in a contemporary literary text. Secondly, visual sources sometimes represent myths or mythical scenes that are not attested in any extant literary source. In some cases, the first known representation of a myth in geometric art predates its first known representation in late archaic poetry, by several centuries. In the Archaic (c. 750–c. 500 BC), Classical (c. 480–323 BC), and Hellenistic (323–146 BC) periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert had {{previously}} been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147, but this hearing came to nothing <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> One was that Gilbert's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert's teachings. The second reason was {{that no one had}} a copy of the treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute. Prior to the second hearing at Reims, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was opposed to Gilbert's teachings, held a private meeting with a number of the attendees, where Bernard attempted to pressure them to condemn Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to insist that they were the only persons who could judge the case.|$|E

5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Rhynie in Aberdeenshire {{is the site}} of an {{important}} sedimentary deposit - Rhynie chert. The bulk of this fossil bed consists of primitive plants that had water-conducting cells and sporangia but no leaves, along with arthropods: Collembola, Opiliones (harvestmen), pseudoscorpions and the extinct, spider-like Trigonotarbids. This fossil bed is remarkable <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> Firstly, the age of the find (early Devonian circa 410 Ma) makes this one of the earliest sites anywhere containing terrestrial fossils, coinciding with the first stages of the colonisation of land by plants and animals. Secondly, these cherts are famous for their exceptional state of ultrastructural preservation, with individual cell walls easily visible in polished specimens. For example, stomata have been counted and lignin remnants detected in the plant material.|$|E
25|$|The Erie Canal {{management}} did {{not like}} swelling <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> First, it used too much water lowering the water on the pound above sometimes causing boats to run aground. In addition, it raised the water level on the pound below causing some boats to strike bridges or get stuck.|$|E

25|$|The {{effort to}} rapidly reorganize the Arkansas National Guard {{following}} World War I was a complicated task <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons,</b> first {{the fact that}} the units mobilized for the war had effectively been disbanded {{at the end of the}} war and second because Federal Authorities were focused on a massive expansion of the National Guard.|$|E
25|$|It is, however, not comfortable, <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> which work together: the cervix {{is full of}} nociceptors, and {{the brush}} used to collect cells has to be stiff enough to scrape them off of the {{surrounding}} tissue. So it can be uncomfortable, but it is generally quick, and the information obtained may be critical.|$|E
25|$|Walker {{argues that}} the {{independent}} inquiry was flawed <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> Firstly, because the time period over which it was conducted (August 2005 to January 2006) surrounded the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Ariel Sharon's stroke, which produced more positive coverage than usual. Furthermore, he wrote, the inquiry only looked at the BBC's domestic coverage, and excluded output on the BBC World Service and BBC World.|$|E

25|$|According to {{scholars}} who considered the environmental justice implications {{of climate change}}, the expected impacts of climate change on subsistence farmers in Latin America and other developing regions are unjust <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> First, subsistence farmers in developing countries, including those in Latin America are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change Second, these nations were the least responsible for causing the problem of anthropogenic induced climate.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} exists <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> First, surviving {{letters from}} {{earlier in the}} fall indicate that the vote was delayed {{until the end of}} October to obtain a quorum, which had been lacking. Second, the journals of the legislature that would contain that information disappeared sometime during the war. The Senate journal was rediscovered in recent years among artifacts at the Wilson's Creek National Battlefield, and the House journal has only recently been found.|$|E
25|$|Eberth and {{the other}} {{researchers}} considered Hilda a prime site for a continuous bonebed <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons,</b> one related to its history, one related to its present geography. First, during the Cretaceous the area was situated closer to the Western Interior Seaway where more sediment would have been deposited than at Dinosaur Provincial Park. Secondly, the modern Hilda area lacks the rough badland terrain that breaks up many probably equivalent deposits in Dinosaur Provincial Park.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{interdisciplinary}} approach proved increasingly complex <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> The levels of specialisation at A Levels meant {{that many students}} had not studied particular subjects for some years and this {{made it impossible to}} devise a course that both covered areas unstudied by some and did not bore others. This proved an especial problem in Natural Sciences, where many Mathematics students had not studied Chemistry at A Level and vice versa.|$|E

Second, the MediaWiki markup cannot at present adequately represent the relationships of the ground beetle subgroups in detail if the restricted view of the Harpalinae is chosen.|$|E
25|$|Bryan opposed Charles Darwin's {{theory of}} {{evolution}} through natural selection <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> First, he believed that what he considered a materialistic account of the descent of man (and all life) through evolution was directly contrary to the Biblical creation account, which he accepted. Second, he considered Darwinism as applied to society (social Darwinism) {{to be a great}} evil force in the world, promoting hatred and conflicts, especially the World War, and inhibiting upward social and economic mobility of the poor and oppressed.|$|E

Second, when the polytope is unbounded {{in the direction of}} the gradient of the objective function (where the gradient of the objective function is the vector of the coefficients of the objective function), then no optimal value is attained.|$|E

The Egyptian apparel industry is attractive <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> Firstly, its proximity to European markets, whose rapidly changing fashions require quick replenishment. Egypt's geographical proximity to style-conscious Europe is a logistical advantage. Secondly, the production of garments is a low-capital and high-labor-intensive industry, and the local population of 66 million provides a ready workforce as well as a natural local consumer market that acts as a springboard for exports.|$|E

Concepts such as game theory, decision theory, necessitate that an agent {{be able to detect}} and model human emotions. Second, in an effort to facilitate human–computer interaction, an intelligent machine may want to display emotions (even if it does not experience those emotions itself) to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction.|$|E
