25|$|There {{are many}} {{stories about the}} origin of the name Nandi Hills. During the Chola period, Nandi Hills was called Ananda Giri meaning The Hill of Happiness. Another story is that Yoga Nandeeshwara {{performed}} penance here, and so it was named after him. Nandi is also commonly called Nandidurga (Fort) because of the fort built <b>here</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ruler Tippu Sultan. It is also perhaps called Nandi Hills because the hills resemble a sleeping bull (Nandi).|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of woollen cloth was well established <b>here</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time of Queen Elizabeth I. It expanded rapidly after the late 18thcentury. The first textile mill was built at Dogley in about 1787 and used waterpower to prepare wool for spinning and for fulling the finished cloth. In about 1800 another mill opened at Linfit, which used steam power. Both mills gradually took on other processes and developed into substantial businesses under the Kenyon and Hey families. By 1880 {{there were eight}} mills {{at work in the}} township.|$|E

25|$|In the 15th-century the Tinwald Mote near Dumfries {{was still}} the legal head of the barony, where sasine (possession) was given by the {{ceremony}} of handing the grantee, before witnesses, a handful of earth and stone from the head messuage called the Mote near the church of Tynwald. In mediaeval law the barony required a principal residence at which the legal process could be formally transacted, which explains why many such motes as that at Ellon were retained, <b>here</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> earls of Buchan, when little else remained of their possessions in the district.

On April 25th, 1625, after being buried for 17 years in this church of São Roque which belongs to the Society of Jesus, his body was found perfect and incorrupt and he was reburied <b>here</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> English Catholics resident in this city, on April 25th, 1626.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} trial and error, Lee and his cabinet decided {{the best way to}} boost Singapore's economy was to attract foreign {{investments}} from the multinational corporations (MNCs). By establishing a First World infrastructure and standards in Singapore, the new nation could woo American, Japanese and European entrepreneurs and professionals to set up base <b>here.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, the arrival of MNCs like Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard and General Electric laid the foundations, turning Singapore into a major electronics exporter the following decade. Workers were frequently retrained to familiarise themselves with the work systems and cultures of foreign MNCs. The government also started several new industries, such as steel mills under 'National Iron and Steel Mills', service industries like Neptune Orient Lines, and the Singapore Airlines.|$|E

25|$|Newport is a {{maritime}} {{city with}} coastlines on the west, south, and east. Its harbors teem with commercial fishing boats {{and power and}} sail pleasure craft. It {{is known as the}} sailing capital of the United States. Many defenses of the America's Cup yachting prize took place <b>here</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> New York Yacht Club. Newport Country Club was one of the five founding clubs of the United States Golf Association; it hosted the first U.S. Open and the first U.S. Amateur, both held in 1895. The Newport Country Club hosted the 1995 U.S. Amateur Championship, made notable by Tiger Woods' second of three consecutive wins of the event. In June 2006, the city hosted the U.S. Women's Open. Each July, it hosts the annual Hall of Fame Tennis Championships as part of the ATP Tour, traditionally the last grass court event of the season. Each August, the International Tennis Hall of Fame Champions Cup is held; this event is part of the Outback Champions Series.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{the complex}} {{served as the}} {{residence}} of the Dukes of Masovia, and since the sixteenth century, {{the seat of the}} Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth: the King and Parliament (Chamber of Deputies and Senate). In its long history the Royal Castle was repeatedly plundered and devastated by the invading Swedish, Brandenburgian, Prussian and Tsarist armies. The Constitution of 3 May 1791, the first of its type in Europe and the world's second-oldest codified national constitution after the 1789 U.S. Constitution, was drafted <b>here</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Four-Year Sejm. In the 19th century, {{after the collapse of the}} November Uprising, it was used as an administrative centre by the Tsar and was re-designed for the needs of the Imperial Russian administration. During the course of World War I it was the residence of the German Governor-General. In 1920-1922 the Royal Castle was the seat of the Polish Head of State and between 1926 and World War II the building was the residence of the Polish president, Ignacy Mościcki.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, {{major roads}} would connect {{the town with}} the mining {{communities}} in San Luis Potosí as well as Zacatecas {{and the rest of}} the state of Guanajuato. Serving travelers' needs and providing supplies to mining camps made the town rich. One particular industry was textiles. Locals claim that the serape was invented <b>here.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> mid 18th century the city reached its height, when most of its large mansions, palaces and religious buildings were constructed. Most still remain. The town was also home to the area's wealthy hacienda owners. At that time, it was one of the most important and prosperous settlements in New Spain with a population reaching 30,000. In comparison, in the mid 18th century Boston had a population of only 16,000 and New York 25,000. The town's apogee came during the transition period between Baroque and Neoclassical architecture and many of the mansions and churches have both influences. Mansions are larger than normal for a settlement of this size.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{cities of}} Gandhara were Puruṣapura (Peshawar), Takṣaśilā (Taxila), and Pushkalavati (Charsadda). The latter {{remained}} {{the capital of}} Gandhara down to the 2nd century AD, when the capital was moved to Peshawar. An important Buddhist shrine helped to make the city a centre of pilgrimage until the 7th century. Pushkalavati, in the Peshawar Valley, is situated at {{the confluence of the}} Swat and Kabul rivers, where three different branches of the River Kabul meet. That specific place is still called Prang (from Prayāga) and considered sacred; local people still bring their dead there for burial. Similar geographical characteristics are found at site of Prang in Kashmir and at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna, where the sacred city of Prayag is situated, west of Benares. There are some legends in which the two rivers are said to be joined <b>here</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> underground Sarasvati River, forming a triveṇī, a confluence of three rivers. However, Rigvedic texts, and modern research, suggest that the path of the Sarasvati River was very different. It ended in the ocean at Kachchh in modern Gujrat and not at Prayag. The Gandharan city of Taxila was an important Buddhist and Hindu centre of learning from the 5th century BC to the 2nd century.|$|E
25|$|Some of the city's {{historic}} pubs and winehouses {{are located}} in the areas around İstiklal Avenue (İstiklal Caddesi) in Beyoğlu. The 19th century Çiçek Pasajı (literally Flower Passage in Turkish, or Cité de Péra in French, opened in 1876) on İstiklal Avenue can be described as a miniature version of the famous Galleria in Milan, Italy, and has rows of historic pubs, winehouses and restaurants. The site of Çiçek Pasajı was originally occupied by the Naum Theatre, which was burned during the great fire of Pera in 1870. The theatre was frequently visited by Sultans Abdülaziz and Abdülhamid II, and hosted Giuseppe Verdi's play Il Trovatore before the opera houses of Paris. After the fire of 1870, the theatre was purchased by the local Greek banker Hristaki Zoğrafos Efendi, and architect Kleanthis Zannos designed the current building, which was called Cité de Péra or Hristaki Pasajı in its early years. Yorgo'nun Meyhanesi (Yorgo's Winehouse) was the first winehouse to be opened in the passage. In 1908 the Ottoman Grand Vizier Sait Paşa purchased the building, and it became known as the Sait Paşa Passage. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, many impoverished noble Russian women, including a Baroness, sold flowers <b>here.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> 1940s the building was mostly occupied by flower shops, hence the present Turkish name Çiçek Pasajı (Flower Passage). Following the restoration of the building in 1988, it was reopened as a galleria of pubs and restaurants.|$|E

500|$|All {{languages}} structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages {{differ in}} the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the nominative-accusative word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown <b>here</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> nominative pronoun I. Some languages, called ergative, Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as [...] "I run", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of [...] "me run". Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun [...] "I" [...] be used. In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the tripartite type.|$|E
