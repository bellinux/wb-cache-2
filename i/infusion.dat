40|$|Intra-septal <b>infusions</b> of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist {{muscimol}} impair {{learning and}} memory {{in a variety}} of tasks. This experiment determined whether hippocampal or entorhinal <b>infusions</b> of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine would reverse such impairing effects on spontaneous alternation performance, a measure of spatial working memory. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given intra-septal <b>infusions</b> of vehicle or muscimol (1 nmole/ 0. 5 μL) combined with unilateral intra-hippocampal or intra-entorhinal <b>infusions</b> of vehicle or physostigmine (10 μg/μL for the hippocampus; 7. 5 μg/μL or 1. 875 μg/ 0. 25 μL for the entorhinal cortex). Fifteen minutes later, spontaneous alternation performance was assessed. The results indicated that intra-septal <b>infusions</b> of muscimol significantly decreased percentage-of-alternation scores, whereas intra-hippocampal or intra-entorhinal <b>infusions</b> of physostigmine had no effect. More importantly, intra-hippocampal or intra-entorhinal <b>infusions</b> of physostigmine, at doses that did not influence performance when administered alone, completely reversed the impairing effects of the muscimol <b>infusions.</b> These findings indicate that increasing cholinergic levels in the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex is sufficient to reverse the impairing effects of septal GABA receptor activation and support the hypothesis that the impairing effects of septal GABAergic activity involve cholinergic processes in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex...|$|R
40|$|Septal <b>infusions</b> of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A agonist {{muscimol}} impair memory, and {{the effect}} likely involves the hippocampus. GABAA receptors are present on the perikarya of cholinergic and GABAergic septo-hippocampal (SH) projections. The current experiments determined whether GABAergic SH projections {{are involved in the}} memory-impairing effects of septal GABAA receptor activation. Experiment 1 tested whether combining septal co-infusions of subeffective doses of muscimol with scopolamine, a drug that selectively influences GABA SH projections, would produce memory deficits. Experiment 2 tested whether hippocampal <b>infusions</b> of a GABAA receptor antagonist would block the effects of septal muscimol <b>infusions.</b> Fifteen minutes prior to assessing spontaneous alternation (SA) or training in a multiple trial inhibitory avoidance (CMIA) task, male Sprague-Dawley rats were given septal <b>infusions</b> of vehicle, muscimol, scopolamine, or co-infusions of muscimol with scopolamine, or septal <b>infusions</b> of vehicle or muscimol combined with hippocampal <b>infusions</b> of vehicle or bicuculline. Septal co-infusions of muscimol with scopolamine significantly impaired SA and CMIA. Hippocampal bicuculline <b>infusions</b> blocked deficits produced by septal muscimol <b>infusions</b> in SA and attenuated deficits produced in CMIA. Combined, these findings suggest that GABAergic SH projections are involved in the memory-impairing effects of septal GABA receptor activation...|$|R

40|$|Forty early {{lactation}} Holstein cows {{were assigned}} to four groups of a 2 x 2 factorial design with two nutritional backgrounds (normal and ketosis-susceptible) and two levels of glucagon (0 and 10 mg/d from 21 to 35 days postpartum) to study the regulation of glucose metabolism. In normal cows, plasma glucagon and glucose concentrations increased by about 6 -fold and 10 mg/dl, respectively, during glucagon <b>infusions,</b> but plasma nonesterified fatty acids, [beta]-hydroxybutyrate, and urea nitrogen did not changed. Liver glycogen decreased at d 2 of glucagon <b>infusions,</b> but it was restored by d 7 and increased to 169 % of baseline at 3 d after cessation of <b>infusions.</b> Milk and milk protein yield, but not milk lactose yield, decreased during glucagon <b>infusions.</b> Concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA decreased during wk 1 of glucagon <b>infusions,</b> when endogenous insulin secretion increased. In susceptible cows, which had fatty liver and less plasma insulin, glucagon <b>infusions</b> increased plasma glucagon and glucose about 8 -fold and 17 mg/dl, respectively, but affected neither PEPCK mRNA nor insulin. Concentrations of PEPCK mRNA were greater overall in susceptible controls than in normal controls;In another experiment with mid-lactation cows, 3. 5 -h <b>infusions</b> of glucagon at 15 mg/d increased plasma insulin and glucose, but decreased plasma nonesterified fatty acids. PEPCK mRNA decreased 41 %, but pyruvate carboxylase mRNA increased 50 % {{by the end of}} <b>infusions,</b> and fructose 1, 6 hisphosphatase mRNA did not change. Liver glycogen decreased an actual value of 2. 1 %, and two thirds of the decrease occurred during the first 0. 75 h of glucagon <b>infusions.</b> The results indicate that glucagon <b>infusions</b> cause an initial net glycogenolysis, but later increase net glycogen synthesis. Long-term glucagon <b>infusions</b> also were suggested to increase gluconeogenesis. We concluded that PEPCK gene expression in normal cows is down-regulated potently by insulin to offset increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis during glucagon <b>infusions.</b> PEPCK gene expression in susceptible cows may be different from that in normal cows, but probably is not involved in the pathogenesis of bovine ketosis.

40|$|Previous {{findings}} indicate that the noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic innervations of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) modulate memory consolidation. The current study investigated whether memory enhancement induced by post-training intra-BLA <b>infusions</b> of a β-adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic agonist requires concurrent activation of dopamine (DA) receptors in the BLA. Rats with implanted BLA cannulae were trained on an inhibitory avoidance (IA) task and, 48 h later, tested for retention. <b>Infusions</b> of the β-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol into the right BLA, but not the left, enhanced retention, and concurrent <b>infusions</b> of the nonspecific DA receptor antagonist cis-Flupenthixol (Flu) blocked the enhancement. Post-training <b>infusions</b> of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine into the right BLA also enhanced retention, and concurrent <b>infusions</b> of Flu blocked this effect. Additional experiments investigated whether memory modulation was lateralized to the right BLA. Post-training DA <b>infusions</b> into the right BLA, but not the left, enhanced retention. Post-training <b>infusions</b> of lidocaine or muscimol, which impair retention when infused bilaterally, had no effect when infused unilaterally into either the right or left BLA. These findings, together with earlier work, suggest that the dopaminergic system in the BLA is critically involved in memory modulation induced by noradrenergic and cholinergic influences.

We used this technique to measure the thermic responses to insulin and glucose <b>infusions</b> in 120 glucose-tolerant Pima Indians, a population with a high prevalence of obesity. During high-dose insulin <b>infusions</b> (400 mU/m 2 per min) the measured increase in energy expenditure (MEE), 150 +/- 6 cal/min, was greater than the predicted increase in energy expenditure (PEE), 72 +/- 2 cal/min, for glucose storage as glycogen. During low-dose insulin <b>infusions</b> (40 mU/m 2 per min) the mean MEE, 6 +/- 5 cal/min, was not significantly different from zero and was not greater than the mean PEE, 9 +/- 1 cal/min.
