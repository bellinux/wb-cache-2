It was completed by 1836, beginning its first operations on March 14 of that year. The B had reached Harpers Ferry in 1834. A final rail connection with the B was completed in January 1837 when the Winchester and Potomac was connected by the first B Railroad Bridge completed across the Potomac River, tying the lines together in a junction on the Virginia side of the river. This was also the first ever intersection of two railroads in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{relation}} ship between intra-metropolitan location, {{research and development}} (R&D) and the outsourcing of production is analysed to determ ine differen ces in, and the supportive character of, intra-metropolitan areas for high-technology production. Madrid’s electron ics industries have shown a remarkable resilien ce, {{in the face of}} extensive economic restructuring and the change in trade regim es that has accompanied continental integration. Much of the strength of the electron ics sector may have been due to the metropolitan area ’ s support for outsourcing, and the creative specialisation that it facilitat ed. The distribution of manufacturing <b>estab</b> lishments, their local sourcing character istics, industrial district or agglom-eration effects, and the role of R&D are evaluated to determ ine the intra-metropolitan context of production. Extensive statistic al analyses of the {{relation ship}} between R&D and productive perform ance, with variou s indicators of capital, costs, revenues and scale, are undertaken with <b>estab</b> lishment-level survey data. These analyses provide conclusive evidence of the in ¯ uence of intra-metropolitan location on R&D and internal organ isation. 1...|$|E
