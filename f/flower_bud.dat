25|$|The trees {{themselves}} can usually tolerate temperatures to around , although the following season's flower buds are usually killed at these temperatures, preventing a crop that summer. <b>Flower</b> <b>bud</b> death begins to occur between , {{depending on the}} cultivar and on {{the timing of the}} cold, with the buds becoming less cold tolerant in late winter.|$|E
25|$|Numerous seeds {{develop in}} hairy follicles over the {{following}} months. Orites revolutus may be heavily infested by the seed parasite Symphygas nephaula, which lays its eggs in the developing <b>flower</b> <b>bud</b> before the seed pods have formed. After hatching, the larvae feed on the maturing seeds as they become available. Orites revolutus is a preferred host for this tortricid moth borer as compared to O. acicularis, which has a heavily overlapping range, and plants at lower altitudes {{are more likely to}} become infested. It is thought that this parasite {{may be the most important}} agent of predispersal seed loss in the plant.|$|E
25|$|Adult weevils overwinter in well-drained {{areas in}} or near cotton fields after diapause. They emerge and enter cotton fields from early spring through midsummer, with peak {{emergence}} in late spring, and feed on immature cotton bolls. The female lays about 200 eggs over a 10- to 12-day period. The oviposition leaves wounds on {{the exterior of the}} <b>flower</b> <b>bud.</b> The eggs hatch in 3 to 5 days within the cotton squares (larger buds before flowering), feed for 8 to 10 days, and finally pupate. The pupal stage lasts another 5 to 7 days. The lifecycle from egg to adult spans about three weeks during the summer. Under optimal conditions, 8 to 10 generations per season may occur.|$|E
40|$|The {{developmental}} {{stage of the}} <b>flower</b> <b>buds</b> of Pharbitis nil, cv, Violet was determined, {{and the effects of}} external conditions and exogenous gibberellin A 3 (GA 3) or abscisic acid (ABA) following a single flower-inducing dark period on their development were examined with axillary <b>flower</b> <b>buds</b> formed on the third node which were referred to as the first <b>flower</b> <b>buds</b> and with the terminal <b>flower</b> <b>buds</b> on the main stem. 1. The stage of development of the <b>flower</b> <b>buds</b> was represented by floral scores from 0 (vegetative bud) to 10 (petal unfurling). 2. Under continuous white-light of fluorescent lamps the first and terminal <b>flower</b> <b>buds</b> developed rapidly to the carpel initiation and carpel development, respectively. Thereafter, these <b>flower</b> <b>buds</b> hardly developed. The rate and pattern of development of these <b>flower</b> <b>buds</b> were not affected by the different lengths of the flower-inductive dark periods of 12 -, 14 - and 16 -h, all of which caused the initiation of <b>flower</b> <b>buds.</b> 3. Exposure to short days caused both the first and terminal <b>flower</b> <b>buds</b> to develop further, where development of the formers preceded that of the latters. However, exposure to long days consisting of either continuous light or interruption of the dark period by light, inhibited or retarded the subsequent development of both the first and terminal <b>flower</b> <b>buds,</b> where development of the formers was retarded earlier than that of the latters. 4. The higher the light intensity, the more promoted the early development of both the first and terminal <b>flower</b> <b>buds.</b> 5. At 30 ℃ the first <b>flower</b> <b>buds</b> ceased their early development. The terminal <b>flower</b> <b>buds</b> reverted earlier to vegetative buds. At 20 ℃ both the <b>flower</b> <b>buds</b> continued to develop slowly later on. 6. Exogenous GA 3 promoted the early development of the terminal <b>flower</b> <b>buds.</b> However, ABA inhibited the early development of both the first and terminal <b>flower</b> <b>buds.</b> These findings are discussed in relation to development of the lower axillary and terminal <b>flower</b> <b>buds.</b> アサガオ，品種Violetの幼植物における， 1 回の花成誘導暗期によって形成された主茎上の第 3 節位の腋生花芽 （初生花）と頂生の花芽（頂花）の両者の発達に及ぼす花成誘導後の各種の外的要因，および外生ジベレリンA 3 （GA 3 ）とアブシジン酸（ABA）の影響を調べた。 1 ．花芽の発達を， 0 （栄養芽）および 1 （花芽の分化）から 10 （花弁の展開）までの段階で示した。 2 ．昼色螢光灯の連続照明下で，初生花は心皮の形成段階，頂花は心皮の発達段階までそれぞれ急速に発達した。し かしその後，両者の発達は遅くなるか，あるいは停止した。この花芽の発達の速度と形式は，花成誘導暗期の長さに （ 12 ， 14 ， 16 時間）影響されなかった。 3 ．短日条件下では，初生花及び頂花は花弁の展開まで連続的に発達した。この際，初生花が，頂花より優先的に発 達した。これに対して，連続照明及び暗期の光中断による長日条件下では，心皮の形成と発達段階まで急速に発達す るが，それ以後の発達は遅くなった。この際，初生花の発達抑制が頂花より早く起った。 4 ．照射光の光度が強いほど，初生花及び頂花の初期発達は促進された。 5 ． 20 ℃では，初生花及び頂花の発達は緩慢であるが，連続的に進行した。これに対して， 30 ℃では初生花の発達 は早期に停止し，頂花は栄養芽に戻った。 6 ．GA 3 は，頂花の初期発達を促進した。ABAは，初生花と頂花の両者の発達を抑制した。 上記の実験結果から，アサガオにおける下位節の腋生花芽と頂生花芽の相互の発達形式について考察した...|$|R

500|$|The {{concert was}} divided into four parts: Equestrian, Bedouin, GlamPunk and Disco. The Equestrian segment of the show began with images of Madonna, riding crop in hand, and horses cantering across windswept plains on the big screens. A giant disco ball was then lowered onstage, and opened like a <b>flower</b> <b>bud</b> to reveal Madonna inside. As she took her dancers' reins, she {{performed}} [...] "Future Lovers/I Feel Love". This was followed by [...] "Get Together" [...] backed by her dancers in horse reins. She rode a carousel horse-like dancepole during [...] "Like a Virgin". The backdrops displayed the X-Ray of Madonna's broken bones, which she had during a previous accident. [...] "Jump" [...] followed this performance, where the dancers displayed the physical discipline parkour. After Madonna disappeared backstage, three of her dancers then revealed personal tragedies during an interlude called [...] "Confessions". The second segment titled Bedouin started with Madonna appearing on a mirrored crucifix to sing [...] "Live to Tell" [...] as a death toll of African AIDS victims counted down onscreen above her. She stepped down off the cross to perform [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] where two male dancers intertwined each other while displaying religious symbolism on the screens like blood corpuscles connecting to form symbols of hope and unity. Madonna brought a guest vocalist from her Confessions on a Dance Floor album onstage for [...] "Isaac", when a female dancer in an oversized Middle-Eastern burka danced within a cage with the backdrops displaying sand dunes. Madonna then recreated the dance-off scene from her [...] "Sorry" [...] music video live with her troupe for her performance of the song. The performance {{was followed by the}} song [...] "Like It Or Not" [...] where burlesque-style dancing was performed by Madonna {{with the help of a}} chair as a prop. After the performance, her dancers performed krump dancing for a remix interlude of [...] "Sorry" [...] as social, political, and ecological images flashed onscreens.|$|E

2500|$|In 1777, on Cook's third expedition, David Nelson {{collected}} a eucalypt on Bruny Island in southern Tasmania. This specimen {{was taken to}} the British Museum in London, and was named Eucalyptus obliqua by the French botanist L'Héritier, who was working in London at the time. He coined the generic name from the Greek roots eu and calyptos, meaning [...] "well" [...] and [...] "covered" [...] in reference to the operculum of the <b>flower</b> <b>bud</b> which protects the developing flower parts as the flower develops and is shed by the pressure of the emerging stamens at flowering. It was most likely an accident that L'Héritier chose a feature common to all eucalypts.|$|E
2500|$|Magnolia is {{an ancient}} genus. Appearing before bees did, the flowers are theorized to have evolved to {{encourage}} pollination by beetles. To avoid damage from pollinating beetles, the carpels of Magnolia flowers are extremely tough. [...] Fossilised specimens of M. acuminata have been found dating to 20 million years ago, and of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae date to 95 million years ago. Another aspect of Magnolia considered to represent an ancestral state is that the <b>flower</b> <b>bud</b> is enclosed in a bract rather than in sepals; the perianth parts are undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals. Magnolia shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering plants near {{the base of the}} flowering plant lineage such as Amborella and Nymphaea (as well as with many more recently derived plants such as Lilium).|$|E
