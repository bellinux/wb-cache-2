50|$|In naval terminology, the <b>deckplate</b> can roughly {{refer to}} the deck ("flooring"), or {{the area of the}} deck of a ship or boat (submarine). It can also {{refer to the}} Division Officer and chief petty officer leadership. The term <b>deckplate</b> leaders is a colloquial term {{referring}} to the senior enlisted personnel of the rate of chief petty officer and higher. They are generally charged with keeping good order and discipline within the lower enlisted rates.|$|E

5000|$|In the U.S. Navy, both {{commissioned}} {{officers and}} Chief Petty Officers are often colloquially {{referred to as}} [...] "khakis". In the past, commissioned officers and chief petty officers wore khaki-colored uniforms while onboard seagoing vessels, in direct contrast to petty officers and seamen, who were referred to as <b>deckplate</b> sailors, or blueshirts. However, since 2009, while khakis are still worn ashore, the U.S. Navy has begun using a blue and gray camouflage working uniform which replaced the khaki-colored ones worn by commissioned officers and chief petty officers on board ships, and also adopted a new service uniform for petty officers and seamen in pay grades E-6 and below, consisting of a khaki shirt and black trousers. The latter has caused some discontent among some chief petty officers and commissioned officers as a result. In the U.S. Coast Guard, petty officers, chief petty officers, warrant officers, and commissioned officers all wear similar uniforms.|$|E

Two pre-production examples of these Ship in a Bottle ships are known to exist (Spanish ship #135 Castigue, and Pirate ship #136 Blue Heron), though both are missing <b>deckplates</b> and as such are incomplete for actual game play purposes.|$|R
5000|$|A {{lift table}} is a device that employs a {{scissors}} mechanism to raise or lower goods and/or persons. Typically lift tables are used to raise large, heavy loads through relatively small distances. Common applications include pallet handling, vehicle loading and work positioning. Lift tables are a recommended way to help reduce incidents of musculoskeletal disorders [...] by correctly re-positioning work at a suitable height for operators. Lift tables lend themselves to being easily adapted to a specific use. They can work in hostile environments, be manufactured in stainless steel and have equipment like conveyors, turn-tables, barriers and gates easily added to their <b>deckplates.</b>|$|R
40|$|How NPS {{helped my}} Navy M&S career: "The Naval Postgraduate School {{provided}} the technical, analytical, research {{and critical thinking}} skills I required to excel as the Navigation, Seamanship, and Shiphandling Simulation Program Manage at the U. S. Navy's Shiphandling Center of Excellence, the Surface Warfare Officers School. No prgogram other than NPS' Modeling, Virtual Environments and Simulation (MOVES) curriculum provides such {{a full range of}} topics, skills, and joint service institutional knowledge required by the Department of Defense Modeling & Simulation practitioner, nor could have prepared me as thoroughly to hit the <b>deckplates</b> running in my current assignment. I am directly involved in influencing and shaping current and future shiphandling simulator training, programs, and system acquisition decisions that benefit our surface forces. The returns on investment of my education and friendships forged in the MOVES program have been substantial. No doubt about it, this degree delivers!"US Navy (USN) autho...|$|R

Individual components of AEW system like Fuselage, Pylon and <b>Deckplate</b> {{have been identified as}} substructures. The substructue models have been verified through simple analysis checks. The results of the analysis under realistic loads will be provided in the subsequent parts of the report. ...|$|E
40|$|The Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) {{mission will}} be the first of the new Mediumclass Explorer (MIDEX) {{missions}} to fly. Led by Southwest Research Institute with oversight from the Explorers Project Office at NASA GSFC, IMAGE is the first satellite mission dedicated to imaging the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s magnetosphere. IMAGE will utilize a combination of ultraviolet and neutral atom imaging instruments plus an RF sounder to map and image the temporal and spatial features of the magnetosphere. The eight science sensors are mounted to a single <b>deckplate.</b> The <b>deckplate</b> is enveloped in an eight-sided spacecraft bus, 225 cm across the flats, developed by Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space Corporation. Constructed of laminated aluminum honeycomb panels, covered extensively by Gallium Arsenide solar cells, the spacecraft structure is designed to withstand the launch loads of a Delta 7326 - 9. 5 ELV. Attitude control is via a single magnetic torque rod and passive nutation damper with aspect information provided by a star camera, sun sensor, and three-axis magnetometer. A single S-band transponder provides telemetry and command functionality. Interfaces between the self-contained payload and the spacecraft are limited to MIL-STD- 1553 and power. This paper describes the IMAGE mission as well as the engineering details of the spacecraft...|$|E

It also inspired him to speak up for those officers who aren’t afforded duty time to pursue their educatio...|$|E
5000|$|A {{total of}} eight {{individual}} airtight chambers comprise the F470. The main hull or gunwale contains five intercommunicating chambers, which {{are separated by}} internal baffles and valves. This means that a single leak will not result in loss of pressure throughout the boat, and that air can be bled between chambers to compensate for loss in one. Two additional chambers, located below the gunwale on either side and called [...] "speed skags," [...] provide cushioning for the boat's occupants and additional buoyancy in case of pressure loss in the hull. The final chamber is an inflatable keel tube which runs {{the length of the}} craft and gives the bottom of the hull a [...] "V" [...] shape, imparting directional stability and additional shock absorption. A wooden [...] "transom" [...] board at the stern provides a mounting point for the outboard engine(s). The deck (floor) is composed of four interlocking aluminum plates, which are fixed to the [...] "thrust board" [...] at the bow end and the transom at the stern. This rigid structure, spanning the entire internal area of the boat, prevents the hull from collapsing or [...] "taco-ing" [...] under power.A ready-for-use craft includes an outboard engine (two in some configurations); removable aluminium <b>deckplates</b> or roll-up slatted decking; paddles; a bow line for securing the docked boat and a [...] "righting" [...] line which is used to flip the boat in the event of capsizing. At the bow of the boat are storage bags for equipment (foot pumps, extra lines, etc.) and a special fuel bladder, which can be of either 6- or 18-gallon capacity and which feeds the engine via a flexible hose. Deflated and rolled up, the boat and all necessary equipment can easily fit into the bed of a small pickup. Most military CRRC's use a [...] two-stroke engine with a pumpjet propulsor, which consists of a shrouded impeller. This design reduces the risk of serious injury to personnel in the water when compared to the traditional open propeller. It also reduces the risk of the propulsion system being seriously damaged by submerged objects.|$|R
