40|$|Glass block, {{a widely}} used {{building}} material in American architecture during the 1930 s, {{is made from}} two molded pieces of glass that have been annealed together and contain a hollow center. Glass block became a fixture in Streamline Moderne buildings, often comprising entire walls or dramatic curved corners, and also was used for planar, infill material in Modern buildings. The Owens-Illinois Glass Company {{was the first to}} begin mass production of <b>glass</b> <b>block</b> <b>in</b> the U. S. in 1932, and its competitor, Pittsburgh Corning Corporation, began large-scale production of <b>glass</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> 1938. The material was featured at the 1933 - 1934 Chicago Century of Progress International Exhibition, and later at the 1939 New York World’s Fair. Glass block was a well-marketed product which boasted numerous qualities, including light transmissivity, multitude of patterns and styles, insulation properties, strength, and adaptability, to name a few. The thesis will discuss a history of glass block, how the material was used in buildings, and examine the influence of the material on architectural designs of the 1930 s and later. The purpose of this work is to expand upon an under-researched building material, and how its history fits into, and impacted, the larger history of American architecture. A chronological timeline of glass block development and some of the most influential buildings and events related to the material will provide the framework for the thesis. In addition to this chronological framework, a discussion of important themes, ideas, and trends <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> <b>block</b> will supplement the history. Some important themes include: glass block’s ability to build walls of light; glass block as a symbol of progress and modernity; the two aesthetic paths of the <b>glass</b> <b>block</b> use <b>in</b> the 1930 s; the illumination of glass block and its use as advertisement; and the material’s rise and fall in popularity...|$|R

30|$|It {{also could}} be seen that foam <b>glass</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> both {{the first and second}} group {{experienced}} no significant change in weight as well as appearance. This indicated the immersion in acid condensation or the exposure to cyclic wet-dry conditions had no significant effect on foam glass blocks. The minimal corrosion rates were 0.0580 and 0.0583  mm/y, denoting that foam glass blocks were very stable and were not selective to the outer environments. The excellent corrosion resistance could be explained by the protective silicon dioxide (SiO 2) and boron trioxide (B 2 O 3) layer formed above the surface during the experimental process (Soo Park et al. 1999). Obviously, simultaneous accumulation of SiO 2 and B 2 O 3 led to comparatively less loss of foam glass blocks on the glass surface.|$|R

The critical considerations for constructing path-length imbalanced full-field interferometers for these and similar applications are discussed, expressions are derived for key calculations and interferograms from example interferometers are presented. These include the concept of balancing the infinity-spaces of the two arms via the use of a glass block to minimise the optical path difference variation across the interferogram and ensure adequate sampling of the fringes on the detector. Further, the use of tilted <b>glass</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> single-pass and double-pass arrangements is detailed for the generation and control of spatial carrier fringes without extensive realignment of the interferometer, and for phase shifting...|$|R

40|$|In {{the period}} between {{the two world wars}} the {{construction}} and urban expansion of the city of Salerno constituted the opportunity for the transition from traditional masonry buildings to reinforced concrete structure, through countless intermediate technology solutions with the use of mixed and sometimes particularly original techniques. Camillo Guerra, head of the municipal engineer from 1928 to 1934, was one of the protagonists of this productive period and the construction of the City Hall, entrusted to him, is particularly emblematic for the choices related to the construction techniques and materials. The result is a building with a complex technological interpretation, where the masonry is integrated with concrete beams, iron, bricks of various types, slab ribbed floor, sometimes with elements <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> <b>block</b> which at the time were considered to be particularly innovative.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of cracks <b>in</b> layered <b>glass</b> from low-velocity impact of sharp or spherical tip projectiles is observed using high-speed photography. Tests are also {{carried out to}} determine the threshold impact energy for chipping <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> <b>blocks</b> and subsurface crack instability <b>in</b> an edge-supported <b>glass</b> plates. The results identify the median and subsurface radial crack systems as the prime damage sources in such applications. A dynamic fracture analysis is developed assuming elastic contact and quasi-static load transfer between target and projectile. The equation of motion of the latter is solved analytically taking into consideration localized elastic contact and plastic penetration of the tool into the material as well as flexural deformations. The growth history of the median crack is then found using an appropriate relationship between crack length and contact load. The predicted crack propagation history of the median crack and the threshold impact energy for chipping or flexure-induced subsurface crack instability compare well with the tests. The analysis explicitly exposes the role of projectile mass, bluntness and velocity, the target's stiffness, toughness and hardness, and the interface critical stress on damage tolerance of well-bonded layered structures...|$|R
40|$|A Layer-by-Layer (LBL) (layer-by-layer) {{manufactured}} {{material is}} examined {{in detail in}} this thesis. Improvements are made to the method of its manufacture. Efforts are made to understand its fracture mechanisms {{and take advantage of}} these fracture mechanisms in the absorption of impact energy. A novel series of experiments has been performed on LBL manufactured thin films to demonstrate their unique fracture mechanisms. Polyurethane/Poly(Acrylic Acid) (PU/PAA) and PU/PAA/(PU/Clay) 5 nanocomposite films readily undergo Interlaminar mode II fracture, because of the relatively weak elctrostatic bonds between monolayers. Tensile tests performed while under observation by a scanning electron microscope demonstrate the tendency of these nanocomposite films to undergo interlaminar mode II fracture even when loads are applied in the plane of nanocomposite film. It is concluded that these mechanisms of energy dissipation are responsible for the enhanced toughness of these films when used as layers between <b>glass</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> the prevention of impact damage to the glass. A novel automated manufacturing facility has been designed and built to deposit large sheets of Layer-by-Layer nanocomposite film. These large sheets are incorporated into a borosillicate <b>glass</b> composite <b>in</b> order to compare the ballistic characteristics of LBL PU based nanocomposite films to a single cast layer of polyurethane. It is demonstrated that shear fracture is the mode of failure <b>in</b> the <b>blocks</b> containing the nanocomposite film. The shear fracture surface in the nanocomposite after it has undergone a ballistic impact is characterized. Additional experiments are performed to characterize the interlaminar fracture stresses and toughnesses of the nanocomposite LBL layers, to assist in the implementation of a numerical crack band model that describes the nanocomposite film. The computational model predicts the failure of the ballistic nanocomposite samples, and the predicted V 50 velocity is found to be in good agreement with experimental results...|$|R

40|$|A {{criterion}} {{of the energy}} efficiency of iron–boron–silicon metallic <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> sulfuric acid solutions is proposed for the first time. The criterion has been derived based on calculating the limit of the ratio value of the conductivity of a metallic <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> aqueous solution to the conductivity of the metallic <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> air. In other words, the conductivity ratio of a metallic <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> aqueous solution to the conductivity of the metallic <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> air[*][*]=[*] 1, was applied to determine the energy efficiency of the metallic <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> the aqueous solution when the conductivity of a metallic <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> air became equal (decreased) to the steady conductivity of the metallic <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> aqueous solution {{as a function of}} time of the exposure of the metallic glass to the aqueous solution. This criterion was not only used to determine the energy efficiency of different metallic glasses, but also, the criterion was used to determine the energy efficiency of metallic glasses exposed {{to a wide range of}} sulfuric acid concentrations. These conductivity values were determined by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In addition, the criterion can be applied under diverse test conditions with a predetermined period of the operational life of the metallic glasses as functional materials. Furthermore, variations of the energy efficiency of the metallic glasses as a function of the acid concentration and time were produced by fitting the experimental data to a numerical model using a nonlinear regression method. The profiles of the metallic glasses exhibit a less conservative behavior of the energy efficiency than the proposed analytical criterion...|$|R
