5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a <b>ferritic</b> and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy <b>ferritic</b> steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steels {{contain a}} minimum of 11% chromium, often {{combined}} with nickel, to resist corrosion. Some stainless steels, such as the <b>ferritic</b> stainless steels are magnetic, while others, such as the austenitic, are nonmagnetic. Corrosion-resistant steels are abbreviated as CRES.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the most}} {{commonly}} used crystal lattice structures in metals are the body-centred cubic, face-centred cubic and close-packed hexagonal. <b>Ferritic</b> steel has a body-centred cubic structure and austenitic steel, non-ferrous metals like aluminum, copper and nickel have the face-centred cubic structure.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum is also {{valued in}} steel alloys for its high {{corrosion}} resistance and weldability. Molybdenum contributes corrosion resistance to type-300 stainless steels (specifically type-316) and especially {{so in the}} so-called superaustenitic stainless steels (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO or 1925hMo). Molybdenum increases lattice strain, thus increasing the energy required to dissolve iron atoms from the surface. Molybdenum {{is also used to}} enhance the corrosion resistance of <b>ferritic</b> (for example grade 444) and martensitic (for example 1.4122 and 1.4418) stainless steels.|$|E
5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in <b>ferritic</b> steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
25|$|Salt bath <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing is {{also known}} as liquid <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing or liquid nitrocarburizing and {{is also known}} by the trademarked names Tufftride and Tenifer.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the naming}} {{the process is}} a {{modified}} form of nitriding and not carburizing. The shared attributes of this class {{of this process is}} the introduction of nitrogen and carbon in the <b>ferritic</b> state of the material. The processes are broken up into four main classes: gaseous, salt bath, ion or plasma, or fluidized-bed. The trade name and patented processes may vary slightly from the general description, but they are all a form of <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing.|$|E
25|$|Gaseous <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing is {{also known}} as {{controlled}} nitrocarburizing, soft nitriding, and vacuum nitrocarburizing or by the tradenames Nitrotec, Nitemper, Deganit, Triniding, Corr-I-Dur, Nitroc, NITREG-C and Nitrowear, Nitroneg. The process works to achieve the same result as the salt bath process, except gaseous mixtures are used to diffuse the nitrogen and carbon into the workpiece.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{cleaning}} issues the Joseph Lucas Limited company began experimenting with gaseous forms of <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing {{in the late}} 1950s. The company applied for a patent by 1961. It produced a similar surface finish as the Sulfinuz process {{with the exception of}} the formation of sulfides. The atmosphere consisted of ammonia, hydrocarbon gases, and a small amount of other carbon-containing gases.|$|E
25|$|The company's founder, {{engineer}} Gaston Glock, had {{no experience}} with firearms design or manufacture at the time their first pistol, the Glock 17, was being prototyped. Glock did, however, have extensive experience in advanced synthetic polymers, knowledge of which {{was instrumental in the}} company's design of the first commercially successful line of pistols with a polymer frame. Glock introduced <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing into the firearms industry as an anticorrosion surface treatment for metal gun parts.|$|E
25|$|Between 2005 and 2008 new, lighter fifty-paise, one-, two- and five-rupee coins were introduced, {{made from}} <b>ferritic</b> {{stainless}} steel. The move {{was prompted by}} the melting-down of older coins, whose face value was less than their scrap value. The demonetisation of the 25-(chawanni) paise coin and all paise coins below it took place, and {{a new series of}} coins (50 paise– nicknamed athanni– one, two, five and ten rupees, with the new rupee symbol) were put into circulation in 2011. Coins commonly in circulation are one, two, five and ten rupees. Although it is still legal tender, the 50-paise (athanni) coin is rarely seen in circulation.|$|E
500|$|For GTAW {{of carbon}} and {{stainless}} steels, {{the selection of}} a filler material is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the filler material and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. Preheating is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but low alloy steels may require preheating to slow the cooling process and prevent the formation of martensite in the heat-affected zone. [...] Tool steels should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the heat-affected zone. Austenitic stainless steels do not require preheating, but martensitic and <b>ferritic</b> chromium stainless steels do. A DCEN power source is normally used, and thoriated electrodes, tapered to a sharp point, are recommended. Pure argon is used for thin workpieces, but helium can be introduced as thickness increases.|$|E

There are four main classes of <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing: gaseous, salt bath, ion or plasma, and fluidized-bed.|$|E
2500|$|Glock Ges.m.b.H., an Austrian {{firearms}} manufacturer, {{utilized the}} Tenifer process until 2010, {{to protect the}} barrels and slides of the pistols they manufacture. The finish on a Glock pistol is {{the third and final}} hardening process. [...] It is [...] thick and produces a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating via a [...] nitride bath. [...] The final matte, non-glare finish meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications, is 85% more corrosion resistant than a hard chrome finish, and is 99.9% salt-water corrosion resistant. After the Tenifer process, a black Parkerized finish is applied and the slide is protected even if the finish were to wear off. In 2010 Glock switched to a gaseous <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing process. Besides Glock several other pistol manufacturers, including Smith & Wesson and Springfield Armory, Inc., also use <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing for finishing parts like barrels and slides but they call it Melonite finish. Heckler & Koch use a nitrocarburizing process they refer to as Hostile Environment. Pistol manufacturer Caracal International L.L.C. uses <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing for finishing parts such as barrels and slides with the plasma-based Plasox process.|$|E
2500|$|Plasma-assisted <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing is {{also known}} as ion {{nitriding}}, plasma ion nitriding or glow-discharge nitriding. The process works to achieve the same result as the salt bath and gaseous process, except the reactivity of the media is not due to the temperature but to the gas ionized state. In this technique intense electric fields are used to generate ionized molecules of the gas around the surface to diffuse the nitrogen and carbon into the workpiece. Such highly active gas with ionized molecules is called plasma, naming the technique. The gas used for plasma nitriding is usually pure nitrogen, since no spontaneous decomposition is needed (as is the case of gaseous <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing with ammonia). Due to the relatively low temperature range ( [...] to [...] ) generally applied during plasma-assisted <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing and gentle cooling in the furnace, the distortion of workpieces can be minimized. Stainless steel workpieces can be processed at moderate temperatures (like [...] ) without the formation of chromium nitride precipitates and hence maintaining their corrosion resistance properties.|$|E
2500|$|The first <b>ferritic</b> nitrocarburizing {{methods were}} done at low temperatures, around , in a liquid salt bath. The first company to {{successfully}} commercialize {{the process was}} the Imperial Chemical Industries in Great Britain. ICI called their process [...] "the cassel" [...] due to the plant where it was developed [...] or [...] "Sulfinuz" [...] treatment because it had sulfur in the salt bath. While the process was very successful with high-speed spindles and cutting tools, there were issues with cleaning the solution off {{because it was not}} very water soluble.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the narrow}} range of {{mixtures}} of hydrogen and iron that make an iron hydride at atmospheric pressure, {{a small number of}} different metallurgical structures with different properties can form. At room temperature, the most stable form of pure iron is the body-centerd cubic (BCC) structure called alpha-iron or α-iron. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a very small concentration of hydrogen, no more than 0.0002% at [...] and 0.0004 wt% at [...] The inclusion of hydrogen in alpha iron is called <b>ferritic</b> iron hydride. At [...] pure iron transforms into a face-centred cubic (FCC) structure, called gamma-iron or γ-iron. The inclusion of hydrogen in gamma iron is called austenitic iron hydride. The more open FCC structure of austenitic iron can dissolve somewhat more hydrogen, as much as 0.0009% hydrogen at [...] At this temperature iron transforms into another BCC structure called delta-iron or δ-iron. It can dissolve even more hydrogen, as much as 0.001% hydrogen at , which reflects the upper hydrogen content of iron hydride.|$|E
2500|$|The engine {{operating}} lifetime of 50 hours was severely decreased {{due to the}} shortages of strategic material especially in metals for <b>ferritic</b> heat-resistant steel with addition of silicon or aluminium, that could resist high temperature up to 1700° Celsius. However, with adequate maintenance between the major overhauls, a pilot could expect an engine life of 20–25 hours from the 004's. While BMW's and Junkers' axial compressor turbojet engines were characterised by a sophisticated design that could offer considerable advantage - also used in a generalized form for the contemporary American Westinghouse J30 turbojet - the lack of rare materials for the Jumo 004 design put it at a severe disadvantage compared to the [...] "partly axial-flow" [...] Power Jets W.2/700 turbojet engine which, despite its own largely centrifugal compressor-influenced design (unlike either production German axial-flow jet engine), provided an operational life span of 125 hours. Frank Whittle concludes in his final assessment over the two engines: [...] "it was {{in the quality of}} high temperature materials that the difference between German and British engines was most marked" ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Ferritic</b> {{stainless}} steels generally have better engineering properties than austenitic grades, but have reduced corrosion resistance, {{because of the}} lower chromium and nickel content. They are also usually less expensive. <b>Ferritic</b> {{stainless steels}} have a body-centered cubic crystal system and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little nickel, if any, but some types can contain lead. Most compositions include molybdenum; some, aluminium or titanium. Common <b>ferritic</b> grades include 18Cr-2Mo, 26Cr-1Mo, 29Cr-4Mo, and 29Cr-4Mo-2Ni. These alloys can be degraded {{by the presence of}} sigma chromium, an intermetallic phase which can precipitate upon welding.|$|E
