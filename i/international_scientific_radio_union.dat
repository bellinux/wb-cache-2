The aim is to discuss recent developments, theories and practical applications covering the whole scope of radio-frequency engineering, including radio waves, antennas, propagation, and electromagnetic compatibility. The Local Organizing Committee consisted of scientists from SUPELEC, the University of Mauritius, and the University of Technology, Mauritius. Various members of staff of the University of Mauritius provided help for the organization of the conference. The International <b>Union</b> of <b>Radio</b> Science (URSI) made available technical and financial sponsorship for partial support of young scientists. A number of companies also supported RADIO 2012 ('Platinum': GSMA, ICTA & MMF, 'Gold': CST & FEKO). More than 120 abstracts were submitted to the conference and peer-reviewed by an <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> committee. <b>RADIO</b> 2012 overall featured six oral sessions, one poster session and two workshops. Three internationally recognized scientists delivered keynote speeches during the conference. The two workshops consisted of both regular and invited papers. A call to extended contributions for publication as a volume in the IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) both on-line and in print, was made. Following the call, thirty-three full papers were received and peer-reviewed by the co-editors and the editorial board. Twenty-seven of them were accepted for publication in this volume...|$|R

50|$|Radio Science is a {{quarterly}} peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Wiley-Blackwell {{on behalf of}} the American Geophysical Union and co-sponsored by the International Union of Radio Science. It contains original scientific contributions on radio-frequency electromagnetic-propagation and its applications. Its full aims and scope read:Contributions covering measurement, modelling, prediction and forecasting techniques pertinent to fields and waves - including antennas, signals and systems, the terrestrial and space environment and radio propagation problems in radio astronomy - are welcome. Contributions may address propagation through, interaction with, and remote sensing of structures, geophysical media, plasmas, and materials, as well as the application of radio frequency electromagnetic techniques to remote sensing of the Earth and other bodies in the solar system.Volumes for the years 1966 through 1968 were issued by the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA), the precursor of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in cooperation with the United States National Committee of the <b>International</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>Radio</b> <b>Union,</b> so they are not available from the current publisher.|$|E

30|$|The article {{presents}} {{a survey of}} Russian researchers’ synchronous <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility as {{an element of the}} global system of scientific labor market. Synchronous <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility is a simultaneous holding of scientific positions in institutions located in different countries. The study explores bibliometric data from the Web of Science Core Collection and socio-economic indicators for 56 countries. In order to examine <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility, we use a method of affiliations. The paper introduces a model of synchronous <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility. It enables to specify country’s involvement in the <b>international</b> division of <b>scientific</b> labor. Synchronous <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility is a modern form of the international division of labor in science. It encompasses various forms of part-time, temporary and remote employment of scientists. The analysis reveals the distribution of Russian authors in the space of affiliations, and directions of upward/downward <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility. The bibliometric characteristics of mobile authors are isomorphic to those of receiver country authors. Synchronous <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility of Russian authors is determined by differences in scientific impacts between receiver and donor countries.|$|R
