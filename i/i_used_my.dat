In the moment, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>my</b> positive strength and I got a reward for the passion, the work not only I, but the masseur Mimmo Pezza did together in Rimini. The injury should take one month to heal, Mimmo Pezza helped me be fit in less than half that. I thank this man for a beautiful moment which will be in my heart {{for as long as}} I can remember." [...] Their victory meant Aston Villa gained a place in the 1998–99 UEFA Cup.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} was more guarded with Lennon's next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that [...] "it contains {{a substantial portion}} of good music" [...] but warned of the possibility that [...] "his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant". The album's title track would become an anthem for anti-war movements, while another, [...] "How Do You Sleep?", was a musical attack on McCartney in response to lyrics from Ram that Lennon felt, and McCartney later confirmed, were directed at him and Ono. However, Lennon softened his stance in the mid-1970s and said he had written [...] "How Do You Sleep?" [...] about himself. He said in 1980: [...] "I used my resentment against Paul… to create a song… not a terrible vicious horrible vendetta <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>my</b> resentment and withdrawing from Paul and the Beatles, and the relationship with Paul, to write 'How Do You Sleep'. I don't really go 'round with those thoughts in my head all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and choreographed by Jeri Slaugher. After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued me that this man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this whole world of the '20s and '30s era, and it made me think that he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. I needed to get the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video in my living room. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>my</b> fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as the pool table where I would stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they were doing a movie more than a music video. On June 21, 2006, the music video for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] was premiered on MTV's Total Request Live.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{instructional}} book, Anderson Silva {{admitted the}} influence of taekwondo {{in the formation of}} his unique style.

2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Faith 7 flight {{there were}} mission-threatening {{technical}} problems. During the 19th orbit, the capsule had a power failure. Carbon dioxide levels began rising, and the cabin temperature jumped to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38°C). Cooper turned to his understanding of star patterns, took manual control of the tiny capsule and successfully estimated the correct pitch for re-entry into the atmosphere. Some precision was needed in the calculation, since if the capsule came in too steep, g-forces would be too large, and if its trajectory were too shallow, it would shoot out of the atmosphere again, back into space. Cooper drew lines on the capsule window to help him check his orientation before firing the re-entry rockets. [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>my</b> wrist watch for time," [...] he later recalled, [...] "my eyeballs out the window for attitude. Then I fired my retrorockets at the right time and landed right by the carrier." [...] Cooper's cool-headed performance and piloting skills led to a basic rethinking of design philosophy for later space missions.|$|E

40|$|Research {{is often}} {{commissioned}} {{for the purpose}} of influencing policy and enabling change. Sociologists can play important roles in facilitating the communication of research results and the implementation of change. The help wanted ads seldom advertise such positions, but the need is there. Al-most 20 years ago, a study by the National Academy of Sciences (1978), recommended that more effort be expended on the dissemination and applica-tion of research findings on social problems. That study inspired me to ex-plore related consulting opportunities—and I've been busy ever since, re-sponding to this need and assisting in the process of promoting change. As a consultant in the Washington metropolitan area, I have focused on facilitating the communication of research for various government and pri-vate sector organizations.
