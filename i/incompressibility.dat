25|$|Liquids {{have little}} {{compress}}ibility. Water, for example, will compress by only 46.4 {{parts per million}} for every unit increase in atmospheric pressure (bar). At around 4000 bar (58,000 psi) of pressure, at room temperature, water only experiences an 11% decrease in volume. In the study of fluid dynamics, liquids are often treated as incompressible, especially when studying incompressible flow. This incompressible nature makes a liquid suitable for transmitting hydraulic power, because {{very little of the}} energy is lost in the form of compression. However, the very slight compressibility does lead to other phenomena. The banging of pipes, called water hammer, occurs when a valve is suddenly closed, creating a huge pressure-spike at the valve that travels backward through the system at just under the speed of sound. Another phenomenon caused by liquid's <b>incompressibility</b> is cavitation. Because liquids have little elasticity they can literally be pulled apart in areas of high turbulence or a dramatic change in direction, such as the trailing edge of a boat propeller or a sharp corner in a pipe. A liquid in an area of low pressure (vacuum) vaporizes and forms bubbles, which then collapse as they enter high pressure areas. This causes liquid to fill the cavities left by the bubbles with tremendous localized force, eroding any adjacent solid surface.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Incompressibility</b> {{rules out}} density and {{pressure}} waves like sound or shock waves, so this simplification is not useful if these phenomena are of interest. The incompressible flow assumption typically holds well with all fluids at low Mach numbers (say {{up to about}} Mach 0.3), such as for modelling air winds at normal temperatures. For incompressible (uniform density ρ0) flows the following identity holds: ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{incompressible}} flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and space. [...] Although all real fluids are compressible, a flow is often approximated as incompressible if {{the effect of}} the density changes cause only small changes to the calculated results. This {{is more likely to be}} true when the flow speeds are significantly lower than the speed of sound. Effects of compressibility are more significant at speeds close to or above the speed of sound. [...] The Mach number is used to evaluate whether the <b>incompressibility</b> can be assumed, otherwise the effects of compressibility must be included.|$|E
2500|$|Discretization in {{the space}} {{produces}} a system of ordinary differential equations for unsteady problems and algebraic equations for steady problems. Implicit or semi-implicit methods are generally used to integrate the ordinary differential equations, producing a system of (usually) nonlinear algebraic equations. [...] Applying a Newton or Picard iteration produces a system of linear equations which is nonsymmetric {{in the presence of}} advection and indefinite in the presence of <b>incompressibility.</b> Such systems, particularly in 3D, are frequently too large for direct solvers, so iterative methods are used, either stationary methods such as successive overrelaxation or Krylov subspace methods. Krylov methods such as GMRES, typically used with preconditioning, operate by minimizing the residual over successive subspaces generated by the preconditioned operator.|$|E
2500|$|Steam {{locomotives}} consume {{vast quantities}} of water because they operate on an open cycle, expelling their steam immediately after a single use rather than recycling it in a closed loop as stationary and marine steam engines do. Water was a constant logistical problem, and condensing engines were devised for use in desert areas. These engines had huge radiators in their tenders and instead of exhausting steam out of the funnel it was captured, passed back to the tender and condensed. The cylinder lubricating oil {{was removed from the}} exhausted steam to avoid a phenomenon known as priming, a condition caused by foaming in the boiler which would allow water to be carried into the cylinders causing damage because of its <b>incompressibility.</b> The most notable engines employing condensers (Class 25, the [...] "puffers which never puff") worked across the Karoo desert of South Africa from the 1950s until the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrostatic shock or {{hydraulic}} shock {{is a term}} which describes the observation that a penetrating projectile can produce remote wounding and incapacitating effects in living targets through a hydraulic effect in their liquid-filled tissues, in addition to local effects in tissue caused by direct impact. Just as force applied by a pump in a hydraulic circuit is transmitted throughout the circuit because of the near <b>incompressibility</b> of the liquid, so the kinetic energy of a bullet can sometimes send a shock wave through the body, transferring physical shock to tissues whose physiologic function may be disrupted by it (especially in the circulatory or nervous systems). (Other kinds of shock, namely circulatory and psychological, may follow, but mechanical shock is the immediate disruptor.) There is scientific evidence that hydrostatic shock can produce remote neural damage and produce incapacitation more quickly than blood loss effects. In arguments about the differences in stopping power between calibers and between cartridge models, proponents of cartridges that are [...] "light and fast" [...] (such as the 9×19mm Parabellum) versus cartridges that are [...] "slow and heavy" [...] (such as the [...]45 ACP) often refer to this phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{probabilistic}} method generally shows {{the existence of}} an object with a certain property in a class, the <b>incompressibility</b> method tends to show that the overwhelming majority of objects in the class (the average, or the expectation) have that property. It is sometimes easy to turn a probabilistic proof into an <b>incompressibility</b> proof or vice versa. In some cases, it is difficult or impossible to turn a proof by <b>incompressibility</b> into a probabilistic (or counting proof). In virtually all the cases of Turing-machine time complexity cited above, the <b>incompressibility</b> method solved problems which had been open for decades; no other proofs are known. Sometimes a proof by <b>incompressibility</b> can be turned into a proof by counting, as happened {{in the case of the}} general lower bound on the running time of Shellsort.|$|E

50|$|If {{a number}} of events are {{independent}} (in probability theory) of one another, the probability {{that none of the}} events occur can be easily calculated. If the events are dependent, the problem becomes difficult. Lovász local lemma is a principle that if events are mostly independent of one another and have an individually-small probability, there is a positive probability that none of them will occur. It was proven by the <b>incompressibility</b> method. Using the <b>incompressibility</b> method, several versions of expanders and superconcentrator graphs were shown to exist.|$|E
