Litter bags containing various dual-labelled plant materials were incubated in cylinders inserted in the topsoil of a young ryegrass-clover ley. Disappearance of C- 14 and N- 15 from the litter bag material were studied for 1 year following incubation.

40|$|To {{select a}} target comet for a Comet Nucleus Sample Return Mission (CNSRM) it is {{necessary}} to have an experimental data base to evaluate the extent of diversity and similarity of comets. For example, the physical properties (e. g., low density) of chondritic porous (CP) interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) are believed to resemble these properties of cometary dust although it is yet to be demonstrated that the porous structure of CP IDPs is inherent to presolar dust particles stored in comet nuclei. Porous structures of IDPs could conceivably form during sublimation at the surface of active comet nuclei. Porous structures are also obtained during annealing of amorphous Mg-SiO smokes which initially forms porous aggregates of olivine + platey tridymite and which, upon continued annealing, react to fluffy enstatite aggregates. It is therefore uncertain that CP IDPs are entirely composed of unmetamorphosed presolar dust. Conceivably, new minerals and textures may form <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>in</b> nuclei of active comets as a function of their individual thermal history. Unmetamorphosed comet dust is probably structurally amorphous. Thermal annealing of this dust can produce ultra fine-grained minerals and this ultrafine grain size of CP IDPs should be considered in assessments of aqueous alterations that could affect presolar dust in comet nuclei between 200 and 400 K. Devitrification and hydration may occur <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>in</b> ice-dust <b>mixtures</b> and the mantle of active comet nuclei.

This ability of ILs is now sought for their application in the selective dissolution of cellulose from lignocellulosic biomass, for the manufacture of cellulosic ethanol. However, there are significant knowledge gaps in the understanding of the chemistry of the interaction of biomass and ILs. While imidazolium ILs have been used successfully to dissolve both isolated crystalline cellulose and components of lignocellulosic biomass, phosphonium ILs have not been sufficiently explored for the use in dissolution of lignocellulosic biomass. This thesis reports on the study of the chemistry of sugarcane bagasse with phosphonium ILs. Qualitative and quantitative measurements of biomass components dissolved in the phosphonium ionic liquids (ILs), trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride ([P 66614]Cl) and tributylmethylphosphonium methylsulphate ([P 4441]MeSO 4) are obtained using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR).

40|$|Green state joining of {{structural}} ceramics has shown {{its potential for}} forming large, complex components. In this work, methods of green state joining of silicon carbide using polymer precursors are explored. Pastes containing either polycarbosilane (PCS) or Allylhydridopolycarbosilane (AHPCS) {{are used in the}} joining process. It has been demonstrated that joints formed under external pressure using PCS containing pastes are indistinguishable from the matrix. The Flexural strength of joined samples having a theoretical density (TD) of 94 % is measured to be 312 MPa, which is comparable to that of the control sample with similar density. Unfortunately, applied pressure is necessary for achieving thin, defect-free joints, which might limit wider application of the method. In order to eliminate applied pressure in the joining process, a method of joining SiC using AHPCS containing pastes is investigated. It is discovered that, using AHPCS containing pastes with appropriate SiC addition, crack-free joints can be obtained without applied pressure. Optimum SiC loading in the paste was determined to be in the range of 25 to 35 vol%. Joints formed by AHPCS+(SiC+ 5 wt%B) paste are essentially indistinguishable from the matrix and have an average strength of 323 MPa, comparable to that of the control sample. For better control over the quality of the joints, x-ray tomography has been used to investigate the density variations in SiC joints. The results indicate that the green density of the joints, formed by PCS containing pastes, increases from 54 % to 66 %TD as the applied pressure increases from ambient to 138 MPa. Also, a minimum density difference between the matrix and joint in the green state is achieved when the PCS content in the pastes is around 50 vol%. Furthermore, regions with higher densities are observed at the joint/matrix interfaces, suggesting that the polymer precursor infiltrates into the matrix during the joining process using AHPCS containing pastes.

Thus, a thorough work was carried out in order to answer some questions that are still open about WMA performance in laboratory and <b>in</b> <b>situ.</b> Three bituminous <b>mixtures</b> were studied, namely a conventional HMA control mixture (AC 14 surf 50 / 70), and other two WMA mixtures with the same composition but using binders modified with different additives (a synthetic wax, Sasobit®, and a surfactant, Cecabase®).

During spring, we postulate that isotopic fractionation of am-monium assimilated at concentrations> 20 PM resulted in more negative 615 N values for organic matter fixed by phytoplankton. As algal growth proceeded, the 615 N of seston reached a maximum (+ 1 SY&) because phytoplankton were using a pool of NH,+ enriched in 15 N as a result of previous fractionation during assimilation. Similarly, maximal 813 C values were related to high rates of primary productivity associated with algal growth. Decreased isotopic fractionation occurred at high rates of production, implying that diffusion of CO, across the cell membrane became increas-ingly rate limiting.

Gas hydrates appear to crystallize in sediments from two end-member gas sources (deep allochthonous and <b>in</b> <b>situ)</b> as <b>mixtures</b> of different proportions. In {{an area of}} high gas flux at the Southern Summit of the ridge (Sites 1248 - 1250), shallow (0 - 40 m below the seafloor [mbsf]) gas hydrates are composed of mainly allochthonous mixed microbial and thermogenic methane and {{a small portion of}} thermogenic C 2 + gases, which migrated vertically and laterally from as deep as 2 - to 2. 5 -km depths. In contrast, deep (50 - 105 mbsf) gas hydrates at the Southern Summit (Sites 1248 and 1250) and on the flanks of the ridge (Sites 1244 - 1247) crystallize mainly from microbial methane and ethane generated dominantly <b>in</b> <b>situ.</b> A small contribution of allochthonous gas may also be present at sites where geologic and tectonic settings favor focused vertical gas migration from greater depth (e. g., Sites 1244 and 1245). Non-hydrocarbon gases such as CO 2 and H 2 S are not abundant in sampled hydrates. The new gas geochemical data are inconsistent with earlier models suggesting that seafloor gas hydrates at Hydrate Ridge formed from gas derived from decomposition of deeper and older gas hydrates. Gas hydrate formation at the Southern Summit is explained by a model in which gas migrated from deep sediments, and perhaps was trapped by a gas hydrate seal {{at the base of the}} gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ). Free gas migrated into the GHSZ when the overpressure in gas column exceeded sealing capacity of overlaying sediments, and precipitated as gas hydrate mainly within shallow sediments. The mushroom-like 3 D shape of gas hydrate accumulation at the summit is possibly defined by the gas diffusion aureole surrounding the main migration conduit, the decrease of gas solubility in shallow sediment, and refocusing of gas by carbonate and gas hydrate seals near the seafloor to the crest of the local anticline structure...|$|R

Results from field studies, however, are inconsistent: Some showing that coexisting plant species predominantly utilize inorganic N, while others reveal distinct interspecies preferences for different N forms. As a result, {{the extent to which}} hypothetical niches are realized in nature remains unclear. Here, we used <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> stable isotope tracer techniques to test the idea, in temperate grassland, that niche partitioning of N based on chemical form is related to plant productivity and the relative availability of organic and inorganic N. We also tested <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> whether grassland plants vary in their ability to compete for, and utilize peptides, which have recently been shown to act as an N source for plants in strongly N-limited ecosystems. We hypothesized that plants would preferentially use NO 3 −-N and NH 4 +-N over dissolved organic N in high-productivity grassland where inorganic N availability is high. On the other hand, in low-productivity grasslands, where the availability of dissolved inorganic N is low, and soil availability of dissolved organic N is greater, we predicted that plants would preferentially use N from amino acids and peptides, prior to microbial mineralization. Turves from two well-characterized grasslands of contrasting productivity and soil N availability were injected, <b>in</b> <b>situ,</b> with <b>mixtures</b> of 15 N-labeled inorganic N (NO 3 − and NH 4 +) and 13 C 15 N labeled amino acid (l-alanine) and peptide (l-tri-alanine). In order to measure rapid assimilation of these N forms by soil microbes and plants, the uptake of these substrates was traced within 2. 5 hours into the shoots of the most abundant plant species, as well as roots and the soil microbial biomass. We found that, contrary to our hypothesis, the majority of plant species across both grasslands took up most N in the form of NH 4 +, suggesting that inorganic N is their predominant N source. However, we did find that organic N was a source of N which could be utilized by plant species at both sites, and in the low-productivity grassland, plants were able to capture some tri-alanine-N directly. Although our findings did not support the hypothesis that differences in the availability of inorganic and organic N facilitate resource partitioning in grassland, they do support the emerging view that peptides represent a significant, but until now neglected, component of the terrestrial N cycle...|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} two {{principal}} sections. The first section {{is a study}} of the hydrogen bonding in a series of urea inclusion compounds, utilising neutron diffraction methods and a novel technique for growing neutron diffraction-suitable single crystals. The second section focusses on high pressure crystallography as a technique for exploring polymorphic landscapes, of a series of acid-base co-crystals, and the well-known active pharmaceutical ingredient 5 -methyl- 2 -[(2 -nitrophenyl) amino]- 3 -thiophenecarbonitrile (ROY). Single crystal neutron structures at several temperatures have been determined for -phase urea inclusion compounds containing hexadecane, 1, 6 -dibromohexane and 2, 7 -octanedione guests. The neutron structure of the ‘partial channel’ co-crystal of urea and DMF is also reported. This includes an in-depth discussion and analysis of the structure and bonding of this urea series, in particular, how the guest compound affects the symmetry and hydrogen bonding of the host urea network. Additionally, the challenge of obtaining crystals suitable for neutron diffraction is addressed and a new heating/cooling device to aid crystallisation is presented. Pyridine and formic acid have been crystallised at differing ratios by both cryo-crystallisation and compression in a diamond anvil cell. Mixtures of the liquids in 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 4 ratios all crystallise at high pressure, while only the 1 : 1 and 1 : 4 compositions were crystallised by <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> low temperature capillary crystallisation. The 1 : 2 structure crystallised by high pressure is a previously unknown co-crystal of pyridine - formic acid. For the 1 : 4 mixture, a new polymorph has been identified at a pressure of 14. 2 kbar with a distinctly different structure and bonding pattern to that of the previously reported low temperature form. Five new co-crystals of 2, 6 -dimethylpyridine (DMP) with formic acid (FA) were crystallised by application of pressure in a diamond anvil cell and by <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> cryo-crystallisation. <b>Mixtures</b> <b>in</b> ratios 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 of DMP: FA have been crystallised via both methods. Both the 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 co-crystals exhibit high pressure/low temperature polymorphism. ROY has been crystallised from acetone solution using a diamond anvil cell. The needle-like form obtained, named ONP shows similarities with the ORP, ON and Y forms, determined by Raman spectroscopy. The ONP crystals were recovered from the pressure cell by freezing with liquid nitrogen. Synchrotron X-ray data were collected on the sample, although no structure solution and refinement was possible. The unit cell of the ONP shows a crystallographic relationship to the ORP form. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> cosmogenic nuclide 14 C {{is unique}} {{compared}} with other nuclides because of its short half-life, and when combined with longer-lived isotopes (e. g. 10 Be), <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> 14 C {{can be a powerful}} tool for deciphering recent and complex surface exposure histories. Like all <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> cosmogenic nuclides, quantifying earth surface processes with <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> 14 C requires a well-constrained <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> 14 C production rate. We present a production-rate calibration from an independently dated moraine in West Greenland, previously used as an <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> 10 Be production-rate calibration site. The local <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> 14 C production rate is 22. 8 1. 4 atoms g 1 a 1 (69. 28 ˚N, 50. 76 ˚ W; 350 m asl) and when scaled to sea level/high latitude using time-dependent Lal/Stone scaling (Lm), we calculate a spallation-only <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> 14 C production rate of 12. 0 0. 9 atoms g 1 a 1 and a 14 C/ 10 Be production rate ratio of 3. 1 0. 2.
