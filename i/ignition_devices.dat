50|$|Hotshot {{crews are}} known for their {{extensive}} training, and are expected to display proficiency in the full range of fire suppression tactics. Like other handcrews, IHCs are primarily tasked with constructing, firing out, and holding handline, through the use of chainsaws, hand tools, <b>ignition</b> <b>devices,</b> and water delivery equipment. Hotshot crews can engage in all phases of wildfire response, from initial attack to mop-up. They are also trained in specialized operations, such as hot spotting, spot fire attack, tree felling, and structure protection.|$|E
50|$|A {{period of}} further {{informal}} professional {{training in the}} family business followed, after which he undertook a period of study in engineering. In 1924 he set himself up as a self-employed explosives engineer working for various manufacturers of explosives and <b>ignition</b> <b>devices</b> in the region (which {{has a long history}} of mining). He also acquired specialist knowledge in agricultural applications of explosives technology. This experience was later applied to opening up planting holes for large plants and small trees, so as to facilitate root penetration into the ground and to improve drainage by break up water-blocking substrata.|$|E
50|$|Improvements {{followed}} in subsequent centuries, as {{various types of}} locks (<b>ignition</b> <b>devices)</b> were invented. In the matchlock, the separate match cord was affixed to a spring-loaded pivot which could be tripped by a trigger. In the wheellock, a mechanism analogous to that used in today's cigarette lighters replaced the smoldering match cord. In the 17th century, the flintlock, which strikes a flint against steel, appeared. The flintlock remained the standard method of small arms ignition around two hundred years. In the 19th century, percussion caps were developed, followed shortly by modern integrated-primer cartridges, and hammers therefore traded their flint for firing pins.|$|E

50|$|Laser {{ignition}} is {{an alternative}} method for igniting mixtures of fuel and oxidiser. The phase of the mixture can be gaseous or liquid. The method {{is based on a}} laser <b>ignition</b> <b>devices</b> that produce short but powerful flashes regardless of the pressure in the combustion chamber. Usually, high voltage spark plugs are good enough for automotive use, as the typical compression ratio of an otto cycle internal combustion engine is around 10:1 and in some rare cases reach 14:1. However, fuels such as natural gas or methanol can withstand high compression without self ignition. This allows higher compression ratios, because it is economically reasonable, as the fuel efficiency of such engines is high. Using high compression ratio and high pressure requires special spark plugs that are expensive and their electrodes still wear out. Thus, even expensive laser ignition systems could be economical, because they would last longer.|$|E
