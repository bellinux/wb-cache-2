However, when other materials are used, {{it is important to}} determine their correct penetration loss value [26]. Also, the <b>interaction</b> <b>loss</b> function could vary for new environments, e.g., in buildings with a lot of glass or metal walls. In that case, the <b>interaction</b> <b>loss</b> function could be determined by executing a limited path loss measurement in two perpendicular corridors.

30|$|A {{heuristic}} algorithm {{taking into}} account the effect of the environment on the wireless propagation channel, has been developed for the prediction of the path loss (see Section 6) in zones of about 5 m 2. The dominant path is determined with a multidimensional optimization algorithm that searches the lowest total path loss, consisting of a distance loss ({{taking into account}} the length of the propagation path), a cumulated wall loss ({{taking into account the}} walls penetrated along the propagation path), and an <b>interaction</b> <b>loss</b> (taking into account the propagation direction changes of the path, e.g., around corners). Measurements on one floor of an office building have been performed to investigate propagation characteristics. The wall penetration losses have been determined from measurements and literature [28] and <b>interaction</b> <b>loss</b> has been fitted to match these measurements. Measurements on another floor of the same building and in three other buildings have been executed to validate the model with limited additional tuning. Our prediction method relies on the free-space loss model for every environment, this way intending to reduce the dependency of the model on the environment upon which the model is based, {{as is the case with}} many other models or tools. The applicability of the algorithm to a wireless testbed network with fixed WiFi 802.11 b/g nodes is discussed based on a site survey with signal strength measurements. The prediction algorithm can easily be implemented in network planning algorithms, as will be illustrated with a network reduction and a network optimization algorithm.

In particular, a measured Q versus temperature curve verifies a peaking point for phonon-phonon <b>interaction</b> <b>losses</b> at a temperature around 150 K. In addition, measurement versus theory for resonators with different support designs suggests that anchor losses probably still dominate the Q’s of the resonators over the entire measured temperature range, implying that improved anchor isolating designs are needed if the true intrinsic material Q’s of polysilicon are to be measured at cryogenic temperatures...|$|R

It is suggested that convection perpendicular to the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy may not be important even at rigidities less than a few GV.

3000|$|Different {{propagation}} properties can {{be chosen}} to be included into the IDP model. We have chosen {{to take into account}} the distance along the dominant path (distance loss), the corresponding wall losses, and the propagation direction changes along the dominant path (<b>interaction</b> <b>loss).</b> The IDP model as presented in [30] also adds other factors, such as waveguiding, transmitter room size, [...].... The more factors used though, the more tuning is needed (limited general use) and the more difficult it is to determine the influence of each single factor on the path loss. As a result, neural networks are mostly needed to construct a path loss model. Also, the more influencing factors included, the higher the dimensions of the problem, and the more training patterns needed to construct reliable models. Therefore, we aimed to construct a model as simple as possible, but as complex as necessary for accurate predictions, this way improving the IDP model from [10, 30]. In Sections 7 and 8, it will be demonstrated that the proposed three contributing factors suffice to perform solid predictions.|$|E

Figure 3 shows the ground plan of 'De Vijvers' with the measurement trajectories (see also Section 4). Table 5 shows that the predictions match the measurements excellently. The average deviation for T 1 -T 12 is only 1.22 dB {{with a standard deviation of}} 2.19 dB. The average absolute deviation is 1.73 dB, while the maximum deviation is 5.07 dB (trajectory T 9). The deviations are small especially for the trajectories with the lowest path losses (T 1, T 2, T 11, T 12 are LoS or OLoS) which will be most relevant for actual networks (locations on trajectories with PL > 90 dB will probably have no WiFi reception).
