40|$|In the {{purification}} of <b>elaiophylin</b> from {{a culture}} of Streptomyces hygroscopicus MCY- 846, mono- and dimethyl-elaiophylin were obtained through a O-methylation of the hemiketal hydroxy group of <b>elaiophylin.</b> All the three elaiophylins showed cytotoxicity against several human tumor cell lines and murine cell lines. <b>Elaiophylin</b> and monomethyl-elaiophylin also showed antimicrobial activities against gram-positive bacteria and potent inhibitory effects on the activation of B cells by lipopolysaccharide {{as well as on}} the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes stimulated by mitogens but dimethyl-elaiophylin did not. This result indicats that <b>elaiophylin</b> and monomethyl-elaiophylin would be strong immunosuppressants. Furthermore this result revealed an interesting structure-activity relationship suggesting that the lack of symmetry and /or the free OH group at C- 11 of <b>elaiophylin</b> might be important in conferring biological activities. ope...|$|E
40|$|<b>Elaiophylin</b> is {{an unusual}} C 2 -symmetric {{antibiotic}} macrodiolide produced on a bacterial modular polyketide synthase assembly line. To probe the mechanism and selectivity of diolide formation, we sought to reconstitute ring formation in vitro by using a non-natural substrate. Incubation of recombinant <b>elaiophylin</b> thioesterase/cyclase with a synthetic pentaketide analogue of the presumed monomeric polyketide precursor of <b>elaiophylin,</b> specifically its N-acetylcysteamine thioester, produced a novel 16 -membered C 2 -symmetric macrodiolide. A linear dimeric thioester is an intermediate in ring formation, which indicates iterative use of the thioesterase active site in ligation and subsequent cyclization. Furthermore, the <b>elaiophylin</b> thioesterase acts on a mixture of pentaketide and tetraketide thioesters to give both the symmetric decaketide diolide and the novel asymmetric hybrid nonaketide diolide. Such thioesterases have potential as tools for the in vitro construction of novel diolides...|$|E

Four new <b>elaiophylin</b> macrolides (1 – 4), together with five known elaiophylins (5 – 9), have been isolated from cultures of the Indonesian soil bacterium Streptomyces sp. ICBB 9297. The new compounds have macrocyclic skeletons distinct from those of the known dimeric elaiophylins in that one or both of the polyketide chains contain(s) an additional pendant methyl group. Further investigations revealed that 1 and 2 were derived from 3 and 4, respectively, during isolation processes. Compounds 1 – 3 showed comparable antibacterial activity to <b>elaiophylin</b> against Staphylococcus aureus. However, interestingly, only compounds 1 and 3, which contain a pendant methyl group at C- 2, showed activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis, whereas compound 2, which has two pendant methyl groups at C- 2 and C- 2 ′, and the known <b>elaiophylin</b> analogues (5 – 7), which lack pendant methyl groups at C- 2 and/or C- 2 ′, showed no activity. The production of 3 and 4 in strain ICBB 9297 indicates that one of the acyltransferase (AT) domains in the <b>elaiophylin</b> polyketide synthases (PKSs) can recruit both malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA as substrates. Bioinformatic analysis of the AT domains of the <b>elaiophylin</b> PKSs revealed that the ela_AT 7 domain contains atypical active site amino acid residues, distinct from those conserved in malonyl-CoA- or methylmalonyl-CoA-specific ATs...|$|E

40|$|Natural product {{discovery}} of novel <b>elaiophylin</b> analogues and actinomycin analogues. Access {{restricted to the}} OSU Community, at author's request, from June 4, 2015 - Jun. 4, 2017. Soil bacteria {{are known to be}} a prolific source of bioactive compounds. They produce secondary metabolites that can be used as therapeutic agents. This investigation focused on the chemistry and biology of secondary metabolites from two soil bacteria, Streptomyces herbaricolor ICBB 9409 and Streptomyces albiflaviniger ICBB 9297, which were isolated from soil samples collected from black water ecosystems on Borneo Island, Indonesia. Both strains were cultured in Modified Bennett’s medium, and their secondary metabolites were extracted using liquid-liquid extraction protocols using ethyl acetate. The extracts were then tested against five different pathogenic bacteria and a fungus by agar disc diffusion assay. Active compounds were then purified by chemical and bioassay guided fractionation experiments. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments were used to elucidate their chemical structures. A new analogue of actinomycin was isolated and purified from the culture broth of ICBB 9409 strain. This compound has potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Furthermore, two novel analogues of <b>elaiophylin,</b> 2 ´-methyl- 11, 11 ´-O-dimethylelaiophylin and 2, 2 ´-dimethyl- 11, 11 ´-O-dimethylelaiophylin, were isolated from the culture broths of ICBB 9297...|$|E
40|$|The {{role that}} endosomal {{acidification}} plays during influenza virus entry into MDCK cells has been analyzed {{by using the}} macrolide antibiotics bafilomycin A 1 and concanamycin A as selective inhibitors of vacuolar proton-ATPase (v-[H+]ATPase), the enzyme responsible for the acidification of endosomes. Bafilomycin A 1 and concanamycin A, present at the low concentrations of 5 x 10 (- 7) and 5 x 10 (- 9) M, respectively, prevented the entry of influenza virus into cells when added during the first minutes of infection. Attachment of virion particles to the cell surface was not the target for the action of bafilomycin A 1. N,N'-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, a nonspecific inhibitor of proton-ATPases, also blocked virus entry, whereas <b>elaiophylin,</b> an inhibitor of the plasma-proton ATPase, had no effect. The inhibitory actions of bafilomycin A 1 and concanamycin A were tested in culture medium at different pHs. Both antibiotics powerfully prevented influenza virus infection when the virus was added under low-pH conditions. This inhibition was reduced if the virus was bound to cells at 4 degrees C prior to the addition of warm low-pH medium. Moreover, incubation of cells at acidic pH potently blocked influenza virus infection, {{even in the absence}} of antibiotics. These results indicate that a pH gradient, rather than low pH, is necessary for efficient entry of influenza virus into cells...|$|E
