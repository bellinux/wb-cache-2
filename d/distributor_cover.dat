50|$|There was a {{voluntary}} take-back action for thermometers containing mercury {{based on the}} Federal Waste Management Plan 2006, and carried out in close cooperation between the Austrian Chamber of Pharmacists (Österreichische Apothekerkammer), the Federal Ministry of Environment, a private waste disposer, a producer of electronic thermometers and a pharmaceutical distributor. The disposal company supplied each pharmacy (approximately 1,200) with a collection bin and covered the cost of disposal. The pharmaceutical <b>distributor</b> <b>covered</b> the logistical costs for {{the distribution of the}} thermometers. The pharmacies accepted a refund of only 0.50 Euro per thermometer for handling (which is far below their normal margin). The supplier provided the thermometers at a reduced price. The Federal Ministry supported each sold thermometer (covering about 30% of the direct costs) and advertised the project. During the collection period, consumers could bring in a mercury thermometer and buy an electronic thermometer for a subsidised price of 1 Euro. Between October 2007 and January 2008, about 465,000 electronic thermometers were sold and about one million mercury thermometers (together containing about 1 tonne of mercury) were collected.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—During {{the past}} few years a world-wide trend to-wards {{renewable}} and ecologically clean forms of energy has been steadily growing. Private investments are encouraged and heavily subsidized in most of the European countries, through tax deductions, and even more through a very favorable re-fund program for feeding electric power from renewable sources into the public network. Due to the limited predictabil-ity of the output of renewable power capacities it has long be-come the policy of grid operators and large power <b>distributors</b> to <b>cover</b> the differences between demand and supply with im-mense reserve and balancing power capacities based on fossil, and thus predictable, energy sources. With growing renewable power feed-in the demand for reserve and balancing power grows over-proportionally. In 2005 the European Union for the Coordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE) de-manded to impose an obligation on grid operators to reduce integration costs for renewable energy capacities. This could obviously be possible once the renewable capacities sources could serve as reserve capacity. Since these are widely distri-buted and dispersed, their combined effect may well be used to guarantee a stable supply. The remaining problem behind is that the largely unpredictable character of wind and solar power supply is to be administered financially and in terms of timely transmission. We introduce a novel solution for the dis-tributed negotiation process, which is compatible with electric distribution procedures. This is part of our DEZENT (Decen-tralized Management of Electric Power Distribution) project. I...|$|R
50|$|For {{simplicity}} and reliability, mechanical pumps are used, driven by mechanical geartrains from the crankshaft. Reducing pump speed is beneficial {{and so it}} is usual to drive the pump from the cam (if this is mounted in the cylinder block) or distributor shaft, which turns at half engine speed. Placing the oil pump low-down uses a near-vertical drive shaft, driven by helical skew gears from the camshaft. Some engines, such as the Fiat twin cam engine of 1964, began as OHV engines with an oil pump driven from a conventional camshaft in the cylinder block. When the twin overhead cam engine was developed, the previous oil pump arrangement was retained and the camshaft became a shortened stub shaft. Even when the distributor position was moved from the previous block-mount to being mounted on the cylinder head camshafts, the oil pump drive remained in the same position, the unused <b>distributor</b> position now <b>covered</b> by a blanking plate. Small engines, or scooters may have internal gear pumps mounted directly on their crankshaft.|$|R

2500|$|The {{bottom part}} of the reactor is {{enclosed}} in a watertight compartment. There is a space between the reactor bottom and the floor. The reactor cavity overpressure protection system consists of steam relief assemblies embedded in the floor and leading to Steam <b>Distributor</b> Headers <b>covered</b> with rupture discs and opening into the Steam Distribution Corridor below the reactor, on level +6. The floor of the corridor contains entrances {{of a large number}} of vertical pipes, leading to the bottoms of the Pressure Suppression Pools ("bubbler" [...] pools) located on levels +3 and +0. In the event of an accident, which was predicted to be at most a rupture of one or two pressure channels, the steam was to be bubbled through the water and condensed there, reducing the overpressure in the leaktight compartment. The flow capacity of the pipes to the pools limited the protection capacity to simultaneous rupture of two pressure channels; a higher number of failures would cause pressure buildup sufficient to lift the cover plate ("Structure E", after the explosion nicknamed [...] "Elena"), sever the rest of the fuel channels, destroy the control rod insertion system, and potentially also withdraw control rods from the core. The containment was designed to handle failures of the downcomers, pumps, and distribution and inlet of the feedwater. The leaktight compartments around the pumps can withstand overpressure of 0.45MPa. The distribution headers and inlets enclosures can handle 0.08MPa and are vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The reactor cavity can handle overpressure of 0.18MPa and is vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The pressure suppression system can handle a failure of one reactor channel, a pump pressure header, or a distribution header. Leaks in the steam piping and separators are not handled, except for maintaining slightly lower pressure in the riser pipe gallery and the steam drum compartment than in the reactor hall. These spaces are also not designed to withstand overpressure. The steam distribution corridor contains surface condensers. The fire sprinkler systems, operating during both accident and normal operation, are fed from the pressure suppression pools through heat exchangers cooled by the plant service water, and cool the air above the pools. Jet coolers are located in the topmost parts of the compartments; their role is to cool the air and remove the steam and radioactive aerosol particles.|$|R
40|$|The School of Natural Resources and Environment (SNRE) team {{engaged with}} Meijer, Inc. {{to assess the}} {{environmental}} impacts of its core business activities, to develop an Environmental Commitment and Sustainability Plan, and to aggregate the sustainability efforts of the company to date. Meijer is a retailer with operations including manufacturing, distribution, and sales in six U. S. states. The team worked alongside Meijer employees focused on environmental sustainability to review and evaluate their current sustainability efforts for the fiscal year 2014 (FY 2014) for the company. In addition, the team created sustainability objectives leading up to 2020, based on the company’s priorities, as well as a benchmark analysis of peer companies. Meijer has five core values that align with environmental sustainability. In addition, there is a strong trend in the retail industry to track and mitigate environmental impacts. The Environmental Commitment will serve as a foundation to integrate the values into the environmental sustainability program, while also serving to communicate those values to both internal and external stakeholders. The Environmental Footprint Report will serve as a benchmark for progress to measure the success of ongoing and future programs. The Sustainability Plan will serve as a guide for Meijer to meet its objectives. When creating the environmental impact report, Meijer and the SNRE team prioritized key areas where the company had the most significant environmental impacts. The scope of this report is limited to Meijer’s operations and does not include an analysis of its customers, products, supply chain, or transportation of goods to store locations by any third party <b>distributor.</b> The report <b>covers</b> the following section topics: 5. 1.

40|$|In February 2015, the U. S. Copyright Office {{released}} a report entitled Copyright and the Music Marketplace, which summarizes its study {{of the music industry}} and recommends significant revisions to copyright law in response to the rapidly changing demands of the industry. Among its recommendations, the Copyright Office proposes an amendment to section 115 (a) (2) of the Copyright Act. Currently, section 115 (a) (2), referred to as the compulsory licensing provision of copyright law, permits someone to record a new version of a previously recorded and publicly distributed song, regardless of the format of the newly recorded version. The revised section 115 (a) (2) would require someone who wishes to distribute a cover recording of a song to seek a license from the copyright owner for dissemination via interactive new media and digital downloads. However, distribution of cover songs in physical formats still would be subject to compulsory licensing. The Copyright Office’s suggested amendment to section 115 (a) (2) would create nonuniformity for creators of cover recordings based on the intended format of the newly recorded song. This approach seems contrary to the Copyright Office’s guiding principles and reasoning behind its recommendations for other changes to copyright law in the Music Marketplace report that emphasize the importance of harmonization of the rules for music licensing. For example, the Copyright Office supports harmonizing the rules that govern terrestrial radio with the rules concerning digital and satellite radio by broadening the sound recording performance right to include terrestrial broadcasts and including terrestrial uses under sections 112 and 114 licenses. According to the report, the creation of a terrestrial radio performance right would adhere to the Office’s principle that “analogous uses should be treated alike. ” Yet, the recommendation for section 115 (a) (2) would produce different treatments of digital and physical formats of works. A potential licensee who is the digital <b>distributor</b> of a <b>cover</b> song would no longer have the option of a compulsory license if the licensee does not want to contact the copyright owner or the copyright owner does not wish to license the song, but the potential licensee could distribute the same cover song in a physical format, such as a compact disc (CD), under the current compulsory licensing system. This Article concludes this recommendation is inadvisable because it creates inconsistencies in licensing musical works when harmonization is critical for the music industry, and it places an unjustifiable burden on musicians and distributors seeking to rerecord songs in digital formats. The U. S. Copyright Office should either recommend the elimination of the compulsory licensing system for music or suggest format-neutral changes to the current system. Because of the lack of need and purpose for a compulsory licensing system for musical works today, the Article suggests that the Office develop a recommendation that includes the repeal of section 115...|$|R
