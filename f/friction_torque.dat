50|$|An {{empirical}} and approximate statement, {{applicable to}} the speed and density ranges herein covered, is that the <b>friction</b> <b>torque</b> (m. e. p.) increases as a linear function of speed at Q constant, air density, and as a linear function of air density at a constant speed. This applies to both the Liberty 12-cylinder and the Hispano-Suiza 8-cylinder engines. The true relations of <b>friction</b> <b>torque,</b> engine speed, and air density are much more complex and cannot be deduced from the available information. It is known, however, that the <b>friction</b> <b>torque</b> is such that the friction horsepower wdl increase with engine speed raised to {{between the first and}} second power, approaching the square of the speed at the higher speeds. The exact relation is dependent on the engine, as well as on the speed and air density. Also, at a given speed, the friction horsepower increases with some varying power of the air density because of the change of the pumping work. The friction horsepower at constant speed is found to increase slightly more rapidly than does the density.|$|E

In this method the perturbed motion of the manipulator is modelled as a first-order perturbation of the nominal manipulator motion. A non-linear finite element method is used to formulate the dynamic equations of the manipulator mechanism. In a closed-loop simulation the driving torques are generated by the control system. <b>Friction</b> <b>torques</b> at the actuator joints are introduced at the stage of perturbed dynamics. For a mathematical model of the <b>friction</b> <b>torques</b> we implemented the LuGre friction model that accounts both for the sliding and presliding regime. To illustrate the method, the motion of a six-axes industrial St¨aubli robot is simulated. The manipulation task implies transferring a laser spot along a straight line with a trapezoidal velocity profile. The computed trajectory tracking errors are compared with measured values, where in both cases the tip position is computed from the joint angles using a nominal kinematic robot model. It is found that a closed-loop simulation using a non-linear finite element model of this robot is very time-consuming due to the small time step of the discrete controller.

50|$|NACA Report 108 is an {{analysis}} of airplane engine tests made at the Bureau of Standards, attempting to identify fundamental relations between the manyvariables of engine operation. The engines were the Liberty L-12 and three models of the Hispano-Suiza 8F. The tests {{were made in the}} altitude chamber, where conditions simulated altitudes up to about 30,000 feet, with engine speeds from 1,200 to 2,200 rpm. Thecompression ratios of the different engines ranged from under 5:1 to over 8:1. The data taken on the tests were exceptionally complete, including many pressures and temperatures, besides the brake and <b>friction</b> <b>torques,</b> rates of fuel and air consumption, the jacket and exhaust heat losses.|$|R
50|$|With the Liberty engine, {{operating}} at 500 to 2,000 rpm {{and with the}} Hispano-Suiza 300 hp {{operating at}} 1,400 to 2,200, {{it was found that}} the <b>friction</b> <b>torque</b> increases approximately as a linear function of engine speed at a given air density, and approximately as a linear function of density at a constant speed. This means that the friction horsepower increases approximately as the square of the speed. Actually the reIation of torque and speedis such that the friction horsepower increases with speed raised to a power between the first and second, this power increasing with speed, approaching the square. The relation depends upon the engine design and speed and the air density. Any statements as to the distribution of the friction losses are based upon incomplete evidence; the indications are, however, that the pumping losses are about half of the total friction. There is no doubt that for a given process of combustion and at a constant speed the engine power is directly proportional to the weight of charge supplied; in other words, proportional to the charge density at the beginning of compression. As a consequence, if operating conditions are sensibly constant except for altitude, the engine power -will be closely proportional to the air density. The volumetric efficiency increases with increase of air temperature at constant pressure, so that power does not decrease as fast as the air density when the temperature is raised, due to changes in vaporization and heat transfer.|$|E
