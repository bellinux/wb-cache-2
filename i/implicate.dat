As {{previously}} told to the engineer by the criminals, they use this disguise to <b>implicate</b> any accomplice as the mastermind and to divert attention away from themselves. Once inside, they encounter security personnel, a shootout ensues, and the two criminals are killed. The engineer is confronted by Batman who is investigating the disturbance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{observed}} previously that Random 3 -SAT exhibits a phase transition at a critical ratio of constraints to variables, where the average frequency of satisfiability falls abruptly from near 1 to near 0. In this paper we look beyond satisfiability to <b>implicates</b> and prime <b>implicates</b> of non-zero length and show experimentally that, for any given length, these exhibit their own phase transitions. All of these phase transitions appear to share the same critical point as the well-known satisfiability phase transition. We also find a rich, regular pattern, in which phase transitions for longer <b>implicates</b> or prime <b>implicates</b> are less steep at a given problem size and all the phase transitions sharpen with increasing problem size. <b>Implicates</b> correspond in a one-to-one way to nogoods, and prime <b>implicates</b> correspond similarly to minimal nogoods. Knowledge about these phase transitions helps us to understand more about the behavior of search algorithms and knowledge compilation approaches {{in the context of}} Random 3 -SAT...|$|R

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs demands engineer Andy Hertzfeld fix it, threatening to publicly <b>implicate</b> him in the presentation's credits if he does not. Hertzfeld finally suggests faking the demo using the prototype Macintosh 512K computer.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studies the}} {{approximation}} {{of the set}} of minimal <b>implicates</b> and the effect this approximation has on their corresponding minimally consistent explanations. A general definition for approximated minimal <b>implicates,</b> called selective <b>implicates,</b> is presented. Three specific instances of selective implicates: query-based, ATMS-based and length-based are studied. Using the set of query-based minimal <b>implicates</b> and its approximation, explanations are generated and the properties of these explanations are studied. The goal of these studies is to propose a framework for incorporating knowledge-guided and resource-bounded approximation into computational abduction. The potential benefit might include {{the discovery of a}} useful and tractable approximation strategy for computational abduction...|$|R

5|$|The FBI {{eliminated}} Weber as {{an active}} suspect in July 1998 when his fingerprints did not match any of those processed in the hijacked plane, and no other direct evidence could be found to <b>implicate</b> him.

5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to <b>implicate</b> tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E

5|$|Another {{cause of}} revulsion against Webster was her attempt to {{impersonate}} Thomas. She {{had managed to}} perpetrate the impersonation for two weeks, implying that middle-class identity amounted {{to little more than}} cultivating the right demeanour and having the appropriate clothes and possessions, whether or not they had been earned. John Church, the publican whom Webster had attempted to <b>implicate,</b> was himself a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and effective management of his pub. His commitment to bettering himself through hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. Webster, in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Cold War tensions, the search and rescue {{operations}} of the Soviet Union were not coordinated {{with those of the}} United States, South Korea, and Japan. Consequently no information was shared, and each side endeavored to harass or obtain evidence to <b>implicate</b> the other. The flight data recorders were the key pieces of evidence sought by both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of its search vessels in the event that they were found. International boundaries are not well defined on the open sea, leading to numerous confrontations between the large number of opposing naval ships that were assembled in the area.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways. First, Stewart declined to cross-examine one of the witnesses, who could <b>implicate</b> Kretske but not Glasser, for fear that it would strengthen the case against Kretske. Stewart also failed to object to the testimony of other witnesses regarding prior statements of Kretske; under the rules of hearsay, these statements were obviously admissible against Kretske, but less obviously admissible against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co-conspirator. Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the admissibility of the statements against Kretske.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study {{relationships}} between CNF representations {{of a given}} Boolean function f and certain sets of <b>implicates</b> of f. We introduce two definitions of sets of <b>implicates</b> which are both based on the properties of resolution. The first type of sets, called exclusive sets of <b>implicates,</b> is shown to have a functional property useful for decompositions. The second type of sets, called essential sets of <b>implicates,</b> is proved to possess an orthogonality property, which implies that every CNF representation and every essential set must intersect. The latter property then leads to an interesting question, to which we give an affirmative answer for some special subclasses of Horn Boolean functions...|$|R

50|$|Cholinergic {{systems are}} <b>implicated</b> in {{numerous}} neurologic functions. Alteration in some cholinergic neurons {{may account for}} the disturbances of Alzheimer disease. The protein encoded by this gene synthesizes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine acts at two classes of receptors in the central nervous system - muscarinic and nicotinic - which are each <b>implicated</b> in different physiological responses. The role of acetylcholine at the nicotinic receptor is still under investigation. It is likely <b>implicated</b> in the reward/reinforcement pathways, as indicated by the addictive nature of nicotine, which also binds to the nicotinic receptor. The muscarinic action of acetylcholine in the CNS is <b>implicated</b> in learning and memory. The loss of cholinergic innervation in the neocortex has been associated with memory loss, as is evidenced in advanced cases of Alzheimer's disease. In the peripheral nervous system, cholinergic neurons are <b>implicated</b> in the control of visceral functions such as, but not limited to, cardiac muscle contraction and gastrointestinal tract function.|$|R
5|$|The Pisones {{had been}} {{longtime}} {{supporters of the}} Claudians, and had allied themselves with the young Octavian after his marriage to Livia, the mother of Tiberius. Germanicus's death and accusations indicted the new Princeps. Piso was placed on trial and, according to Tacitus, threatened to <b>implicate</b> Tiberius. Whether the governor actually could connect the Princeps {{to the death of}} Germanicus is unknown; rather than continuing to stand trial when it became evident that the Senate was against him, Piso committed suicide.|$|E

The inquiry may be reopened by decision of prosecuting council or by request of any of those involved if new, serious and relevant evidence emerges.|$|E
5|$|The {{resultant}} Cleveland Street scandal implicated other high-ranking {{figures in}} British society, and rumours swept upper-class London of {{the involvement of}} a member of the royal family, namely Prince Albert Victor. The prostitutes had not named Albert Victor, and it is suggested that Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, fabricated and spread the rumours to take the heat off his client. Letters exchanged between the Treasury Solicitor, Sir Augustus Stephenson, and his assistant, Hamilton Cuffe, make coded reference to Newton's threats to <b>implicate</b> Albert Victor.|$|E
40|$|Infections due to Salmonella enteritidis are {{increasing}} worldwide. In the United States, between 1985 and 1989, 78 % of the S. enteritidis outbreaks {{in which a}} food vehicle was identified <b>implicated</b> a food containing raw or lightly cooked shell eggs. Under a US Department of Agriculture regulation published in 1990, eggs <b>implicated</b> in human food-borne S. enteritidis outbreaks were {{traced back to the}} source flock. The flock environment and the internal organs of a sample of hens were tested for S. enteritidis. We compared the S. enteritidis phage types of isolates from 18 human, egg-associated outbreaks and the 15 flocks <b>implicated</b> through traceback of these outbreaks. The predominant human outbreak phage type was recovered from the environment in 100 % of <b>implicated</b> flocks and from the internal organs of hens in 88 % of <b>implicated</b> flocks we tested. The results support the use of phage typing as a tool to identify flocks involved in human S. enteritidis outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{prospects}} for justifying the somewhat widespread, somewhat firmly held sense {{that there is some}} moral advantage to untruthfully <b>implicating</b> over lying. I call this the "Difference Intuition. " I define lying in terms of asserting, but remain open about what precise definition best captures our ordinary notion. I define <b>implicating</b> as one way of meaning something without asserting it. I narrow down the kind of untruthful <b>implicating</b> that should be compared with lying for purposes of evaluating whether there is a moral difference between them. Just as lying requires a robust form of assertion, so the kind of untruthful <b>implicating</b> to be compared with lying requires a robust form of <b>implicating.</b> Next, I set out various ways of sharpening the Difference Intuition and survey a range of approaches to justifying one class of sharpenings. I finish by sketching an approach to justifying an alternative sharpening of the Difference Intuition, which is inspired by John Stuart Mill's discussion of lying...|$|R

5|$|As {{the novel}} progresses, Clay learns that Rip {{also had a}} fling with Rain and is now obsessed with her. When Clay discovers that Julian is {{currently}} Rain's boyfriend, he conspires with Rip to hand Julian over to him. When Julian is then found murdered, Rain confronts Clay {{about his role in}} the affair and is raped by him in response. He later receives a video of Julian's murder from Rip which has been overdubbed with an angry voicemail from Clay as a means to <b>implicate</b> him in the crime. The novel then depicts sequences of the savage sexual and physical abuse of a beautiful young girl and young boy, perpetrated by Clay. Clay experiences no feelings of remorse or guilt for this, for Julian's death, or for exploiting and raping Rain. In the last scenes, it is strongly implied that Blair has been hiring people to follow Clay. In return for his giving her what she wants, she offers to provide Clay with a false alibi that will prevent the police from arresting him as an accomplice to Julian's murder.|$|E
5|$|Diogenes {{had been}} married to an {{anonymous}} daughter of Basil Argyros, brother of Emperor Romanos III Argyros (r. 1028–1034), but in 1029 he was accused, along with other prominent Balkan generals such as Eustathios Daphnomeles, of conspiring against the emperor with the porphyrogennete princess Theodora. He was transferred east as strategos of the Thracesian Theme but, {{as soon as his}} complicity in the affair was confirmed, was recalled to Constantinople. There he was imprisoned, beaten and publicly paraded in the Mese along with the other conspirators, and later tonsured and forced to enter the Stoudios Monastery. Theodora herself was placed in a convent, but she apparently continued to conspire with Diogenes, who planned to take advantage of Romanos's absence on campaign in the East in 1032 to escape to the Balkans. The plot was leaked to Romanos by Theophanes, metropolitan of Thessalonica, and the conspirators were arrested. Diogenes was brought to the Palace of Blachernae for interrogation by John the Orphanotrophos, but he committed suicide, throwing himself off a wall, rather than confess under torture and <b>implicate</b> his fellow conspirators.|$|E
