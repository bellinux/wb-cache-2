5|$|Pokémon Channel is {{difficult}} to categorize into a genre, as it incorporates elements of adventure, simulation, and digital pet games. The graphics are in 3D, the perspective is first-person, and the player navigates and selects things with a cursor. The game centers on watching television programs with a Pikachu, a mouse-like Pokémon. The player, {{who lives in a}} house, can channel-surf freely among the various channels of a television network created by the pokémon professor, Professor Oak, as well as explore one room of the house and several outdoor areas. Pikachu sometimes displays <b>emotional</b> <b>reactions</b> while watching, such as happiness or anger. The game takes place over a few days, with unique plot events on each. The GameCube's inner clock tracks time such that every in-game day lasts at least as long as one real-time day.|$|E

On both occasions they also rated valence and activation of current mood. In Experiment 2, another 40 undergraduates rated valence and activation of current mood followed by ratings of preference for and valence and activation of anticipated <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> to descriptions of familiar emotion-eliciting situations. The results showed that preference is related to valence and activation of current mood, anticipated <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction,</b> or experienced <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction.</b> The valence of current mood was also found to influence preference for anticipated and experienced emotions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Emotions play an {{important}} role in cognitive processes and specially in learning tasks. Online learning is no exception. Detecting a learner’s <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> for a given situation is an essential element for every Distant Learning Environment. Nevertheless, inferring a learner’s <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> in those environments is not a trivial task. In this paper, we present an agent capable of predicting a learner’s <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> in a distant learning environment based on the learner’s personal and non-personal traits using a machine learning technique, namely the ID 3 algorithm. We then describe the agent’s method for predicting the learner’s <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> and discuss the obtained results. ...|$|R

5|$|The premiere {{took place}} at the EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts in Calgary in February 2011.

Four days after the premiere, Burnt Thicket Theatre moved the play to the Scott Block Theatre in Red Deer, where the play was scheduled to be performed until March 12. All the performances in Red Deer were sold out. The play drew <b>emotional</b> <b>reactions</b> from the audience. Kooman learned that some audience members at the initial performances later responded to the play by talking with others about human trafficking, writing letters to their Members of Parliament, and doing other creative things on the subject. They also contacted Waldschmidt, sometimes up to a year later, with stories about how the play had continued to affect their lives. In conjunction with the initial run of She Has a Name, Burnt Thicket Theatre provided the names of organizations that assist human-trafficking victims. There was also a panel discussion about human trafficking after the matinée on February 26.|$|E

40|$|The {{reciprocal}} relationship between parent factors (parental support, parent <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction,</b> and parenting stress) and child symptoms of posttraumatic stress was {{examined in the}} current study. Three hypotheses were tested: 1) parents and children interact in a transactional manner {{through the course of}} clinical services, 2) change in parental support and parent <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> would be stronger predictors of child symptoms at post-therapy and 6 -month follow-up compared to baseline scores, and 3) child and caregiver characteristics would account for the most amount of variance in pre-assessment scores of parental support and parent <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> when compared with abuse characteristics. Method: 115 children with trauma and their non-offending caregivers completed questionnaires. Parents completed the Parental Support Questionnaire, Parent <b>Emotional</b> <b>Reaction</b> Questionnaire, and the Parenting Stress Index. Child symptoms were assessed with the parent report Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children and child report Trauma Symptom Child Checklist. Data collections occurred at pre-assessment, pre-therapy, post-therapy, and 6 -month follow-up. Results: No relationship was found between parental support and child symptoms. Parent <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction,</b> parent depression, and parenting competency were related with child symptoms. Parental support did not predict child symptoms. Baseline and post-therapy reports of parent <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> were related to child symptoms. Parental support and parent <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> pre-assessment ratings were only predicted by baseline reports of these factors. Conclusion: The findings with relation to parental support may be an artifact of the data or may support the findings in the broader literature that indicate that parental support is not a reliable indicator of child well-being. A better indicator appears to be parent <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction.</b> This may be due to a spill-over effect of parents emotions on their children which influences their perception of their childs emotional state and/or impacts their child by subtly dictating how a child should react in response to his/her parent. By assessing parent <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction,</b> clinicians can identify important areas for intervention to ensure that parents are supported in their own emotional processing and in their understanding of the links between the parent and child emotional experience and expression of emotions...|$|R
25|$|The {{prospect}} of memory erasure or alteration raises ethical issues. Some of these concern identity, as memory seems {{to play a}} role in how people perceive themselves. For example, if a traumatic memory were erased, a person might still remember related events in their lives, such as their <b>emotional</b> <b>reactions</b> to later experiences. Without the original memory to give them context, these remembered events might prompt the subjects to see themselves as emotional or irrational people. In the United States, the President's Council on Bioethics devoted a chapter in its October 2003 report Beyond Therapy to the issue. The report discourages the use of drugs that blunt the effect of traumatic memories, warning against treating human <b>emotional</b> <b>reactions</b> to life events as a medical issue.|$|E

In addition, self-reported <b>emotional</b> <b>reactions</b> favor self-enhancement while more thoughtful processes favor self-verification.|$|E

Neither hypothesised <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> nor common psychological factors in recovering process was found. Through psychological testing and interview，however，some psychological reaction to the injury were found such as; the influence of a social support，an adjustment problem，and future goals. Also an <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> difference was found between acute injured players and overtraining and its correlated other psychological factors. As Kubler-Ross's study to realize and accept the injury was found to be very important in recovering process. Accordingly，more case studies should further be done to identify stages of <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> process and to develop a precise measurement for it. That will improve psychological intervention or counseling to players, which will lead a healthy recovery from the injury mentally and physically...|$|R

40|$|Little {{research}} is available examining the predictors or underlying mechanisms of employee reactions to implementation of change efforts. This article argues {{for the importance}} of the conceptual perspective of organizations adopted when implementing a change effort. A theoretical model is presented that aims to explain how employees decide to resist the implementation of an organizational change effort and to identify the key factors that affect the employees’ decisions to resist during change implementation. The model shows that resistance has an initiating event (discovery) and an outcome (resistance behavior), and that there are three intermediary elements (the interacting elements of attribution and <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> followed by the decision to resist), each of which is shaped by a number of key variables. The initiating event triggers independently both an attribution and an <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> with the attribution and <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> interacting, each affecting the other. The <b>emotional</b> <b>reaction</b> affects, in turn, the decision-making process to resist, and the resistance decision leads to resistance behavior.

25|$|Relational ties principle: The fusion {{approach}} {{assumes that}} strongly fused persons care {{not only about}} their collective ties to the group (as an abstract entity), but also their relationships (real or imagined) {{with other members of}} the group. Identity Fusion Theory posits that strongly fused individuals feel kin-like bonds with other group members, even ones with whom they may have had little or no contact. Several studies have garnered empirical support for the relational ties principle. Using several interpersonal variations of the classic trolley dilemma, individuals who were strongly fused with their country endorsed saving fellow countrymen by jumping to their deaths in front of a speeding trolley. Moreover, fused participants endorsed pushing aside a fellow countryman who was poised to jump to his death to ultimately benefit the group, and instead jumping themselves. This research suggests that highly fused persons are so strongly aligned with their fellow group members that they would prefer that they themselves die rather than a fellow group member. Additionally, when highly fused individuals learn that other group members might be killed in a hypothetical trolley dilemma, they demonstrate <b>emotional</b> <b>reactions</b> similar to how people react when a family member is in distress. These <b>emotional</b> <b>reactions</b> predicted subsequent endorsements of self-sacrifice for the group. In comparison, the social identity approach assumes that, when the social identity is salient, individuals view their fellow group members as mere interchangeable exemplars of the group (i.e. they evaluate other group members based on their “collective ties” toward the group).|$|E
