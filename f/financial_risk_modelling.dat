40|$|A common {{assumption}} in quantitative <b>financial</b> <b>risk</b> <b>modelling</b> is the distributional {{assumption of}} normality in the asset’s return series, which makes modelling easy but {{proves to be}} inefficient if the data exhibit extreme tails. When dealing with extreme financial events like the Global Financial Crisis of 2007 - 2008 while quantifying extreme market risk, Extreme Value Theory (EVT) proves to be a natural statistical modelling technique of interest. Extreme Value Theory provides well established statistical models for the computation of extreme risk measures like the Return Level, Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall. In this paper we apply Univariate Extreme Value Theory to model extreme market risk for the ASX-All Ordinaries (Australian) index and the S 2 ̆ 6 P- 500 (USA) Index. We demonstrate that EVT can be successfully applied to Australian stock market return series for predicting next day VaR by using a GARCH(1, 1) based dynamic EVT approach.

This method {{has been used in}} characterising dynamic changes in time series, with various ap-plications such as <b>financial</b> <b>risk</b> <b>modelling</b> and biomedical signal processing. Ordinal pattern encoding is a fundamental calculation in ordinal analysis. It is computationally demanding particularly for high query orders and large time series data. This paper presents the first reconfigurable accelerator for this encoding calculation, with four main contributions. First, we propose a two-level hardware-oriented ordinal pattern encoding scheme to avoid sequence sorting operations in the accelerator, enabling theoretically best code compactness. Second, we develop a hard-ware mapping method by promoting data reuse, by parallelising arithmetic operations, and by pipelining the data path. Third, we conduct an experimental implementation of the proposed system, showing promising accelerated performance compared to software solutions. Finally, we apply the proposed accelerator to the computation of permutation entropy, demonstrating the significant potential for acceleration that would benefit such computation.

40|$|Managing {{financial}} risk {{continues to be}} an integral part of assessing financial instrument performance. It is important to note that many empirical studies have looked on factors such as total risk and diversifiable risk or even beta, standard deviation and variance as risk representation. Due to the urgent need for a single risk measure, Value-at-Risk (VaR) has attained more demand in replacing standard deviation or volatility as the most widely used risk measure. However, VaR has so far not been exploited extensively in explaining fixed income {{financial risk}} within specific parameters, assumptions and data characteristics. In addition, most literature with regards to the usage of VaR has associated the measure with the assumption of normal distribution. Maintaining a normality assumption and failure to account for any financial time series imperfection will undoubtedly lead to underestimating or overestimating VaR and should the risk of heavy-tailed events fail to be quantified, the financial distress implications of trader’s actions will not be captured accurately. This paper highlights the proposition to fill the gap in the knowledge of financial risk measures by adding a new parameter dimension to the quantification of VaR for fixed income securities. This will be done by extending the measure through the inclusion of several volatility models under a different assumption of return distribution. The new dimension includes associating VaR estimation based on Bayesian distribution. Within this new parameter dimension, the <b>financial</b> <b>risk</b> <b>modelling</b> for the fixed income securities should be able to portray the actual traits of the return thus providing more accurate financial risk estimatio...|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{quantifying}} financial risks, risk managers need to model the behavior of financial variables. However, the construction of such mathematical models is a difficult task that requires careful statistical approaches. Among the important choices that must be addressed,we can list the error distribution, {{the structure of the}} variance process, the relationship between parameters of interest and explanatory variables. In particular, one may avoid procedures that rely either on too rigid parametric assumptions or on inefficient estimation procedures. In this thesis, we develop statistical procedures that tackle some of these issues, in the context of three <b>financial</b> <b>risk</b> <b>modelling</b> applications. In the first application, we are interested in selecting the error distribution in a multiplicative heteroscedastic model without relying on a parametric volatility assumption. To avoid this uncertainty, we develop a set of model estimation and selection tests relying on nonparametric volatility estimators and focusing on the tails of the distribution. We illustrate this technique on UBS, BOVESPA and EUR/USD daily stock returns. In the second application, we are concerned by modeling the tail of the operational losses severity distribution, conditionally to several covariates. We develop a flexible conditional GPD model, where the shape parameter is an unspecified link function (nonparametric part) of a linear combination of covariates (single index part), avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We apply successfully this technique on two original databases, using macroeconomic and firm-specific variables as covariates. In the last application, we provide an efficient way to estimate the predictive ability of trading algorithms. Instead of relying on subjective and noisy sample splitting techniques, we propose an adaptation of the. 632 bootstrap technique to the time series context.

To improve on the previous Three-Factor Asset Pricing Model, Fama and French (2015) propose a new Five-Factor Model, adding portfolio factors that mimic profitability and investment patterns in stock returns. With limited testing of this model carried out so far, further testing is required to determine how effective the model is at explaining excess returns. Chapter- 1 of this thesis uses Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression and Quantile Regression (QR) (Koenker 2 ̆ 6 Bassett, 1978) to examine the effectiveness of this new factor model in modelling excess returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent stocks around the mean and across various quantiles of the return distribution.

40|$|Financial {{investments}} in large scale engineering sectors {{are subject to}} a variety of risks which affect the productivity and the profitability of the industry in the long run. Therefore, it is essential to quantify these risks and build mathematical models for analysis, so that better and more informed decisions can be made. This PhD research work focuses on the <b>financial</b> <b>risk</b> <b>modelling</b> of raw materials production engineering facilities and applies the developed concepts and tools to mining and mineral processing. These sectors are specifically chosen as {{there are a lot of}} operational, environmental and other site specific hazards involved and at present there is no streamlined methodology for financial risk assessment. The approach developed in this research uses heuristic methods and expert inputs and is given a quantitative foundation using a robust modelling technique with an engineering basis, as opposed to the qualitative and subjective methods currently employed. Current methods of estimating risk or forecasting future contingencies rely only on past historical data of failure and insurance claims. These often miss out on the finer details of the specific process and grossly over or under estimate the risks. Many other modelling techniques based on conservation laws employ mass balance and material flow through the whole process chain to obtain a more accurate model. However, the process systems data for mass and material flows through each component of the system is difficult to obtain and in many cases is a trade secret. Thus, it is difficult for an independent assessor or an external insurer to have a clear impression of the risk involved in the operation. The modelling techniques developed in this research aim to identify an optimal balance between these two extremes and handle missing or inaccessible information in the process flow chain. As such, and beyond its academic value, the work is of significant practical value and especially useful for insurance underwriters, financial risk managers, business consultants and the raw materials production systems operators. The thesis describes the development of a novel risk modelling tool based on a systems engineering approach. The risk model uses finite state machines with a set of logic for transitioning between the different states of the system. The flexibility of the systems risk modelling tool allows for features like incorporation of maintenance schedules, modelling of storage elements, redundancy schemes etc. which are implemented and validated with short case studies. These bespoke model refinements are useful for the process systems studied in this thesis. The work presented next then describes how elements from queuing theory have been integrated with the proposed risk modelling methodology. This is especially useful for process systems which can be naturally modelled as a combination of servers and queues (e. g. transportation networks, automated manufacturing operations, computer networks etc.). A validation study is carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The systems based risk modelling methodology, is augmented with fuzzy logic for incorporating expert knowledge and handling the uncertainties in the model parameters. This is of practical use as it allows for risk quantification in cases where only qualitative inputs are available from an external risk assessor. Next, a Bayesian network based formalism is coupled with the systems level risk model for incorporating the effects of catastrophic risks. This allows for situations where information for the various parameters are partially available. Validation studies are conducted on both the fuzzy and Bayesian augmented risk frameworks to show the effective working of both methodologies. Finally, the developed risk modelling tools are used to characterise the risk profiles of a mineral processing operation and various mining operations. The research would help investors and insurers in the mining and mineral processing sector to make appropriate investment decisions, by quantitative assessment of the risk factors, and hence minimise financial losses. It would also be useful for the management of the process operation to identify the bottlenecks in the system and propose appropriate risk mitigation strategies for the same. To this end, a multi-objective optimisation is also done to obtain various Pareto optimal risk vs. reliability tradeoffs for the mineral processing operation. Since the modelling paradigm used is a generic one, it is expected that it can easily be adapted to other scenarios and would be of benefit for modelling financial risks in other industrial domains.

40|$|International audienceThis book {{provides}} {{a perspective on}} a number of approaches to <b>financial</b> <b>modelling</b> and <b>risk</b> management. It examines both theoretical and practical issues. Theoretically, <b>financial</b> <b>risks</b> <b>models</b> are models of a real and a financial “uncertainty”, based on both common and private information and economic theories defining the rules that financial markets comply to. Financial models are thus challenged by their definitions and by a changing financial system fueled by globalization, technology growth, complexity, regulation and the many factors that contribute to rendering financial processes to be continuously questioned and re-assessed. The underlying mathematical foundations of <b>financial</b> <b>risks</b> <b>models</b> provide future guidelines for <b>risk</b> <b>modeling.</b> The book’s chapters provide selective insights and developments that can contribute to better understand the complexity of financial modelling and its ability to bridge financial theories and their practice. Future Perspectives in <b>Risk</b> <b>Models</b> and Finance begins with an extensive outline by Alain Bensoussan et al. of GLM estimation techniques combined with proofs of fundamental results. Applications to static and dynamic models provide a unified approach to the estimation of nonlinear <b>risk</b> <b>models.</b> A second section is concerned with the definition of risks and their management. In particular, Guegan and Hassani review a number of <b>risk</b> <b>models</b> definition emphasizing the importance of bi-modal distributions for financial regulation. An additional chapter {{provides a}} review of stress testing and their implications. Nassim Taleb and Sandis provide an anti-fragility approach based on “skin in the game”. To conclude, Raphael Douady discusses the noncyclical CAR (Capital Adequacy Rule) and their effects of aversion of systemic risks. A third section emphasizes analytic financial modelling approaches and techniques. Tapiero and Vallois provide an overview of mathematical systems and their use in financial modeling. These systems span the fundamental Arrow-Debreu framework underlying financial models of complete markets and subsequently, mathematical systems departing from this framework but yet generalizing their approach to dynamic financial models. Explicitly, models based on fractional calculus, on persistence (short memory) and on entropy-based non-extensiveness. Applications of these models are used to define a modeling approach to incomplete financial models and their potential use as a “measure of incompleteness”.
