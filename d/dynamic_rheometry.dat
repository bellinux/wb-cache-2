40|$|The co-assembly of {{mutually}} complementary, but self-repulsive oligopeptide pairs into viscoelastic hydrogels {{has been}} studied. Oligopeptides of 6, 10, and 14 amino acid residues {{were used to}} investigate the effects of peptide chain length on the structural and mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogels. Biophysical characterizations, including <b>dynamic</b> <b>rheometry,</b> small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and fluorescence spectroscopy, were used to investigate hydrogelation at the bulk, fiber, and molecular levels, respectively. Upon mixing, the 10 -mer peptides and the 14 -mer peptides both form hydrogels while the 6 -mer peptides do not. SAXS studies point to morphological similarity of the cross-sections of fibers underlying the 10 : 10 and 14 : 14 gels. However, fluorescence spectroscopy data suggest tighter packing of the amino acid side chains in the 10 : 10 fibers. Consistent with this tighter packing, <b>dynamic</b> <b>rheometry</b> data show that the 10 : 10 gel has much higher elastic modulus than the 14 : 14 -mer (18 kPa vs. 0. 1 kPa). Therefore, {{from the standpoint of}} mechanical strength, the optimum peptide chain length for this class of oligopeptide-based hydrogels is around 10 amino acid residues. © 2010, Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E

This is due to a lack of understanding of some fundamental questions related to the polymer nanocomposite technology. Despite recent progresses, open questions remain such as the nanofiller/matrix compatibilisation, the control of the filler dispersion of the nanocomposite under thermomechanical solicitations (processing conditions), the relationship between the level of filler dispersion and the mechanical properties [...] . In this presentation, two of these points will be discussed. In a first part, the use of <b>dynamic</b> <b>rheometry</b> to probe the filler dispersion will be discussed.

Nanocomposites are based on organomodified montmorillonite (OMMT) dispersed in an isotactic polypropylene (PP) matrix compatibilized by a polypropylene grafted with maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA). Nanocomposites are obtained using a ThermoFischer PTW 24 co-rotating twin-screw extruder, by dilution of a masterbatch into the PP matrix down to the composition 85 / 10 / 5 wt% PP/PP-g-MA/OMMT. The effect of different extrusion parameters (feed rate, screw speed, barrel temperature for a fixed extrusion screw profile) on the final dispersion state is investigated. The nanocomposite structure is characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electronic microscopy (SEM and MET) and <b>dynamic</b> <b>rheometry.</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>rheometry</b> is well adapted to probe the microstructure of nanocomposites. Depending on the nanoclay state (from intercalated to fully exfoliated), the rheological behavior lies between a liquid-like and a solid-like one. The solid-like behavior is associated to the presence of a 3 D structure where the nanoclay platelets and tactoids form a more or less soft network. The complex viscosity curve of such a material is well-fitted by a Carreau-Yasuda law with a yield stress. The yield stress is a good and unique indicator of the exfoliation state. We will also see that the microstructure of these materials is not stable and evolves with time. Sample preparation conditions are thus critical in order to properly characterize the microstructure when using the yield stress as a probing parameter to compare nanocomposites prepared in different conditions. The effect of extrusion parameters such as screw speed, feed rate and barrel temperature on the nanocomposite structure will be examined in a second part. The nanocomposite structure appears to be controlled by the specific mechanical energy up to a critical value. Results will be discussed...|$|E

The peptide fragment, FFKLVFF is based on fragment KLVFF of the amyloid beta-peptide, A beta(16 - 20), extended by two hydrophobic phenylalanine units. This is conjugated to PEG which confers water solubility and leads to distinct self-assembled structures. Small-angle scattering reveals the formation of cylindrical fibrils comprising a peptide core and PEG corona.

Circular dichroism and FTIR spectroscopy show that the self-assembly of both peptides at low concentration is dominated by interactions among Fmoc units, although Fmoc-GRDS shows beta-sheet features, at lower concentration than Fmoc-RGDS. Fibre X-ray diffraction indicates beta-sheet formation by both peptides at sufficiently high concentration. Strong alignment effects are revealed by linear dichroism experiments for Fmoc-GRDS.

The fractal concept {{has been applied}} to describe the structure development of barley β-glucan gels using a scaling model and <b>dynamic</b> <b>rheometry</b> data. The model supports that the gel structure consists of fractal clusters that upon aggregation lead to a three-dimensional network. The analysis showed that with increasing Mw a denser (more packed) network is formed as indicated by the corresponding fractal dimension (df) values. The microelastic parameter of the model, α, showed that all gel structures were in the transition regime implying structural reordering upon ageing. The description of the microstructure as a fractal network seems to be able to explain syneresis and other observations from large deformation testing of such systems. The molecular treatment of the gelation kinetics suggests that the gelling behavior is governed by the probability of collision of chain fragments with consecutive cellotriosyl units. This is greater for small chains due to their higher diffusion rates, for chains having lower amounts of cellulose like fragments and finally for those showing smaller degree of intrachain interactions.

Addition of nanofiller such as organomodified montmorillonite layered clay (OMMT) is mostly {{used to enhance}} tensile, impact and barrier properties of the neat matrix. Initial clay agglomerates need to be finely dispersed within the matrix during the process in order to form exfoliated nanostructures. Interactions between non polar thermoplastics such as polyolefins and organomodified clay are usually promoted {{by the presence of}} a compatibilizer. Maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MA) is generally used in the case of polypropylene matrix (PP). Besides the need to use a compatibilizer, a good state of dispersion and distribution of the clay requires optimized processing conditions. Many studies have focused on the influence of nanocomposite formulations on their final properties, but few have paid attention to the nanostructure sensitivity to processing conditions.

Phase continuity was first determined using selective solvent extraction. Subsequently, <b>dynamic</b> stress <b>rheometry</b> and <b>dynamic</b> mechanical analysis were used to detect the co-continuity and phase inversion compositions in the melt and the solid states. It appears that the phase inversion occurs in a domain rather than at a single point. The evaluation of the storage modulus of PP/PS blends in the melt at a constant low frequency gives information about the co-continuity, as far as the onset of co-continuity and phase inversion composition of the PS phase are concerned. The evaluation of the storage modulus and mechanical loss factor at a constant high temperature, or the glass transition temperature intensity allowed to precisely detect the phase inversion composition. The fractionated or bulk crystallization behavior of the crystallizable PP phase in the PP/PS blends can also be used to identify the matrix/dispersed phase or co-continuous phase morphology.

Gel R 10 with highest cross-linker content (9. 1 mol% MBA) behaves anomalously due to heterogeneity and the hindered conformation of the side chains of PNIPAAm...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the occurrence of}} bile salt hydrolase in fourteen strains belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium. Deconjugation activity was detected using a plate test, two-step enzymatic reaction and activity staining on a native polyacrylamide gel. Subsequently, bile salt hydrolases from B. pseudocatenulatum and B. longum subsp. suis were purified using a two-step chromatographic procedure. Biochemical characterization of the bile salt hydrolases showed that the purified enzymes hydrolyzed all of the six major human bile salts under the pH and temperature conditions commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract. Next, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>rheometry</b> was applied to monitor the gelation process of deoxycholic acid under different conditions. The results showed that bile acids displayed aqueous media gelating properties. Finally, gel-forming abilities of bifidobacteria exhibiting bile salt hydrolase activity were analyzed. Our investigations have demonstrated that the release of deconjugated bile acids led to the gelation phenomenon of the enzymatic reaction solution containing purified BSH. The presented results suggest that bile salt hydrolase activity commonly found among intestinal microbiota increases hydrogel-forming abilities of certain bile salts. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report showing that bile salt hydrolase activity among Bifidobacterium is directly connected with the gelation process of bile salts. In our opinion, if such a phenomenon occurs in physiological conditions of human gut, it may improve bacterial ability to colonize the gastrointestinal tract and their survival in this specific ecological niche...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePolyhydroxyurethanes (PHUs) {{produced}} by the reaction between dicyclocarbonate and diamine groups are often presented as possible candidates to substitute for classical polyurethanes based on isocyanate precursors. In the literature, the synthesis of this class of polymers is often performed according to arbitrary conditions of time and temperature without any scientific justification. As such, the real potential of PHUs is probably not fully known. Numerous contradictions in previously published results seem to support this hypothesis. Our paper proposes two methodologies based on <b>dynamic</b> <b>rheometry</b> to determine optimized conditions for the synthesis of PHUs. The case of a PHU formed by the reaction between 1, 10 -diaminodecane and a dicyclocarbonate bearing a central aromatic group is described more precisely. The first approach consists of conducting various rheological experiments (kinetics, thermomechanical analyses) in situ on the reaction mixture. The second one retains the same technique to qualify the viscoelastic properties of PHUs synthesized according to various conditions. In this latter case, all samples show thermomechanical behaviour of amorphous thermoplastic polymers. But discrepancies are observed {{with regard to the}} value of the glass transition temperature and the existence or not of a rubbery zone. Comparison of these data with size exclusion chromatography results shows that these differences are direct consequences of the polymer molecular weight that can be predicted using macromolecular theory. The properties of the PHUs obtained after optimization of the polymerization reaction were compared with literature data in order to complete the evaluation of the efficiency of the rheological methodology...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDiallyl orthophthalate (DAOP) {{has been}} used as a {{reactive}} plasticizer for polycarbonate (PC) due to the low reactivity and high conversion at the gel point of DAOP and its high solubility in PC. Miscible blends of PC with various ratios of DAOP have been investigated using gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, <b>rheometry,</b> <b>dynamic</b> mechanical thermal analysis and optical microscopy (with and without polarised light), and the experimental results have shown that DAOP can act as an effective plasticizer in PC processing by lowering the melt viscosity, the melting and the crystallisation temperatures, and by reducing the glass transition temperature of the blend. However, the molecular mobility provided to the PC chains by DAOP causes crystallisation of the PC as shown by optical microscopy and DSC and this places limits on the potential reduction in the processing temperature of the blend...|$|R
40|$|The non-Newtonian flow {{properties}} of the wormlike surfactant system, cetyl pyridinium chloride/sodium salicylate in water, have been studied using <b>dynamic</b> and steady <b>rheometry</b> and nuclear magnetic resonance velocity imaging. The NMR measurements of velocity profiles across a 5. 0  mm diameter glass tube reveal a discontinuity in the flow behaviour, once a critical shear strain rate of around 1  s- 1 is exceeded, {{a manifestation of the}} so-called “spurt effect". Rheological measurements show that three characteristic regimes are observed. Below 0. 2  s- 1 the system is near-Newtonian. Between 0. 2 and 0. 8  s- 1, shear-thinning behaviour is observed. Above this a multi-valued shear-rate regime is found at constant stress. This “spurt" regime exhibits shear rates up to values of around 50 to 100  s- 1, at which an upturn in the shear stress is found. The rheological flow curves are characteristic of those predicted by a Wagner model and in turn are found to be broadly consistent with the velocity profiles as measured by NMR...|$|R
40|$|Mucus {{obstruction}} of the airway {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF) reduces lung function, invites infection, and limits delivery of inhaled drugs including gene therapy vectors to target cells. Not all patients respond to presently available mucolytics, and new approaches are needed. Our objectives were to investigate the in vitro effects of unfractionated heparin (UFH) on the morphology and rheology of sputum {{and the effect of}} UFH on diffusion of 200 -nm nanospheres through sputum from adult CF patients. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to image fluorescently stained actin and DNA components of CF sputum, and atomic force microscopy was used to image isolated DNA networks. The viscoelasticity of CF sputum was measured using <b>dynamic</b> oscillatory <b>rheometry.</b> Nanosphere diffusion was measured through CF sputum using a Boyden chamber-based assay. Actin-DNA bundles in CF sputum were disaggregated by UFH at concentrations of 0. 1 - 10 mg/ml, and UFH enhanced the endonuclease activity in sputum from patients on dornase alfa therapy. UFH significantly reduced the elasticity and yield stress, but not the viscosity, of CF sputum from patients not receiving dornase alfa therapy. Heparin dose-dependently significantly increased the diffusion of nanospheres through CF sputum from patients not on dornase alfa therapy from 10. 5 +/- 2. 5 % at baseline to 36. 9 +/- 4. 4 % at 10 mg/ml but was more potent, with maximal effect at 0. 1 mg/ml, in patients who were on dornase alfa therapy. Thus the mucoactive properties of UFH indicate its potential as a new therapeutic approach in patients with cystic fibrosis...|$|R
