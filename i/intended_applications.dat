5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{projectile}} potentially poses {{less risk}} of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, {{as well as}} risk of ricochet. The lightweight projectile also poses less risk of collateral damage {{in the event of}} a miss, because it loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (437yd), whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (875yd). This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge's <b>intended</b> <b>applications,</b> so the cartridge's limited energy at long range is not conversely considered to be disadvantageous.|$|E

Since the SS190 projectile does not rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a hollow point, the cartridge (and 5.7×28mm weapons) is considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of expanding bullets in warfare.|$|E
500|$|The {{reactivity}} of niobium with oxygen requires {{it to be}} worked in a vacuum or inert atmosphere, which significantly increases the cost and difficulty of production. [...] Vacuum arc remelting (VAR) and electron beam melting (EBM), novel processes at the time, enabled the development of niobium and other reactive metals. [...] The project that yielded C-103 began in 1959 {{with as many as}} 256 experimental niobium alloys in the [...] "C-series" [...] (possibly from columbium) that could be melted as buttons and rolled into sheet. [...] Wah Chang had an inventory of hafnium, refined from nuclear-grade zirconium alloys, that it wanted to put to commercial use. [...] The 103rd experimental composition of the C-series alloys, Nb-10Hf-1Ti, had the best combination of formability and high-temperature properties. Wah Chang fabricated the first 500-lb heat of C-103 in 1961, ingot to sheet, using EBM and VAR. The <b>intended</b> <b>applications</b> included turbine engines and liquid metal heat exchangers. [...] Competing niobium alloys from that era included FS85 (Nb-10W-28Ta-1Zr) from Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., Cb129Y (Nb-10W-10Hf-0.2Y) from Wah Chang and Boeing, Cb752 (Nb-10W-2.5Zr) from Union Carbide, and Nb1Zr from Superior Tube Co.|$|E

2500|$|Natural light, {{and most}} other common sources of visible light, are incoherent: {{radiation}} is produced independently by {{a large number of}} atoms or molecules whose emissions are uncorrelated and generally of random polarizations. In this case the light is said to be unpolarized. This term is somewhat inexact, since at any instant of time at one location there is a definite direction to the electric and magnetic fields, however it implies that the polarization changes so quickly in time that it will not be measured or relevant to the outcome of an experiment. [...] A so-called depolarizer acts on a polarized beam to create one which is actually fully polarized at every point, but in which the polarization varies so rapidly across the beam that it may be ignored in the <b>intended</b> <b>applications.</b>|$|E
