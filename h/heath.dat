The fauna of the lowland <b>heath</b> includes the <b>heath</b> fritillary (Mellicta athalia), a nationally rare butterfly.

40|$|The {{ecology and}} {{phytosociology}} of north-western Dinaric <b>heaths</b> {{of the association}} Rhododendro hirsuti-Juniperetum alpinae Horvat ex Horvat et al. 1974 nom. corr. prop. {{as well as the}} syndynamics and synsystematics of <b>heaths</b> in the Dinaric Alps are discussed. While the structure (physiognomy) of these stands is very homogenous and dominated by few species, the flora is heterogeneous, since ecotonal areas, where <b>heaths</b> are most frequently developed, represent a contact zone of elements of different syntaxa. Due to an abrupt reduction in pasture activities strong encroachments of shrubs and trees have become common, which additionally contribute to the floristic heterogeneity of the <b>heaths.</b> Although the identification and circumscription together with synecology and synchorology of <b>heaths</b> in general are more or less easily understood and straightforward, their floristic affinities, in relation to structure homogeneity and syndynamics, are complicated, which led to the proposal of several synsystematic schemes depending on interpretation of the relationship between flora and structure of stands. Dinaric <b>heaths</b> are classified into three classes, Erico-Pinetea, Vaccinio-Piceetea and Festuco-Brometea and a classification scheme is proposed together with nomenclatorial revision of the analyzed <b>heaths</b> with dwarf ericaceous shrubs and Alpine juniper (Juniperus alpina) in the Dinaric Alps...|$|R

5|$|Wilson's small {{majority}} {{after the}} 1964 general election {{had made the}} transaction of government business difficult, and in 1966 he called another election in which Labour gained a strong working majority of 96. Some older members of Heath's team, including Lloyd, retired from the front bench, making room {{for members of the}} next generation. <b>Heath</b> moved Maudling to the foreign affairs portfolio, and Douglas-Home took over Lloyd's responsibilities as spokesman on Commonwealth relations. <b>Heath</b> was widely seen as ineffective against Wilson, and as the 1970 general election approached there was concern within the party that he would lose, and that Powell would seek to replace him as leader. Maudling and the chief whip, William Whitelaw, believed that if <b>Heath</b> had to resign Douglas-Home would be the safest candidate to keep Powell out. Douglas-Home shared their view that Labour would win the 1970 election, and that <b>Heath</b> might then have to resign, but he declined to commit himself. To the surprise of almost everyone except <b>Heath,</b> the Conservatives won the election, with a majority of 31 seats.|$|E

5|$|A {{research}} chemist {{before becoming}} a barrister, Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959.

5|$|A {{study of}} coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes found B.aemula grew on ridges (dry <b>heath)</b> and B. oblongifolia on slopes (wet <b>heath),</b> {{and the two}} species did not overlap. Manipulation of {{seedlings}} in the same study area showed that B. aemula grows longer roots seeking water and that seedlings do grow in wet <b>heath,</b> but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in wet <b>heath</b> as well as dry <b>heath.</b> Unlike similar situations with banksia species in Western Australia, the two species {{did not appear to}} impact negatively on each other. A field study on seedling recruitment conducted at Broadwater National Park and Dirrawong Reserve on the New South Wales North Coast showed that generally Banksia aemula produced seedlings in low numbers but the attrition rate was low, and that seedlings had a greater survival rate on dry rather than wet heaths. Field work including the experimental planting out of seedlings at Crowdy Bay National Park showed that Banksia aemula seedling roots reach the water table within six months of germination, and that they can germinate in {{the presence or absence of}} recent bushfire. The reasons for bradyspory (that is fewer seeds with greater percentage of survival) is unclear, but may be a defence against seed-eating animals. Similarly in field work on North Stradbroke Island, B.aemula was noted to shed its winged seeds over time between (as well as after) fire, and germinate and grow readily with little predation by herbivores.|$|E

5|$|After narrow {{defeat in}} the general {{election}} of 1964, Douglas-Home resigned the leadership of his party, having instituted a new and less secretive method of electing the party leader.

5|$|As Leader of the Opposition, Douglas-Home persuaded Macleod and Powell {{to rejoin}} the Conservative front bench. Within weeks of the general {{election}} Butler retired from politics, accepting the post of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge together with a life peerage. Douglas-Home did not immediately allocate shadow portfolios to his colleagues, but in January 1965 he gave Maudling the foreign affairs brief and <b>Heath</b> became spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs. There was no immediate pressure for Douglas-Home {{to hand over the}} leadership to a member of the younger generation, but by early 1965 a new Conservative group called PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism) had discreetly begun to call for a change. Douglas-Home either did not know, or chose to ignore, the fact that <b>Heath</b> had made a donation to PEST. He decided that the time was coming for him to retire as leader, with <b>Heath</b> as his preferred successor.|$|E
