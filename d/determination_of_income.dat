In any given region, {{the welfare of}} all workers is increasing in the share of skilled workers, as after-tax incomes increase for both skilled and unskilled workers. When skilled workers are more geographically mobile than unskilled ones, the endogenous response of redistribution policy can induce regional agglomeration of skilled workers. We also find that the equilibrium features symmetry-breaking if migration costs are relatively low; and that worker mobility tends to amplify pre-existing welfare differences in income and welfare across regions.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis explores {{labour supply}} on {{the example of}} small and medium enterprises in the Czech Republic. It contrasts two basic hypoteses - the hypothesis of daily targeting and the intertemporal substitution hypothesis. The hypothesis of daily targeting is based on <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> which workers try to achieve. On the other hand, the intertemporal substitution hypotesis assumes that hours worked depend on wage rate. I have used the survey to obtain monthly data of work hours and earned wage by Czech entrepreneurs. Based on the obtained data I have tested two hypotheses. Wage elasticities have positive values which lead to rejection the hypothesis of daily targeting. I have offered several possible explanations of obtained conclusions. One {{of them is the}} focus of entrepreneurs on accumulation of capital and wealth as the main motivation for business. This is related to recent economic transition in the Czech Republic...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presents}} {{a survey of}} five different approaches to retirement decision analysis. Simple life cycle labour supply model leads to a classical optimization problem of choice between work and leisure, but it is highly limited in explaining retirement decision as a static approach. Comparative static version of this model enables the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> wealth and social security on retirement decisions, but does not include neither the preference parameters of the individual or the expected value of future income flows. Merely the first problem can be solved by the reservation wage approach, but both problems are soluble by implementing a dynamic programming model. As {{an alternative to the}} latter, an option value approach is also discussed, which highly decreases the complexity, but does not lose a lot of reliability of the dynamic programming model. ageing, dynamic programming model, early retirement, income effect, labour force participation, life cycle labour supply model, option value approach, pension, reservation wage, retirement decision, social security, substitution effect...|$|E

In all cases, the answers given by Peronist voters (relative to those given by the opposition) are similar to the answers given by Republicans (relative to the democrats).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} a major channel {{through which}} financialization or finance-dominated capitalism affects macroeconomic performance: the distribution channel. Empirical {{data for the}} following dimensions of redistribution {{in the period of}} finance-dominated capitalism since the early 1980 s is provided for 15 advanced capitalist economies: functional distribution, personal/household distribution, and the share and composition of top incomes. Based on the Kaleckian approach to the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> shares, the effects of financialization on functional income distribution are studied in more detail. Some stylized facts of financialization are integrated into the Kaleckian approach, and by means of reviewing empirical and econometric literature it is found that financialization and neoliberalism have contributed to the falling labor income share since the early 1980 s through three main Kaleckian channels: (1) a shift in the sectoral composition of the economy; (2) an increase in management salaries and rising profit claims of the rentiers, and thus in overheads; and (3) weakened trade union bargaining power...|$|E
