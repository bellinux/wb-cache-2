500|$|Squidward has {{received}} positive reception from critics and fans. SpongeBob's voice actor Tom Kenny named Squidward his favorite character on the show. He said, [...] "He has an extra dimension where SpongeBob and Patrick's capacity of play mystifies him, but he's also jealous of it. When {{he tries to}} participate, he just fails utterly because he doesn't believe in it." [...] Staff writer Casey Alexander said, [...] "Squidward is the character I relate to the most. In an exaggerated way, he's the most human character. If <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> human like SpongeBob, I probably would react to him like Squidward does". American singer Pharrell Williams, who says he {{is a fan of}} the show, said that [...] "Squidward is my favorite, though. If he was a human, I would hang out with him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alan Dower Blumlein {{was born}} on 29 June 1903 in Hampstead, London, to Semmy Blumlein, a German-born naturalised British subject. Semmy was born to Joseph Blumlein, a German of Jewish descent, and Phillippine Hellmann, a French woman of German descent. Alan's mother, Jessie Dower, was Scottish, {{daughter}} of a missionary.

2500|$|Having {{the home}} {{recording}} system also proved useful for production, the band {{felt that it}} would not only benefit themselves, but other local bands who could not afford the studio prices, even in the Welwyn Garden City area. It was here that Billy and Charlotte both stumbled upon the opportunity that would eventually prove significant for the band. [...] "I was producing a local Welwyn Garden City band in my front lounge one day and I noticed that it was quite good so I asked {{if they were going to}} send it to any London venues, because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> few that would like it. They said that they were going to send it off to Michael Eavis who runs Glastonbury Festival, and I asked why..." [...] Michael Eavis that year was running an unsigned bands competition to play on the Other Stage, and The Subways decided that would be a great idea. [...] "It was really just another address to send one of our CDs off to. All we wanted was to play shows and this was another great opportunity. The CD we sent off to Michael Eavis was literally one among a bunch of 30 that were being sent out to London promoters for a load of gigs we wanted to book. We never expected the phone call saying that we'd won and were to play Glastonbury", said Cooper on radio. The Subways remain friends with Eavis today, and have suggested that other upcoming bands should send demos to Eavis.|$|E
