40|$|Abstract Spatio-temporal {{aggregation}} of observed or predicted {{values for}} environmental phenomena {{is needed for}} fusing sensor data or coupling sensors and <b>environmental</b> <b>models.</b> However, estimates from sensors or <b>environmental</b> <b>models</b> can never represent our world precisely and are subject to errors. Hence, there is uncertainty in the estimates {{that needs to be}} considered in <b>environmental</b> <b>model</b> workflows. This chapter presents an approach for an error-aware spatio-temporal aggregation in the Web, where probabilistic uncertainties are used within a Monte Carlo simulation. The approach is applied in a Web-based model chain that pro-vides uncertain crop yield predictions on field parcel level that are aggregated to larger regions. ...|$|R

To allow the Web Map Service (WMS) to support this, this paper explores a generic framework in which a dynamic <b>environmental</b> <b>modeling</b> process can be interactively visualized, controlled and tuned on the Internet by using Java 3 D-based hybrid Internet computation through the simulation steering technique. A hydrological model, TOPMODEL, is employed to illustrate the simulation of a rainfall-run off process within a computational and steering environment.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{summarizes}} {{research for}} generating explanations from <b>environmental</b> <b>models.</b> We {{make use of}} the corresponding representation of the <b>environmental</b> <b>models</b> as constraint satisfaction problems. We show how this representation can be used directly to derive explanations. During the whole paper we use a coarse model which represents the relationship between the ground-level ozone concentration and its influencing quantities like traffic, industrial emissions, and meteorological conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the roles of}} different <b>environmental</b> <b>models</b> on quantum correlation dynamics of two-qubit composite system interacting with two independent environments. The most common <b>environmental</b> <b>models</b> (the single-Lorentzian model, the squared-Lorentzian model, the two-Lorentzian model and band-gap model) are analyzed. First, we note that for the weak coupling regime, the monotonous decay speed of the quantum correlation is mainly determined by the spectral density functions of these different environments. Then, by considering the strong coupling regime we find that, contrary to what is stated in the weak coupling regime, the dynamics of quantum correlation depends on the non-Markovianity of the <b>environmental</b> <b>models,</b> and is independent of the environmental spectrum density functions.

40|$|In the <b>environmental</b> field, <b>modeling</b> plays a {{critical}} role in connecting current data and knowledge with predictions of future events and environmental states. Environmental problems are quite challenging to solve because of the complex relationships among many contributing factors, both natural and man-made. Moreover, these problems need to be addressed not only by environmental engineers and regulators but also by a larger community consisting of concerned members of the public and nongovernmental organizations. Their demands on <b>environmental</b> <b>modeling</b> often conflict because predictions need to be accurate yet easily understood, communicated, and explored. The requirements for <b>environmental</b> <b>modeling</b> are generally identified as accuracy, defensibility, transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness. An approach to meet these requirements based on layered components, role assignments, and flexible integration strategies is identified, developed, and tested with prototypes. The results from the prototypes suggest possible enhancements for further advancing the use and communication of <b>environmental</b> <b>modeling.</b> Qualitative comparisons with other approaches are framed with identified criteria...|$|R

5000|$|The use of {{the methods}} {{underlying}} shared vision planning is now more widespread than the name itself. Robert Costanza, {{the director of the}} Gund Institute for Ecological Economics, has used STELLA models in environmental and economic modeling since 1987. The International <b>Environmental</b> <b>Modelling</b> and Software Society (iEMSs), which Dr. Costanza co-founded, has as its goal the development and use of <b>environmental</b> <b>modelling</b> and software tools to advance the science and improve decision making with respect to resource and environmental issues. Many iEMSs members have developed approaches similar to shared vision planning without any apparent awareness of the Corps' work, which is perhaps a testament to its soundness. [...] "Mediated Modeling" [...] describes a systems based participatory modeling approach to environmental issues that is very similar to shared vision planning but has typically been used as a learning tool, especially for stakeholders who might otherwise be left out of public policy dialogues.|$|E
