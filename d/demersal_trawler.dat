The paper {{presents}} a vessel level simulation {{model of the}} impact of a landing obligation on a typical Scottish <b>demersal</b> <b>trawler</b> under a discard ban in addition to existing quota management controls. The simulation model is based on a simple microeconomic model of firm behaviour and predicts landings, discards and trip profits in response to the imposition of a landing obligation for different target species. The model can be used to predict the effects of a landing obligation under different assumptions about the enforcement of both the discard ban and quota controls...|$|E
40|$|As quota {{and fishing}} effort {{restrictions}} become tighter, and fuel costs spiral, {{it is likely}} that fishing time will further reduce and therefore the design pressure on fishing vessels of the future will be to improve efficiency when steaming and to retain optimum thrust when trawling. Rules and regulations have shaped our modern trawlers. The necessary fullness for carrying fish is accentuated by the imposition of restrictions in length. While it is generally accepted that there is a penalty in fuel consumption relating to this evolution this study sets out to quantify it. This paper describes the development of a “green trawler” designed to incorporate the highest level of efficiency available in a practical form for use in the demersal fishing fleet. Results from field tests on existing trawlers and towing tank tests on the green trawler design are presented. Comparison is made between a typical <b>demersal</b> <b>trawler,</b> at sea and in the test tank, and the green trawler. The model tests were designed to confirm that the design concept was fuel efficient; and to determine the potential for increased fuel efficiency if certain regulatory restrictions on fishing vessel design parameters were lifted. Savings of 30 % on fuel consumption could be achieved with relatively modest length increases. Additional savings of 10 to 20 % can be achieved by reducing the drag of hull appendages, for example, better alignment of bilge keels. The study concludes by introducing the concept of “Green Tonnage” as an option that should be considered by the EU and Member States, whereby vessel owners would be allowed additional GT’s for new builds over and above existing limits without being penalized. This should be strictly on the basis that no increase in effective fishing effort results...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} use of <b>demersal</b> <b>trawler</b> {{discards}} by scavenging seabirds at one location in the western Mediterranean (Benidorm, SE Spain) {{from the end of}} June to the beginning of October 2000. Yellow-legged gull and Cory's shearwater were the most common species in the study area (52. 35 %, 35. 49 %) and behind boats (82. 4 %, 7. 07 %). Eight other seabird species were observed in much lower numbers following boats (Audouin's gull 2. 6 %, black-headed gull 2. 3 %, sandwich 1. 5 %, black 0. 82 % and common terns 0. 97 %, Balearic shearwaters 1. 4 %, storm-petrel 0. 52 % and shags 0. 36 %). Yellow-legged gulls were present behind trawlers in higher numbers than might have been expected by its abundance at sea, whereas Cory's shearwaters were less so. The discarded fish (>discard>) comprised mainly of sardine (22. 4 %), flatfish (19. 1 %) and horse-mackerel (17. 3 %) and included fish of a small size (median 10. 5 cm) in the main. Yellow-legged gull made the largest use of discards, albeit lower than expected by its Presence Index. Average percentage consumption was about 54 % of the edible discards, suggesting that yellow-legged gulls were not highly efficient at catching >discard>. The average ratio of fish discarded over fish landed was ca. 65 %, although the range was very variable (23 - 175 %). Estimates of the energy requirements of yellow-legged gulls and >energy availability> from the ca. 8 tonnes of discard produced every fishing day, suggest that trawling waste was probably enough to support a local gull population four times larger than that present during the study period. © 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. In multi-species fisheries, {{technical}} and social interactions between different {{components of the}} fisheries can {{make it difficult to}} maximize economic yield. Furthermore, the different fish stocks contributing to the overall catch may present different levels of natural variability leading to difficulties in determining optimal management strategies. Bio-economic performances of multi-species fisheries being subject to high levels of biological and economic uncertainty, successful fisheries management should identify and cope with risk when assessing management strategies. In this paper, bio-socio-economic performances of various management strategies under uncertainty are studied based on the French fisheries in the Gulf of Lion in the Mediterranean Sea. These multi-species and multi-gear fisheries is divided here into three main components, one including <b>demersal</b> <b>trawlers</b> exploiting especially hake (Merluccius merluccius), one including pelagic trawlers used to be directed to the catch of small pelagic species (mainly anchovy Engraulis encrasicholus and sardine Sardina pilchardus) and recently reallocating effort on demersal species due to anchovy and sardine collapse and the other component consisting of small-scale fisheries. A multi-species, multi-gear bio-economic and stochastic model (Impact Assessment model for fisheries management, IAM) is used to explore the bio-socio-economic performances of the three different components of the fishery. Different management strategies are tested and compared in the context of change in fishing strategy of pelagic trawlers. Taking into account the interactions between pelagic and <b>demersal</b> <b>trawlers</b> {{on the one hand and}} trawlers and small-scale fisheries on the other hand, the trade-offs between biological and socio-economic indicators are quantified for the different management strategies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract To reduce fleet {{capacity}} in European fisheries {{is an important}} objective of the European Union’s Common Fisheries Policy. The success of such programmes depends both on the variation {{and the level of}} efficiency within the fishing fleets. If vessels with significantly lower efficiency level than average are decommissioned, the actual reduction in fishing capacity will be less than expected. Further, if the remaining vessels after a decommissioning program are not operating at an efficient level, future improvement in efficiency may even further offset the effects of the decommissioning program. This paper examines the level and determinants of technical efficiency for a sample of Swedish <b>demersal</b> <b>trawlers,</b> which mainly target Norway lobster but also shrimps and demersal fish in 1995. The data on per-trip gross revenues, fishing effort, gear choice, month of fishing and vessel attributes are analyzed using a translog stochastic production frontier, including a model for vessel-specific technical inefficiencies.

We attempt to minimize biases from the non-randomness of the catch and effort survey by interpolating CPUE, spatially and temporally, in un-sampled areas. The data are then standardized with a generalized linear model to obtain the time-series changes in relative catch rate during this period. Using multiple imputation analysis, we account for the uncertainty associated with the interpolated data. The CPUE of most of these species declined by over 70 % over the 15 -year period. CPUE of some intrinsically vulnerable groups such as skates and rays declined {{by an average of}} over 90 %. Based on their life history traits reported in published literature and FishBase, we calculate an index of intrinsic vulnerability from a published expert system for the 17 species groups and evaluate its relationship with the estimated declines in catch rate. The results support the hypothesis that the two variables are positively related (i. e., species with higher intrinsic vulnerability would have a stronger rate of decline). Thus, intrinsic vulnerability can be used to approximate the population status of other species in the region that are exploited by bottom trawlers...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} subsidies on the profitability and ecological stability of the North Sea fisheries over the past 20 years. It shows the negative impact that subsidies can have on both the biomass of important fish species and the possible profit from fisheries. The study includes subsidies in an ecosystem model of the North Sea and examines the possible effects of eliminating fishery subsidies. Methodology/Principal Findings: Hindcast analysis between 1991 and 2003 indicates that subsidies reduced the profitability of the fishery even though gross revenue might have been high for specific fisheries sectors. Simulations seeking to maximise the total revenue between 2004 and 2010 suggest {{that this can be}} achieved by increasing the effort of Nephrops trawlers, beam trawlers, and the pelagic trawl-and-seine fleet, while reducing the effort of <b>demersal</b> <b>trawlers.</b> Simulations show that ecological stability can be realised by reducing the effort of the beam trawlers, Nephrops <b>trawlers,</b> pelagic- and <b>demersal</b> trawl-and-seine fleets. This analysis also shows that when subsidies are included, effort will always be higher for all fleets, because it effectively reduces the cost of fishing. Conclusions/Significance: The study found that while removing subsidies might reduce the total catch and revenue, it increases the overall profitability of the fishery and the total biomass of commercially important species. For example, cod, haddock, herring and plaice biomass increased over the simulation when optimising for profit, and when optimising fo...|$|R
40|$|The feeding {{behaviour}} of two potentially competing species, the longspine snipefish, Macroramphosus scolopax, and the boarfish Capros aper was examined. While both species are very abundant along the Mediterranean coast and are regularly caught by <b>demersal</b> <b>trawlers,</b> {{they are of}} no commercial value. The diets of boarfish and longspine snipefish were investigated from samples collected between January 2001 and May 2002. Variations in the diet with fish size and season, as well as diet overlap and diversity were explored. Mysid shrimps, amphipods and gastropods {{were the most important}} food items in the diet of longspine snipefish. During ontogenetic development, M. scolopax occupies different trophic levels: the diet shifts from being predominantly composed of mysids (Anchialina agilis, Lophogaster typicus, Erythrops sp., Leptomysis spp.) in the smaller longspine snipefish [ 6. 5 cm TL). Crustacean decapods and copepods were the most important prey in the stomachs of boarfish. Mysids (Lo. typicus), euphausiids and nematodes were present in the larger individuals (> 8 cm TL). A more generalist diet, still containing copepods, crustacean decapods, gastropods (Limacina retroversa) and a large variety of amphipods (e. g. Phtysica marina, Stenotoe bosphorana) and mysids (e. g. A. agilis, Leptomysis spp., Erythrops sp.), dominated the diet of C. aper between 2 and 8 cm TL.

40|$|Spanish <b>demersal</b> <b>trawlers</b> which {{operate in}} the Grand Sole and Porcupine Areas usually make between 50 and 80 hauls in each fishing trip, lasting around 15 days where fishing is almost continuous. Since the {{observer}} {{is not able to}} sample every haul, it is crucial to define a robust number of hauls to be sampled by the observer. A bootstrap analysis was carried out to determine the minimum number of hauls to be sampled to reduce significantly intra-variance within a fishing trip. Additionally, number of vessels and trips per vessel to be sampled was also analysed. Taking account the multistage sampling design and partitioning the over-all variability over the various stages, optimum sample sizes was estimated. On the other hand, fishermen may vary its retained catch and discard patterns whilst fishing trip occurs. Particular targets, discarded fish length or proportion of discarded/retained may change according to weather, occasional presence/absence of main target, storage space, quota exceeded, etc [...] . To look into these plausible differences, every fishing trip was divided in three periods, beginning of the trip, half period and ending period, containing each one the same number of hauls. Several statistical tests were applied to these three periods to look for differences as well as to fit a consistent division of hauls to every period. Finally, an optimal allocation sampling scheme is suggested, both in terms of minimum number of hauls to be sampled and temporal division of those hauls along the fishing trip...|$|R

However, unmeasurable factors accounted for about 65 % of the variation in efficiency, and as much as 9 % of the total variation in catches between boats. It is postulated that most of this variation was due to differences in skipper and crew skill. In contrast, “luck ” accounted for around 11 % of the variation in catches between boats. Key words: fisheries management, stochastic production frontier, technical efficiency. Input controls are a common feature of most fisheries management programs throughout the world. An assumption of input controls is that restricting input use indirectly leads to a target level of output being achieved. How-ever, input controls are restricted to inputs that are readily measurable, such as boat size, en-gine power, gear use, and days fished. When other factors affect the level of output, the use-fulness of input controls in achieving target output levels may be limited. For example, when skipper or crew skill is a major factor determining the output of the vessels, con-trolling other inputs may be largely ineffec-tive for many of the boats. Variations in skip-per and crew skill are likely to contribute to the overall technical efficiency of the ves-sel, along with other potentially uncontrolla-ble inputs. The contribution of these inputs to the production process will influence the po-tential success of management through input controls. Early attempts at examining variations i...|$|R

Hierarchical cluster {{analysis was used to}} define 8 clusters with relatively homogenous species compositions. These clusters formed 34 distinct spatial regions in the waters around Ireland. Identification of these regions can be useful for a number applications, including spatial stratification of commercial or survey data, defining and characterising fishing grounds for marine spatial planning, evaluation of closed areas and prediction of how fishing effort might be re-allocated following a closure. A casestudy is presented that explores options to reduce cod (Gadus morhua) catches by implementing seasonal closures in two of the 34 regions. Cod are caught by <b>demersal</b> <b>trawlers</b> in a mixed fishery and the catches often exceed the quota, resulting in discarding of marketable fish. Two regions were identified that had relatively low effort and high cod landings. The effects of closing these regions during {{the first quarter of the}} year were explored. Cod catches were likely to be reduced by 8 - 22 % while only 3 - 9 % of the annual demersal otter trawl effort would be displaced. Whiting catches were also likely to be reduced, the change in catches of some other species depended on the assumed effort displacement.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades it has become {{recognised}} that an ecosystem approach is required to manage world fisheries. Management strategies must ensure that non-target (bycatch) as well as target catches are sustainable. To achieve this, detailed commercial catch and biological information is required. The composition of catches made by trawlers operating off the south and west coasts of South Africa was investigated. Distinct fishing areas were identified on each coast, based on target species and fishing depth. Catch composition differed markedly among the areas defined. Although hake Merluccius sp. dominated South Coast catches, {{a large proportion of the}} catch was composed of bycatch. On the West Coast, hake dominated catches and this domination increased with increasing depth. On both coasts approximately 90 % of the observed nominal catch was processed and landed. Estimates of annual discards suggested that the fishery discarded 38 thousand tons of fish per annum (16 % of the nominal trawl catch). The data also indicated that hake discarding, the capture of linefish and the increased targeting of high value species might be cause for concern. Spatial analysis indicated that a variety of factors such as trawling position, catch size and catch composition affects bycatch dynamics. The monkfish Lophius vomerinus is a common bycatch species that has been increasingly targeted by <b>demersal</b> <b>trawlers.</b> This study showed that L. vomerinus is a slow-growing, long-lived species (West Coast males L∞ = 68. 50 cm TL, t₀ = - 1. 69 yr, K = 0. 10 yr⁻¹; West Coast females L∞ = 110. 23 cm TL, t₀ = - 1. 54 yr, K = 0. 05 yr⁻¹; South Coast sexes combined L∞ = 70. 12 cm TL, t₀ = - 0. 80 yr, K = 0. 11 yr⁻¹), that matures at approximately 6 years of age. These traits could have serious management implications for the species. Per-recruit analysis suggested that the stock might be overexploited, although further investigation is required to confirm this. Solutions were suggested for each of the concerns raised, taking cognisance of the differences observed between the South and West Coasts and the economic dependence of South Coast companies on bycatch.

40|$|Benthos release panels (BRPs) {{are known}} for their {{capacity}} to release large amounts of unwanted benthos and debris, which can decrease mortality on these animals and eases the on board sorting process aboard <b>demersal</b> beam <b>trawlers.</b> They can reduce the bycatch of undersized fish, which is desired once the European discard ban is implemented. However, unacceptable commercial losses of sole (Solea solea L.) and damage to the BRP as a consequence of suboptimal and unsuitable rigging in the traditional beam trawl with chain mat, is hampering a successful introduction in commercial beam-trawl fisheries. To eliminate these drawbacks, square-meshed BRPs with different mesh sizes (150, 200, and 240 [*]mm) were rigged in a trawl with square net design as used in electrotrawls and tested for selectivity. In addition to this, the effect of electric stimulation {{at the height of the}} BRP to eliminate the loss of commercial sole was examined. According to our observations, no abrasion of the net attributable to suboptimal rigging occurred in any of the BRPs tested. The catch comparisons showed significant release of benthos and undersized fish in all panel mesh sizes, but there was always a significant loss of marketable sole in the 150, 200, and 240 [*]mm BRPs. Adding a 80 [*]Hz electric cramp stimulus to the BRP, resulted in equal catches of sole larger than 25 [*]cm as the standard net, without negatively affecting the release of benthos and most undersized commercial fish.

40|$|Purpose: Capture {{fisheries}} are {{the only}} industrial-scale harvesting of a wild resource for food. Temporal variability in environmental performance of fisheries has only recently begun to be explored, but only between years, not within a year. Our aim was {{to better understand the}} causes of temporal variablility withing and between years and to identify improvement options through management at a company level and in fisheries management. Methods We analyzed the variability in broad environmental impacts of a <b>demersal</b> freeze <b>trawler</b> targeting cod, haddock, saithe, and shrimp, mainly in the Norwegian Sea and in the Barents Sea. The analysis was based on daily data for fishing activities between 2011 and 2014 and the functional unit was a kilo of landing from one fishing trip. We used biological indicators in a novel hierarchic approach, depending on data availability, to quantify biotic impacts. Landings were categorized as target (having defined target reference points) or bycatch species (classified as threatened or as data-limited). Indicators for target and bycatch impacts were quantified for each fishing trip, as was the seafloor area swept. Results and discussion No significant difference in fuel use was found between years, but variability was considerable within a year, i. e., between fishing trips. Trips targeting shrimp were more fuel intensive than those targeting fish, due to a lower catch rate. Steaming to and from port was less important for fuel efficiency than steaming between fishing locations. A tradeoff was identified between biotic and abiotic impacts. Landings classified as main target species generally followed the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) framework, and proportions of threatened species were low, while proportions of data-limited bycatch were larger. This improved considerably when reference points were defined for saithe in 2014. Conclusions The variability between fishing trips shows that there is room for improvement through management. Fuel use per landing was strongly influenced by target species, fishing pattern, and fisheries management. Increased awareness about the importance of onboard decision-making can lead to improved performance. This approach could serve to document performance over time helping fishing companies to better understand the effect of their daily and more long-term decision-making on the environmental performance of their products. Recommendations Fishing companies should document their resource use and production on a detailed level. Fuel use should be monitored as part of the management system.

40|$|Sea turtle {{by-catch}} {{data in the}} Mediterranean {{were reviewed}} and analysed with fishing effort. The results indicate over 132000 captures per year, with probably over 44000 incidental deaths per year, while many others are killed intentionally. Small vessels using set net, demersal longline or pelagic longline represent most of the Mediterranean fleet and likely cause more incidental or intentional deaths than large vessels typically using bottom trawl or pelagic longline. When interactions, mortality, intentional killing, size (a proxy for reproductive value) and turtle populations are considered, results indicate that Mediterranean green (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) are more affected (i) by fishing gears such as bottom <b>trawlers,</b> <b>demersal</b> longlines and set nets, (ii) by small-scale fisheries, and (iii) by fishing in the eastern basin. Although small-scale fisheries should be the priority target, available measures are easier to implement on the fewer large vessels. Moreover, these measures are few, {{and they are not}} implemented yet, while others should still be tested for the Mediterranean fisheries. Thus, measures for reducing captures or mortality through changing gear-specific characteristics may help, but probably a more holistic conservation strategy aimed to an ecosystem-based fishery management for a sustainable fishing would be the only solution for the long-term survival of Mediterranean Sea turtle populations and their habitats. Small-scale fisheries should manage marine resources, including turtles, in a responsible and sustainable way. Turtles may not only benefit from but can also help this process if their non-consumptive value is fully recognized. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{costs are}} an {{important}} element in models used to analyse and predict fisher behaviour for application within the wider mixed fisheries and ecosystem approaches to management. This investigation explored the predictive capability of linear and generalized additive models (GAMs) in providing daily fuel consumption estimates for fishing vessels given knowledge of their length, engine power, fleet segment (annual dominant gear type), and fuel prices. Models were fitted to half of the Irish fishing vessel economic data collected between 2003 and 2011. The predictive capabilities of the seven best models were validated against the remaining, previously un-modelled, data. The type of gear used by a fleet segment had an important influence on fuel consumption as did the price of fuel. The passive pot gear and Scottish seine gear segments indicated consistently lower consumptions, whereas dredge and pelagic gears showed consistently higher fuel consumptions. Furthermore, increasing fuel price negatively affected fuel consumption, especially for more powerful, larger vessels. Of the formulated models, the best fit to training data were a GAM with a gear main effect and two smooth functions; standardized vessel length and engine power interacting with fuel price. For prediction, overall, this model showed the closest predictions with the least bias, followed by three linear models. However, all seven models compared for predictive capability performed well for the most sampled segments (<b>demersal</b> and pelagic <b>trawlers).</b> This is an author produced pre-print pdf.

40|$|Seabirds feeding ecology was {{studied at}} sea {{to assess the}} {{significance}} of two commercial fisheries, <b>trawlers</b> (<b>demersal</b> fishery with diurnal activity) and purse seiners (pelagic fishery with nocturnal activity), in the NW Mediterranean. Trawlers offered high amounts of discards (mostly fish of small size) on a predictable basis, and consequently attracted large numbers of seabirds. At the Ebro Delta, discards provided in average 65 % of the energy requirements of the seabird breeding community, being most important for large gulls and of little significance for terns. Purse seiners produced few discards, on an irregular basis, and attracted lower numbers of seabirds during discarding (after dawn). During the fishing operation, at night, only Audouin's Gulls Larus audouinii attended these vessels, capturing live fish concentrated near the sea surface, attracted by powerful lamps. During the breeding season, Audouin's Gulls preferentially attended trawlers in spite of potential competition with the more aggressive and opportunistic Yellow-legged Gulls Larus cachinnans, since the former showed to be more efficient at capturing discards and reduced competition by showing {{a wider range of}} feeding techniques. Only during trawler closures, Audouin's Gulls occurred in important numbers at purse seiners (thus acting as a secondary food resource for most individuals). During the non-breeding season Audouin's Gulls shifted to preferentially attend purse seiners, presumably because competition at trawlers strengthened at this period. The rare and threatened Balearic Shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus also made significant use of discards, which represented more than 40 % of the energy requirements of the whole population during the breeding season. Seabirds feeding upon discards showed higher levels of mercury, as discards make accessible to them demersal fish that is more polluted than epipelagic fish (natural prey for most seabirds). Thus, the risks of toxicity by this metal are higher for those species capturing discards. Given the significance of commercial fisheries for seabirds in the NW Mediterranean, and considering the increasing ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management, fisheries managers should regard these birds when designing fishing policies...|$|R
