40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{implementing}} effects-based operations (EBO) on {{course of action}} (COA) development and evaluation will be significant. Because EBO focuses on producing effects from military activities, {{as opposed to the}} direct result of attacking targets, there is an opportunity to develop a significantly higher number of COAs that achieve the desired effects. Consequently, EBO planning will significantly increase the number of evaluated COAs and the depth of evaluation. In order to evaluate these numerous COAs, which may achieve the same desired effects by substantially different methods, metrics must be found to adequately quantify their relative merits. Desired effects may be achieved though disparate COAs, such as propaganda campaigns versus major interdictions. The Course of Action Simulation Analysis (CASA) task was created to research metrics identification, data representation and scoring approaches. This paper introduces concepts behind CASA, chronicles task results to <b>date,</b> <b>and</b> <b>finishes</b> with a discussion of the scoring methodologies and capabilities developed during the CASA prototyping effort.

[...] The Guardian journalist Michael Cragg noted that the hype behind the song was big, however, he expressed that it actually [...] "sounds disappointing." [...] He continued, [...] "while 'The Boy is Mine' brilliantly played the two singers off against each other, fuelling the supposed rivalry the song itself generated, 'It All Belongs to Me' is a fairly rudimentary 'man's done me wrong and he needs to leave' mid-paced strumalong."

Eggertsen also noted that the song's production sounded quite <b>dated,</b> <b>and</b> <b>finished</b> his review saying that both singers will need a stronger single for a real comeback.

40|$|Much {{attention}} {{has been placed on}} measuring performance of activity completion in Lean literature, using techniques such as Percentage of Planned Activities Completed (PPC). Originally intended as one component of measuring plan execution, along with measures of Planned Productivity, PPC has been extensively researched but Planned Productivity has been neglected. Using a lean methodology based on location-based scheduling enables an alternative performance measurement system. This paper proposes a method which makes possible the gathering of large amounts of performance data without too much effort. The method is an important contribution to the available suite of lean methods. Performance measurement using location-based status data is a method which has much in common with earned value analysis, and is able to use the progressive performance through each location of the project as the unit of measurement. The equivalent indicator to PPC is provided by measuring against the planned completion of a location. Furthermore, before commencing work the site checks the actual quantities in each location. Planned Productivity is measured during implementation, with the start <b>date</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>date,</b> actual quantities <b>and</b> average resources used in each location being recorded. This information can be used to calculate actual productivity. The location-based data gives the ability to measure within tasks, revealing not just completion of stages as in PPC, can measure against Planned Productivity. The actual productivities can be used to forecast problems in the future and to evaluate the feasibility of alternative control actions. In addition, the location-based actual information combined with the original Bill-of-Quantities and schedule reveals the erroneous assumptions made during preplanning and facilitates learning on future projects.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} jobs that any manager can take on in the management of a large scale project that requires coordinating numerous activities throughout the organization. A myriad of details must be considered in planning how to coordinate all these activities, in developing a realistic schedule, and then in monitoring the progress of the project. Fortunately, two closely related operations research techniques, PERT (program evaluation and review techniques) and CPM (critical path method) were developed in the 50 's, within different contexts: the CPM was developed for planning and control of DuPont engineering projects and the PERT was developed for the management of the production cycle of the Polaris missile. They share the same objectives such as defining the project duration and the critical task. The PERT/CPM technique is based on two straight steps; a forward propagation to define the earliest start <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>dates</b> (<b>and</b> subsequently the project duration and the free floats), and a backward promulgation for the latest start <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>dates</b> (<b>and</b> the total floats).
