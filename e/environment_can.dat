5|$|Human {{eyes have}} color receptors known as cone cells, {{of which there}} are three types. In some cases, one is missing or faulty, which can cause color blindness, {{including}} the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green, known as deuteranopia or redgreen color blindness. Green is restful to the eye. Studies show that a green <b>environment</b> <b>can</b> reduce fatigue.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of certain chemical substances—such as ethanol or pesticides or defensive toxic biochemicals produced by plants—to a bee's <b>environment</b> <b>can</b> cause the bee to display abnormal or unusual behavior and disorientation. In sufficient quantities, such chemicals can poison and even kill the bee. The effects of alcohol on bees {{have long been}} recognized. For example, John Cumming described the effect in an 1864 publication on beekeeping.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of natural sites, ascertained dangers include the serious decline in the {{population}} of an endangered or other valuable species or the deterioration of natural beauty or scientific value of a property caused by human activities such as logging, pollution, settlement, mining, agriculture and major public works. Ascertained dangers for cultural properties include serious deterioration of materials, structure, ornaments or architectural coherence {{and the loss of}} historical authenticity or cultural significance. Potential dangers for both cultural and natural sites include development projects, armed conflicts, insufficient management systems or changes in the legal protective status of the properties. In {{the case of}} cultural sites, gradual changes due to geology, climate or <b>environment</b> <b>can</b> also be potential dangers.|$|E

5|$|The {{discipline}} of plant ecology was pioneered {{in the late}} 19th century by botanists such as Eugenius Warming, who produced the hypothesis that plants form communities, and his mentor and successor Christen C. Raunkiær whose system for describing plant life forms is still in use today. The concept that the composition of plant communities such as temperate broadleaf forest changes by a process of ecological succession was developed by Henry Chandler Cowles, Arthur Tansley and Frederic Clements. Clements is credited {{with the idea of}} climax vegetation as the most complex vegetation that an <b>environment</b> <b>can</b> support and Tansley introduced the concept of ecosystems to biology. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) produced accounts of the biogeography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.|$|E
5|$|Xenosaga I & II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} which retells {{the events of}} Xenosaga Episode I and its direct sequel Episode II. Cutscenes and the in-game environments and character sprites are displayed on the Nintendo DS (DS) console's top screen, with events outside still animated cutscenes taking place from an angled top-down perspective using two-dimensional graphics. Additional information is displayed on the DS's bottom screen. Environments can be freely explored, with breakable chests holding consumable items and accessories. Shops within the levels {{can be used to}} purchase items and equipment using in-game currency. Special EVA structures within the <b>environment</b> <b>can</b> be used to recover health points (HP) and a type of skill point called ether points (EP). Characters are able to both roam around open environments and enter story-based dungeons. During the course of the story, the player receives emails through the U.M.N. service, which is also used to store the game's glossary, a store of information on the world and characters.|$|E

50|$|Juju has two {{components:}} a client and a bootstrap node. Currently clients exist for Ubuntu, CentOS, Mac and Windows. After installing the client, {{one or more}} <b>environments</b> <b>can</b> be bootstrapped. Juju <b>environments</b> <b>can</b> be bootstrapped on many clouds: Amazon Web Services, HP Cloud Services, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack, etc. By creating a Juju Provider, additional cloud <b>environments</b> <b>can</b> be supported. Juju can also be bootstrapped on bare-metal servers. Large deployments can use Canonical's Metal as a Service. Small deployments can use the manual provider, which allows any SSH Ubuntu machine to be converted into a Juju-managed machine. Juju can also be installed on a local Ubuntu machine via LXC operating system-level virtualization and the local provider.|$|R
