60|$|At first Tarzan {{would eat}} nothing, but rolled and tossed {{in a wild}} {{delirium}} of fever. All he craved was water, and this she brought him in {{the only way she}} could, bearing <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
50|$|Marjatta lives {{a life of}} respectability and virtue. One {{day when}} she was {{shepherding}} her flock she lamented her maidenhood, and wished for a husband. She hears a cowberry crying {{that no one would}} pluck it, she reaches for the berry and <b>it</b> places itself <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and is eaten.|$|R
60|$|Mary {{was very}} handsome, the handsomest woman, she felt in a moment, {{she had ever}} seen--or perhaps it was only Cissy. Perhaps it was both, for she had seen {{stranger}} things than that--ladies wiring to different persons under different names. She had seen {{all sorts of things}} and pieced together all sorts of mysteries. There had once been one--not long before--who, without winking, sent off five over five different signatures. Perhaps these represented five different friends who had asked her--all women, just as perhaps now Mary and Cissy, or one or other of them, were wiring by deputy. Sometimes she put in too much--too much of her own sense; sometimes she put in too little; and in either case this often came round to her afterwards, for she had an extraordinary way of keeping clues. When she noticed she noticed; that was what it came to. There were days and days, there were weeks sometimes, of vacancy. This arose often from Mr. Buckton's devilish and successful subterfuges for keeping her at the sounder whenever it looked as if anything might arouse; the sounder, which it was equally his business to mind, being the innermost cell of captivity, a cage within the cage, fenced oft from the rest by a frame of ground glass. The counter-clerk would have played into her hands; but the counter-clerk was really reduced to idiocy by the effect of his passion for her. She flattered herself moreover, nobly, that with the unpleasant conspicuity of this passion she would never have consented to be obliged to him. The most she would ever do would be always to shove off on him whenever she could the registration of letters, a job she happened particularly to loathe. After the long stupors, at all events, there almost always suddenly would come a sharp taste of something; <b>it</b> was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> before she knew it; <b>it</b> was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pull hard! Stretch her out!" [...] yelled Jones. He grasped a stout {{piece of}} wood and pushed it at the lioness. She caught <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> making the {{splinters}} fly. Jones shoved her head {{back on the ground}} and pressed his brawny knee on the bar of wood.|$|E
6000|$|Instantly a tiny mouse {{stepped forward}} and said: 'I often creep about the Princess's bedroom at night, and I have noticed {{that she has a}} ring which she treasures as the apple of her eye.

60|$|He had {{forgotten}} the egg. It still lay on the veranda, and Nagaina came nearer and nearer to it, till at last, while Rikki-tikki was drawing breath, she caught <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> turned to the veranda steps, and flew like an arrow down the path, with Rikki-tikki behind her. When the cobra runs for her life, she goes like a whip-lash flicked across a horse's neck.|$|E
60|$|How very lovable {{her face}} was to him. Yet there was nothing {{ethereal}} about it; all was real vitality, real warmth, real incarnation. And <b>it</b> was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> that this culminated. Eyes almost as deep and speaking he had seen before, and cheeks perhaps as fair; brows as arched, a chin and throat almost as shapely; <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> he had seen nothing to equal {{on the face of}} the earth. To a young man with the least fire in him that little upward lift in the middle of her red top lip was distracting, infatuating, maddening. He had never before seen a woman's lips and teeth which forced upon his mind with such persistent iteration the old Elizabethan simile of roses filled with snow. Perfect, he, as a lover, might have called them off-hand. But no--they were not perfect. And it was the touch of the imperfect upon the would-be perfect that gave the sweetness, because it was that which gave the humanity.|$|R
6000|$|There {{were other}} things about Scraps {{that would have}} seemed curious to one seeing {{her for the first}} time. She was {{commonly}} called [...] "the Patchwork Girl" [...] because her body and limbs were made from a gay-colored patchwork quilt which had been cut into shape and stuffed with cotton. Her head was a round ball stuffed in the same manner and fastened to her shoulders. For hair, she had a mass of brown yarn, and to make a nose for her a part of the cloth had been pulled out into the shape of a knob and tied with a string to hold <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. <b>Her</b> <b>mouth</b> had been carefully made by cutting a slit in the proper place and lining it with red silk, adding two rows of pearls for teeth and a bit of red flannel for a tongue.|$|R
500|$|In New Zealand, {{sharks and}} rays appear to be {{important}} prey; species taken include eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail stingrays, common threshers, smooth hammerheads, blue sharks and shortfin mako sharks. With sharks, orcas may herd them {{to the surface and}} strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. Killer whales can induce tonic immobility in {{sharks and rays}} by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near the Farallon Islands in October 1997, a [...] female killed a [...] great white shark, apparently after swimming with <b>it</b> upside-down <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and inducing tonic immobility <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> She and another pod member ate the shark's liver and allowed the rest of the carcass to sink. In February 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a white shark off South Australia. Interspecific competition between the two species is probable in regions where dietary preferences overlap. Killer whales have also been recorded hunting tiger sharks. In July 1992, two killer whales attacked, killed and fed on an [...] long whale shark, Rhincodon typus, in the waters off Bahia de los Angeles in Baja California.|$|R
6000|$|The cottage loaf and the pennyworth of milk {{had been}} set forth {{on a sheet of}} paper on the window-seat. The cherubic pocket-knife, with the first bit of the loaf still on its point, lay beside them where it had been hastily thrown down. Bella took the bit off, and put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> 'My dear child,' said her father, 'the idea of your partaking of such lowly fare! But at least you must have your own loaf and your own penn'orth. One moment, my dear. The Dairy is just over the way and round the corner.' ...|$|E
60|$|Zeb hitched Jim to {{the buggy}} again, {{and the horse}} trotted along and drew them rapidly over the smooth water. The kitten was at first dreadfully afraid of getting wet, but Dorothy let her down and soon Eureka was frisking along beside the buggy without being scared a bit. Once a little fish swam too near the surface, and the kitten grabbed <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and ate it up as quick as a wink; but Dorothy cautioned her to be careful what she ate in this valley of enchantments, and no more fishes were {{careless}} enough to swim within reach.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Like a squaw!' was {{the only}} comment of Elias P. Hutcheson, as we moved on our way round the city fosse. Every now and then we looked over the wall and each time saw the cat {{following}} us. At first she had kept {{going back to the}} dead kitten, and then as the distance grew greater took <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and so followed. After a while, however, she abandoned this, for we saw her following all alone; she had evidently hidden the body somewhere. Amelia's alarm grew at the cat's persistence, and more than once she repeated her warning; but the American always laughed with amusement, till finally, seeing that she was beginning to be worried, he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|The instant that Remarkable Pettibone had {{executed}} her {{portion of}} the labor in illuminating, she returned to a position near Elizabeth, with the apparent motive of receiving the clothes that the other threw aside, but in reality to examine, {{with an air of}} curiosity—not unmixed with jealousy—the appearance of the lady who was to supplant <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the administration of their domestic economy. The housekeeper felt a little appalled, when, after cloaks, coats, shawls, and socks had been taken off in succession, the large black hood was removed, and the dark ringlets, shining like the raven’s wing, fell from her head, and left the sweet but commanding features of the young lady exposed to view. Nothing could be fairer and more spotless than the forehead of Elizabeth, and preserve the appearance of life and health. Her nose would have been called Grecian, but for a softly rounded swell, that gave in character to the feature what <b>it</b> lost <b>in</b> beauty. <b>Her</b> <b>mouth,</b> at first sight, seemed only made for love; but, the instant that its muscles moved, every expression that womanly dignity could utter played around it with the flexibility of female grace. It spoke not only to the ear, but to the eye. So much, added to a form of exquisite proportions, rather full and rounded for her years, and of the tallest medium height, she inherited from her mother. Even the color of her eye, the arched brows, and the long silken lashes, came from the same source; but its expression was her father’s. Inert and composed, it was soft, benevolent, and attractive; but it could be roused, and that without much difficulty. At such moments it was still beautiful, though it was a little severe. As the last shawl fell aside, and she stood dressed in a rich blue riding-habit, that fitted her form with the nicest exactness; her cheeks burning with roses, that bloomed the richer for the heat of the hall, and her eyes lightly suffused with moisture that rendered their ordinary beauty more dazzling, and with every feature of her speaking countenance illuminated by the lights that flared around her, Remarkable felt that her own power had ended ...|$|R

The cub safe for the moment, she would then wheel round and face the dogs, so as to give it a chance to run away; but it always stopped, just as it alighted, till she came up and threw it ahead again; it seemed to expect her aid, and would not go on without it. Sometimes the mother would run a few yards ahead, as if to coax the young one up to her, and when the dogs came up she would turn and drive them back then, as they dodged her blows, she would rejoin the cub and push on, sometimes putting her head under it, sometimes catching <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> by the nape of the neck.|$|E

50|$|Kramm's {{youngest}} daughter began suffering epileptic seizures weeks after her birth in February 1992.

Her seizures continued, resulting in more hospital trips. Within a few months, Kramm and his wife Shelley decided something must be done.|$|E

50|$|The end {{credits for}} each episode include brief {{animations}} {{of the original}} comic strips, with dialogue appearing in word balloons. Since November 1991, after the closing credits and the next episode previews, each show has ended with a janken match between Sazae and the viewers at home, in which Sazae holds up a sign representing one of the appropriate hand gestures. From 1969 to 1991, Sazae ended each episode by tossing a bean or rice cake {{in the air and}} catching <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Fuji Television switched to the janken match after doctors at Tohoku University Hospital and the National Center for Child Health and Development raised concerns that children may try to imitate Sazae and potentially choke on food.|$|E

50|$|The males {{initiate}} the courtship ritual, which entails chasing the females around the tank. The female darts {{away and the}} males search for her and find her a few moments later. The males shiver all over the female and may lie {{down on top of}} her. When she is ready to spawn she turns to the male next to her and pounds furiously below his ventral fin. The male releases his seed and the female catches <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> The female cups her ventral fins and lays a few eggs (normally about 4) in them. She now starts cleaning a spot on the glass to lays her eggs on. Corydoras are egg depositors and lay their eggs all over the aquarium. Favourite spots include the heater, filter tubes and the glass, although, occasionally eggs are also laid on plants.|$|E
5000|$|When laying eggs, P. striatula secretes {{a sticky}} {{abdominal}} substance, created by its Dufour’s gland, and collects <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Then as the eggs emerge from her abdomen, she uses this abdominal substance {{to handle them}} and proceeds to stick them into an empty cell. Next, to secure her eggs, the female will once again gather more abdominal substance {{in her mouth and}} place it over the eggs. Sometimes, the female wasp that laid the eggs, will keep them uncovered and the worker females will finish the job with their own secretion. There have been cases where the female was interrupted during this process, and was seen abandoning the nest with the eggs still in her mouth. Once the threat passed, the female was able to return to place them in the empty cell. [...] Individuals in the colony are not able to discriminate between eggs covered by their nestmates.|$|E
50|$|P. jacobsoni wasps {{reproduce}} via oviposition. Egg laying {{is divided}} into three stages. First, the female produces a substance from the Dufour’s gland and collects a patch of <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Then, after stretching the gaster, the wasp brings it back toward her mouth and collects the eggs as they emerge, adhering them to the original secretion. The egg is then affixed to the nest cell via another patch of secretion. Finally, another deposition of the abdominal secretion is placed on the original secretion on the concave surface of the egg. The various functions of the abdominal substance in child-rearing include serving as the substratum to protect young larva, as a dish for larval food, and as a place to store reserves of liquid food. It is not, however, used as a larval food itself. Instead it is used to protect sugary and protein heavy foods collected from the environment by adults.|$|E
