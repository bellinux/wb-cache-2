Day- 6 rabbit blastocysts were {{recovered}} from superovulated donor animals, washed in ice-cold Krebs=n-=n-(KRB) buffer, pooled and randomly allocated to polypropylene incubation tubes, usually 10 blastocysts in 1 ml KRB. The blastocysts were ruptured with a <b>dissecting</b> <b>needle</b> and incubated at 37 =deg periods of 1 =n-h with 10 =m[3 H]arachidonic acid/tube. A control tube without blastocysts was run in each experiment. At {{the end of}} the incubation, the samples were acidified, extracted with ethyl acetate, dried down and resuspended in h. p. l. c. column solvent. The radioactivity from the control tube eluting from the h. p. l. c., using a solvent system for prostaglandins (PGs), was subtracted from each experimental run in the same experiment.

40|$|Water in dormant peach (Prunus persica [L. ] Batsch. var. `Harbrite') flower buds deep supercooled. Both {{supercooling}} and {{the freezing}} of water within the bud axis and primordium as distinct components {{depended on the}} viability of the bud axis tissue. The viability of the primordium was not critical. Supercooling was prevented by wounding buds with a <b>dissecting</b> <b>needle,</b> indicating that bud structural features were important. Bud morphological features appeared to prevent the propagation of ice through the vascular tissue and into the primordium. In dormant buds, procambial cells had not yet differentiated into xylem vessel elements.

The perforated grains were incubated at 4 °C for 24  h in the aqueous solution or 48  h in the ethanol solution. The excess stain was removed by washing exhaustively with distilled water to prevent the contamination of the cutting knife when the grains were cut longitudinally, and stained areas were observed to establish the diffusion between the two compartments. Stain diffusion in unperforated or perforated grains from the embryo to the endosperm were also evaluated.|$|E

For a better understanding of comparative biochemistry information about this subject is required. Furthermore, investigations of the biochemical characteristics of parasitic invertebrates will reveal metabolic reactions essential for survival of these organisms. Information obtained from such studies will make it possible to search for non-toxic inhibitors of essential metabolic reactions and eventually may afford a possibility of replacing the presently prevailing empirical methods with a more rational development of chemotherapeutic agents against pathogenic parasites. ~ccordingly, when an investigation concerned with the chemotherapy of schistosomiasis was initiated in this laboratory, it was decided to study the metabolism of Schistosoma mansoni, an organism concerned with the pathogenesis of one form of this disease.

Testes are typically isolated from adult males 0 - 3 days after eclosion from the pupal case. The testes of wild-type flies are easily distinguished from other tissues because they are yellow, but the testes of white mutant flies, a common genetic background for laboratory experiments are similar in both shape and color to the fly gut. Performing dissection on a glass microscope slide with a black background makes identifying the testes considerably easier. Testes are removed from the flies using <b>dissecting</b> <b>needles.</b> Compared to protocols that use forceps for testes dissection, our method is far quicker, allowing a well-practiced individual to dissect testes from 200 - 300 wild-type flies per hour, yielding 400 - 600 testes. Testes from white flies or from mutants that reduce testes size are harder to dissect and typically yield 200 - 400 testes per hour. Protocol 1. Make a glass microscope slide with a black background: Cut 20 # white paper to {{the same size as the}} microscope slide.

30|$|Live {{marine fishes}} were {{collected}} freshly from the Ayyikkara fish-landing centre (Lat. 11 ° 51 ′N, Long. 75 ° 22 ′E; Malabar Coast, India). The various body {{parts of the}} fish were examined (immediately after collection) {{for the presence of}} cymothoids using a hand lens. The recovered parasites with their host were brought to the laboratory and subjected to detailed examination {{with the aid of a}} stereomicroscope (Leica-S 6 D, Leica Microsystems Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK). The cymothoids thus obtained were preserved in 75 % ethanol (after Ramakrishna 1980) and subjected to further taxonomical identification. The survey was conducted twice a week round the year from November 2009 to November 2012. The prevalence (P) and intensity (I) of the recovered C. frontalis were calculated as per the methods described in Margolis et al. (1982) and Bush et al. (1997). The total length of the fish host as well as the parasite (C. frontalis) was measured to the nearest 1 mm. Mouthparts and appendages of the parasite were carefully dissected out using a <b>dissecting</b> <b>needle</b> and a fine pair forceps and observed under the microscope (Leica DM- 750). The drawings of the observed mouthparts and appendages were performed using a camera lucida attached to the microscope. The moult stages and the moult-related changes of the parasite were determined through the macroscopical and microscopical observations on the characteristic changes occurring in the carapace and the appendages (after Sudha et al. 2012). The reproductive activity was assessed through microscopic observations of the ovary (after dissecting out) and marsupiumites (after Sudha et al. 2012; Aneesh 2014). Classification of the marsupial stages was carried out taking cues from Bakenhaster et al. (2006). Fish taxonomy and host nomenclature were performed according to FishBase (Froese and Pauly 2012).

From a {{functional}} view point the soil may be consider as the land surface on the earth which provides substratum for plant and animal life. The genous bacillus consists of aerobic bacilli forming heat resistance spores they are gram positive but tend to be decolourised on gram staining. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a type of electron microscope that produces images of the sample by scanning with a focused beam of electron. easily so that it is gram variable or may be gram negative. the soil is collected from the mountain regions of south india, the primary screening and secondary screening were done and isolated organism is subjected to morphological and biochemical studies. Colonies where fixed in formalin vapour for a period of 24 hr. After fixing {{the outer edge of the}} colonies were marked with <b>dissecting</b> <b>needle.</b> The agar was removed. The colonies were then coated with gold –palladium alloy to a thickness of 500 A 0 by means of vacuum evaporation. Then the colonies were viewed using scanning electron microscopy. After that the chamber was evacuated to 10 (- 5) torr the specimens were scanned using electron beam the electrons liberated from the surface of the specimen were detected using a scintillation photo multiplier system. The resulting image was formed on a cathode ray tube. Photo graphs were taken with the Polaroid camera. At 3000 x a small rode shaped, non- uniform distribution of organism were seen. At 5000 x the rods were more elongated and the arrangement of colonies were non uniform. At 10, 000 x the colonies showed a length of 1. 46 micrometer and 1. 64 micrometer and the width of the colonies were found to be 630. 1 nanometre and 752. 9 nanometre and irregularly arranged colonies. At 20, 000 x the rods were found to be more elongated. Scanning electron microscope can be used to view the organism isolated from the soil. The examination depends on the concentration of cells in the soil. This limits the use of sem technique in soils with more than 10 - 7 organisms per gram of the soil.

The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the accessibility and safety of the SCJ by arthroscopy in a cadaveric model. An inferolateral and superomedial portal to the SCJ was created in 20 cadaveric specimens. After debridement, the specimens were <b>dissected</b> with a <b>needle</b> positioned in the portal tracts. The distance between the needles and bony landmarks, tendons and ligaments were measured. The integrity of the posterior capsule was evaluated macroscopically. In eight specimens, after anterior dissection, the needles were replaced by K-wires that perforated the posterior capsule to evaluate the distance to the neurovascular structures behind the SCJ. Both portals were found to be safe while allowing good access to the joint. The superomedial portal went through the tendon of the sternocleidomastoideus muscle and the inferolateral portal through the pectoralis major muscle. The portals entered the capsule medial and lateral to the anterior sternoclavicular ligament. The posterior capsule was never perforated during debridement. The perforating K-wires, however, usually perforated either a major vein or artery, but were at a safe distance from the vagal nerve. In this cadaver study, arthroscopy of the sternoclavicular joint could be used as a minimally invasive procedure allowing debridement of the joint without damaging the posterior capsule of the joint. If the capsule is inadvertently be breached, a major risk of neurovascular damage exists. We advise to have a backup of a cardiothoracic surgeon when performing this procedure...|$|R
40|$|Chatham Island {{forget-me-not}} (Myosotidium hortensia (Decne) Baillon) is {{endemic to}} the Chatham Islands {{where it is}} mainly confined to the outer islands. There is speculation that seed of M. hortensia is recalcitrant and reports that germination can be slow and erratic. Moreover there is little information on the seed biology of M. hortensia available. In this study the seed structure and composition of the seed storage reserves of M. hortensia were determined. The seed is a dicotyledon. The embryo is predominantly cotyledonary tissue with a only small embryo axis present. There {{appears to be a}} single cell thick layer of endosperm tissue between the embryo and seed coat. Food reserves are stored as both protein and oil with no starch reserves apparent. The seed contains 24 % oil and therefore can be considered an oilseed. These oil reserves include the commercially important γ-linolenic (cis, cis, cis- 6, 9, 12 -octadecatrienoic) acid (9 % of the fatty acid content). Seed of M. hortensia was evaluated for recalcitrant behaviour by determining if desiccation to low seed moisture content caused a loss of viability. Seed was harvested at two moisture contents, 47. 4 % (green seed) and 35. 5 % (black seed), and air dried to a final moisture content of 7. 5 %. Seed viability and germination performance were monitored at harvest and as moisture content declined. At 7. 5 % seed moisture content viability was 89 % and germination 92 % for seed harvested at 47 % seed moisture content, and 82 % and 78 %, respectively, for seed harvested at 36 % seed moisture content. Within each colour classification, after desiccation {{there was no significant difference}} in germination compared to that at harvest, indicating that M. hortensia seed can be desiccated to a low seed moisture content without loss of germination and is therefore not recalcitrant. Seed stored at 5 °C and 7. 5 % seed moisture content showed no decline in viability after 21 months, but, seed stored at the same temperature and 9. 5 % seed moisture content showed a significant loss of viability after 9 months storage. The loss of viability at this higher (9. 5 %) seed moisture content is characteristic of oilseeds, but it is not clear whether the high oil content of the seed alone can account for the loss of viability after nine months storage at a temperature of 5 °C. This study confirmed earlier reports that germination of M. hortensia seed is slow and erratic. At maturity seed of M. hortensia is dormant. Seed dormancy is a function of the seed coat rather than the embryo. The dormancy is likely to be a result of either physical constraint of embryo growth or restriction of gas exchange by the seed coat, or a combination of both. Removal or weakening of the seed coat allowed germination to proceed. However, some of the treatments used to weaken the seed coat resulted in an increase in abnormal seedling development. An effective and non-damaging technique for alleviating dormancy was to prick the seed coat with a 0. 6 - 0. 8 mm diameter <b>dissecting</b> <b>needle</b> in the middle of the cotyledons...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Yoh Wada, Minako Aoyama, Ge-Hong Sun-Wada, Nobuyuki Kawamura & Hiroyuki Tabata ### Abstract In this {{protocol}} {{we describe}} methods for observation endocytic {{activity in the}} mouse embryos. The methods are optimised for mouse embryos at E 5. 5 ~E 7. 2 pregastrulation/gastrulation stages. We optimise three different experimental schemes for tracing the embryonic endocytosis. In utero labelling scheme, an endocytic tracer is introduced into circulation of a pregnant mother to follow bulk uptake of fluid phase endocytosis. Rodent embryos are known to internalise maternal immunoglobulins, thus steady-state levels of endocytosis can be visualised by subcellular localization of mouse IgG. We also describe an in vitro labelling method for the isolated embryos. The last method allows pulse-labelling and chase experiments thus one can follow the temporal orders of events. Further, cellular processes involved in the endocytosis can be dissected pharmacologically by applying small- or large molecules with biological activities. ### Introduction Endocytosis is an important cellular process by which cells internalise macromolecules impermeable to cell membranes. During the endocytosis, a portion of cell surface membranes invaginates inwardly with extracellular and membrane-embedded substances including signalling molecules, growth factors, and nutrients to form small membrane vesicles which are destined to be transported toward the intracellular compartments like endosomes and lysosomes. The endocytosis is not only important for taking up nutritional macromolecules including a transferrin-iron complex, lipoproteins, immunoglobulins, but plays {{a central role in}} downregulation of cell-surface receptors for various signalling molecules as well. Moreover, in the various systems, signal transductions from the activated receptors to cytosolic mediators occur after ligand-receptor complexes are endocytosed. Therefore, the endocytosis plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in the signal transduction. The visceral endoderm, a polarised absorbing epithelium overlying embryo proper, actively internalises various molecules including transferrin, immunoglobulins, lipoproteins, and albumins [1 - 3]. This tissue controls multiple signalling cascades that ultimately governs antero-posterior axis formation and epiblast differentiation[4, 5]. This process, in principle, is highly dependent upon the endocytic pathways in the embryonic tissues [6 - 8]. The endocytic activity of rodent embryo has been documented by electron-microscopy in the earlier literatures. The endocytic pathway in the visceral endoderm cells is composed of the apical canaliculi, spherical bodies, and giant organelles referred as to apical vacuoles [9, 10]. We optimise protocols for observing the endocytosis under fluorescence microscopes, and with appropriate equipment setting, one can follow the endocytic process in live embryos. Here, we describe step-by-step protocols for different labelling schemes for the endocytic compartments. ### Reagents 1. 10 X Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen 70011044) - PBST 1 x PBS plus 0. 05 % Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich P 9416) - PBST+TSA+DS: dissolve TSA blocking reagent (Perkin Elmer FP 1020) at 1 %(w/v) in PBST, at 50 ºC in water bath.

Equilibrate the media in the CO 2 incubator. - Make a drop of 0. 5 mL DMEM+RS in a 35 mm dish, three or four dishes are required. Place them in the CO 2 incubator. - Prepare four 35 mm dishes of the isolation buffer, place in 37 ºC incubator (humidified with wet paper towel). - Prepare 35 mm dishes containing freshly prepared PFA/PBS. - Sacrifice the pregnant mother by cervical dislocation, dissect the embryos as quick as possible in the isolation buffer. Remove Reichert’s membrane, but not tear the visceral endoderm layer and ectoplacental cone. Place the embryos into a DMEM+RS drop. - When all the embryos (or required numbers of embryos) are ready in DMEM+RS, transfer them into the well # 1 of the IVF plate with a minimum volume of no-dye-medium. Incubate at 30 min in the CO 2 incubator. - Transfer the embryos to a drop of DMEM+RS on the 35 mm dish with minimum carry over of the medium. chase in the well # 2 - After appropriate chase-duration, transfer them into well # 3 : incubate 5 - 15 min in the CO 2 incubator, then transfer and wash in a DMEM+RS drop. - Incubate in the well # 4, for various duration. - Terminate the labelling/chase by transferring the embryos into PFA/PBS. Fix for 1 hr on ice. - Proceed for observation (IV), or for immunohistochemical staining as described in section C. C. Immunoglobulins as an endogenous tracer 1. Cross mice, and check vaginal plugs on next morning (E 0). - At E 5. 5 - 7. 5, anesthetise the pregnant female by injecting pentobarbital or xylazine/ketamine. - Check anaesthesia by foot pad reflection. Fix the pregnant female by introducing mouse tonic saline (c. a. 5 mL) and PFA/PBS into circulation from right ventricle. - Dissect uterus, wash in PFA/PBS, and free embryos from deciduae in PBST in 35 mm dish. - Wash briefly with PBST in 35 mm dish. The embryos become less “sticky” to pipette walls and needles. - Remove Reichert membranes by needles. - Fix for 2 hr ~ O/N in PFA/PBS at 4 ºC. - Incubate the embryos in PBST+TSA+DS for 12 hr ~ O/N in a microtube. - Transfer the embryos to 100 μL of anti-mouse IgG antibodies in PBST+TSA+DS, and incubate at 4 ºC for 12 hr~O/N. For FITC-, Cy 3, and Cy 5 -labelled antibodies, use at 1 / 100, 1 / 500, and 1 / 250 dilutions, respectively. - Wash the embryos with PBST in microtubes or 35 mm dish. c. a. 5 ~ 10 min wash, 5 times, with changing the tubes or dishes twice. - Fix the embryos in PFA/PBS for 20 min. D. Observation. 1. Wash 3 -times in PBST - Incubate in 20 % glycerol/PBST for 1 hr - Incubate in 40 % glycerol/PBST for 1 hr - Add approximately an equal volume of Vectashield, tap the tube gently. - Store at 4 ºC for several days, but try to record the image ASAP. - Mix 0. 2 % gellan gum in 40 % glycerol in PBST, and microwave. Gellan gum solidifies in the presence of monovlalent or divalent ions. - Pour 500 - 1000 μL of hot Gellan gum/PBST/glycerol solution into a 35 mm glass-bottom dish. Once solidified, cool in a refrigerator to harden further. Used and washed glass-bottom dish gives less fluorescence background. - Under a dissection microscope, make a slit reaching the bottom glass with a <b>dissecting</b> <b>needle.</b> Embed an embryo into the slit, and adjust its orientation (Figure 1). - View under/on microscopes, and record. Gellan gum gel sustains the embryos and gel itself even if the dishes set inverted, therefore the samples can be viewed on upright microscopes. ### Timing - Day - 5 ~ - 7 : mating set up - Day - 4 ~ - 6 : plug check - Day 1 : embryo isolation, culture, labelling, fix and blocking - Day 2 : primary antibodies incubation - Day 3 : washing and secondary antibodies incubation - Day 4 : washing and glycerol/anti-fade substitution - Day 5 - : observation and data recording ### Troubleshooting Under in vitro labelling condition, mouse embryos actively take up rat IgG from rat serum, thus indirect immunofluorescence with combination of primary antibodies raised in rat and anti-rat secondary antibodies is practically impossible. Mouse serum works fine in the in vitro culture, whereas FBS or Knock-out Serum Replacement gave high background staining in our hands. ### References 1. Huxham, I. M. and F.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve blocks {{may be used}} in the {{diagnosis}} of chronic groin pain or for analgesia for hernia repair. This study describes a new ultrasound-guided approach to these nerves and determines its accuracy using anatomical dissection control. METHODS: After having tested the new method in a pilot cadaver, 10 additional embalmed cadavers were used to perform 37 ultrasound-guided blocks of the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve. After injection of 0. 1 ml of dye the cadavers were <b>dissected</b> to evaluate <b>needle</b> position and colouring of the nerves. RESULTS: Thirty-three of the thirty-seven needle tips were located at the exact target point, in or directly at the ilioinguinal or iliohypogastric nerve. In all these cases the targeted nerve was coloured entirely. In two of the remaining four cases parts of the nerves were coloured. This corresponds to a simulated block success rate of 95 %. In contrast to the standard 'blind' techniques of inguinal nerve blocks we visualized and targeted the nerves 5 cm cranial and posterior to the anterior superior iliac spine. The median diameters of the nerves measured by ultrasound were: ilioinguinal 3. 0 x 1. 6 mm, and iliohypogastric 2. 9 x 1. 6 mm. The median distance of the ilioinguinal nerve to the iliac bone was 6. 0 mm and the distance between the two nerves was 10. 4 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The anatomical dissections confirmed that our new ultrasound-guided approach to the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve is accurate. Ultrasound could become an attractive alternative to the 'blind' standard techniques of ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block in pain medicine and anaesthetic practice...|$|R

Dissect E 11 - 12 lungs in DMEM and 5 % serum on ice. Young lungs (E 11 to 11. 5) are best. 2. Wash the lungs 3 x 5 minutes on ice in Tyrode-Ringer's Solution, pH 7. 6 - 7. 7 to optimize physiological conditions for pancreatin-trypsin activity. 3. Incubate whole lungs for appoximately 5 minutes in pancreatin-trypsin solution on ice. The time required will {{vary depending on the}} batch of PT. 4. Wash lungs 3 x 5 minutes in DMEM + serum to saturate pancreatin-trypsin activity. 5. Using tungsten <b>needles,</b> <b>dissect</b> off the mesenchyme and cut off the buds. Alternatively, cut off the buds first and remove the mesenchyme surrounding them. 6. Place into matrigel matrix and culture for three to five days (see accompanying protocol). Isolated endoderm will not survive without growth factor added to the culture medium. ### Solutions **Tyrode-Ringer's Solution, pH 7. 6 - 7. 7 ** component g/liter NaCl 8. 0 KCl 0. 3 NaH 2 PO 4. 5 H 2 O 0. 093 KH 2 PO 4 0. 025 NaHCO 3 1. 0 Glucose 2. 0 Pancreatin/Trypsin Solution component g/ 20 ml final concentration pancreatin 0. 50 2. 5 % trypsin 0. 10 0. 5 % polyvinylpyrrolidone(PVP) 0. 10 0. 5 % Tyrode-Ringer's Solution 20 ml Suspend by mixing for about 30 minutes.

This process is a big pain and time consuming, mainly because the supernatant does not filter efficiently and the Millipore filters must be switched often. ### Collagen Gels **What you need:** - Collagen, type I rat tail (cat no 40236, Collaborative Biomedical Products) - 10 X DMEM, low glucose (cat no D 6921, Sigma Cell Culture) - 0. 8 M NaHCO 3 in sterile water - four-well (1. 5 cm diameter/well) Nunc tissue culture dishes (cat no 176740, Nalge Nunc International) - culture medium (for lung buds) - tissue culture incubator Tissues to be cultured are placed into 50 ul drops of collagen in four-well Nunc dishes. For each treatment, make a separate 50 ul aliquot of collagen gel as described in the protocol below and store on ice. Directly before adding samples, add the NaHCO 3 and mix well. It is necessary to prepare each collagen gel separately because addition of NaHCO 3 makes the collagen polymerize quickly. 1. Place collagen, 10 X DMEM and on ice. Also chill the four-well dishes in the rfridge before use. 2. Mix 45 ul collagen and 5 ul 10 X DMEM. Mix well on ice. The collagen will not gel if kept cold. 3. Add 1. 9 ul of NaHCO 3. Mix well. This step begins polymerization of the collagen gel. 4.

40|$|Authors: Blanche Capel and Jordan Batchvarov Corresponding author ([b. capel@cellbio. duke. edu](b. capel@cellbio. duke. edu)) ### INTRODUCTION It can {{be useful}} to assay {{migration}} between any two adjacent tissues during development. This protocol assays cell migration between the gonad and mesonephros using tissue recombination between genetically marked and unmarked tissue, combined with an organ culture technique. First, agar blocks are prepared in a custom-built mold. The {{size and shape of}} the wells are important to maintain the authentic three-dimensional morphology of the organ; the molds here are designed specifically to accommodate the gonad/mesonephros complex. Freshly dissected organs are then transferred to grooves within the agar blocks, where they are allowed to grow over 24 - 48 h. Using this protocol, organs develop with good morphology, and show only an ~ 12 -h delay relative to in vivo development. ### RELATED INFORMATION Details on the techniques used in this procedure have been described previously (Martineau et al. 1997; Tilmann and Capel 1999; Brennan et al. 2002, 2003). An overview of the preparation of recombinant organ cultures is presented in Figure 1. The sex of the embryos can be determined by [Sex Chromatin Staining in Amnion Cells]([URL] (Capel and Batchvarov 2008). ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Overview of experimental plan. The gonad/mesonephros complex is dissected from wild-type (CD 1) and genetically marked mice (ROSA 26). Gonads and mesonephroi are separated, and wild-type gonads are recombined with transgenically marked mesonephroi and cultured for 24 - 48 h in agar blocks. ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Bacto Agar - Buffer for DNA extraction - DMEM containing 10 % fetal calf serum and 50 μg/mL ampicillin (organ culture medium) - Dulbecco’s Minimal Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), prewarmed to 37 °C for Step 17 - Embryos, mouse, 11. 5 - 16. 5 days post-coitum (dpc) - *Obtain embryos from pregnant mice of both a wild-type strain and a transgenic strain expressing a constitutive marker in all of its cells (e. g., β-gal [Gt(ROSA) 26 Sor/J] or EGFP [Cg-Tg(CAG-EGFP) B 5 Nagy/J]; both lines are available from the Jackson Laboratory.) * - Ethanol (optional; see Step 8) ### Equipment ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2 **. (A) Dimensions of machined mold for casting agar blocks (in.). (B) Finished mold. This mold has three ridges of slightly different dimensions. 1. Agar-block molds - *The dimensions of the wells are important to maintain the morphology of the organ. Design wells specifically for the organ under study, and have them custom-made in a good machine shop. For the recombinant gonad culture presented here, use the dimensions in Figure 2 *. - Autoclave - Beaker - Dishes (tissue culture; 30 -, 60 -, and 100 -mm) - Erlenmeyer flask (500 -mL) - Forceps (# 5; see Step 16) - Hood (tissue culture) - Incubator (tissue culture) preset to 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 - Micropipettor with tips (20 -μL, 200 -μL) - Microscope (<b>dissecting)</b> - <b>Needles</b> (30 -gauge) - Pipettes (glass, hand-pulled) - *The diameters of the openings should be slightly larger than the mesonephroi or gonads, as appropriate; see Steps 21 and 24 *. - Pipettes (plastic, transfer) - *Trim tips to accommodate the urogenital complex comfortably*. - Plates (tissue culture; four-, 12 - or 24 -well) - Razor blade (sterile) - Soap for washing agar-block molds - Stir bar - Stirrer/heater - Tubes (heatproof, 15 mL) - Tubes (microcentrifuge, 1. 5 -mL) (for 11. 5 dpc wild-type embryos; see Step 15. i) ### METHOD **Preparation of the Agar** 1. Add 1. 5 g of Bacto Agar to 100 mL of DMEM in a 500 -mL Erlenmeyer flask. Add a stir bar. - Place the flask into a beaker of H 2 O to make a double boiler. Heat while stirring on a stirrer/heater until the agar is dissolved completely. - *Do not microwave; it will overflow*. - Transfer the flask directly to the heat. Boil the agar for 3 - 5 min. - *Monitor carefully; this boils over easily*. - Aliquot the agar into 15 -mL heatproof tubes in convenient quantities. - *Use 5 - 9 mL, depending on the number of blocks needed for an experiment. Each block requires 1. 5 mL*. - Store the agar aliquots at 4 °C. **Preparation of the Agar Blocks** 6. Wash the agar-block molds with soap and water. Rinse 10 times with tap H 2 O and 10 times with distilled H 2 O. 7. Autoclave the molds. - *Alternatively, just before use, dip the blocks in ethanol and flame them*. 8. Reheat an aliquot of agar in a beaker of H 2 O until it melts completely, then remove from heat and keep in a beaker of warm H 2 O. 9. Working in a tissue culture hood, place a mold with the trench side up into a 100 -mm tissue culture dish. 10. Slowly pipet 1. 5 mL of melted agar onto the top of the mold (surface tension will keep the agar on the block). 11. Cover the tissue culture dish to avoid dehydration. Allow the agar to set for ~ 10 min. 12. Using a sterile razor blade, loosen the agar around the edges. Peel the agar off of the block, inverting it into a 30 -mm tissue culture dish. - *Peel the agar from the block {{in the same direction as}} the trenches are running or the agar will break along the trenches*. 13. Cover the agar with 1. 5 mL of organ culture medium. Allow the agar to equilibrate for at least 2 h (or overnight) in the incubator. **Assembling Recombinant Gonad Organ Cultures** 14. Collect embryos from wild-type or transgenic mice at the developmental stage of interest. Place each embryo in a single well of a tissue culture plate (four-, 12 - or 24 -well). 15. For 11. 5 -dpc wild-type embryos, follow these additional steps: - i. Collect the amnions into 1. 5 -mL microcentrifuge tubes on ice. - ii. Catalog each amnion with the well number containing the associated urogenital complex (see Step 17). - iii. Determine the sex of the embryos using the protocol [Sex Chromatin Staining in Amnion Cells]([URL] (Capel and Batchvarov 2008). - *This is a quick method for identifying XX samples by the presence of cells with a condensed chromatin body*. - iv. Reserve a bit of each embryo’s tail for confirmation of the sex by PCR. - *Tail tips are stable in a dry tube on ice for several hours during dissection. Alternatively, they can be processed immediately for DNA extraction or stored at - 20 °C in buffer for DNA extraction*. 16. Using # 5 forceps, dissect the entire bilateral urogenital complex (see Fig. 3) along with the dorsal aorta from all of the embryos. ![Figure 3]([URL] "Figure 3 ") **Figure 3 **. The entire urogenital complex at 11. 5 dpc contains the left and right gonad (G) /mesonephroi (M) and the dorsal aorta (DA), which lies at the midline. Separate the left and right gonad/mesonephros from the complex when you are ready to assemble to avoid tissue curling. Separate the gonad and mesonephros using a 30 -gauge needle. 17. Place each complex back into the individual well of the tissue culture plate containing prewarmed DMEM. Keep tissues at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. - *Four-well plates are preferred: You can remove one plate at a time from the incubator for fine dissection while the rest of the samples stay at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 *. 18. After determining the sex of the wild-type embryos, transfer each urogenital complex to a 60 -mm dish using a plastic transfer pipette (trimmed to accommodate the urogenital complex). 19. Using a 30 -gauge needle, separate the mesonephroi from the urogenital complexes of the embryos carrying a transgenic label. 20. Using a micropipettor with a 200 -μL tip, remove all but 100 - 200 μL of medium from the dish holding the agar block (from Step 13). - *It is much easier to assemble the recombination tissues in a dry well*. 21. Using a pulled glass pipette that has a diameter slightly larger than the mesonephros, transfer the transgenic mesonephroi into the grooves of the agar blocks. - *Each groove can hold approximately three mesonephroi*. - *Dissect one pair of mesonephroi at a time and transfer them to an agar block to prevent curling of the organ*. - *See Troubleshooting*. 22. Position mesonephroi into the groove under a dissecting microscope (see Fig. 3). - *Do not crowd samples; they are easier to work with if they are positioned far apart*. 23. Using a fresh 30 -gauge needle, separate the gonads from the wild-type urogenital complexes. - *To prevent curling, dissect only one or two wild-type gonads before transferring them to the agar and immediately assembling with a mesonephros*. 24. Using a pulled glass pipette that has a diameter slightly larger than the gonads, transfer gonads to an agar groove containing a mesonephros. - *When drawing the gonads into the pipette, keep track of the “cut” side, so that you can deposit the cut side toward the cut side of the mesonephros in the well*. *See Troubleshooting*. 25. Assemble the cut edges of the gonad and mesonephros together (Fig. 4). ![Figure 4]([URL] "Figure 4 ") **Figure 4 **. (A) Agar block with three trenches, equilibrated, medium removed, and ready for loading samples with pulled glass mouth-pipette. (B) Four gonad/mesonephros cocultures are loaded in the top trench, and one is loaded in the middle left. (C) Higher magnification of coculture positioned in trenches; (left) gonad oriented downward; (right) gonad facing up. - *See Troubleshooting*. 26. Once all the samples are assembled completely, use a micropipettor with a 20 -μL tip to remove the remainder of the DMEM. - *Removing medium from the grooves will promote adhesion between the mesonephroi and gonads once you are satisfied with their position*. 27. Add 350 - 400 μL of fresh organ culture medium to the bottom of the 30 -mm tissue culture dish. Incubate for 1 - 2 h in the incubator. - *Do not disturb the samples until they have had time to adhere*. 28. Incubate the agar blocks in closed tissue culture dishes at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2. - *Placing the 30 -mm dishes inside 100 -mm culture dishes makes them easier to handle when transferring in and out of the incubator*. 29. Change the organ culture medium in the bottom of the dish daily. - *Cultures maintain good morphology for at least 48 h. See Troubleshooting*. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The gonads or mesonephroi stick to the inside of the glass pipette **[Steps 21 and 24]** - **Solution**: Be sure to pick up a small volume of liquid in your pipette before you pick up the organ. - **Problem**: The gonads and mesonephroi are not properly aligned. [Step 25] - **Solution**: The organs are very sticky. Consider the following: - 1. Use pulled glass pipettes that are just slightly larger than the organ. This will provide better control as you pick up and orient the two tissues. - 2. Make sure that the cut sides of the organs are facing one another. - 3. If organs fail to align properly, add some DMEM to the trough and allow the organs to float apart. Then remove most of the medium (i. e., all but 100 - 200 μL) and use a pulled glass pipette or a needle to reassemble the gonads and mesonephroi. - **Problem**: Cultures are not growing optimally. **[Step 29]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Cultures can be improved by pipetting a drop of medium atop each organ to wash it each time you change the medium. Remove the excess washing medium from the well before returning samples to the incubator. - 2. There are differences in serum batches that affect viability and migation efficiency. When changing serum, test three or four batches to determine the best lot. - **Problem**: Mixed organ cultures become contaminated. **[Step 29]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Replace the medium each day to help control contamination. - 2. In general, additional antibiotics and fungicides take a toll on the tissue, but they might be required under some conditions. - 3. Spread the samples among multiple plates so that all the work is not lost if one plate becomes contaminated. - **Problem**: Labeling of plate is lost and it is not possible to distinguish the top and bottom groove on the plate - **Solution**: Always load the plate asymmetrically (e. g., four samples in the top groove, two in the middle, and three on the bottom). Document the location and details of each sample in a diagram in your notebook for reference in case labels on the plates are smudged or lost. ### REFERENCES 1. Brennan J., Karl J., Capel B.
