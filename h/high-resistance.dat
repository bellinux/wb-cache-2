5|$|The {{change in}} {{electrical}} resistivity in samarium monochalcogenides {{can be used}} in a pressure sensor or in a memory device triggered between a low-resistance and <b>high-resistance</b> state by external pressure, and such devices are being developed commercially. Samarium monosulfide also generates electric voltage upon moderate heating to about 150°C that can be applied in thermoelectric power converters.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} an {{electrostatic}} discharge to occur, two preconditions are necessary: firstly, a sufficiently high electric potential between two regions of space must exist, and secondly a <b>high-resistance</b> medium must obstruct the free, unimpeded equalization {{of the opposite}} charges.|$|E
25|$|Whole-cell {{patch and}} {{perforated}} patch allow {{the researcher to}} study the electrical behavior of the entire cell, instead of single channel currents. The whole-cell patch, which enables low-resistance electrical access {{to the inside of}} a cell, has now largely replaced <b>high-resistance</b> microelectrode recording techniques to record currents across the entire cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|Melamine also {{enters the}} {{fabrication}} of melamine poly-sulfonate used as superplasticizer for making <b>high-resistance</b> concrete. Sulfonated melamine formaldehyde (SMF) is a polymer used as cement admixture {{to reduce the}} water content in concrete while increasing the fluidity and the workability of the mix during its handling and pouring. It results in concrete with a lower porosity and a higher mechanical strength, exhibiting an improved resistance to aggressive environments and a longer lifetime.|$|E
25|$|When {{households}} are not charged for the reactive power they consume {{there is almost}} no monetary incentive for them to install power factor correction equipment. This is generally the case today, as household electric meters do not measure apparent power but only real power. Adding power factor correction merely affects the reactive power supplied or drawn and not real power, so utility costs are unaffected. However if there are <b>high-resistance</b> lines connected between the utility meter and a relatively high load then the power as measured by the meter can be reduced by a small amount with power factor correction. Any such savings are usually insignificant.|$|E
25|$|The {{memory effect}} is {{evaluated}} using {{the ratio of}} Rmax to Rmin (see figure). This ratio increases with decreasing light intensity and has a value of 1.5–1.6 at 0.1 lux and 1.05–1.10 at 1000 lux for PerkinElmer devices. In some low-resistive RO models this ratio was as high as 5.5, but by 2009 their production has been discontinued. <b>High-resistance</b> photoresistors typically have a less pronounced memory effect, are less sensitive to temperature, and have a more linear response, but are also relatively slow. Some devices designed in the 1960s had a negligible memory effect, but exhibited unacceptably high signal distortions at high current levels.|$|E
25|$|<b>High-resistance</b> {{grounding}} (HRG) systems use an NGR {{to limit}} the fault current to 25A or less. They have a continuous rating, and are designed to operate with a single-ground fault. This means that the system will not immediately trip on the first ground fault. If a second ground fault occurs, a ground fault protection relay must trip the breaker to protect the circuit. On an HRG system, a sensing resistor is used to continuously monitor system continuity. If an open-circuit is detected (e.g., due to a broken weld on the NGR), the monitoring device will sense voltage through the sensing resistor and trip the breaker. Without a sensing resistor, the system could continue to operate without ground protection (since an open circuit condition would mask the ground fault) and transient overvoltages could occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} a {{resistor}} can be measured with an ohmmeter, which may be one function of a multimeter. Usually, probes {{on the ends of}} test leads connect to the resistor. A simple ohmmeter may apply a voltage from a battery across the unknown resistor (with an internal resistor of a known value in series) producing a current which drives a meter movement. The current, in accordance with Ohm's law, is inversely proportional to the sum of the internal resistance and the resistor being tested, resulting in an analog meter scale which is very non-linear, calibrated from infinity to 0 ohms. A digital multimeter, using active electronics, may instead pass a specified current through the test resistance. The voltage generated across the test resistance in that case is linearly proportional to its resistance, which is measured and displayed. In either case the low-resistance ranges of the meter pass much more current through the test leads than do <b>high-resistance</b> ranges, in order for the voltages present to be at reasonable levels (generally below 10 volts) but still measurable.|$|E
2500|$|Meters with {{electronic}} amplifiers (all digital multimeters and some analog meters) have a fixed input impedance that is high {{enough not to}} disturb most circuits. This is often either one or ten megohms; the standardization of the input resistance allows the use of external <b>high-resistance</b> probes which form a voltage divider with the input resistance to extend voltage range up {{to tens of thousands}} of volts. [...] High-end multimeters generally provide an input impedance >10Gigaohms for ranges less than or equal to 10V. [...] Some high-end multimeters provide >10Gigaohms of impedance to ranges greater than 10V.|$|E
2500|$|In what is {{considered}} to be independent lines of inquiry, Swan's incandescent electric lamp was developed at the same time Thomas Edison was working on his incandescent lamp with Swan's first successful lamp and Edison's lamp both patented in 1879. Edison's goal in developing his lamp was for it to be used as one part of a much larger system: a long-life <b>high-resistance</b> lamp that could be connected in parallel to work economically with the large-scale electric-lighting utility he was creating. Swan's original lamp design, with its low resistance (the lamp could only be used in series) and short life span, was not suited for such an application.|$|E
2500|$|The HP {{device is}} {{composed}} of a thin (50 nm) titanium dioxide film between two 5nm thick electrodes, one titanium, the other platinum. Initially, there are two layers to the titanium dioxide film, one of which has a slight depletion of oxygen atoms. The oxygen vacancies act as charge carriers, meaning that the depleted layer has a much lower resistance than the non-depleted layer. When an electric field is applied, the oxygen vacancies drift (see Fast ion conductor), changing {{the boundary between the}} <b>high-resistance</b> and low-resistance layers. Thus the resistance of the film as a whole is dependent on how much charge has been passed through it in a particular direction, which is reversible by changing the direction of current. [...] Since the HP device displays fast ion conduction at nanoscale, it is considered a nanoionic device.|$|E

50|$|In {{areas with}} <b>high-{{resistance}}</b> soil, {{the resistance of}} the soil wastes energy. Another issue is that the resistance may be high enough that insufficient current flows into the earth neutral, causing the grounding rod to float to higher voltages. Self-resetting circuit breakers usually reset because of a difference in voltage between line and neutral. Therefore, with dry, <b>high-resistance</b> soils, the reduced difference in voltage between line and neutral may prevent breakers from resetting. In Australia, locations with very dry soils need the grounding rods to be extra deep.Experience in Alaska shows that SWER needs to be grounded below permafrost, which is <b>high-resistance.</b>|$|E

50|$|In <b>high-resistance</b> dust layers, {{the dust}} is not {{sufficiently}} conductive, so electrical charges have difficulty {{moving through the}} dust layer. Consequently, electrical charges accumulate on and beneath the dust layer surface, creating a strong electric field.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} (around 1969) Plessey exchanges, a {{significantly}} {{high proportion of}} the reed-inserts were contaminated with a <b>high-resistance</b> film and were prone to giving an intermittently <b>high-resistance</b> contact. If this occurred {{in one of the}} common-control areas of the exchange, it could, and did (despite the A- and B-sides described above), give rise to the exchange becoming isolated (being unable to set up any calls) for perhaps several hours in a worst case. These faults were very difficult to locate and in the end the problems were only resolved by a fairly substantial re-reeding programme carried out on the common-control units of the early Plessey exchanges.|$|E

50|$|The main {{function}} of the glomerulus is to filter plasma to produce glomerular filtrate, which passes {{down the length of}} the nephron tubule to form urine. The rate at which the glomerulus produces filtrate from plasma (the glomerular filtration rate) is much higher than in systemic capillaries because of the particular anatomical characteristics of the glomerulus. Unlike systemic capillaries, which receive blood from <b>high-resistance</b> arterioles and drain to low-resistance venules, glomerular capillaries are connected in both ends to <b>high-resistance</b> arterioles: the afferent arteriole, and the efferent arteriole. This arrangement of two arterioles in series determines the high hydrostatic pressure on glomerular capillaries, which is one of the forces that favour filtration to the Bowman's capsule.|$|E

50|$|A similar {{appearing}} {{product is}} mineral-insulated trace heating cable, {{in which the}} conductors are made of a <b>high-resistance</b> alloy. A heating cable is used to protect pipes from freezing, or to maintain temperature of process piping and vessels. An MI resistance heating cable may not be repairable if damaged. Most electric stove and oven heating elements are constructed in a similar manner.|$|E
50|$|A slight variant has {{multiple}} contacts designed {{to engage in}} rapid succession. The first to make contact and last to break will experience the greatest contact wear and will form a <b>high-resistance</b> connection that would cause excessive heating inside the contactor. However, in doing so, it will protect the primary contact from arcing, so a low contact resistance will be established a millisecond later.|$|E
50|$|Ayrton shunt or {{universal}} shunt is a <b>high-resistance</b> shunt used in galvanometers {{to increase}} their range without changing the damping.The circuit is named after its inventor William E. Ayrton. Multirange ammeters that use this technique are more accurate than those using a make-before-break switch. Also it will eliminate the possibility of having a meter without a shunt which is a serious concern in make-before-break switches.|$|E
50|$|PPE {{provides}} protection {{after an}} arc flash incident has occurred {{and should be}} viewed as the last line of protection. Reducing the frequency and severity of incidents should be the first option and this can be achieved through a complete arc flash hazard assessment and through the application of technology such as <b>high-resistance</b> grounding which has been proven to reduce the frequency and severity of incidents.|$|E

5000|$|Certain {{uncommon}} faults in wiring {{may give}} a good indication on a receptacle tester, but the receptacle may still not work for actual appliances. The lamps in the tester require very little current to light and a <b>high-resistance</b> joint or a stray voltage may give false indications on the tester. [...] The lights in the receptacle tester do not indicate that the voltage (or frequency) is correct, only that some voltage is present.|$|E
50|$|Human {{studies have}} shown that both high {{resistance}} training and endurance training have yielded an increased number of satellite cells. These results suggest that a light, endurance training regimen may be useful to counteract the age-correlated satellite cell decrease. In <b>high-resistance</b> training, activation and proliferation of satellite cells are evidenced by increased cyclin D1 mRNA, and p21 mRNA levels. This is consistent with the fact that cyclin D1 and p21 upregulation correlates to division and differentiation of cells.|$|E
50|$|Bad wiring {{junctions}} {{can occur}} in utilization equipment, cords, or in-situ wiring and especially in a defective switch, socket, plug, wiring connection and even at the circuit breaker or fuse panels. Terminal screws loosened by vibration, improper tightening or other causes offer increased resistance to the current, with consequent heating and potential thermal creep, which will cause the termination to loosen further and exacerbate the heating effect. In North America, high resistance junctions are sometimes observed at the terminations of aluminum wire circuits, where oxidation has caused increased resistance, resulting in thermal creep. No technology located in a circuit breaker or fuse panel could detect a <b>high-resistance</b> wiring fault as no measurable characteristic exists that differentiates a glow fault from normal branch circuit operation. Power Fault Circuit Interrupters (PFCI) located in receptacles are designed to prevent fires caused by glowing connections in wiring or panels. From the receptacle a PFCI can detect the voltage drop when high current exists in a high resistance junction. In a properly designed and maintained circuit, substantial voltage drops should never occur. Proper wire terminations inside utilization equipment, such as appliances, and cords prevent <b>high-resistance</b> connections {{that could lead to}} fires.|$|E
50|$|When {{breakdown}} occurs, the diode {{enters a}} region of negative dynamic resistance, leading to {{a decrease in the}} voltage drop across the diode and, usually, a sharp increase in current through the diode. The diode remains in conduction until the current through it drops below a value characteristic for the device, called the holding current, IH. Below this value, the diode switches back to its <b>high-resistance,</b> non-conducting state. This behavior is bidirectional, meaning typically the same for both directions of current.|$|E
50|$|VSS {{systems have}} been {{installed}} in industrial 6 kV networks {{as well as in}} standard distribution networks up to 35 kV. Operational experience proved that VSS can eliminate even extremely high cross parameters unbalance in the network without negatively influencing the function of earth fault protection. Thanks to elimination of phase capacity unbalance, high reliability of directional ground protection can be reached even with <b>high-resistance</b> earth-faults. The possibility of operating the network with accurately compensated phase-to-earth capacity currents contributes to higher safety of the network operation.|$|E
50|$|The first {{electric}} stoves used {{heating elements}} made of <b>high-resistance</b> metal to produce heat. The stovetop (range) surface {{had one or}} more circular heating elements, insulated with compressed magnesia and sheathed in a spiral metal tube. Heating elements for the oven are of similar construction but an elongated loop to distribute heat. Elements were made as plug-in consumer-replaceable parts and could also be easily removed for cleaning. Temperature of cooking elements was regulated by adjusting a bimetal thermostat control switch, which switched power on and off to control the average heating effect of the elements.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{transition}} metals used or considered {{for use in}} salicide technology include titanium, cobalt, nickel, platinum, and tungsten. One key challenge in developing a salicide process is controlling the specific phase (compound) formed by the metal-silicon reaction. Cobalt, for example, may react with silicon to form Co2Si, CoSi, CoSi2, and other compounds. However, only CoSi2 has a sufficiently low resistance to form an effective electrical contact. For some compounds, the desired <b>high-resistance</b> phase is not thermodynamically stable, such as C49-TiSi2, which is metastable {{with respect to the}} low-resistance C54 phase.|$|E
