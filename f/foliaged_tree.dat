Strychnos potatorum, whose berries are used to purify water, forms a dense <b>foliaged</b> <b>tree,</b> 30 to 60 feet high, some individuals pale yellow, others deep green, both in apparent health. Feronia Elephantum and Aegle marmelos* [The Bhel fruit, lately introduced into English medical practice, as an astringent of great effect, in cases of diarrhoea and dysentery.] were very abundant, with Sterculia, and the dwarf date-palm.|$|E

The moaning rose to a great volume of sound. [...] "They come!" [...] said Tarzan of the Apes, and sought the shelter of a thickly <b>foliaged</b> <b>tree.</b> Quite {{suddenly}} the trees bent their tops simultaneously as though God had stretched a hand from the heavens and pressed His flat palm down upon the world. [...] "They pass!" [...] whispered Tarzan. [...] "The lions pass." [...] Then came a vivid flash of lightning, followed by deafening thunder. [...] "The lions have sprung," [...] cried Tarzan, [...] "and now they roar above the bodies of their kills." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus with Pierre. In the joyous young times, ere {{his great}} grief came upon him, all the objects which {{surrounded}} him were concealingly deceptive. Not {{only was the}} long-cherished image of his rather now transfigured before him from a green <b>foliaged</b> <b>tree</b> into a blasted trunk, but every other image in his mind attested the universality of that electral light which had darted into his soul. Not even his lovely, immaculate mother, remained entirely untouched, unaltered by the shock. At her changed aspect, when first revealed to him, Pierre had gazed in a panic; and now, when the electrical storm had gone by, he retained in his mind, that so suddenly revealed image, with an infinite mournfulness. She, who in her less splendid but finer and more spiritual part, had ever seemed to Pierre {{not only as a}} beautiful saint before whom to offer up his daily orisons, but also as a gentle lady-counsellor and confessor, and her revered chamber as a soft satin-hung cabinet and confessional;--his mother was no longer this all-alluring thing; no more, he too keenly felt, could he go to his mother, as to one who entirely sympathized with him; as to one before whom he could almost unreservedly unbosom himself; as to one capable of pointing out to him the true path where he seemed most beset. Wonderful, indeed, was that electric insight which Fate had now given him into the vital character of his mother. She well might have stood all ordinary tests; but when Pierre thought of the touchstone of his immense strait applied to her spirit, he felt profoundly assured that she would crumble into nothing before it.|$|E

50|$|They {{are seen}} in scrub and light to medium forests but are {{especially}} seen near rocky places within the mainland of the Indian Subcontinent south of the Himalayas and below 1500 m elevation. Humid evergreen forest and extremely arid areas are avoided. Bush covered rocky hillocks and ravines, and steep banks of rivers and streams are favourite haunts.

40|$|Summary. Three {{hypotheses}} of insect-plant {{interactions were}} tested by rearing fall webworm larvae in the laborato-ry on foliage from red alder trees with different histories of western tent caterpillar herbivory. Fall webworm larvae raised on <b>foliage</b> from <b>trees</b> {{which had been}} attacked pre-viously for two summers by moderate densities of western tent caterpillars grew faster and attained heavier pupal weights than did those fed <b>foliage</b> from unattacked <b>trees.</b> This contradicts the hypothesis that moderate l vels of pre-vious herbivory induces the production of plant defensive chemicals in red alders. Growth of webworms, when fed <b>foliage</b> from unattacked <b>trees</b> adjacent o alders that were attacked by fall webworm larvae, {{was the same as}} when fed <b>foliage</b> from <b>trees</b> isolated by distance from attacked trees. This contradicts the hypothesis that attacked trees stimulate the production of defensive chemicals in neigh-boring trees. Young and mature alder foliage was equally good for fall webworm growth and survival, and <b>foliage</b> from <b>trees</b> heavily attacked by both fall webworm and west-ern tent caterpillars for three years produced slow growth rates and small pupal sizes. This supports the hypothesis that continued heavy insect attack can cause the deteriora-tion of the food quality of attacked trees...|$|R
50|$|Many of Rosov's realist {{paintings}} document {{his immediate}} surroundings. He paints landscapes of the Galilee, Hebron, Africa and Tuscany, {{as well as}} views of <b>foliage,</b> <b>trees</b> and sabra bushes. Pilots and soldiers are a dominant theme in his early work. Rozov creates an atmosphere of portending destruction, with violence present in an indirect manner. His painting is typified by attention to minute detail, combining local and European painterly traditions.|$|R

50|$|Sights in {{the town}} proper are few in the little town with its 7,000 inhabitants, {{but it has a}} large 12th-century church, with a north {{transept}} from 1769 (an unusual date for Skåne churches) and a 19th-century tower, along with some picturesque older houses. A peaceful place, the typical Höör house is one or two storeys tall, with no large streets.

40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{investigating the}} proportion of several types of <b>tree</b> <b>foliages</b> leaves as animal feed in different locations and altitudes in Malang Raya. The case {{study was conducted in}} five districts of Malang Raya where were assumed as the centre of goat farms. The results showed that there were 30 types of forage used as goat feeds, both leaves of <b>tree</b> <b>foliages</b> and shrubs, or grasses, crop residues and others. Most forages (73 %) were leaves of <b>tree</b> <b>foliages</b> and shrubs, both legumes, and non-legumes. <b>Tree</b> <b>foliage</b> leaves were more used as goat feeds in the study area with higher altitude, whereas in the area with lower altitude, farmers also utilized grasses and crop residues. The leaves of <b>tree</b> <b>foliages</b> were Paraserianthes falcataria, Gliricidia sepium, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Leucaena leucocephala and Calliandra calothyrsus. Paraserianthes falcataria was most widely used in Klampok-Singosari (88. 3 %). The proportion of Calliandra calothyrsus ranged from 32 to 98 %, while Gliricidia sepium was 58 - 98 %, both were most widely used in Argoyuwono-Ampelgading. Artocarpus heterophyllus was most widely used in Wajak (90. 3 %), whereas Leucaena leucocephala leaf was used by all respondents (100 %) in Sumberdem-Wonosari.

No crepuscular predation of bats was recorded, in contrast to regular summer predation on colonies of little free-tailed bats, Tadarida pumila, but winter emergence rates of these bats at dusk had dropped to < 5 of the previous summer. We predict that many accipiters will be regular predators of bats and that skewed sex ratios and high fecundity may be two means by which bats counter this predation...|$|R
