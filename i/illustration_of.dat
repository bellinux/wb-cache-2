5|$|In 1500 polymath Leonardo da Vinci {{provides}} the first <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> the thyroid. In 1543 Anatomist Andreas Vesalius gave the first anatomic description and <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> the gland. In 1656 the thyroid received its name, by the anatomist Thomas Wharton. The gland was named thyroid, meaning shield, as its shape resembled the shields {{commonly used in}} Ancient Greece. The English name thyroid gland {{is derived from the}} medical Latin used by Wharton – glandula thyreoidea. Glandula means gland in Latin, and thyreoidea {{can be traced back to}} the Ancient Greek word θυρεοειδής, meaning shield-like/shield-shaped.|$|E

In 1717 in London, a Latin-English edition of Metamorphoses was published, translated by Samuel Garth and with plates of French engraver Bernard Picart. The <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> Myrrha was entitled The Birth of Adonis and featured Myrrha as a tree delivering Adonis while surrounded by women. In 1857 French engraver Gustave Doré made a series of illustrations to Dante's Divine Comedy, the depiction of Myrrha showing her in the eighth circle of Hell.|$|E
5|$|According to Renaissance accounts, gigantic, {{triangular}} fossil teeth {{often found}} embedded in rocky formations were once {{believed to be}} the petrified tongues, or glossopetrae, of dragons and snakes. This interpretation was corrected in 1667 by Danish naturalist Nicolas Steno, who recognized them as shark teeth, and famously produced a depiction of a shark's head bearing such teeth. He described his findings in the book The Head of a Shark Dissected, which also contained an <b>illustration</b> <b>of</b> a megalodon tooth.|$|E

Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.|$|E
