50|$|The first {{provisional}} station building became inadequate {{within a}} few years. It was decided {{to build a new}} building, designed by Hauptner and Ebeling and opened in 1850 on a new section of line connecting the BME and <b>DEE</b> <b>lines,</b> which was completed on 9 March 1849. Around 1900, a protruding porch was built in front of the ground floor, which conflicted with the architectural design. Nevertheless, this concept was maintained after its reconstruction after World War II. This will only change with the completion of the current renovation of the station/Döppersberg area.|$|E

A rotating condenser is used at approximately one-third {{of the length of}} the <b>dee</b> <b>line</b> from the shorted end. It is shown to be possible to operate through the range of approximately 9 to 24 megacycles per second as required for the acceleration of either protons or deuterons in the 184 -inch Berkeley cyclotron.

50|$|The Cox line of {{reed valve}} engines {{designed}} prior to 1960 used a rear reed valve induction system. In the late 1950s they played around with rear rotary valve induction (as {{used in the}} RR1) before moving forward with front rotary valve induction for their Tee <b>Dee</b> and Medallion <b>lines.</b>|$|R

40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} studies {{were conducted to}} develop a model of energy expenditure in a population of white-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus townsendii). Field work in southwestern Wyoming during 1985 - 87 showed that the breeding season commenced at snowmelt and ceased during late- July drought. Adult females reproduced relatively synchronously and produced a mean of three litters annually. Greatest fetal production occurred in the second litter period. Collections indicated a 1 : 1 sex ratio, few jackrabbits 3 ̆e 2 years-old, and a density of 7 animals / km 2 in the population. Postnatal growth was sigmoidal, culminating in heavier adult females than males. Using radio -telemetry, a circadian rhythm was detected in jackrabbit activity, with movement beginning after sunset and ending by sunrise. Observations showed that season, snow cover, weather, lunar phase, and predators influenced activity. Energetics studies established the pattern of seasonal acclimatization in the jackrabbit. Basal metabolic rate (BMR), pelage thickness, and body temperature increased but overall thermal conductance (C) and the lower critical temperature (LCT) declined from summer to winter. High winds and low air temperatures elevated metabolism interactively and their effects were most pronounced during summer. Metabolic rate <b>dee</b> <b>lined</b> with incident radiation at Ta 3 ̆c LCT during winter but not during summer. In newborn jackrabbits, body temperature dropped despite increased metabolism at Ta 3 ̆c 25 °C. Cold tolerance and homeothermy developed with age. Based on these and published data, a FORTRAN model was written that simulated the energy expenditure of a population of jackrabbits. Metabolizable energy requirements for maintenance, thermoregulation, reproduction, growth, and activity were estimated. The model indicated that most energy (kJ·kg - l. day- 1) was required by adult females during lactation, adult males {{at the onset of}} breeding, and newborn juveniles. Energy expenditures for adult females, adult males, and juveniles were 191, 130, and 224 MJ·individual- 1 ·km- 2 ·yr- 1, respectively. Total energy expenditure increased with wind and lower air temperature and decreased if juvenile huddling was simulated. The model indicated that the jackrabbit population is not limited by food. Estimated percent consumption of forage energy was 4...|$|R
40|$|Social {{entrepreneurship}} evades easy {{definition and}} conceptualization. In this paper {{we attempt to}} advance social entrepreneurship theoretically by examining it conceptually, from a theory of the firm perspective. If social entrepreneurship entails pursuit of a double bottom <b>line</b> (<b>Dees</b> 1998), the added complexity of the social entrepreneurial venture identified by Tracey and Phillips (2007) should be discoverable from a theory of the firm perspective. Applying the knowledge-based theory of the firm to social entrepreneurship, we aver that social entrepreneurship’s added complexity is manifest when social entrepreneurs make decisions about their knowledge. In contrast to ordinary entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs have to balance two incommensurable objectives when they form their attitude toward protection of their knowledge...|$|R
