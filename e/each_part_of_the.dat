Each transmitter antenna was fed by its own power amplifier using travelling wave tubes with switching diodes and striplines performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in sequence and the receivers had three channels, one tuned to <b>each</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulse chain. This allowed the receiver to send <b>each</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signal to different processing equipment, allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy, while the study of its {{function}} is neuroscience. A number of techniques are used to study the brain. Specimens from other animals, which may be examined microscopically, have traditionally provided much information.

5|$|This {{situation}} improved as COBOL adopted more features. COBOL-74 added subprograms, giving programmers {{the ability}} to control the data <b>each</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program could access. COBOL-85 then added nested subprograms, allowing programmers to hide subprograms. Further control over data and code came in 2002 when object-oriented programming, user-defined functions and user-defined data types were included.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Eurotunnel was in discussions with the Intergovernment Commission, which oversees the tunnel, with the aim of amending elements of the safety code governing the tunnel's usage. Most saliently, the requirement that trains be able to split within the tunnel and <b>each</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train be driven out to opposite ends has been removed. However, the proposal to allow shorter trains was not passed. Eurotunnel Chairman & Chief Executive Jacques Gounon said that he hoped the liberalisation of rules would allow entry into the market of competitors such as Deutsche Bahn. Sources at Eurotunnel suggested that Deutsche Bahn could have entered the market at the timetable change in December 2012. This, however, did not happen.|$|E

5|$|Like the series, {{the game}} takes place over 24 hours {{and has the}} same start and end clocks for each hour, marking the start and end of <b>each</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. The hours are broken down into 58 {{separate}} missions, {{of which there are}} three broad types, each described in further detail below. Some missions are objective based, while others have a time-restricted element. Each mission is graded out of 100 points, based on the quality of performance, number of objectives completed, shooting accuracy and so on. A grade of 90 points or higher rewards the player by unlocking some form of bonus feature, including three movies (interviews with cast about the game, TV promos), 98 images (wallpaper-like images of main characters) and 23 characters (3D models that the player can view).|$|E
5|$|The draught section {{drivability}} test, which evaluates disposition: adaptability, reliability, and calmness, {{consists of}} four parts, and 0â€“5 points are given for each. To pass the test, the horse must score at least one point for <b>each</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test, and its combined score for the test {{must be at least}} 10 points. The first part examines the behaviour of the horse while it is being harnessed and loaded, then unloaded and unharnessed, and the remaining three parts evaluate the way the horse behaves when being driven. These parts often include regulation of the speed of the horse's walk, halts, turns around obstacles, and backing with a load around a corner.|$|E
5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. <b>Each</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.|$|E

5|$|PlayStation Home is a {{community-based}} social gaming networking {{service for}} the PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Network (PSN). It is available directly from the PlayStation 3 XrossMediaBar. Membership is free, and only requires a PSN account. Home has been in development since early 2005 and started an open public beta test on December 11, 2008. Home allows users to create a custom avatar, which {{can be made to}} suit the user's preference. Users can decorate their avatar's personal apartment ("HomeSpace") with default, bought, or won items. They can travel throughout the Home world (except cross region), which is constantly updated by Sony and partners. <b>Each</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world is known as a space. Public spaces can just be for display, fun, or for meeting people. Home features many mini-games which can be single player or multiplayer. Users can shop for new items to express themselves more through their avatars or HomeSpace. Home features video screens in many places for advertising, but the main video content is shown at the theatre for entertainment. Home plays host to a variety of special events which range from prize-giving events to entertaining events. Users can also use Home to connect with friends and customize content. Xi, a once notable feature of Home, is the world's first console based Alternate Reality Game that took place in secret areas in Home and was created by nDreams.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads-up display}} shows Samus's health, the supply mode for Reserve Tanks, icons that {{represent}} weapons, and a map display showing her location and its surroundings. The inventory screen allows the player to enable and disable weapons and abilities. While the beam weapon can be combined, the Spazer and Plasma beams {{cannot be used}} simultaneously. The backup units called Reserve Tanks can be used automatically when Samus's health is depleted. The game also features an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of the}} game. Additionally, the player can use the map computer found in <b>each</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, the player must find and use one of the save stations scattered around the planet. The game can also be saved at Samus's gunship, which fully recharges her health and ammunition as well. Super Metroid has three endings based on the time taken to complete the game, which determine whether Samus poses with or without her suit. The best ending is achieved when the game is completed under three hours.|$|E
