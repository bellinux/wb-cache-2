5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} come <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of people}} that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} {{centered}} on Maroon 5 playing in a dimly-lit house/factory. Throughout {{the course of the}} video, items such as darts on a dart board, candles, pictures, and even members of the band with their instruments are shown fading in and out. Towards the end of the video, Adam Levine is seen walking through a narrow corridor dragging a guitar with pictures {{on both sides of the}} wall fading in and out. When he reaches the end of the corridor, he is <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wall with a small light coming out of it and then flings his guitar backwards and then pounds on the wall. The camera then quickly moves to a scene of the band playing and the lights suddenly flickering on.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Cliff Bole, was a school friend of makeup supervisor Michael Westmore. The scene with Remmick {{at the end of}} the episode was added in post-production, as it was originally scripted to have Riker and Picard come <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> full-sized mother creature. The part where the parasite enters Remmick's throat reportedly took many takes because the bulging effect was made by Westmore blowing into air bladders under a false neck, and Bole kept trying to make Westmore hyperventilate from the exertion. The parasites themselves were created by Makeup & Effects Laboratories from a design by Rick Sternbach. A mold of Paul Newman's face was filled with raw meat and then blown up to create the effect used when Picard and Riker fire on Remmick, but both Rick Berman and Peter Lauritson were concerned that it was too graphic. Dan Curry invited his six-year-old son to watch the episode in order to test how children would react to it; the boy reportedly liked it so much that he suggested the creation of a Remmick action figure whose head would blow up by pressing a button. This resulted in Berman deciding to air the episode uncut with the full sequence included.|$|E

25|$|Despite early {{successes of}} the Jurchens, the Jurchens was beaten off by another general, Yue Fei, {{in a series of}} battles. The Jurchens under a crowned prince Jin Wuzhu (金兀朮), with a large force of hundred {{thousand}} force, decided to avoid Yue and took a route to cross and invade the capital and abduct another emperor. A force consisting of local militias and a few well trained soldiers was assembled in a mountain near the Yangtse River, and Han along with his wife hurried to take command of it. In his journey, he stayed in a local temple where he came <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> few Jin Generals and over a hundred Jurchen warriors. Despite the fact that Han only had a few guards and his wife along with him, they managed to fend the enemy off and took the heads of some Jin Generals.

25|$|Vitthalapant {{eventually}} {{left the}} town for Nashik with his family. One day while performing his daily rituals, Vitthalapant came <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tiger. Vitthalapant {{and three of}} his four children escaped, but Nivruttinath became separated from the family and hid in a cave. While hiding in the cave he met Gahaninath, who initiated Nivruttinath into {{the wisdom of the}} Nath yogis. Later, Vitthalapant returned to Alandi and asked the Brahmins to suggest a means of atonement for his sins; they suggested giving up his life as penance. Vitthalapant and his wife gave up their lives, within a year of each other by jumping into the Ganges in the hope their children might be able to lead lives free of persecution. Other sources and local folk tradition claim that the parents committed suicide by jumping in the Indrayani River. However, orthodox Brahmins of the town still refused to accept the children as pure and suggested that they obtain a certification of atonement (śuddhi) from the pandits of Paithana, which was a centre of orthodox learning.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777, the American {{offensive}} stalled when Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Musgrave and 120 British {{soldiers of}} the 40th Foot stoutly defended the Chew House. After artillery and infantry assaults failed, du Plessis and other officers attempted to set the house on fire. To fellow aide John Laurens, du Plessis suggested the idea of fetching hay from the nearby barn and using it to ignite the structure. Using the kitchen outbuilding as cover, du Plessis reached a ground-floor window {{to the left of}} the servant's entrance. He smashed it and tried to climb in. Perched on the window sill, he found himself <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pistol-wielding British officer who demanded his surrender. At that moment, a British soldier burst into the room and fired at du Plessis but hit the officer by mistake. After this close call, the Frenchman decided to retreat. With numerous American soldiers looking on, he refused to run for it. He later claimed that he retired at a walk, which he managed to do without being shot, though Laurens was slightly wounded in the shoulder. Two of Major General John Sullivan's aides, Captains John White and Edward Sherburne were killed while unsuccessfully trying to carry out this dangerous mission.|$|E

[...] Journalist for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), Svein Terje Torvik described the song as [...] "One of the album's best cuts", while Fox News writer Roger Friedman wrote [...] "its just enough of a new twist to create the most elusive thing of all: a radio smash. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose the song {{as one of his}} [...] "top picks" [...] from E=MC², and wrote [...] "it has a lightness that so much of the album lacks." [...] Richard Cromelin from the Los Angeles Times highlighted Carey's unadorned and raw form of singing in the song, writing [...] "her singing is so direct, understated and unglamorous it's almost shocking -- like seeing a diva without makeup." [...] Margeauz Watsman from Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "dance-floor anthem", while PopMatters Evan Sawdey described it as [...] "certainly worthy of some greatest-hits canonization". Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani felt [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] was a [...] "stroke of genius", and wrote [...] " [...] sounds like a hyperventilating cross between a graduation anthem and an early-'80s family sitcom theme song.

He was appointed Director, Materiel Supply and Distribution (Army), a post which became Director, Materiel Support (Army) in 1997 {{as a result of}} re-organisation, based in Andover, Hampshire. At the end of 1997, he took command of the British National Support Element in the Balkans, responsible for supplying the British contingent of the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR). At the same time, he commanded the Combat Service Support Group, later renamed 101 Logistic Brigade. He returned to the UK in April 1998, only to be told that he would be returning to the Balkans in January 1999 as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). In this role, he was responsible for the humanitarian effort {{in the aftermath of the}} Kosovo War, establishing and maintaining refugee camps in Macedonia and Albania. He was tasked with commanding multinational troops, as well as coordinating the humanitarian efforts of personnel from the British Department for International Development, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and multiple non-governmental organisations. Speaking about his service with KFOR, he later called it a [...] "challenging and demanding deployment" [...] and [...] "the first time that I have come <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large-scale humanitarian crisis." [...] He went on to say that the most challenging part was the military working alongside large numbers of civilian agencies and that the Army needed to learn how to better work with such organisations—a need he said was [...] "widely recognised" [...] outside the military. In recognition of his service in the Balkans, Cross was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2000 New Year Honours List.|$|E
500|$|Jack {{develops}} aplastic anemia like Starr. This ultimately leads Sam {{to deduce}} {{that they are}} biological siblings, and to inform Blair that Jack is her biological son. She angrily confronts Todd. When {{he admits that he}} gave Jack away and forced her to grieve for a child that was never dead, she classifies his existence as worthless and bans him from her life, which results in him being severely emotionally unstable. Blair leaves town with the children, but Todd follows her to Hawaii, where his plans to kidnap the children with help from Ross Rayburn (Shawn Christian) are foiled by Téa. Todd and Téa make love when they get stranded together on an island with Ross. Todd escapes to return to Blair, and protects her when the Mafia comes after her because of her exposé on them in The Sun. As Todd and Blair are about to remarry, Sam discloses that Todd, in an effort to win Blair's affections, staged a hit on their nanny, who had been presumed dead {{as a result of the}} Mafia's retaliation. Todd had used the nanny's [...] "death" [...] as an excuse for Blair to stay with him, later staging a hit on Blair's life, with him as the rescuer. The wedding is called off, and Blair distances herself from Todd. Soon afterward, Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born) kidnaps Starr. Blair exchanges her own life for her daughter's. Todd rescues Blair by kidnapping his niece, Natalie (Melissa Archer), and exchanging her life for Blair's.
