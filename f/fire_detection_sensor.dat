40|$|As {{the field}} of {{communications}} networks continues to evolve, a very interesting and challenging area, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is rapidly coming of age. A wireless sensor network consists {{of a large number}} of sensor nodes that may be randomly and densely deployed. Recent advancements have made it possible to make these components small, powerful, and energy efficient and they can now be manufactured cost-effectively in quantity for specialized telecommunications applications. Sensor nodes are small electronic components capable of sensing many types of information from the environment, including temperature, light, humidity, radiation, the presence or nature of biological organisms, geological features, seismic vibrations and more. Sensor networks have numerous applications like disaster relief operations and wild <b>fire</b> <b>detection.</b> <b>Sensor</b> network research and development derive many concepts and protocols from distributed computer networks such as the Internet. However, several technical challenges in sensor networks need to be addressed due to the specialized nature of the sensors and the fact that many sensor network applications may involve sensors with limited power sources that must dynamically adapt to their environment. In this dissertation, we address the problem of localization and energy efficient routing protocols in sensors networks. In WSN, localization techniques are used to determine location information by estimating the location of each sensor node. Distance measurement errors are commonly known to affect the accuracy of the estimated location resulting in errors that may be due to environmental factors. Trilateration is a well-known method for localizing nodes by using the distances to three anchor nodes. Yet it performs poorly when the distance measurement error is high. Therefore, we propose the LRD (Localization with Ratio-Distance) algorithm, which performs well even in the presence of high measurement errors associated with the estimated distance to anchor nodes. Secondly, to address the energy problem we propose Greedy Routing for Maximum Lifetime (GRMax) which can efficiently use the limited energy available to nodes in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) in order to delay the dropping of packets, thus extend the network lifetime. We define network lifetime as the time period until a source node starts to drop packets because it has no more paths to the destination. In GRMax, We introduce the new concept of Network Connectivity Aiming (NCA) node. The primary goal of NCA nodes is to maintain network connectivity and avoid network partition. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented to characterize the behavior of LRD and GRMax. Results obtained from simulation experiments indicate that our algorithms can compute node position with more accuracy and increase the life of the network. 電気通信大学 201...|$|E

The Panel was charged with providing independent scientific and engineering review and recommendations with respect to the utilization of belt air and the composition and fire retardant properties of belt materials in underground coal mining. The TSP was impaneled by the Honorable Elaine L. Chao and commenced its work on January 9, 2007. At this first meeting, Mr. Richard E. Stickler, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, asked the Panel to report on many issues including how recent technological advances could be applied to atmospheric monitoring systems, point-type heat sensors, current state of fire-resistant vs. fireproof belt materials, and belt fire suppression systems to improve miner safety. In addition, Mr. Stickler asked the Panel to review belt air velocity limitations. The Panel members attended 12 days of public meetings over a nine-month period. Three of the public meetings were scheduled for the Panel to hear from technical experts and those persons or organizations interested in providing input.

40|$|A {{document}} discusses {{an optical}} carbon monoxide <b>sensor</b> for early <b>fire</b> <b>detection.</b> During the <b>sensor</b> development, a concept was implemented to allow reliable carbon monoxide detection {{in the presence}} of interfering absorption signals. Methane interference is present in the operating wavelength range of the developed prototype sensor for carbon monoxide detection. The operating parameters of the prototype sensor have been optimized so that interference with methane is minimized. In addition, simultaneous measurement of methane is implemented, and the instrument automatically corrects the carbon monoxide signal at high methane concentrations. This is possible because VCSELs (vertical cavity surface emitting lasers) with extended current tuning capabilities are implemented in the optical device. The tuning capabilities of these new laser sources are sufficient to cover the wavelength range of several absorption lines. The delivered carbon monoxide sensor (COMA 1) reliably measures low carbon monoxide levels even {{in the presence of}} high methane signals.

In general, the AVHRR and MODIS data are used as the main tools for forest <b>fire</b> <b>detection.</b> In recent years, many scholars developed a variety of forest <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> algorithms based on AVHRR AND MODIS data that were tested and applied in practice and achieved good results. According to the characteristics of environment and disaster monitoring small satellite, the existing contextual algorithm based on MODIS is improved to adapt to HJ-IRS. The process of improved forest <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm includes potential fire spots judgment, absolute fire spots judgment, contextual analysis, relative fire spots judgment and confidence degree of fire spots...|$|R
