5|$|After it {{was clear}} that Austria-Hungary had lost World War I, the Austrian <b>government</b> <b>decided</b> to give Viribus Unitis, along with much of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, to Yugoslavia, the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.

5|$|After this {{construction}} was complete, {{there were still}} more calls to further develop the site, and especially to provide facilities for education about the wars. A $62million proposal was presented in 2006, incorporating a museum and an underground carpark. Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall, the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members, and ran into significant funding problems when the Federal <b>Government</b> <b>decided</b> not to provide funding.|$|E
5|$|During late 1990 {{and early}} 1991 the Australian {{government}} considered deploying F-111Cs {{to expand the}} Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War, which mainly comprised a Royal Australian Navy task group. The Department of Defence and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's (DFAT) preferred option if the <b>government</b> <b>decided</b> to expand Australia's commitment was to deploy at least two RF-111s, though these aircraft would need to have their electronic warfare equipment upgraded to operate in this war zone. Due to {{the small size of}} the RF-111 force, the loss of any of these aircraft in combat would have inflicted a heavy blow on Australia's reconnaissance capability. The second preference in the advice put to the government was to deploy a squadron of four to eight F-111Cs, though Defence did not support this. In the event, the <b>government</b> <b>decided</b> to not expand the Australian force. As a result, the F-111Cs' contribution to the war was limited to conducting intensive exercises with the Naval ships as they sailed through Australian waters en route to the Persian Gulf.|$|E

Queen's Park considered selling Hampden, but a public appeal and minor repair work kept Hampden open during the 1980s. The riot after the 1980 Scottish Cup Final prompted reforms, as alcohol was banned from football stadia in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Eventually the British <b>government</b> <b>decided</b> {{that the}} {{campaign}} in Sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in Suakin. The New South Wales Contingent sailed for home on 17 May, arriving in Sydney on 19 June 1885. Approximately 770 Australians served in Sudan; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Following Khumarawayh's {{ascension}} {{to power}} in 884, the Abbasid central <b>government</b> <b>decided</b> to reassert its control over the provinces ruled by him and invaded northern Syria that year. By early 885 the conflict was proceeding favorably for the Abbasids, forcing Khumarawayh to personally take the field and try to stop their advance toward Egypt. In the battle that followed, the Abbasid troops initially defeated the Tulunids and plundered Khumarawayh's camp, but were then ambushed by a Tulunid reserve force and routed in turn.|$|E

5|$|Fresh {{concerns}} grew {{that the}} Thames might {{be vulnerable to}} attack from torpedo boats and armoured cruisers, and in 1903 four quick-firing 12-pounder, 12 cwt (5.4 kg, 50.8 kg) guns were positioned on Tilbury's south-east curtain wall, supplemented in 1904 by two 6-inch (15 cm) breech loading guns. In 1905, however, the <b>government</b> <b>decided</b> that the Royal Navy and the forts downstream gave sufficient protection for the capital and removed the artillery, leaving only machine-guns in place.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 the Royal Society's {{project was}} concluded, and the {{observatory}} {{was set to}} be abandoned.

The top eight countries, which are responsible for 70 percent of the world's total annual deforestation, have implemented certain forms of decentralization in public administration and forest management. This paper analyzes implications of decentralized forest management for the {{implementation of}} REDD. Three possible options for the involvement of local governments in the implementation of REDD are: 1) the central <b>government</b> <b>decides</b> on a national reference level and devolves the implementation to local governments; 2) the central <b>government</b> <b>decides</b> on a national reference level and seeks expressions of interest from local governments to implement REDD in their administrative areas; and 3) the central and local <b>governments</b> <b>decide</b> on a national reference level jointly and local governments implement REDD activities locally.

A variety of military buildings and masts {{have since been}} erected, including a canteen (which is not open to the public), the Puff Inn. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) leases St Kilda from the National Trust for Scotland for a nominal fee.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, a 500 MW {{nuclear power}} plant was {{proposed}} for the Jervis Bay Territory, 200km south of Sydney.

5|$|In 2002 the Australian <b>Government</b> <b>decided</b> {{to retire}} the F-111s in 2010 {{and replace them}} with Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II aircraft, which at the time were {{expected}} to be delivered from 2012. As a result of delays to the F-35 program, the <b>government</b> <b>decided</b> in early 2007 to re-equip both No.1 and No.6 Squadrons with Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft on an interim basis. No.6 Squadron's F-111Gs were progressively retired {{over the next few months}} as they became due for major servicing, and the last aircraft of this type flew on 3 September. The final F-111 operational conversion course was completed in mid-2008, and all the remaining F-111Cs and RF-111Cs were transferred to No.6 Squadron in November 2008 when No.1 Squadron began the process of converting to F/A-18Fs. For the next two years the squadron operated as a bomber and reconnaissance unit. No.6 Squadron's F-111s were formally retired in a ceremony held at Amberley on 3 December 2010 and No.1 Squadron was declared operational with its new aircraft several days later. No.6 Squadron began to be re-equipped with F/A-18F Super Hornets from January 2011, and became operational with these aircraft on 1 March that year. The squadron's first Super Hornet operational conversion course was completed in October 2011.|$|E
