25|$|Most modern PID {{controllers}} {{in industry}} are implemented in {{distributed control systems}} (DCS), programmable logic controllers (PLCs), or as a panel-mounted <b>digital</b> <b>controller.</b> Software implementations have the advantages that they are relatively cheap and are flexible {{with respect to the}} implementation of the PID algorithm. PID temperature controllers are applied in industrial ovens, plastics injection machinery, hot-stamping machines and packing industry. PID controllers are at the core of multirotor drones as well, in the form of self-stabilising flight controllers.|$|E
40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>controllers</b> {{have several}} {{advantages}} {{with respect to}} their flexibility and design's simplicity. However, they are subject to problems that are not faced by analog controllers. In particular, these problems are related to the finite word-length implementation that might lead to overflows, limit cycles, and time constraints in fixed-point processors. This paper proposes a new method to detect design's errors in <b>digital</b> <b>controllers</b> using a state-of-the art bounded model checker based on satisfiability modulo theories. The experiments with <b>digital</b> <b>controllers</b> for a ball and beam plant demonstrate that the proposed method can be very effective in finding errors in <b>digital</b> <b>controllers</b> than other existing approaches based on traditional simulations tools...|$|R

25|$|The {{brain of}} the ESC {{system is the}} {{electronic}} control unit (ECU). The various control techniques are embedded in it. Often, the same ECU is used for diverse systems {{at the same time}} (ABS, Traction control system, climate control, etc.). The input signals are sent through the input-circuit to the <b>digital</b> <b>controller.</b> The desired vehicle state is determined based upon the steering wheel angle, its gradient and the wheel speed. Simultaneously, the yaw sensor measures the actual state. The controller computes the needed brake or acceleration force for each wheel and directs via the driver circuits the valves of the hydraulic modulator. Via a Controller Area Network interface the ECU is connected with other systems (ABS, etc.) in order to avoid giving contradictory commands.|$|E
500|$|Released in 1998, the DualShock {{controller}} for the PlayStation succeeded its predecessor, the Dual Analog, {{and would}} go on to become the longest running series of controllers for the PlayStation brand. In addition to the inputs of the original, <b>digital,</b> <b>controller</b> ( [...] , , , , L1, L2, R1, R2, Start, Select and a D-pad), the DualShock featured two analog sticks in a similar fashion to the previous Dual Analog controller, which can also be depressed to activate the L3 and R3 buttons.|$|E
500|$|Released in 1994, the PlayStation {{control pad}} {{was the first}} {{controller}} made for the original PlayStation. It featured a basic design of a D-pad, 4 main select buttons ( [...] ('Green Triangle'), [...] ('Red Circle/Red O')), [...] ('Blue Cross/Blue X') and [...] ('Pink Square'), [...] and start and select buttons on the face. 'Shoulder buttons' are also featured on the top [...] (named by the side [...] and 1 and 2 [...] ). In 1996, Sony released the PlayStation Analog Joystick for use with flight simulation games. The original <b>digital</b> <b>controller</b> was then replaced by the Dual Analog in 1997, which added two analog sticks {{based on the same}} potentiometer technology as the Analog Joystick. This controller was then also succeeded by the DualShock controller.|$|E

40|$|The {{extensive}} use of <b>digital</b> <b>controllers</b> demands a growing effort to prevent design errors that appear due to finite-word length (FWL) effects.

500|$|With {{aggregated}} {{scores of}} 57percent and 54 from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively, Battle for Naboos PC port garnered significantly lower review scores than its Nintendo 64 counterpart. Many {{complaints about the}} PC version stemmed {{from the fact that}} the game was not optimized for the PC when it was ported. Computer Games Magazines Adam Fleet thought the game was ugly, citing [...] "truly bland textures and sad-looking 2D sprites". Next Generations Jim Preston bluntly wrote that the [...] "graphics suck." [...] Of the audio, GameSpot's Giancarlo Varanini wrote, [...] " [...] isn't that bad, but it isn't quite as good as the audio in other similar games", and goes on to describe the music as sounding [...] "tinny." [...] Varanini also took issue with the PC version's aiming controls, stating that because Battle for Naboo was originally designed for the Nintendo 64's analog controller, it is difficult to aim using a PC's digital keyboard. Preston agreed, writing that controlling the game is [...] "nearly impossible" [...] with a <b>digital</b> <b>controller</b> or mouse.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} results of car {{collisions}} easier to predict, Reflections implemented simulated physics into Destruction Derby. Director Martin Edmondson believed that the game would otherwise be [...] "completely unplayable", as with [...] "pool when the collisions are all off". Producer Tony Parks noted that the physics were simplified to improve performance and {{to compensate for the}} PlayStation's <b>digital</b> <b>controller,</b> and that the team sought a balance between [...] "realism and playability". Performance was also improved by optimising the game's graphics, and by reducing the level of detail of objects in the distance. Destruction Derbys game engine supports up to twenty cars on screen simultaneously, which no console racing game, other than Daytona USA, had achieved until that time. However, a single wire-frame model, differentiated by texture maps, was used for every vehicle. Damage to vehicles is modelled in real-time, based on the speed and angle of the cars involved. The team made the game's tracks small to [...] "keep the density of the cars on the track very high", which allowed for large-scale wrecks. Plans were made to support up to eight players with the PlayStation Link Cable.|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{ten years}} later the second step was taken – the {{creation}} of [...] "quasi-digital" [...] hearing aid, in which the analog components and digital programmable module was combined into a single compact case.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} real-time {{magnetic levitation}} control with analog and <b>digital</b> <b>controllers.</b> The {{objective is to}} keep a ferromagnetic object suspended, without contact, beneath an electromagnet. The electromagnetic force must be adjusted to counteract {{the weight of the}} object and account for disturbances. This is accomplished by measuring the location of the object using a non-contact sensor, and adjusting the current in the electromagnet based on this measurement {{in order to maintain the}} object at a predetermined location. The system is both inherently nonlinear and open-loop unstable. Negative feedback and phase-lead controllers are designed to stabilize this magnetic levitation system. The controllers are designed using MATLAB. Analog controllers are implemented using resistors, capacitors, and operational amplifiers. <b>Digital</b> <b>controllers</b> are implemented using the TMS 320 C 6711 DSK. In the case of <b>digital</b> <b>controllers,</b> controller coefficients are included in a C language program that implements the phase-lead controller.

40|$|Abstract. — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new control design tool for {{algebraic}} methods to obtain <b>digital</b> <b>controllers.</b> These controllers are very useful to obtain an exact response (zero errors) in the close loop control system. But for students the algebraic methods are difficult and tedious because they involve the resolution of large linear systems. This is the main motivation for the tool presented in this paper. The tool is a graphical toolbox for Matlab and {{it is able to}} show the detailed solution of the controller design using symbolic notation, very similar to the resolution of problems in practical laboratories. The tool includes a visual environment and has been very useful in the learning process for engineering undergraduate students. Four types of <b>digital</b> <b>controllers</b> have been considered: poles placement, cancellation, minimum time, and finite time controllers. The specifications in the complex plane are the starting point of the design and the toolbox can obtain the final controller in two different ways: didactic mode (with symbolic details) and direct mode (obtaining the controller without design details).
