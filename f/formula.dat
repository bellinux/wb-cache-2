He also beat future F1 World Champion Fernando Alonso, then 19, in the 2000 International <b>Formula</b> 3000 season.|$|E
5|$|Although March {{considered}} quitting <b>Formula</b> One {{on several}} occasions, money was always found to support {{at least one}} car. Motorsport historian Mike Lawrence credits Mosley with pressing for a six-wheeled March to be built as a draw for sponsors, having seen the popularity with fans of Tyrrell's six-wheeled P34. The resulting March 2-4-0 never competed in <b>Formula</b> One, but generated the required publicity and a Scalextric slotcar model was profitable. Mosley {{spent much of his}} time negotiating deals for drivers with sponsorship and was also successful in selling Marches to other <b>Formula</b> One teams, such as Williams and Penske. The cars were rarely frontrunners, although the works team won a single race in both 1975 and 1976. By the end of 1977, Mosley was fed up with the struggle to compete in <b>Formula</b> One with no resources and left to work for FOCA full-time, selling his shares in the company to Herd but remaining as a director. March's involvement in <b>Formula</b> One ended the same year.|$|E

40|$|NNIL <b>formulas</b> are propositional <b>formulas</b> that do {{not allow}} nesting of {{implication}} to the left. These <b>formulas</b> were introduced in [15], where it was shown that NNIL-formulas are (up to frame-equivalence) exactly the <b>formulas</b> that are closed under taking submodels of Kripke models. In this paper we show that NNIL-formulas are exactly those <b>formulas</b> that are closed under taking subframes of (descriptive and Kripke) frames.

As a result, we obtain that the set of ONNILLI-formulas coincides with the set of stable <b>formulas,</b> which was introduced in [4].

5|$|From 1963 to 1965, MRD was not {{directly}} involved in <b>Formula</b> One, and often ran works cars in other formulae. A separate company, Jack Brabham's Brabham Racing Organisation, ran the <b>Formula</b> One works entry. Like other customers, BRO bought its cars from MRD, initially at £3,000 per car, although it did not pay for development parts. Tauranac was unhappy with his distance from the <b>Formula</b> One operation and before the 1966 season suggested {{that he was no}} longer interested in producing cars for <b>Formula</b> One under this arrangement. Brabham investigated other chassis suppliers for BRO, however the two reached an agreement and from 1966 MRD was much more closely involved in this category.

He was a {{longtime}} friend of future <b>Formula</b> One world champion Ayrton Senna, who was already racing in the UK, and the two shared a house from 1982 to 1987. Senna, having previously been a <b>Formula</b> Ford driver with the Van Diemen team, used his influence within the organisation to secure Gugelmin a race seat with them for 1982. By the end of the year, Gugelmin was British <b>Formula</b> Ford 1600cc champion. He followed this up by finishing as runner-up in the British <b>Formula</b> Ford 2000cc series the following year. He moved to the European <b>Formula</b> Ford series in 1984, and won the title at his first attempt. A step up to <b>Formula</b> Three followed in 1985 with West Surrey Racing, winning the British championship and the prestigious Macau Grand Prix. Gugelmin then spent two years in <b>Formula</b> 3000, the final step before <b>Formula</b> One.
