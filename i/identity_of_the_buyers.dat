50|$|The MUS affair {{concerns}} the fraudulent privatization of MUS (Mostecká Uhelná Spolecnost), {{one of the}} principal coal mines in the Czech Republic, which took place {{at the end of the}} 1990s.After his time at the World Bank and the IMF, de Groote began working with Stephen Norris, the co-founder of the investment group Carlyle Group. de Groote became the president of one of Norris’s companies, Appian Group, and was a member of the Board of Directors of Appian Group. As it turned out, de Groote used the Appian Group as a screen to effect illegal purchases of stock in MUS, disguising the true <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buyers</b> who were, not the Appian Group, but five Czech managers of MUS. He admitted as much in a testimony he submitted on 12 June 2013 during the MUS trial before the Swiss Federal Criminal Court at Bellinzona. It was a crucial piece of evidence leading to the conviction and prison sentences for the five Czech managers while de Groote himself narrowly escaped prison. He was however found guilty of fraud, no doubt a first for a former Executive Director of the IMF.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} price formation mechanisms {{on the art}} market. More specifically, it uses historical data to test the impact of several factors on the French art market between 1860 and 1950 and on the Belgian art market between 1945 and 1950. The first paper investigates the link between art dealers’ management and artwork pricing. We study the determinants of profit for an art dealer, from the management of inventories to the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buyers.</b> The second paper deals with macro factors and their influence on prices evolution {{in the first half}} of the 20 th century French art market. This market was the most important art market until the Second World War but has been omitted from previous studies. We compute the risk-return characteristics in order to see if previous studies were downward biased. Further we analyze the art market in times of crisis: the two World Wars and the Great Depression. The third paper (published in Financial History Review) explores the question of art acting as a capital flight tool by focusing on a very particular episode in history: the monetary reform that occurred in Belgium after the Second World War and drastically reduced the money supply. It also addresses the question of the link between art prices and the money supply...|$|E

It deals with two main issues: capital structure decisions in financially distressed firms and <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investor <b>identity</b> on the acquisition performance. The first essay is a literature review about equity issues {{as a means}} to recover from financial distress. The study provides, firstly, an overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extant literature on capital structure theory and financial distress in order to deepen <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> how a firm can resolve its financial constraints. On the one hand, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important contributions in capital structure theory are reviewed with a specific focus on equity issues. On the other hand, financial distress is discussed examining the main solutions adopted by distressed firms in order to reorganize (i. e. formal in court proceedings and private reorganizations). Finally, it is discussed a possible gap in capital structure theory and financial distress literature arguing that most of previous research, in the attempt to explain <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> equity issues, just focused on firm specific determinants. With the aim to provide a further perspective for future research, the study examines a series of contributions that consider how capital structure decisions can be affected by external determinants related to the legal system in which the firm operates.

Controlling for this exogenous factor allows me to explain how recovery is affected by <b>the</b> issuance <b>of</b> equity. This study contributes to both capital structure theory and financial distress literature providing evidence on how the capital structure decision to issue equity can drive <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> firm’s recovery from distress. Then, it suggests an alternative explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision to issue equity in distress arguing <b>the</b> relevance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal system as a determinant <b>of</b> this choice. <b>The</b> hypotheses are tested on a sample of 70 firms that recovered from financial distress in 49 countries.

Employing data for 596 rights offerings and 181 private placements for the period 1998 to 2004, we find significant positive short-term market reaction for both rights offerings and private placements; however, the long-term operating performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firms offering private placements is significantly better than the rights offering firms. In China, firms issuing rights offerings are required to adhere to strict rules set by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).

Firms issuing private placements {{are not required to}} meet the same strict earnings/profitability requirements.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of three essays on mechanism design. In Chapter 1, we consider a general Informed Principal Problem in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> procurement. Both <b>the</b> potential suppliers and <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> hold some private information: each supplier knows his cost <b>of</b> production, <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> knows how much each supplier's product fits her technical requirements. We derive the optimal auction in this environment, and analyze the implementation problem with special emphasis on three aspects that are particularly relevant in real practice: privacy protection, dynamic consistency, and simplicity. We design a dynamic mechanism, the Modified English Auction, that implements the optimal auction outcome, is privacy preserving, dynamically consistent, and simple. Chapter 2 is a joint work with Joao Leao. How do mechanisms like hotwire. com work? What is their economic impact on <b>the</b> existing markets <b>of</b> hotel rooms, airplane tickets, and rental cars? We address these questions by investigating whether lotteries over the basic goods can be profitably used by any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market participants. We consider lotteries in which <b>the</b> <b>buyers</b> win a prize for sure, but they do not know which one. Our main finding is that the perfect cartel always uses lotteries to maximize its profits. Moreover, under specific conditions, <b>the</b> entry <b>of</b> a lottery provider in a competitive market may bring the existing firms closer to the cartel solution. <b>The</b> introduction <b>of</b> lotteries has two effects. First, the firms can use them to price-discriminate their consumers. Second, the firms can use lotteries to cover a larger part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market. Indeed, the consumers who find the basic goods too expensive may still want to buy cheaper lottery tickets. (cont.) In Chapter 3 we initiate <b>the</b> formal analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Price-First Score Auction in a general context where the auctioneer is a seller and two bidders compete to buy one indivisible good. The auctioneer's preferences are assumed to directly depend on <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> to whom <b>the</b> good is allocated. In this auction, the bidders submit monetary bids, and then the seller decides which bid to accept after comparing the bidders' scores. A particular class of auction we focus on have simple scoring functions: each bidder's score is given by <b>the</b> summation <b>of</b> his bid and a bidder-specific additional parameter. Our main goal is to obtain <b>the</b> specification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem that generates a closed-form analytical solutions for the bidding strategies. The task is complicated as {{there are at least two}} sources of asymmetries inherent to the problem that can quickly lead to intractable formulas. <b>The</b> main contribution <b>of</b> this work is to provide closed formulas for the inverse bidding functions. Our results generalize <b>the</b> comparison <b>of</b> bidding strategies in asymmetric first price auctions obtained by Maskin and Riley (2002). Even if the asymmetry between the bidders is exogenously introduced by the auctioneer, in equilibrium the disadvantaged bidder bids more aggressively. We are also able to determine <b>the</b> ranges <b>of</b> bids that can be submitted by the two bidders.

40|$|Computer {{technology}} has penetrated virtually {{all aspects of}} modern life. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main reasons for <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> modern computers is their ability to store large amounts of information in central or distributed repositories, and with <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> modern data mining techniques, the ability in finding relevant information from those repositories. This {{has given rise to}} important forms of data stores such as databases and the World Wide Web (WWW). It is known that <b>the</b> typical size <b>of</b> data stores increases at an exponential rate over time. This {{is due to the fact}} that data collection is greatly simplified through computer technology, and due to the fact that storage devices become larger and cheaper all the time. As a consequence, the discovery or extraction of information in a data store is becoming an increasingly challenging task. For example, finding information on the World Wide Web, the largest known source of digital information storage, has become possible through efficient search engine designs. <b>The</b> scalability <b>of</b> web search engines is achieved through the distribution and parallelization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> search task, and through algorithms which scale at most linearly with <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> a dataset. Google, <b>the</b> largest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> web search engine companies, solves the problem through a partitioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WWW into chunks, and assigning a set of chunks to independent computers called chunk servers. Information contained in these chunks is indexed, and documents are ranked by an efficient algorithm called PageRank. This system allows <b>the</b> finding <b>of</b> documents which contain a given set of keywords within a fraction of a second despite <b>the</b> current size <b>of</b> Google’s database, containing an estimated 6 billion documents. Much more challenging is <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> finding patterns in large sets of data. This exercise is commonly referred to as Data Mining. Data mining assumes no prior knowledge about the data in a dataset. This is a common situation arising out of data logging. Logging is <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> recording events for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> keeping a trail (record) of past activities in a system. For example, sales in a supermarket are logged electronically at cash registers which record <b>the</b> sale <b>of</b> any item. <b>The</b> records stored normally include a name or description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> item, the sales price, <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sale, <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> sale, and perhaps other fields such as the name, ID number, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> salesperson, <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buyer,</b> etc. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> such logged data can be utilized to analyse a variety <b>of</b> aspects concerning <b>the</b> system. For example, <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> data logs can help to draw a conclusion about <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> a salesperson, help to discover irregularities which may be caused by a shortcoming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process in the system or due to fraud. It can also serve as a marketing tool to help identify successful marketing strategies, or to draw conclusions about user behaviours. In other words, data mining often involves <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> discovering knowledge from unlabeled data. Logged data is often referred to as temporal data in order to account for potential temporal relationships between entries (i. e. some given sales occurred before some other given sales). <b>The</b> capturing <b>of</b> temporal dependencies is often an integral part of data mining and knowledge discovery tasks. There are very effective methods for discovering knowledge from temporal data. For example, hidden Markov models (HMM) are a popular approach to discover patterns from temporal data. However, HMMs do not scale favourably with <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> a given dataset, and hence, are not normally used for data mining applications of large sets of temporal data. This thesis addresses knowledge discovery in a data mining environment. In this work, we present a new method in discovering patterns from a large set of unlabeled temporal data. Gaussian Mixture (GM) and hidden Markov model (HMM) form <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> our proposed approach. These methods are engaged to cluster temporal data by using a novel recursive GM_HMM model. This recursive GM_HMM model works as follows: it will start with the entire dataset, and will partition the dataset into clusters which are similar to one another using the GM technique. These will be unlabelled clusters, containing patterns which are similar to one another. Then, it will consider each cluster in turn, and attempt to take into consideration <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> each pattern, and use HMM to label them into different labelled sets. It will then consider each labelled set in turn, and then to find sub clusters of similar patterns thereof. This process of applying GM followed by HMM will be repeated for each cluster, until the clusters contain all similar patterns with same label. This recursive process produces a hierarchical model, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> levels in <b>the</b> model is determined by the data. It is a data driven approach, with little a priori assumption about <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> levels in <b>the</b> hierarchical model, or the unlabelled data itself. It is conceivable that the method can be parallelized in that an independent machine can take care of a cluster, and can use the GM and HMM repeatedly to further partition the data, thus overcoming one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major issues involved in using HMM in such applications, as the HMM will only operate on a partition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data, rather than the entire dataset. We apply this methodology in finding patterns in a large scale database of logged information from Health Insurance Commission, Australia’s main health insurance provider. The experimental results on a large set of health insurance data confirm <b>the</b> robustness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patterns in grouping patients of similar medical behaviours into the same cluster. The approach works in an unsupervised fashion in that there is no requirement on <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> patterns which may be embedded in the data. <b>The</b> main significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach lies in the ability to label large collections of data in a semi-automatic fashion. This is demonstrated in this thesis through an application to a large scale real world problem, viz., <b>the</b> logged dataset <b>of</b> health insurance record kept by the Health Insurance Commission of Australia...|$|R
