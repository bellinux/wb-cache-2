5|$|In {{more recent}} applications, the {{influence}} {{has also been}} reversed to motivate <b>geometric</b> constructions by a group-theoretical background. In a similar vein, <b>geometric</b> group theory employs <b>geometric</b> concepts, for example {{in the study of}} hyperbolic groups.

5|$|Islamic <b>geometric</b> {{patterns}} {{derived from}} simpler designs used in earlier cultures: Greek, Roman, and Sasanian. They {{are one of}} three forms of Islamic decoration, the others being the arabesque based on curving and branching plant forms, and Islamic calligraphy; all three are frequently used together. <b>Geometric</b> designs and arabesques are forms of Islamic interlace patterns.|$|E
5|$|Islamic leather {{is often}} {{embossed}} with patterns {{similar to those}} already described.

5|$|Metal {{artefacts}} {{share the}} same <b>geometric</b> designs {{that are used in}} other forms of Islamic art. However, in the view of Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: <b>geometric</b> patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they are most often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. <b>Geometric</b> designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they can form the background pattern.|$|E

5|$|Decorative mosaic tilings made {{of small}} squared blocks called {{tesserae}} were widely employed in classical antiquity, sometimes displaying <b>geometric</b> patterns.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are {{the centerpiece}} of general relativity. They provide a precise formulation {{of the relationship between}} spacetime geometry and the properties of matter, using the language of mathematics. More concretely, they are formulated using the concepts of Riemannian geometry, in which the <b>geometric</b> properties of a space (or a spacetime) are described by a quantity called a metric. The metric encodes the information needed to compute the fundamental <b>geometric</b> notions of distance and angle in a curved space (or spacetime).|$|E
5|$|Finite {{symmetry}} {{groups such}} as the Mathieu groups are used in coding theory, which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data, and in CD players. Another application is differential Galois theory, which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved. <b>Geometric</b> properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in (<b>geometric)</b> invariant theory.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Sahl (ca. 940–1000) {{discovered}} {{the law of}} refraction known as Snell's law. He used the law to produce the first Aspheric lenses that focused light without <b>geometric</b> aberrations.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening flow is {{a process}} that modifies a smooth curve in the Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed {{proportional}} to the curvature. The curve-shortening flow {{is an example of a}} <b>geometric</b> flow, and is the one-dimensional case of the mean curvature flow. Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening flow, <b>geometric</b> heat flow, and arc length evolution.|$|E

5|$|Salvador Dalí's last painting, The Swallow's Tail (1983), {{was part}} of a series {{inspired}} by René Thom's catastrophe theory. The Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Palazuelo (1916–2007) focused on the investigation of form. He developed a style that he described as the geometry of life and the geometry of all nature. Consisting of simple <b>geometric</b> shapes with detailed patterning and coloring, in works such as Angular I and Automnes, Palazuelo expressed himself in <b>geometric</b> transformations.|$|E

5|$|The derived {{category}} of coherent sheaves is constructed using tools from complex geometry, {{a branch of}} mathematics that describes <b>geometric</b> curves in algebraic terms and solves <b>geometric</b> problems using algebraic equations. On the other hand, the Fukaya category is constructed using symplectic geometry, a branch of mathematics that arose from studies of classical physics. Symplectic geometry studies spaces equipped with a symplectic form, a mathematical tool {{that can be used}} to compute area in two-dimensional examples.|$|E
25|$|A <b>geometric</b> polytope is {{understood}} to be a realization of the abstract polytope, such {{that there is a}} one-to-one mapping from the abstract elements to the <b>geometric.</b> Thus, any <b>geometric</b> polytope may be described by the appropriate abstract poset, though not all abstract polytopes have proper <b>geometric</b> realizations.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the <b>geometric</b> {{multiplicity}} of the eigenvalue 2 is only 1, because its eigenspace is spanned by just one vector T {{and is therefore}} 1-dimensional. Similarly, the <b>geometric</b> multiplicity of the eigenvalue 3 is 1 because its eigenspace is spanned by just one vector T. The total <b>geometric</b> multiplicity γ'A is 2, which is the smallest it could be for a matrix with two distinct eigenvalues. <b>Geometric</b> multiplicities are defined in a later section.|$|E
25|$|Atiyah {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that the classification ought to be simplified by constructing some <b>geometric</b> object that the groups act on and then classifying these <b>geometric</b> structures. The problem is that no one has been able to suggest an easy way to find such a <b>geometric</b> structure associated to a simple group. In some sense the classification does work by finding <b>geometric</b> structures such as BN-pairs, but this only comes {{at the end of a}} very long and difficult analysis of the structure of a finite simple group.|$|E
25|$|<b>Geometric</b> group {{theory is}} an area in {{mathematics}} devoted {{to the study of}} finitely generated groups via exploring the connections between algebraic properties of such groups and topological and <b>geometric</b> properties of spaces on which these groups act (that is, when the groups in question are realized as <b>geometric</b> symmetries or continuous transformations of some spaces).|$|E

25|$|Infinite volume {{manifolds}} {{can have}} {{many different types}} of <b>geometric</b> structure: for example, R3 can have 6 of the different <b>geometric</b> structures listed above, as 6 of the 8 model geometries are homeomorphic to it. Moreover if the volume {{does not have to be}} finite there are an infinite number of new <b>geometric</b> structures with no compact models; for example, the geometry of almost any non-unimodular 3-dimensional Lie group.|$|E
25|$|A <b>geometric</b> proof, which {{yields a}} {{stronger}} <b>geometric</b> result, is the uniformization theorem. This was originally proven only for Riemann surfaces in the 1880s and 1900s by Felix Klein, Paul Koebe, and Henri Poincaré.|$|E
25|$|Pieced quilt: Pieced quilts {{are also}} known as patchworks. They consist of <b>geometric</b> shapes taken from {{different}} fabrics and are sewn together.

25|$|The {{product of}} a surface {{negative}} curvature and a circle has a <b>geometric</b> structure, but can also be cut along tori to produce smaller pieces that also have <b>geometric</b> structures. There are many similar examples for Seifert fiber spaces.|$|E
25|$|<b>Geometric</b> group theory attacks these {{problems}} from a <b>geometric</b> viewpoint, either by viewing groups as <b>geometric</b> objects, or by finding suitable <b>geometric</b> objects a group acts on. The first idea is made precise {{by means of}} the Cayley graph, whose vertices correspond to group elements and edges correspond to right multiplication in the group. Given two elements, one constructs the word metric given by the length of the minimal path between the elements. A theorem of Milnor and Svarc then says that given a group G acting in a reasonable manner on a metric space X, for example a compact manifold, then G is quasi-isometric (i.e. looks similar from a distance) to the space X.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, {{pioneering}} work of Dehn, Nielsen, Reidemeister and Schreier, Whitehead, van Kampen, amongst others, introduced some topological and <b>geometric</b> ideas into the study of discrete groups.

25|$|Because of the {{definition}} of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, an eigenvalue's <b>geometric</b> multiplicity must be at least one, that is, each eigenvalue has at least one associated eigenvector.
