Lithium chloride-mediated drying is a commonly used method (Galdiano et al. 2014). A pinch of seeds (ranging from 300 to 2000 seeds depending on the species) were transferred to <b>hardened</b> <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> (Whatman, UK) and stapled. Due to the rare nature of the orchids and therefore limited seeds available, only one replicate per treatment was possible. Seed packets destined for direct sowing were surface sterilised in Magenta™ jars containing 50  ml of 0.5 % sodium dichloroisocyanurate for 1  h. The other seeds were treated with or without vitrification solution. The vitrified seeds were then recovered and sterilised as described above. Once sterilised all seeds were washed in sterile water for 4  min and sown onto recovery medium 1 (RM 1), Phytamax (Sigma, UK) with 3 % sucrose and 0.15 % activated charcoal, and recovery medium 2 (RM 2), Oat Meal Agar medium (Clements 1988). RM 2 was used for both asymbiotic and symbiotic recovery. The symbiotic RM 2 consists of either OMF isolates Tul 1 and Tul 2 and (Rafter et al. 2016) (Table  1). Tul 1 (originated from a lithophyte) and Tul 2 (originated from a terrestrial) were specifically selected as these fungi were isolated from the mature roots of Angraecum magdalenae and Benthamia cinnabarina respectively, two of the taxa studied here (Table  1). Yokoya et al. (2015) were unsuccessful to isolate OMF from roots of both A. protensum and A. sesquipedale roots, therefore, only asymbiotic (RM 1) medium was used for these species. Packets were cut open and seeds spread onto both asymbiotic (RM 1) and symbiotic media (RM 2). Non-cryopreserved controls were treated with PVS 2 and then sown as above.|$|E
