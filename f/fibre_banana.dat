40|$|In {{this study}} <b>banana</b> <b>fibres</b> were {{extracted}} using three processes and advantages/drawbacks are discussed according to yield, extraction time, quality and properties of <b>banana</b> <b>fibres</b> obtained by each process. Three parts of banana tree (i. e. stem, mid rib and leaves) {{of two different}} types of banana trees (i. e. Seeni hesel and Aanamalu) have been analyzed. Two series of filled natural rubber compounds were prepared by changing flier loading from 0 - 50 phr using <b>banana</b> <b>fibre</b> and carbon black as fillers and physical properties were examined. Hardness increased with both <b>banana</b> <b>fibre</b> and carbon black loading. However, tensile strength decreased with <b>banana</b> <b>fibre</b> loading, while they increased with carbon black loading.

Subsequently, a large action plan for the development use of fly ash bricks substitute has resulted in creation of more awareness about the use of fly ash based building materials. In the past one decade or so the joint efforts by R & D organizations, private industries and funding agencies provided the much needed thrust for the actual transfer of technical know-how and product to the end users. Most of the developing countries are very rich in agricultural and natural fibre. Except a few exceptions, a large part of agricultural waste is being used as a fuel.

40|$|SummaryThe {{application}} of natural fibres such as bamboo, jute, banana, coir, linen {{and the like}} in Fibre Reinforced Polymeric (FRP) composites have become so vital due to their high effective stiffness and strength, availability, low cost, specific strength, better dimensional stability and mechanical properties, eco-friendly and biodegradable as compared with synthetic fibres. The interest in natural fibre reinforced polymeric composites is rapidly springing up in terms of research and industrial applications. The increased applications of these natural fibres in such composites are a proof to this claim. The paper deals with the detailed study of bamboo <b>fibre,</b> <b>banana</b> fibre and linen fibre cut into 2 − 4 mm of length with epoxy resin having random orientations. Various tests like Impact test (IZOD and CHARPY test), Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) test and Rockwell Hardness test were conducted on 10 specimens of bamboo epoxy resin composite, bamboo−banana epoxy resin composite and bamboo−linen epoxy resin composite. It is analysed and proved that bamboo−banana epoxy resin composite shows better results in Impact test with values of 4 Joules for Izod test and 5 Joules for Charpy test and in FTIR test, compatibility of fibres with polymers in bamboo−banana epoxy resin composite are the best while bamboo−linen epoxy resin composite shows better result in Rockwell hardness test with value of 40 RHN...|$|E
