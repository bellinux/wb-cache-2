40|$|The {{body image}} of the Turin Shroud {{has not yet been}} {{explained}} by traditional science; so a great interest in a possible mechanism of image formation still exists. We present preliminary results of excimer laser irradiation (wavelength of 308 nm) of a raw linen fabric and of a linen cloth. The permanent coloration of both linens is a threshold effect of the laser beam intensity, and it can be achieved only in a narrow range of irradiation parameters, which are strongly dependent on the pulse width and time sequence of laser shots. We also obtained the first direct evidence of latent <b>images</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>on</b> linen that appear in a relatively long period (one year) after laser irradiation that at first did not generate a clear image. The results are compared with the characteristics of the Turin Shroud, reflecting the possibility that a burst of directional ultraviolet radiation may {{have played a role in}} the formation of the Shroud image...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{summarize}} the important contribution fumished by Optìcs in the studi es of the TS (Turin Shroud) made {{in more than a}} century of researches and tests. In the first section the very peculiar characteristics of the TS are presented and discussed showìng that up to now the double body <b>image</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>on</b> it is not yet reproducible. Some body image formation hypotheses are presented and they will be tested by also means of optical means successively discussed. The second and third sections respectively present the most important optical researches dane in the past and in the present in reference to the Relic and the fourth section discusses some possible optical studies that should be done on the TS to unveil some obscure points. It is also accounted for the conservation problems that are very important for the body <b>image</b> <b>impressed</b> in the linen C Ioth ìn a very particular way. In any case the complexity of the studies related to the TS implies that the future analyses will not be Jet to a limited group as it was done in 2002, but to a very wide commission composed of experts in each one of the many disciplines involved ìn the studies...|$|R

5000|$|Inn signs have {{a history}} that extends beyond the Middle Ages, when many houses were {{identified}} by a sign, often a heraldic charge, which signified that the premises were under the special care of a nobleman, or a vivid <b>image</b> that <b>impressed</b> itself <b>on</b> the memory. The ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii reveal that most of their street-front shops displayed an identifying sign outside.|$|R
5000|$|Apart from scripture, {{experience}} is the strongest proof of Christianity. [...] "What the scriptures promise, I enjoy." [...] Again, Wesley insisted that we cannot have reasonable assurance of something unless we have experienced it personally. John Wesley was assured of both justification and sanctification because he had experienced them in his own life. What Christianity promised (considered as a doctrine) was accomplished in his soul. Furthermore, Christianity (considered as an inward principle) is the completion of all those promises. Although traditional proof is complex, {{experience is}} simple: [...] "One thing I know; I was blind, but now I see." [...] Although tradition establishes the evidence a long way off, experience makes it present to all persons. As for the proof of justification and sanctification, Wesley states that Christianity is an experience of holiness and happiness, the <b>image</b> of God <b>impressed</b> <b>on</b> a created spirit, a fountain of peace and love springing up into everlasting life.|$|R

40|$|At {{the most}} basic level of folk fancy and belief, {{it is clear that}} an <b>image</b> which <b>impresses</b> itself <b>on</b> the mind of an {{individual}} or group of individuals {{has the potential to be}} given significance in the surrounding culture. In the same way, actual narratives owe much to the influence of striking images. Imagery plays an important and often basic role in the actual spread of folk narratives, most obviously in the case of the genre which we refer to as the migratory legend. Ireland has the oldest literature of Europe, apart from Greek and Latin, and so the researcher into Irish lore has sources at his disposal which range widely on the historical as well as the geographical plain. The article discusses the relationship between the brightness of the otherworld, which is so often met with in Irish sources, and the darkness of the nocturnal world of the dead. The duality in ancient Celtic belief concerning the worlds of the living and the dead gave rise to narratives concerning the divine personages Fionn (meaning `white') and Donn (meaning `black'). Well into the 20 th century, stories were told in Irish folklore of great battles fought between two otherworld troops - the fairies of the southern province of Munster under the leadership of Donn Firinne, and the fairies of the western province of Connacht under the leadership of Fionnbharra. In more modern folklore, the two figures continue their periodic contests...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, a bioinspired neural {{model for}} {{detecting}} object motion based <b>on</b> <b>retina</b> computational machanism is proposed based on synthesizing representative works <b>on</b> modeling <b>retina</b> and incorporating some latest findings <b>on</b> <b>retina</b> mechanisms. To understand more in-depth the retina machanism of motion detection, the spatio-temporal properties {{of each type}} of neurons in the retina motion pathway are then mathematically analyzed. And then a set of experiments and quantitative analysis of the experimental results are accomplished for assessing the model performance on motion detection. Experimental results show {{the effectiveness of this}} proposed model on detecting object motion.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a simple yet robust {{unsupervised}} algorithm for automated localization of macula-fovea area <b>on</b> <b>retina</b> images. The small sizes and weak contrast of the macula-fovea area <b>on</b> <b>retina</b> images make it unreliable to detect it directly. As such, we extract the retina blood vessel network topology based on local energy function of blood vessel widths and densities {{and use it}} as the main image cue to position the macula-fovea area. Regardless of the severity of most retinal diseases as well as variations in field clarity, the high level topology of the retinal blood vessel flows remains fairly predictable. Compared with conventional algorithms, our method can effectively localize the macula-fovea area <b>on</b> <b>retina</b> images with inadequate field clarity and diseased conditions. The algorithm is tested on both STARE and DRIVE retina image databases and gained satisfactory detection results.
