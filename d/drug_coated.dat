Coated pellets possessed three polymorphic forms of HSO but only the stable form was dominant after tempering. Tempered pellets presented crystal growth of HSO with 1 - 2 mu m microstructure elements. This morphological change led to the reduced porosity and increased surface area of the pellets as well as the increased drug release.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{the investigation of}} the release mechanism of the cationic <b>drug</b> <b>coated</b> with Surelease® after curing compared with nonionic and anionic drug. The release rate of cured propafenone hydrochloride pellets coated with Surelease® was increased significantly compared with uncured ones. The changes in release rate after seal-coating proved the migration of drug into the polymer film. Based on a comparative study of ammonia permeation tests and the impact of ammonia on drug with different properties, it was shown that the change in release of the cationic drug after curing was related to the combination of cationic drug and ammonia in Surelease®. Also, the scanning electron microscopy results showed that curing and dissolution can both prevent polymer film coalescence. During coating, the evaporated ammonia combined with the cationic drug and the polymer film coalesced. However, the combined ammonia could be decomposed during curing and interrupt the coalescence of the polymer-coat, leading to increased release. In an optimized process, the ammonia in the Surelease® can be evaporated quickly and the ionization of the drug will be reduced.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of Simvastatin, locally applied from intramedullary coated and bioactive implants, on bone integration using biomechanical and histomorphometrical analyses. Methods Eighty rats received retrograde nailing of the femur with titanium implants: uncoated vs. polymer-only (poly(D,L-lactide)) vs. polymer plus <b>drug</b> <b>coated</b> (either Simvastatin low- or high dosed; “SIM low/ high”). Femurs were harvested after 56 days for radiographic and histomorphometric or biomechanical analysis (push-out). Results Radiographic analysis revealed no pathological findings for animals of the control and SIM low dose group. However, n= 2 / 10 animals of the SIM high group showed osteolysis next to the implant without evidence of bacterial infection determined by microbiological analysis. Biomechanical results showed a significant decrease in fixation strength for SIM high coated implants vs. the control groups (uncoated and PDLLA). Histomorphometry revealed a significantly reduced total as well as direct bone/implant contact for SIM high- implants vs. controls (uncoated and PDLLA-groups). Total contact was reduced for SIM low vs. uncoated controls. Significantly reduced new bone formation was measured around SIM high coated implants vs. both control groups.

40|$|Drug-eluting stents are small, metallic, {{wire-mesh}} tubes {{that are}} implanted into occluded arteries {{that have been}} restored to their original patency through the expansion of a balloon catheter. The stent acts as a mechanical scaffold that minimises the risk of arterial collapse, whilst a <b>drug</b> <b>coating</b> on the stent surfaces reduces smooth muscle cell proliferation at arterial injury sites. However, in-stent restenosis – defined as the reduction in diameter of a stented vessel by more than 50 % – still persists in up to 20 % of drug-eluting stent patients. Furthermore, blood clots persist on the surfaces of drug-eluting stents in up to 0. 8 % of patients even after more than 30 days have passed since stent implantation. This condition, known as late stent thrombosis, {{is associated with a}} 45 % mortality rate. The primary aim of this thesis is to use computational fluid dynamics analyses to identify methods of attenuating the stent-induced haemodynamic disturbances that give rise to these diseases, without compromising drug transport into the arterial tissue. The haemodynamic and drug transport behaviour of stented arteries are also characterised in these numerical studies and the drug transport models used are validated using in-vitro experiments. The results obtained showed that the non-Newtonian properties of blood, its complex near-wall behaviour, and the pulsatility of its flow each have minimal impact on the drug transport behaviour from stents into arterial tissue. This is because the surfaces of the stents that are exposed to arterial blood flow are much more rapidly depleted of drug than the surfaces that directly contact arterial tissue. Furthermore, the drug that is transported from these non-contacting surfaces is not significantly taken up by the arterial tissue but is instead lost to the surrounding blood flow. Hence, the overall drug uptake is driven primarily by this direct contact whilst flow-mediated drug transport is negligible. It is therefore concluded that drug transport can be enhanced in stented arteries by extending the region of contact between the <b>drug</b> <b>coating</b> and the arterial tissue. Finally, it is shown that this extended contact region can be used in conjunction with streamlined stent strut geometries to alleviate the adverse haemodynamics of stented vessels without compromising drug uptake. Ultimately, it is hoped that these results can be used by device designers to mitigate the risk of stent thrombosis and in-stent restenosis in the next generation of drug-eluting stents...|$|R

In this dissertation, I study the transport, safety and efficacy of moving <b>drug</b> <b>coated</b> magnetic nanocarriers in different types of tissue. Movement of magnetic nanocarriers of sizes ranging from 100 nm to 1 µm with different biocompatible coatings (Starch, PEG, Lipid and Chitosan) was quantified in different tissue types using an automated cryostat system. The safety of moving magnetic nanocarriers in live rodent brain tissue was assessed using electrophysiology, calcium imaging and immunohistochemistry. Moving magnetic nanocarriers in brain tissue did not significantly affect the firing ability of single neurons, synaptic connectivity and the overall functioning of the neuron network. As part of efficacy studies, steroid-eluting magnetic nanoparticles were targeted using external magnets to the inner ear of mice to counter hearing loss caused by cisplatin chemotherapeutics. This targeted steroid delivery to the cochlea significantly reduced the change in hearing threshold at 32 KHz caused by cisplatin injections and protected the hair cells from significant damage.

Precoating the microspheres with magnesium stearate (MgSt) excipient solutions (1 %– 2 %) significantly increased (p < 0. 05, n = 5) the FPF of SS (11. 4 %– 15. 4 %), whereas precoating with leucine had a similar effect (FPF = 11. 3 ± 1. 1 %), but was independent of the solution concentration. The force of adhesion (by atomic force microscopy) between the PCL microspheres and SS was reduced from 301. 4 ± 21. 7 [*]nN to 110. 9 ± 30. 5 nN and 121. 8 ± 24. 6 nN, (p < 0. 05, n = 5) for 1 % and 2 % MgSt solutions, respectively, and to 148. 1 ± 21. 0 nN when coated with leucine. The presence of PVA on the PCL microspheres (detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) affected the detachment of SS due to strong adhesion between the two, presumably due to capillary forces acting between them.

Within the biological tissue, the model can account for nonlinear saturable reversible binding, with linear reversible binding and linear irreversible binding being recovered as special cases. The generality of our model will allow the simulation of the release {{from a wide range}} of drug delivery devices encompassing many different applications. To demonstrate the efficacy of our model we simulate results for the particular application of drug release from arterial stents...|$|R
