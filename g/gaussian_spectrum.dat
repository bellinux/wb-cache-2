50|$|Similar to {{temporal}} phasor the Fourier {{transformation of}} spectra {{can be used}} to make phasor. Considering a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>spectrum</b> with zero spectral width and changing the emission maximum from channel zero to K the phasor rotates on a circle from small angles to larger angles. This corresponds to shift theorem of Fourier transformation. Changing the spectral width from zero to infinity moves the phasor toward center. This means that the phasor for background signal which can be considered as a spectrum with infinite spectral width is located at center of phasor with coordinate of (0,0).|$|E

50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the z-value of {{the positioning}} stage, when the modulation of the interference signal {{for a certain}} pixel is greatest, defines the height value for this pixel. Therefore, the quality {{and shape of the}} correlogram have a major influence on the system’s resolution and accuracy. The most important features of the light source are its wavelength and coherence length. The coherence length determines the width of the correlogram, which relies on the spectral width of the light source, as well as on structural aspects such as the spatial coherence of the light source and the numerical aperture (NA) of the optical system. The following discussion assumes that the dominant contribution to the coherence length is the emission spectrum. In Figure 4, you can see the spectral density function for a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>spectrum,</b> which is, for example, a good approximation for a light emitting diode (LED). The corresponding intensity modulation is shown to be substantial only in the neighborhood of position z0 where the reference and object beams have the same length and superpose coherently. The z-range of the positioning stage in which the envelope of intensity modulation is higher than 1/e of the maximum value determines the correlogram width. This corresponds to the coherence length because the difference of the optical path length is twice the length difference of the reference and measurement arms of the interferometer. The relationship between correlogram width, coherence length and spectral width is calculated for the case of a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>spectrum.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{diffraction}} of a unidirectional incident wave group by a bottom-seated cylinder is considered. We assume the amplitude {{of the incoming}} wave to be small in comparison with other linear scales of the problem, and develop the corresponding second-order perturbation theory. We use the Fourier transform to treat time variation and separate spatial variables when solving the non-homogeneous second-order problem. The resulting set of non-homogeneous Bessel equations is solved numerically. Solutions for various types of incoming wave spectrum are obtained including the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>spectrum</b> and the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum. To validate the method, problems with gradually decreasing bandwidth of <b>Gaussian</b> <b>spectrum</b> are solved and it is shown that the corresponding solution approaches that for the monochromatic case. The Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum {{with a set of}} realistic physical parameters is used as an example of extreme wave interaction with an offshore structure. The corresponding first- and second-order solutions are obtained and the effect of non-linearity on the solution is discussed with the emphasis on the growth of maximum free-surface elevation on the cylinder's surface and generation of high frequency free radiated waves. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A new generation of quasi-monochromatic, high-flux X-ray sources is currently under development, based on Thomson scattering of photons produced by a laser on a highly focused electron beam. In this paper we investigate the effect of different spectral distributions on the image contrast on 2 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, 8 cm breast mammographic phantoms containing details of different composition (tumor mass and calcification details) and thickness. In the simulations we assume a homogeneous breast composition and three compositions (25 %; 50 % and 75 % glandular) are investigated. We simulate monochromatic, quasi-monochromatic and polychromatic X-ray sources in order to define the optimal energies that maximize the image quality parameter. In particular we compare the simulations of the <b>Gaussian</b> quasi-monochromatic <b>spectra.</b> having different energy standard deviations (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 keV) with traditional X-ray tubes spectra.

40|$|Using {{the concept}} of damage {{accumulation}} for the fatigue design of components under operational conditions, the correct damage sum is an important quantity. Assuming the tehoretical quantity D= 1, the calculated life time is often higher than the experimental. Therefore the real damage sum combined with the corresponding modified Miner rule should be determined. The investigation is based on fatigue tests with different notched specimens under constant amplitude loading and various <b>gaussian</b> <b>spectra.</b> Damage calculation were carried out by four different modifications of the Miner rule: Miner original, Miner-Haibach, Miner elementar (Corton-Dolan) and Miner-Liu-Zenner.

40|$|Abstract: The {{existence}} of the local maximum of information obtained in univariate analysis was discovered for the first time. The information content was shown to be maximal {{at the point where}} the predicted concentration is close to the average of the calibration set concentrations. This result was obtained using a new expression for the systematic error of the measured concentration caused by systematic errors in the preparation of standard samples. The information content of the analysis of multicomponent mixtures was calculated numerically using simulated <b>Gaussian</b> <b>spectra</b> and the spectrum of Excedrin tablet components. It was shown that the informational approach allows balancing the ratio between random and systematic errors.

40|$|Within the {{structural}} durability evaluation of welded structures under spectrum loading, {{the influence of}} overloads on the fatigue life due to special events during service must also be considered. For this, butt welds and transverse stiffeners manufactured from the steel grades S 355 N/M, 6900 and 9600 were submitted to <b>Gaussian</b> <b>spectra</b> without and with superimposed overload spectra. The overloads harmed only the low-strength joints under pulsating bending. In all the other cases investigated, with low-, medium- and high-strength steels under fully reversed and pulsating loadings, a significant decrease of fatigue life was not observed; on the contrary, a significant increase of fatigue life could even be observed. This behaviour is explained by modelling the notch stresses and strains in the weld toes with the appertaining cyclic elastic-plastic material law and considering the local residual stresses. The modelling comprised also the crack propagation behaviour. Not only the fatigue life to crack initiation but also the crack propagation life is increased by the overload spectra...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an effective approach for the optimization of multiband spectra to produce prospective white-light spectra having specific color temperatures. The optimization process employs a genetic algorithm known as differential evolution, {{which aims to}} minimize the color rendering differences between a prospective white-light spectrum and its corresponding reference illuminant. Color rendering is assessed by calculating the CIEDE 2000 color difference (ΔE 00) for 14 CIE test colors under the two sources. Optimized white-light spectra were matched to three CIE standard illuminants, that is, A (2856 [*]K), D 50 (5003 [*]K), and D 65 (6504 [*]K). Optimal solutions for three- and four-band 25 and 50 [*]nm <b>Gaussian</b> <b>spectra</b> are presented and analyzed, together with mixed 4 -LED spectra that were optimized in the same way.
