5|$|On 23 December 1972 at 16:30, the company's most fatal {{accident}} occurred. F-28 LN-SUY Sverre Sigurdson on Flight 239 from Ålesund to Oslo crashed at Asker, killing 40 of the 45 people on board, including {{the crew of}} three. The cause of the accident was never discovered, although a possibility could have been faults with the <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|The AW101's {{navigation}} system includes a GPS receiver and inertial {{navigation system}}, VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR), <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> (ILS), TACAN, and automatic direction finding. The Mk1 and Mk3 {{are equipped with}} a Doppler velocity system (DVS) which provides relative ground velocities; the DVS is also linked into the AFCS {{as part of the}} autostabilisation system. For safety, the aircraft is equipped with obstacle and terrain avoidance warning systems, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), and both voice and flight data recorders.|$|E
5|$|The airport {{had very}} poor {{operating}} conditions. Whenever an aircraft was to land, the cranes at the shipyard {{had to be}} moved to allow sufficient clearance. Conversely, the airport {{could not be used}} when ships were launched. The industrial buildings were located just next to the taxiway. The control tower was located such that it did not have visual sight of the entire runway. The surrounding terrain, consisting of deep fjords, mountains and a town, made it impossible to install an <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system.</b> This again meant that the airport could only be served during daylight. The airport never received a permanent operating license.|$|E
50|$|Space {{modulation}} is {{a method}} whereby signals are modulated within airspace such as that used in <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Radio {{navigation}} aids including {{distance measuring}} equipment (DME), VHF omnidirectional range (VOR), non-directional beacons (NDBs) and <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems</b> (ILSs).|$|R
50|$|Born in Samara, Russia, Alford invented and {{developed}} antennas for radio navigation systems, now used for VHF omnidirectional range and <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{system used}} at the time had four basic control modes: HEADING, VOR/LOC, ILS, and INS. The HEADING mode maintained a constant magnetic course selected by the pilot. The VOR/LOC mode maintained the plane on a specific course, transmitted from a VOR (VHF omnidirectional range, a type of short-range radio signal transmitted from ground beacons) or Localizer (LOC) beacon selected by the pilot. The ILS (<b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system)</b> mode caused the plane to track both vertical and lateral course beacons, {{which led to a}} specific runway selected by the pilot. The INS (inertial navigation system) mode maintained the plane on lateral course lines between selected flight plan waypoints programmed into the INS computer.|$|E
5|$|In March 1985, Partnair {{was granted}} {{concession}} for scheduled services from Fornebu via Notodden to Stavanger. The route was started on 15 August using a ten-seat Beechcraft 200 Super King Air and flew twice a day, {{five days a}} week. This route was made possible after an <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> was installed at the airport. The NOK2 million cost had been paid for by Norsk Hydro, while Tinfos had paid NOK100,000 for new landing lights. The upgrades also included a new terminal, which included a café in the second story and seating for 14 people. Ticket sales and check-in was managed by NSB Reisebyrå, {{a subsidiary of the}} Norwegian State Railways. After five months, Partnair had lost NOK1.2 million on the route. In average, they were selling three to four tickets per flight to Stavanger, and one to Oslo. From March 1986, the leg from Notodden to Oslo was dropped and the service to Stavanger reduced. However, the route proved unprofitable and was eventually terminated later the same month.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish Airline Pilots Association {{stated that}} an <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> might have {{prevented}} the accident.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, the Murphy Terminal was {{expanded}} with an International Arrivals wing. This {{was followed by}} the installation of <b>Instrument</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems</b> on two runways in 1977.|$|R
50|$|All {{approaches}} except Runway 29 have <b>Instrument</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems</b> and Runway 4R is certified for Category III approaches. Runway 22L {{had been}} upgraded to CAT III approach capability.|$|R
50|$|All radio-navigation beacons are checked {{periodically}} {{to ensure that}} they are performing to the appropriate International and National standards. This includes VOR beacons, Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), <b>Instrument</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems</b> (ILS), and Non-Directional Beacons (NDB).|$|R
25|$|A109E Power Elite: A {{stretched}} cabin {{version of}} A109E Power. Features a glass cockpit with two complete sets of pilot instruments and navigation systems, including a three-axis autopilot, an auto-coupled <b>Instrument</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>System</b> and GPS.|$|E
25|$|The <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> (ILS) for runway 21 was {{upgraded}} to category III in 2008, which allows landings in very low visibility conditions. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol {{is the only}} other airport in the Netherlands that has category III ILS.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 {{an airport}} traffic control tower was built and the main runway was {{extended}} from 3,900 feet to 5,300. In 1963 an <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> was installed to help during poor weather. In 1977 the runway was further lengthened to 6,500 feet.|$|E
50|$|Since 2007, {{the airport}} has {{received}} upgrades to {{air traffic control}} equipment, <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems,</b> and runway lighting, {{as well as a}} runway extension at both ends. The Walvis Bay VOR-DME (Ident: WBV) and non-directional beacon (Ident: WB) are located on the field.|$|R
25|$|The <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system's</b> {{vertical}} guidance (glide slope) on runway 28L {{was out of}} service, as scheduled, beginning on June 1 (and a Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) to that effect had been issued); therefore, a Precision ILS approach to this runway was not possible.|$|R
5000|$|Ground radar (cf. {{airborne}} radar system) is a radar positioned {{on the ground}} and used for air defense (e.g., ground-controlled interception), command guidance (e.g., ground-directed bombing), air traffic control (i.e., radar control), <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems,</b> radar bomb scoring, etc.. Ground radar may refer to: ...|$|R
25|$|Radio {{aeronautical}} navigation aids (Navaids) {{use other}} frequencies. Non-directional beacons (NDB)s operate on low frequency and medium frequency bands between 190–415kHz and 510–535kHz. The <b>Instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> (ILS) glide path operates in the UHF frequency range of 329.3–335.0MHz with marker beacons at 75 MHZ. Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) also uses UHF from 962–1150MHz.|$|E
25|$|Runways 10L and 10R have Category III ILS (<b>Instrument</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>System)</b> approaches. Runway 28R is {{certified}} for Category I ILS and {{is authorized}} for Category II approaches but requires special aircrew and aircraft certification. Runways 28L and 32 have Category I ILS approaches and Runways 10C/28C has LOC/GS. All runways have GPS approaches as well.|$|E
25|$|The airport {{has been}} set up and {{upgraded}} with technology and instruments worth BDT 70 million up to the 2nd quarter of 2012, by the CAAB. They include: <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system,</b> distance measuring equipment and flight calibration system, which will help the operational standards of the airport. 2 more boarding bridges have been operational, and another is under manufacturing.|$|E
50|$|All radio {{navigation}} beacons {{are required to}} monitor their own output. Most have redundant systems, so that the failure of one system will cause automatic change-over {{to one or more}} standby systems. The monitoring and redundancy requirements in some <b>Instrument</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems</b> (ILS) can be very strict.|$|R
5000|$|The F3F was {{featured}} as an [...] "experimental fighter" [...] in Warner Bros.'s Wings of the Navy (1939). The F3F-2 {{was featured}} in the 1940 film Flight Command, starring Robert Taylor as a pilot whose work developing <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems</b> helps his lost squadron return to NAS North Island.|$|R
40|$|System of {{microwave}} instrumentation and data-processing equipment {{developed to}} enable ground-based calibration of microwave scanning-beam <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> (MSBLS) at distances of about 500 to 1, 000 ft from MSBLS transmitting antenna. Ensures accuracy of MSBLS near touchdown point, {{without having to}} resort to expense and complex logistics of aircraft-based testing. Modified versions prove useful in calibrating aircraft <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{distance}} from key destinations, {{the length of}} runway available, {{and the type of}} aircraft available in the region dictate that air services to St Helena must operate to the requirements of extended twin engine operations (ETOPS) which implies the provision of an instrument approach system based on an off-set <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> localiser (ILS LLZ).|$|E
25|$|The {{infrastructure}} for a renewed airlift, however, {{was kept in}} place and was constantly improved until German reunification. The runway was extended in the 1960s and an <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> (ILS) for runway 26 was installed. At {{the end of the}} 1980s, shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the rail siding received an extensive lighting system.|$|E
25|$|A {{multi-mission}} {{avionics system}} includes a heads-up display (HUD), advanced radar, AN/ASN-109 {{inertial guidance system}} (INS), flight instruments, ultra high frequency (UHF) communications, and tactical air navigation system (TACAN) and <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> (ILS) receivers. It also has an internally mounted, tactical electronic warfare system, Identification friend or foe (IFF) system, electronic countermeasures suite and a central digital computer.|$|E
25|$|G-4MD: Further {{development}} of G-4M upgrade including: LCD flight screens, HOTAS, HUD, integrated mission computers, distance measuring equipment, GPS-based navigation systems, identification friend or foe, navcomm units, mission records, and VHF omni-range and <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems.</b> Integration of guided weapons, countermeasures and targeting systems is also scheduled {{as part of}} the upgrade.|$|R
50|$|It is a class 4D airport. Runway 13-31 is 9186 {{feet long}} and 200 feet wide. It is {{equipped}} at both ends with <b>Instrument</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems</b> (ILS), Approach Lighting Systems (ALS) with sequenced flashers, and touchdown zone (TDZ) lighting. Both the Boeing 737-900 and Boeing 767-300ER aircraft are capable of landing there.|$|R
2500|$|The {{next phase}} of {{development}} was the second runway, which was completed three months ahead of schedule and opened in April 1984. This runway, located [...] north of the existing runway and parallel to it and is equipped with the latest meteorological, airfield lighting and <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems</b> to give the airport a Category II classification.|$|R
25|$|On 23 December 1972 at 16:30, the company's most fatal {{accident}} occurred. F-28 LN-SUY Sverre Sigurdson on Flight 239 from Ålesund to Oslo crashed at Asker, killing 40 of the 45 people on board, including {{the crew of}} three. The cause of the accident was never discovered, although a possibility could have been faults with the <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|Navigation is via both GPS and an {{inertial}} navigation system. The Typhoon can use <b>Instrument</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>System</b> (ILS) for landing in poor weather. The aircraft also features an enhanced {{ground proximity warning}} system (GPWS) based on the TERPROM Terrain Referenced Navigation (TRN) system used by the Panavia Tornado. The Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) provides a Link 16 data link.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} commission {{found no}} fault of the pilot or air traffic control, instead focusing on short-cuts being taken by the Swedish Air Force and the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) to not configure military airports in line with civilian regulations. The finding caused a surge of funding which subsequently caused military airports to change their <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> and approach lighting system to meet civilian requirements.|$|E
50|$|In October 2008, to {{coincide}} {{with the opening of the}} new Marshall Business Aviation Centre, the airport's name was changed from Cambridge City Airport to Marshall Airport Cambridge UK. The name was changed again to Cambridge Airport in 2011 as plans were announced for an expansion of the airport following the installation of <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems</b> and new hangars.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, a {{critical}} area {{refers to a}} designated area of an airport that all aircraft, vehicles, persons or physical obstructions must remain clear of when one or more <b>Instrument</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems</b> are in use, to protect against signal interference or attenuation {{that may lead to}} navigation errors, or accident. Critical areas also protect the ILS system's internal monitoring.|$|R
50|$|The {{next phase}} of {{development}} was the second runway, which was completed three months ahead of schedule and opened in April 1984. This runway, located 360 m north of the existing runway and parallel to it and is equipped with the latest meteorological, airfield lighting and <b>instrument</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems</b> to give the airport a Category II classification.|$|R
