5|$|Based on {{research}} on findings made there, the lake did support a substantial population that relied mostly on resources <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> including aquaculture and fishing. Estimated populations range from 20,000 to 100,000 people. When the lake dried up, the inhabitants switched to other economic activities. Agriculture {{did not play}} a major role in food supply.|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{has been}} a problem along the Scarborough Bluffs. Properties located near the brink have been abandoned, and houses condemned, as the brink wears back away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Since the 1980s, large areas of beach {{at the base of the}} Bluffs have been {{reinforced}} with limestone breakwaters and construction rubble infilling.|$|E

5000|$|Thumb Lake, {{also known}} as <b>Lake</b> Louise by <b>the</b> [...] "Lake Louise Camp" [...] community, is a kettle lake located in Hudson Township, Charlevoix County, Michigan. <b>The</b> epithet Thumb <b>Lake</b> derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake's</b> bathymetry.

5|$|Lake-effect snow is {{produced}} during cooler atmospheric conditions when a {{cold air mass}} moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> rises up through the colder air above, freezes and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.|$|E

5|$|Solar {{evaporation}} ponds at {{the edges}} of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant. US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two outlets}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> namely the Dalgate and Amir Khan Nallah {{that connects the}} lakes of Nagin and Anchar Lake.

5|$|A {{pattern of}} lake cycles {{becoming}} {{longer than the}} preceding one has been noted. Water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> {{may have contributed to}} increased oxygen-18 at Sajama around 14,300 years ago, possibly triggered by evaporation. As the lake level dropped, Lake Poopó would have been disconnected first; the sill separating it from the rest of Lake Tauca is relatively shallow. Coipasa and Uyuni would have remained connected until later. Water levels in Lake Titicaca's Lake Huinaimarca were low by 14,200 BP.|$|E

5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no motorized boats are permitted. Flying over the lakes is also discouraged except for scientific reasons. Vehicular traffic is {{banned in the}} reserved areas. Taking samples <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for sampling, {{and it must be}} thoroughly washed to avoid any type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|E

Routes22 and 9 join together, closely parallel to the Adirondack Northway (I-87), the only other route in the state to directly connect New York City with Canada. The three routes, spread over many miles {{in the southern part of}} the state, run through a narrow corridor for two miles (3km) until Routes9 and 22 veer east again toward Keeseville.|$|E

5|$|Ganoga Glen has ten named waterfalls in 1.1miles (1.8km). It is 1.8miles (2.9km) from PA 118 in {{the south}} to Waters Meet and the {{southern}} end of Ganoga Glen.
