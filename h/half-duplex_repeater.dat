40|$|A <b>half-duplex</b> <b>repeater</b> is the least-cost {{method for}} {{connecting}} multiple hosts to an IEEE 802. 3 Ethernet LAN. However, if we increase the data rate from 10 Mb/s Ethernet to 100 Mb/s Fast Ethernet, shared access via CSMA/CD becomes less e#cient {{because of the}} resulting increase in size of the collision fragments. For example, in a typical star-wired single-repeater network with a diameter of 200 meters, upgrading from 10 BASE-T to 100 BASE-T increases the round-trip delay (including bit budget for the network cards and repeater) from about 100 bit times to almost 500 bit times. Moreover, a further upgrade to 1000 Mb/s Gigabit Ethernet would increase the round-trip delay to about 4000 bit times [...] - which is eight {{times larger than the}} minimum frame size. In this paper, we introduce a simple change to the handling of incoming signals at the repeater ports known as collision truncation, and show that it reduces the average duration of a collision by more than 50 percent for networ [...] ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{misconception}} about Quindar tones is {{that they}} were designed to signal the end of a transmission, similar to a courtesy tone used on many <b>half-duplex</b> radio <b>repeaters.</b> Although the astronauts may have secondarily used the Quindar outro tone to know when the CAPCOM had started/stopped speaking, no equivalent existed for Mission Control because the astronauts keyed their transmissions locally (inside the spacecraft) using either a PTT or VOX, neither of which required Quindar tones. Additionally, separate radio frequencies allowed both Houston and the astronauts to talk simultaneously if they wished and thereby made a courtesy tone as a way to minimize the possibility of both of them speaking at the same time unnecessary.|$|R
25|$|New spotter {{technologies}} and training techniques have been developing since the 1960s. Prior to the 1960s, {{the vast majority}} of amateur radio communication relied on AM-modulated signals and the use of simplex. It was not uncommon for spotters to hear the distant net control station and not hear other mobile or base stations which were much closer. After 1960, amateurs adopted the use of FM repeaters which operated in the VHF spectrum. The use of FM repeaters was a huge advancement for storm spotters; spotters could now hear each other regularly. The low noise floor and greatly improved audio quality meant much better signal reception for all stations. By the 1970s, nearly all spotter radio activity consisted of <b>half-duplex</b> FM <b>repeater</b> use. The next major technology to aid spotters was the development of the cell phone in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was then possible for non-amateur radio operators to directly report severe weather.|$|R
