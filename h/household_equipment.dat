2500|$|In {{his later}} years, Gerard had come under {{suspicion}} for his religious beliefs. An anonymous letter of 1586 to Walsingham denounced him as [...] "a protestant at London and a papist in Lancashire... {{there is no}} man that so much shifteth papists from {{the danger of the}} law as he doth". His wife and two of his daughters, at least, were known Catholics. Many of his descendants, like Richard Gerard of Hilderstone who died in Newgate Prison in 1680, were staunchly Catholic. However, this seems not to be true of his heir, Thomas, who gave specific directions to be buried without ceremony - a provision typical of radical Protestants. In the preamble to his will, Gerard himself expressed his trust in Divine grace, as [...] "there is nothing in any of my works or deeds whereby I can or may challenge or attain unto everlasting life". These words closely echo the Protestant teaching embodied in Article 11 of the Thirty-Nine Articles: [...] "We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by faith, and not for our own works or deservings." [...] He left plate to his sons-in-law Sir Richard Molyneux, Peter Legh and Richard Hoghton, and to an unmarried daughter, presumably Radclyffe, who was also promised £1,000 towards her wedding. His wife received all her jewels and <b>household</b> <b>equipment,</b> as well as use of his Middlesex house.|$|E

The purposes of this research were to obtain information {{on the level of}} household activities of carbon footprint and to obtain information on the most influential factor of household activities in Denpasar City. The research method employed was the descriptive quantitative. The analysis of the first purpose was obtained by the multiplication of emission factor and the use of LPG and electrical capacity. The analysis of the second purpose was obtained by implementing the analysis of doubled linier regression supported by employing SPSS version 16. 00 program for Windows. The research result showed that the average of the total carbon footprint was as big as 138, 037. 02 g of carbon/month. Based on that average, the total of carbon footprint in Denpasar city with as many as 15, 908 households was 2, 195. 89 ton CO 2 e/month. The statistic analysis test showed the factors that influenced the carbon footprint were the amount of household members, the amount of <b>household</b> <b>equipments</b> which needed LPG to operate, the amount of <b>household</b> <b>equipments</b> which needed electricity to operate and the duration of using electric equipments whose R 2 power was as big as 90 %. The duration of using electric equipments had the highest correlation with the value of 62. 70 %. It is suggested that households should use energy saving equipments such as LED products; the government should consistently promote carbon saving movements; and to future research to calculate carbon footprint by using DNPI carbon calculator, or by using software LEAP. </p...|$|R
