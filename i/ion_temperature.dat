5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the <b>ion</b> <b>temperature</b> may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E

Using a one meter VUV {{spectrometer}} and a MCP {{coupled to}} a CCD detector on TCABR tokamak, <b>ion</b> <b>temperatures</b> from impurity {{species have been}} measured and much better spectral resolution was obtained using higher order diffraction lines. Due to very small Doppler effect in the VUV region compared to large instrumental broadening, <b>ion</b> <b>temperatures</b> obtained from first order diffraction present large errors.

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{we use a}} deep-exposure {{spectrum}} taken by the SUMER spectrometer in a polar coronal hole in 1996 to measure the <b>ion</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{of a large number}} of ions at many different heights above the limb between 0. 03 and 0. 17 solar radii. We find that the measured <b>ion</b> <b>temperatures</b> are almost always larger than the electron temperatures and exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the charge-to-mass ratio. We use these measurements to provide empirical constraints to a theoretical model of ion heating and acceleration based on gradually replenished ion-cyclotron waves. We compare the wave power required to heat the ions to the observed levels to a prediction based on a model of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We find that the empirical heating model and the turbulent cascade model agree with one another, and explain the measured <b>ion</b> <b>temperatures,</b> for charge-to-mass ratios smaller than about 0. 25. However, ions with charge-to-mass ratios exceeding 0. 25 disagree with the model; the wave power they require to be heated to the measured <b>ion</b> <b>temperatures</b> shows an increase with charge-to-mass ratio (i. e., with increasing frequency) that cannot be explained by a traditional cascade model.
