40|$|Application of the {{conventional}} X. 500 approach to naming has heretofore, {{in the experience of}} the authors, proven to be an obstacle to the wide deployment of directory-enabled applications on the Internet. We propose a new directory naming plan that leverages the strengths of the most popular and successful Internet naming schemes for naming objects in a hierarchical directory. This plan can, we believe, by extending the X. 500 approach to naming, facilitate the creation of an <b>Internet</b> <b>White</b> <b>Pages</b> Service (IWPS) and other directory-enabled applications by overcoming the problems encountered by those using {{the conventional}} X. 500 approach...|$|E

This work {{is the result of}} the IETF Integrated Directory Services (IDS) Working Group. The IDS Working Group proposes a standard specification for a simple <b>Internet</b> <b>White</b> <b>Pages</b> service by defining a common schema for use by the various White Pages servers. This schema is independent of specific implementations of the White Pages service. This document specifies the minimum set of core attributes of a White Pages entry for an individual and describes how new objects with those attributes can be defined and published. It does not describ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The <b>Internet</b> <b>White</b> <b>Pages</b> Service {{has been}} slow to {{materialise}} for many reasons. One of them is the security concerns that organisations have, over allowing the public to gain access to either their Intranet or their directory database. The Guardian DSA is a firewall application proxy for X. 500 and LDAP protocols that is designed to alleviate these fears. Sitting in the firewall system, it filters directory protocol messages passing {{into and out of the}} Intranet, allowing security administrators to carefully control the amount of directory information that is released to the outside world. This paper describes the design of our Guardian system, and shows how relatively easy it is to configure its filtering capabilities. Finally the paper describes the working demonstration of the Guardian that was built for the 1997 World Electronic Messaging Association directory challenge. This linked the WEMA directory to the NameFLOW-Paradise Internet directory, and demonstrated some of the powerful filtering capabilities of the Guardian...|$|E

50|$|A <b>white</b> <b>pages</b> schema is a data model, {{specifically}} {{a logical}} schema, for organizing the data contained in entries in a directory service, database, or application, {{such as an}} address book. In a <b>white</b> <b>pages</b> directory, each entry typically represents an individual person that makes use of network resources, such as by receiving email or having an account to log into a system.In some environments, the schema may also include the representation of organizational divisions, roles, groups, and devices. The term {{is derived from the}} <b>white</b> <b>pages,</b> the listing of individuals in a telephone directory, typically sorted by the individual's home location (e.g. city) and then bytheir name.|$|R

The current study aims to investigate the demographic differences between households which have their telephone numbers listed or not listed in the Australian <b>White</b> <b>Pages</b> telephone directory. A total of 5, 023 eligible Australian residents who were currently in paid employment participated in this study. Each respondent’s telephone number was individually matched to the residential <b>White</b> <b>Pages</b> to determine its listed status, and demographic variables were compared between those with a listed and unlisted telephone number. Those with an unlisted number {{were significantly more likely to}} be younger, to have been born in a country outside of Australia, and to live in a lower socioeconomic area than those who were listed in the <b>White</b> <b>Pages.</b> These demographic differences should be considered when undertaking telephone surveys using a <b>White</b> <b>Pages</b> sample...|$|R

This evolved into the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol standard schema in [...] One of the most widely deployed <b>white</b> <b>pages</b> schemas used in LDAPfor representing individuals in an organizational context is inetOrgPerson, defined in , although versions of Active Directory require a different object class, User. Many large organizations havealso defined their own <b>white</b> <b>pages</b> schemas for their employees or customers, as part of their Identity management architecture. Converting between data bases and directories using different schemas is often thefunction of a Metadirectory, and data interchange standards such as Common Indexing Protocol.|$|R
