40|$|Using benthic macroinvertebrates {{to measure}} stream health {{has been widely}} used and {{accepted}} around the world. Macroinvertebrates are resident monitors of chronic impairment in a stream since they are relatively sessile and most commonly respond to disturbance by drift but can recolonize a restored stream reach very quickly. This study tested the effectiveness of macroinvertebrate metrics developed through the Rapid Bioassessment Protocol (RBP) to detect changes in stream integrity {{as the result of}} placement of a best management practice (BMP), installed on a tributary of Roaring Branch, located in Columbus, Georgia. The BMP was designed to attenuate flow to reduce sediment suspension and downstream deposition. A sampling protocol derived from the Georgia <b>Ecoregions</b> <b>Project</b> was implemented to evaluate the macroinvertebrate community, located downstream of the BMP, and downstream of the confluence with Roaring Branch, {{both before and after the}} BMP installation. The resulting metrics were compared to a reference condition described for subecoregion 65 c, sandhills-lower piedmont. A dramatic improvement or increase of macroinvertebrate populations suggests an improvement in water quality (via reduction in fine sediment deposition) due to improved physical habitat conditions for indicators (Trichoptera) of healthier streams. The results of this study suggests further restoration activities should continue and that re-evaluation of the sampling protocol should take into account a larger subsample size of benthic macroinvertebrates than currently recommended by the RBP...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} Measurements Quality Objectives (MQOs), in bioassessment {{programs}} {{is a useful}} tool in evaluating the consistency of data and limiting variability and potential sources of measurement error. Typical evaluations of data repeatability and/or data quality center {{on the use of}} a series of calculations that quantify variability between measures. These calculations provided some indication of not only the quality of the data collected, but also acted as a measure of how representative the biological data were to each ecoregion. The evaluation of the Quality Control data for this project provides a framework for data users and water resource managers to assess the reliability and inherent variability of the proposed biotic indices for the state of Georgia. In bioassessment programs, it is important to identify natural variability of reference and impaired sites, as well as the variability of the influences anthropogenic stressors. Calculations of variance within the biological parameters measured are necessary for identifying the effects of measurement errors and/or inherent differences between sampling sites in relation to the overall variance of a metric or index on an ecoregional and sub-ecoregional level. Considering the invertebrate data produced by the Georgia <b>Ecoregions</b> <b>Project,</b> the consistency of all metric categories having average precision measures above the prescribed MQOs for both raw metric values and standardized metric scores may demonstrate that the lotic systems across the state of Georgia naturally have high variability from year-to-year and spatially within catchments. This in turn may indicate that the established precision thresholds of the MQOs may not be indicative of the data quality for this specific project...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Establishment of {{reference}} sites for biomonitoring water quality assessment network {{is an essential}} component of a national biomonitoring programme. The use of biomonitoring has increased tremendously {{over the last few years}} with the realization by water quality managers that water is only but a component of a complex ecosystem made up of both biotic and abiotic factors. This paper gives an account of activities that were carried out during the establishment {{of reference}} sites for biomonitoring water quality assessment network in Zimbabwe. The initial stage was actually coming up with the relevant bio-geographical regions but as a result of insufficient biological data, ecoregions based on the climate, hydrology, geology and land use were used. The next stage was to identify least impacted sites using the catchment boundaries within the ecoregions as sub-regions, termed ecoregion level. After identifying the sites samples were collected in two sample runs. The samples were then identified to family level and thus reference samples were housed at the Laboratory whilst the identical set was sent to the Bulawayo museum for validation. The data collected underwent Multivariate analysis using Minitab software. About thirty three reference sites were established in the study area, Manyame Catchment within the Central <b>Ecoregion</b> [...] <b>PROJECT</b> BACKGROUND The history of surface water assessment based on biological indicators of pollution started more than a century ago with Kalenati (1848) and Cohn (1853). These workers observed that organisms that occur in polluted water were different from organisms that occur in clean water. Since then the use of indices in ecology has exploded, particularly over the last 20 years and a plethora of different approaches has been developed (Metcalfe, 1989...|$|R

The work at UCSB is supported by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the Southern California Edison Company (SCE), and the IBM Environmental Research Program and is part of a national program of state and regional gap analyses being coordinated by the USFWS. The term "Gap Analysis" refers to the evaluation of the protection status of plant communities, animal species and vertebrate species richness by GIS overlay of biological distribution data on a map of existing biological reserves. We are conducting a Gap Analysis of California in collaboration with a number of public and private groups. This entails preparing a statewide map of actual vegetation, supplemented with more detailed locality data for plant taxa of special concern. By compiling a statewide, albeit low resolution digital database, GIS capabilities can be used to identify and map landscapes in California that contain large numbers of potentially unprotected vegetation types and vertebrate species of interest. Such areas can then be studied in more detail as candidates for additional preservation and protection efforts to fill existing "gaps" in the protection network. This approach allows conservationists to be proactive rather than reac [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Increased land-use {{intensity}} (e. g. clearing {{of forests}} for cultivation, urbanization), {{often results in}} the loss of ecosystem carbon storage, while changes in productivity resulting from climate change may either help offset or exacerbate losses. However, there are large uncertainties in how land and climate systems will evolve and interact to shape future ecosystem carbon dynamics. To address this we developed the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS) to track changes in land use, land cover, land management, and disturbance, and their impact on ecosystem carbon storage and flux within a scenario-based framework. We have combined a state-and-transition simulation model (STSM) of land change with a stock and flow model of carbon dynamics. Land-change projections downscaled from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) were used to drive changes within the STSM, while the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) ecosystem model was used to derive input parameters for the carbon stock and flow model. The model was applied to the Sierra Nevada Mountains ecoregion in California, USA, a region prone to large wildfires and a forestry sector projected to intensify over the next century. Three scenario simulations were conducted, including a calibration scenario, a climate-change scenario, and an integrated climate- and land-change scenario. Based on results from the calibration scenario, the LUCAS age-structured carbon accounting model was able to accurately reproduce results obtained from the process-based biogeochemical model. Under the climate-only scenario, the <b>ecoregion</b> was <b>projected</b> to be a reliable net sink of carbon, however, when land use and disturbance were introduced, the ecoregion switched to become a net source. This research demonstrates how an integrated approach to carbon accounting can be used to evaluate various drivers of ecosystem carbon change in a robust, yet transparent modeling environment...|$|R

40|$|Anthropogenic {{land use}} will likely present a greater {{challenge}} to biodiversity than climate change this {{century in the}} Pacific Northwest, USA. Even if species are equipped with the adaptive capacity to migrate {{in the face of}} a changing climate, they will likely encounter a human-dominated landscape as a major dispersal obstacle. Our goal was to identify, at the ecoregion-level, protected areas in close proximity to lands with a higher likelihood of future land-use conversion. Using a state-and-transition simulation model, we modeled spatially explicit (1 km 2) land use from 2000 to 2100 under seven alternative land-use and emission scenarios for ecoregions in the Pacific Northwest. We analyzed scenario-based land-use conversion threats from logging, agriculture, and development near existing protected areas. A conversion threat index (CTI) was created to identify <b>ecoregions</b> with highest <b>projected</b> land-use conversion potential within closest proximity to existing protected areas. Our analysis indicated nearly 22 % of land area in the Coast Range, over 16 % of land area in the Puget Lowland, and nearly 11 % of the Cascades had very high CTI values. Broader regional-scale land-use change is projected to impact nearly 40 % of the Coast Range, 30 % of the Puget Lowland, and 24 % of the Cascades (i. e., two highest CTI classes). A landscape level, scenario-based approach to modeling future land use helps identify ecoregions with existing protected areas at greater risk from regional land-use threats and can help prioritize future conservation efforts...|$|R
40|$|Focusing on {{coral reef}} policy, this thesis {{challenges}} orthodox understanding of international environmental policy, studying environmental crises as political assemblies, and policy endeavours as power-filled networks. This requires first rendering the subject accessible for critical research by constructing a 'multiperspectival' {{base from which}} to view it, thus elucidating how a Foucauldian discourse of modernisation hides the politics of orthodox understandings of international environmental policy. The thesis then investigates the efforts of a suite of science/policy/conservation agencies to save coral reefs from a perceived global crisis. It analyses how coral reef policy arises {{as an instrument of}} international governance, articulating with the Fiji Islands, a South Pacific archipelago. This reveals how global truths are created and translated into policies and action plans, enrolling places and people into a global network largely outside the formal interstate treaty system. Understanding these networks and the various modes of power operating within them-from seduction to coercion and hegemony-necessitates understanding how actors in both developed and developing counties exhibit similar agency, co-opting discourses to suit their interests. The final section argues that this political assembly around ecological crisis represents a deepening integration of humankind in which ecology has become a model for the practice of development under the control of ecological technocrats. The West continues to dominate the Third World, however. Both environmental policy discourse and the universals through which policy travels the globe-the moral imperative to look after the planet plus science-based universals positioning coral reefs as a problem of common concern to humanity-contribute to this relationship of domination. Indeed, hegemony is predicated upon the universal of international cooperation as much as those of science and neoliberalism. Technical practices and expert technologies accepted as commonsense help sustain an asymmetrical relationship; practices used in creating global reports of coral health, capacity-building <b>projects,</b> <b>ecoregion</b> planning technologies and the rhetorical style used in scientific papers all contribute...|$|R
40|$|The Georgia <b>Ecoregions</b> Reference Sites <b>Project</b> has {{developed}} biological criteria for streams in Georgia {{according to the}} Rapid Bioassessment Protocols For Wadeable Streams and Rivers. Streams will ultimately be classified into categories of impairment so that management decisions {{can be made in}} accordance with the Clean Water Act. A cost-effective approach to accomplish mandates set forth by the Clean Water Act must be employed, as state budgets are limited. One means of examining costs is to assess taxonomic resolution. Taxonomic resolution not only assesses the sensitivity of biocriteria, it also allows one to make recommendations to state agencies regarding {{the costs and benefits of}} recommended taxonomic identification requirements. Due to the broad diversity in geology, topography, climate, soils and geography within Georgia, taxonomic resolution requirements may vary. Thirty macroinvertebrate samples from five reference condition streams and five or six impaired streams from three Georgia sub-ecoregions were identified to 2 ̆ 2 lowest possible 2 ̆ 2 or lowest practical level. Lowest practical level includes many taxonomic levels determined by the group identified and the availability of peer-reviewed keys. Specific data from lowest practical level were reduced to generic level then further reduced to familial level so that three identification levels, incorporated into sub-ecoregional specific invertebrate indices, were assessed for discriminatory ability. Time spent on identification was recorded at each taxonomic level so that identification 2 ̆ 2 costs 2 ̆ 2 versus 2 ̆ 2 benefits 2 ̆ 2 or degree of information could be used in conjunction with the indices in determining recommended taxonomic resolution requirements. Final analysis indicated taxonomic resolution requirements vary among subecoregions within Georgia and future benthic work, at least in some subecoregions, will require less time and money. By performing cost/benefit analyses, agencies involved in bioassessment and biomontioring programs can identify regions that may require less taxonomic effort...|$|R
