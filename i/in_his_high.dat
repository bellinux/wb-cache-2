25|$|Cankar {{was raised}} as a Roman Catholic. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>high</b> school years, {{he became a}} typical liberal freethinker.

His later life was marked by a gradual evolution towards orthodox Christianity, which became evident after 1910 and especially in the last year of his life. Although he never officially rejected his Roman Catholic faith, he was generally considered an agnostic, albeit sympathetic to some elements of traditional Catholic devotion.|$|E
