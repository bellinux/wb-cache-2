5|$|Here {{came the}} Rabbi, his back bent, his face shaved... His mere {{presence}} among the deportees added {{a touch of}} unreality to the scene. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> page torn from some story book... One by one they passed in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I once could have laughed at, all those I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E
5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E

25|$|As {{soon as the}} Artful Dodger came onstage, Gavroche came to mind. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> blow to {{the solar}} plexus. I started seeing all the {{characters}} of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables—Valjean, Javert, Gavroche, Cosette, Marius, and Éponine—in my mind's eye, laughing, crying, and singing onstage.|$|E
25|$|Mendis had {{a severe}} back injury in {{second half of}} 2014. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> disc {{fracture}} in the back. He {{has not been able}} to bowl at all during this period. Now slowly with rest and rehab, he has started to do a bit of running and bowling.|$|E
25|$|Younis {{said he did}} {{not want}} to blame {{individuals}} but largely singled out players, particularly Afridi. He said Akmal should not have been selected, instead it should be players who are 'proud' to represent their country. He also said that the team lost the Asia cup in February 2016 because they were 'unfit' as they had not trained during PSL season and said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 'holiday for them'. Overall, he blamed it on poor captaincy from Afridi. He said it was unfair for him to first use Mohammad Nawaz, a new player, as a bowler in the Asia Cup 2016 because it 'destroyed' his confidence when he was unable to handle it after being hit for 38 runs in 3 overs. Younis later posted on his Twitter – 'no one wants to hear the truth'.|$|E
50|$|The {{significance}} test requires only one hypothesis. The {{result of the}} test is to reject the hypothesis (or not), a simple dichotomy. The test distinguish between truth of the hypothesis and insufficiency of evidence to disprove the hypothesis; so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> criminal trial in which the defendant's guilt is assessed in (so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> criminal trial in which the defendant is assumed innocent until proven guilty).|$|R

25|$|As Cold War {{tensions}} rose {{still further}} during the 1950s, restrictions {{were placed on}} travel between the Soviet sector (East Berlin) and the western sectors (West Berlin). For {{the second time in}} its history, the Potsdam Gate (or what remained of <b>it),</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dividing line between two different worlds. Lying on this invisible frontier, Potsdamer Platz was no longer an important destination for Berliners. Similarly, neither East Berlin nor West Berlin regarded their half as a priority area for redevelopment, seeking instead to distance themselves from the traditional heart of the city and develop two new centres for themselves, well away from the troubled border zone. West Berlin inevitably chose the Kurfürstendamm and the area around the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, while East Berlin built up Alexanderplatz and turned Frankfurter Allee (which they renamed Stalinallee in 1949, Karl-Marx-Allee in 1961), into their own showpiece boulevard. Potsdamer Platz, meanwhile, was more or less left to rot, as one by one the ruined buildings were cleared away, neither side having the will to repair or replace them. On the western side things did improve later on with the development of the Cultural Forum, whose site roughly equates with the former Millionaires' Quarter.|$|E

500|$|Wolfgang Falck {{felt that}} Sayn-Wittgenstein was not officer-material. Falck {{described}} him as: [...] "...not {{the type to}} be a leader of a unit. He was not a teacher, educator or instructor. But he was an outstanding personality, magnificent fighter and great operational pilot. He had an astonishing sixth sense—an intuition that permitted him to see and even feel where other aircraft were. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> personal radar system. He was an excellent air-to-air shot." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of his death in 1966, Walter Henning, an {{assistant}} chief inspector and a colleague of Broderick's, called him a [...] "man of his time," [...] and said that [...] "under restrictions today, he'd have a difficult time doing the things he did." [...] But during Prohibition, he said, [...] "when these people [...] went in and out of court <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> revolving door, they had rather be locked up than to meet Johnny." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{eruption}} {{was heard}} {{hundreds of miles}} away, but {{some of those who}} survived the eruption declared that the landslide and pyroclastic flows were silent as they raced down the mountain. Krau Kilpatrick, an employee of the United States Forest Service, recalled, [...] "There was no sound to it, not a sound. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> silent movie and we were all in it." [...] The reason for this discrepancy is a [...] "quiet zone", created {{as a result of the}} motion and temperature of air and, to a lesser extent, upon local topography.|$|E
500|$|... "Clocks" [...] {{was written}} and {{composed}} {{during the late}} stages of production of Coldplay's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head. A riff popped into Chris Martin's mind late one night in Liverpool {{when he came into}} the studio, where he then developed it on piano. According to Martin, [...] "Clocks" [...] was inspired by the English rock band Muse. Martin presented the riff to the band's guitarist, Jonny Buckland, who then added a layer of guitar chords to the basic track: [...] "He picked up his guitar [...] and played these brilliant chords... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> chemical reaction process." ...|$|E

500|$|An {{offensive}} minded player {{throughout his}} amateur and minor professional career, St. Louis {{was forced into}} a checking-line role by the Calgary Flames.

For me, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> five-month crash course on developing my defensive game.

Despite the complexity of their music, the band were well received on the tour, with Hammill noting [...] "at nearly all the gigs, most of the audience have known most of the songs... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> big family actually, exactly as all of us had pictured it in our wildest dreams." ...|$|E
500|$|The World's Fair airship exhibit {{was located}} south of Physical Culture hall {{and west of}} the Hall of Congress.
