The most interesting issue concerning small diameter <b>cogged</b> <b>wheels</b> occurs during their production. The characteristic {{parameters of the}} wheel depend strongly on the manufacturing process and while inspecting small diameter wheels the shrinkage during the cast varies with the slight change of fabrication process. In the paper the LCI interferometric Twyman- Green setup with pigtailed high power light emitting diode, for <b>cogged</b> <b>wheels</b> measurement, is described. Due to its relatively big field of view the whole wheel can be examined in one measurement, without the necessity of numerical stitching. For purposes of small <b>cogged</b> <b>wheel’s</b> characteristic parameters measurement the special binarization algorithm was developed and successfully applied. At the end the results of measurement of heads and foot diameters of two <b>cogged</b> <b>wheels</b> obtained by proposed LCI setup are presented and compared with the results obtained by the commercial optical profiler. The results of examination of injection moulds used for fabrication of measured <b>cogged</b> <b>wheels</b> are also presented. Additionally, the value of <b>cogged</b> <b>wheels</b> shrinkage is calculated as a conclusion for obtained results. Proposed method is suitable for complex measurements of small diameter <b>cogged</b> <b>wheels</b> with low module especially {{when there are no}} measurements standards for such objects...|$|R

5000|$|Salamanca {{was also}} the first rack and pinion locomotive, using John Blenkinsop's {{patented}} design for rack propulsion. A single rack ran outside the narrow gauge tracks and was engaged by a large <b>cog</b> <b>wheel</b> {{on the left side of}} the locomotive. The <b>cog</b> <b>wheel</b> was driven by twin cylinders embedded into the top of the centre-flue boiler. The class was described as having two 8"×20" [...] cylinders, driving the wheels through cranks. The piston crossheads slid in guides, rather than being controlled by a parallel motion linkage like the majority of early locomotives. The engines saw up to twenty years of service.|$|R

50|$|The wood is {{generally}} hard, tough and heavy, hornbeams particularly so; several species were of significant {{importance in the}} past where very hard wood capable of withstanding heavy wear was required, such as for cartwheels, water <b>wheels,</b> <b>cog</b> <b>wheels,</b> tool handles, chopping boards, and wooden pegs.
