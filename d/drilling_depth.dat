40|$|Abstract—The {{dynamic model}} of a drill in {{drilling}} process was proposed and investigated in this study. To assure a good drilling quality, the vibration variation on the drill tips during high speed drilling is needed to be investigated. A pre-twisted beam is used to simulate the drill. The moving Winkler-Type elastic foundation is used to characterize the tip boundary variation in drilling. Due to the variation of the <b>drill</b> <b>depth,</b> a time dependent dynamic model for the drill is proposed. Results simulated from this proposed model indicate that an abrupt natural frequencies drop are experienced as the drill tip tough the workpiece, and a severe vibration is induced. The effects of parameters, e. g. <b>drilling</b> speed, <b>depth,</b> <b>drill</b> size and thrust force on the drill tip responses studied. Keywords—Drilling, vibration of drill, twisted beam.

30|$|Owing to {{the large}} volume of the logging data {{generated}} by each logging tool, they were resampled from 1 to 5  cm sample intensity by averaging every five data values. The data generated were collated and processed using Viewlog software (Kettelar 2005) and displayed in a standard composite log format. The composite logs were further corrected, replotted, filtered, and smoothened where necessary. As a means of depth control, depth correction was made by comparing and shifting to align gamma logs from two or more logging tools containing gamma ray detectors. The analyses and interpretation of the logging data in terms of <b>drilled</b> <b>depths,</b> construction details and profiles of soils/rocks penetrated were compared with records obtained from the supervising geologist/driller to check for similarities and discrepancies.

40|$|Planimetric control {{positioning}} {{and detail}} pickups using the Real Time Kinematics (RTK) Global positioning System (GPS) {{is emerging as}} one of the fastest, reliable and more accurate method of surveying in surface mining. This paper seeks to highlight how the RTK GPS from Trimble is being employed at Gold Fields Ghana Limited, Tarkwa Mine to provide accurate <b>drill</b> <b>depth</b> and <b>drill</b> pattern design. The usage, problems, processing and efficiency of this system in a mining environment is also explored. It also looks at the level of accuracies provided by this system. Before the introduction of RTK GPS into the blasting process, the current blast fragmentation was resulting in sub-optimal feed size to crushers on the Mine and an unfriendly floor conditions resulting in excessive sheeting of digging floor to prevent tyre damage. It was decided to use RTK GPS to improve the fragmentation through accurate <b>drill</b> <b>depth</b> and design pattern in order to achieve a constant throughput to the north heap leach crusher of 1500 t/hr, a 5 % increase in pit loading efficiency and a 50 % decrease in rock breaker hours, equipment damage costs and in-pit sheeting costs respectively. This paper is intended to take the reader through the application of RTK GPS in accurate <b>drill</b> <b>depth</b> and <b>drill</b> pattern which have resulted in a 10 % reduction in loading times, of which half has been attributed to improved fragmentation, as well as a substantial increase in blasted stocks whiles rock breaker hours have also decreased resulting in substantial financial gains to the company.
