He joined Tencor Instruments in Mountain View, California in 1992 when he proposed and helped develop a platform for a high-speed, laser-based, wafer inspection system, which, then for the first time, addressed the inspection needs for 0.25 micrometre semiconductor device fabrication technology during high volume production. That platform was subsequently named Advanced Inspection Technology (AIT) and during its peak times generated over $1 billion in revenue.
