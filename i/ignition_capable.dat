40|$|The central {{objective}} of the proposed work is to demonstrate an HCCI (homogeneous charge compression <b>ignition)</b> <b>capable</b> SI (spark ignited) engine {{that is capable of}} fast and smooth mode transition between SI and HCCI combustion modes. The model-based control technique was used to develop and validate the proposed control strategy for the fast and smooth combustion mode transition based upon the developed control-oriented engine; and an HCCI capable SI engine was designed and constructed using production ready two-step valve-train with electrical variable valve timing actuating system. Finally, smooth combustion mode transition was demonstrated on a metal engine within eight engine cycles. The Chrysler turbocharged 2. 0 L I 4 direct injection engine was selected as the base engine for the project and the engine was modified to fit the two-step valve with electrical variable valve timing actuating system. To develop the model-based control strategy for stable HCCI combustion and smooth combustion mode transition between SI and HCCI combustion, a control-oriented real-time engine model was developed and implemented into the MSU HIL (hardware-in-the-loop) simulation environment. The developed model was used to study the engine actuating system requirement for the smooth and fast combustion mode transition and to develop the proposed mode transition control strategy. Finally, a single cylinder optical engine was designed and fabricated for studying the HCCI combustion characteristics. Optical engine combustion tests were conducted in both SI and HCCI combustion modes and the test results were used to calibrate the developed control-oriented engine model. Intensive GT-Power simulations were conducted to determine the optimal valve lift (high and low) and the cam phasing range. Delphi was selected to be the supplier for the two-step valve-train and Denso to be the electrical variable valve timing system supplier. A test bench was constructed to develop control strategies for the electrical variable valve timing (VVT) actuating system and satisfactory electrical VVT responses were obtained. Target engine control system was designed and fabricated at MSU for both single-cylinder optical and multi-cylinder metal engines. Finally, the developed control-oriented engine model was successfully implemented into the HIL simulation environment. The Chrysler 2. 0 L I 4 DI engine was modified to fit the two-step vale with electrical variable valve timing actuating system. A used prototype engine was used as the base engine and the cylinder head was modified for the two-step valve with electrical VVT actuating system. Engine validation tests indicated that cylinder # 3 has very high blow-by and it cannot be reduced with new pistons and rings. Due to the time constraint, it was decided to convert the four-cylinder engine into a single cylinder engine by blocking both intake and exhaust ports of the unused cylinders. The model-based combustion mode transition control algorithm was developed in the MSU HIL simulation environment and the Simulink based control strategy was implemented into the target engine controller. With both single-cylinder metal engine and control strategy ready, stable HCCI combustion was achived with COV of 2. 1 % Motoring tests were conducted to validate the actuator transient operations including valve lift, electrical variable valve timing, electronic throttle, multiple spark and injection controls. After the actuator operations were confirmed, 15 -cycle smooth combustion mode transition from SI to HCCI combustion was achieved; and fast 8 -cycle smooth combustion mode transition followed. With a fast electrical variable valve timing actuator, the number of engine cycles required for mode transition can be reduced down to five. It was also found that the combustion mode transition is sensitive to the charge air and engine coolant temperatures and regulating the corresponding temperatures to the target levels during the combustion mode transition is the key for a smooth combustion mode transition. As a summary, the proposed combustion mode transition strategy using the hybrid combustion mode that starts with the SI combustion and ends with the HCCI combustion was experimentally validated on a metal engine. The proposed model-based control approach made it possible to complete the SI-HCCI combustion mode transition within eight engine cycles utilizing the well controlled hybrid combustion mode. Without intensive control-oriented engine modeling and HIL simulation study of using the hybrid combustion mode during the mode transition, {{it would be impossible to}} validate the proposed combustion mode transition strategy in a very short period...|$|E
50|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{detectors}} work by {{detecting the}} UV radiation emitted at the instant of <b>ignition.</b> While <b>capable</b> of detecting fires and explosions within 3-4 milliseconds, a time delay of 2-3 seconds is often included to minimize false alarms {{which can be}} triggered by other UV sources such as lightning, arc welding, radiation, and sunlight. UV detectors typically operate with wavelengths shorter than 300 nm to minimize the effects of natural background radiation. The solar blind UV wavelength band is also easily blinded by oily contaminants.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that {{unconfined}} dust explosions typically start off with a relatively weak primary flame followed by a severe secondary explosion. We show that clustering of dust particles in a temperature stratified turbulent flow ahead of the primary flame may {{give rise to a}} significant increase in the radiation penetration length. These particle clusters, even far ahead of the flame, are sufficiently exposed and heated by the radiation from the flame to become <b>ignition</b> kernels <b>capable</b> to ignite a large volume of fuel-air mixtures. This efficiently increases the total flame surface area and the effective combustion speed, defined as the rate of reactant consumption of a given volume. We show that this mechanism explains the high rate of combustion and overpressures required to account for the observed level of damage in unconfined dust explosions, e. g., at the 2005 Buncefield vapor-cloud explosion. The effect of the strong increase of radiation transparency due to turbulent clustering of particles goes beyond the state of the art of the application to dust explosions and has many implications in atmospheric physics and astrophysics. © 2017 American Physical Societ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{application}} of lean homogeneous combustion in SI engines using a passive SCR after treatment system. By implementing this concept a decrease in fuel consumption and engine out NOx is expected. The data and results are obtained through engine experiments. Under lean conditions the ignition system faces harder conditions, in order to reliably ignite a lean fuel/air mixture an advanced ignition system is necessary. A literature study revealed that among, standard ignition, dual coil ignition, laser ignition, corona ignition and pre-chamber ignition the pre-chamber <b>ignition</b> system was <b>capable</b> of igniting the highest diluted mixture. The corona system however was second best and {{does not require a}} modification to the engine. The dual coil ignition system was installed on a multi-cylinder engine. This system uses a standard spark plug but by firing two coils in consecutive order a long duration spark is created. By applying this system and optimizing the timing of the existing adjustable cam shafts for lean conditions, substantial decreases in fuel consumption and NOx were achieved. Another part of this thesis {{is about the}} after treatment system. An ammonia formation catalyst produces ammonia under rich engine conditions and stores it. The ammonia in its turn reacts with NOx when the engine operates lean. The ammonia formation catalyst was tested under lab-scale and real engine conditions. It was shown that taken the differences in set-up into account the lab-scale tested catalysts showed good similarities with the engine-scale tests...|$|R
40|$|A {{ram-jet engine}} with an {{experimental}} 48 -inch-diameter combustor {{was investigated in}} a free-jet facility. The combustor design comprised a large-volume annular pilot region {{and an array of}} sloping baffle- or gutter-type flameholders. The combustor was intended to operate at a fuel-air ratio of about 0. 037. To promote combustion efficiency at such low fuel-air ratios, a divided-flow system was employed which bypassed a portion of the engine air around the combustion region. Three combustor lengths, three lengths of the shroud which separated the bypass air from the burning stream, and four fuel-distribution systems were investigated over a range of fuel-air ratios from 0. 025 to 0. 055 and a range of engine air flows from 40 to 110 pounds per second (combustor-outlet total pressures from 500 t o 1800 lb/sq ft abs). The highest efficiencies were obtained with a combustor length of 78 inches and a shroud length of 6 inches. At the lowest air flow, with combustor pressures of about 700 pounds per square foot absolute, a maximum efficiency of about 93 percent was obtained. The efficiency increased with combustor length, a typical increase being from 88 to 95 percent as the length increased from 60 to 96 inches. The length of the shroud separating the bypass air from the burning stream affected not only the efficiency level, but also the fuel-air ratio at which the maximum efficiency occurred. In general, a longer shroud caused the maximum efficiency to occur at lower f'uel-air ratios. Highest efficiencies usually resulted from the use of a fuel-injection system giving a uniform fuel profile. The efficiency at low fuel-air ratios could be considerably improved by the use of a radially nonuniform fuel profile which concentrated the fuel towards the outermost portion of the burning stream The total-pressure ratio across the combustor was about 0. 86 at the design point. An electrical-spark <b>ignition</b> system proved <b>capable</b> of starting the engine at all conditions investigated and ignition was found not t o depend on the use of pilot fuel...|$|R
40|$|The Constant Volume Combustion Chamber (CVCC) at the Combustion Laboratory at the Institute of Marine Technology has shown: (I) Temperature {{related issues}} that reduce {{reproducibility}} within test series. (II) The environment the vessel can simulate is not satisfactory {{in terms of}} density. Previous results and observation {{with the use of}} a high-speed camera indicates that the CVCC has an inhomogeneous temperature field. This is due to unsymmetrical heat loss to the wall after pre-combustion, which is used to chemically heat the CVCC to reach the engine-like conditions. The CVCC can run up to a maximum of 100 [bar], which directly affects how much of the gas used for pre-combustion can be injected. The amount of the gas mixture that the old <b>ignition</b> system was <b>capable</b> of igniting cannot be increased substantially without reaching the pressure limit. These issues were investigated in this present work by installing two types of ignition systems that both aimed to initiate a more symmetrical pre-combustion and to ignite leaner gas mixtures for the pre-combustion. The conventional inductive ignition system from Motortech has a dual spark configuration and an alternative ignition system using Corona Discharge made by Øystein Smith and fellow students at the Omega Workshop at the Norwegian University of Technology and Science (NTNU). The experiment we conducted on the conventional ignition system indicated a higher maximum pressure level and a faster pre-combustion with a dual spark plug configuration compared to a single spark plug configuration, which could reduce the temperature gradient, but further experimentation is necessary to conclude on this issue. The system indicated an improved capability to ignite lean mixtures, during experiments where the volume fraction of Carbon Monoxide (CO) was reduced when the GMB was further pressurized with Nitrogen gas (N 2). The corona discharge ignition system has promising properties as a symmetrical ignition source to address both issues presented. The challenge is to introduce the voltage into the CVCC without reaching the dielectric strength of the insulating material surrounding the conducting electrode. This would generate an arc between the electrode and the grounded CVCC. The initial experiments we conducted resulted in spark discharge and not corona discharge with all developed electrodes. Further development on the electrodes and a more controllable signal to drive the corona driver is necessary to get this ignition system working properly...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} status of plans to {{commission}} a short-pulse, quad of beams on the National <b>Ignition</b> Facility (NIF), <b>capable</b> of generating > 10 kJ of energy in 10 ps. These beams will initially provide an advanced radiographic capability (ARC) to generate brilliant, x-ray back-lighters for diagnosing fuel density and symmetry during ignition experiments. A fiber, mode-locked oscillator generates the seed pulse for the ARC beam line in the NIF master oscillator room (MOR). The 200 fs, 1053 nm oscillator pulse is amplified and stretched in time using a chirped-fiber-Bragg grating. The stretched pulse is split to follow two separate beam paths through the chain. Each pulse goes to separate pulse tweakers where the dispersion can be adjusted to generate a range of pulse widths and delays at the compressor output. After further fiber amplification the two pulses are transported to the NIF preamplifier area and spatially combined using shaping masks to form a split-spatial-beam profile that fits in a single NIF aperture. This split beam propagates through a typical NIF chain where the energy is amplified to several kilojoules. A series of mirrors directs the amplified, split beam to a folded grating compressor that is located near the equator of the NIF target chamber. Figure 1 shows a layout of the beam transport and folded compressor, showing the split beam spatial profile. The folder compressor contains four pairs of large, multi-layer-dielectric gratings; each grating in a pair accepts half of the split beam. The compressed output pulse can be 0. 7 - 50 ps in duration, depending on {{the setting of the}} pulse tweaker in the MOR. The compressor output is directed to target chamber center using four additional mirrors that include a 9 meter, off-axis parabola. The final optic, immediately following the parabola, is a pair of independently adjustable mirrors that can direct the pair of ARC beams to individual x-ray backlighter targets. The first mirror after the compressor leaks {{a small fraction of the}} light that is transported to a diagnostics station where detailed measurements of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the ARC pulse will be recorded for each shot. A NIF quad of short-pulse beams will support up to eight, independently-timed, short-pulse beams, capable of producing an x-ray motion picture. Alternatively, the combined aperture of the quad can direct > 10 kJ of energy in 10 psec onto a single target, enabling research into fast ignition and high-energy-density science on the NIF. We will discuss modifications to the NIF to accommodate ARC, including features such as simultaneous NIF-ARC operation in the same NIF quad, protection against backward propagating pulses from the target and plans to coherently add split beams...|$|R
