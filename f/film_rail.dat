40|$|Separation {{is a vital}} {{process in}} oil industries, where the {{mixtures}} separation, like the upstream gotten from oil reservoirs, differentiate the useful products. Gas-liquid separation process has been widely studied in order to optimize the quality of gas to export and later refine. However liquid-liquid separation {{has not been as}} optimized as gas-liquid separation. Nowadays liquid-liquid separators consist in a big over- dimensioned vessels, where due to the slow migration velocities and the coalescence time liquids get separate after some time. Specially in the offshore installations where space and weight {{play a crucial role in}} the design and transport of the mate- rials is not so easy, this over-dimension of the containers can create overweight and structural issues. In this thesis the different parts of the separation process (dynamics of droplets, and their interaction with a liquid-liquid interface) have been studied. In order to be able to conceive, design and build a facility which can simulate the processes suffered by the liquids during the separation, an extensive work in literature has been reviewed. The goal of this work is starting from a simple circuit, design and build a test section which will allow to simulate and study the coalescence process and the droplet dynamics inside a gravity separator inducing shear by forcing flows to run in opposite directions in the presence of the other. The design was performed with 3 D software and built in transparent resin in a 3 D printer. A study of transparency through different post-printing processes and section designs with the addition of crystal slides is presented. Also resistance of sections built and supports generated in a 3 D printer has been performed to validate this method for experiments in the future. The facility construction suffered modifications from the first idea due to a lack of time to perform all the components although they are included both in theory and designing part. Visualization of the droplets was achieved with a high-speed camera over a <b>film</b> <b>rail</b> controlled by computer software. The results show the validation of the 3 D prints for possible laboratory uses as the pieces are able to resist increases and reductions of flow without suffering an important pressure drop. Because of the superposition of resin layers and the aging of the resin film through the resin was rejected. A re-design of the test section was made to incorporate windows to be able to visualize and illuminate the simulation of the gravity separation process...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research into adhesion and contaminant films, low adhesion problems continue to plague the modern railway, particularly in autumn when leaves on line and damp conditions combine {{to form a}} very low adhesion contaminant <b>film</b> on the <b>rail</b> head which cannot be removed easily. Whether accelerating, braking or simply maintaining the desired speed, good adhesion between rail and wheel is essential. Without good adhesion the braking distances are very long and for safety reasons trains need to reduce speed. Sudden drops in adhesion can cause havoc with time-tables, {{and can lead to}} accidents - the number of signals passed a danger is significantly higher in autumn. In addition to low-adhesion problems, contaminants (sometimes environmental, sometimes as a deliberate adhesion-control) can cause problems with track circuitry and the failure of train detection systems can also lead to accidents. This report covers the causes of low adhesion and the methods used to control the problem, and describes measurements which have been carried out in the field or in the laboratory. A plan for new laboratory work examining contaminant films, particularly leaf <b>films,</b> studying new <b>rail</b> materials or coating which provide good adhesion properties, and developing mechanisms for preventing film formation or removing existing films is outlined.

40|$|Autumn leaves often cause low {{adhesion}} {{problems for}} train operations, leading to station overruns and signals passed at danger (SPADS). The {{aim of this}} paper was to review operational data and research methods to assess the current understanding of the problem and formulate hypotheses for the causes. Incident analysis showed the relatively high possibility of incidents between the hours of 05 : 00 – 10 : 00 and 20 : 00 – 24 : 00, suggesting the dew effect was important. This result corresponds to the knowledge that wet leaves in the contact area produce very low friction coefficients, below 0. 1. Current mitigation methods, such as sanding, seem inadequate to remove the leaf films completely. To explain the bonding mechanism between the leaf <b>film</b> and the <b>rail,</b> a laboratory-based model and a field-based model were developed based on previous studies. Moreover, key parameters for a strong bond formation were identified, which are iron oxide, temperature, pressure and leaf material.

40|$|Management {{of rolling}} contact fatigue (RCF) risk is a {{critical}} maintenance activity in railway operations. Practical means of RCF mitigation involve: 1) preventative and corrective grinding to remove RCF cracks; 2) management of wheel and rail profiles to minimize peak contact pressures; and 3) selection of appropriate rail metallurgy. In addition, reduction of traction forces by application of dry <b>film</b> Top of <b>Rail</b> friction modifiers (FM) has recently been shown to reduce crack growth and extend grinding intervals. Hydro-pressurisation and crack face lubrication are processes by which liquid materials (e. g., water), enter pre-existing RCF cracks and under wheel/rail contact pressure and cause accelerated crack growth, leading to spalling and shelling on rail and wheels. Thus, any liquid material added deliberately to the wheel/rail interface should be considered carefully {{in terms of the}} potential for aggravating RCF damage. This study compares the impact on hydro-pressurization and crack face lubrication of different types of materials designed for application to the top of rail using twin disc testing. One type of FM material is water-based, drying providing solid particles to the rail-wheel contact. Two other types are oil or oil-plus-water-based (hybrid material) that do not naturally dry and have been introduced more recently to the market. In addition, a commonly used gauge face lubricant (grease) was evaluated...|$|R

5000|$|Synchronized {{sound was}} a {{contentious}} issue with Soviet <b>film</b> theorist. Pudovkin <b>railed</b> against its use given its capacity for commodification within capitalist society and, primarily, its propensity to move film toward naturalism. In his reasoning, since sync sound was conditioned to the image, {{it could only}} lend itself toward enhanced continuity. Continuity, a process that mitigates the dialectical collision of concepts, would dilute the radical potential of films. Further, any dialectical potential for sound had already been explored in cinema, since musical accompaniment had a well established history by the time synchronized sound had been introduced. However, Pudovkin later reversed his position on sync-sound. Joining Eisenstein and others, Pudovkin came to understand sound not a complementary, but as a counterpoint capable of imbuing films with additional conflictual elements. The inherent tension between this position and the State’s mandate for narrative clarity and continuity would {{be a source of}} confusion and stagnation for much of this period.

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{continuation}} of the RAIL - Rapid Automated Induction Lamination - process developed by S. Yarlagadda et al. at the Center for Composite Materials, University of Delaware, USA. The RAIL process was developed and optimized for laminating prepregs, i. e. preimpregnated carbon fibers that are oriented parallel to each other and then formed as a sheet 12 ” x 36 ”. These sheets are stacked so that there is always an angle between the fibers of two sheets that are in contact with each other. If the angle is zero degrees there will be no heat generated in the induction heating zone {{due to the fact that}} conductive loops are required for heating to occur. This project’s primary goal was to test an alternative combination of carbon fiber and thermoplastic polymer and run it in the existing RAIL machine. Carbon fiber weave would be stacked with thermoplastic film and the result would be a flexible and strong composite. Both raw materials could be delivered to the machine separately, on rolls, and the need for pre- impregnation would be eliminated. This would reduce the raw material cost compared to prepregs. A requirement was that the quality of the final composite had to be at least as good as the same composite manufactured in a hot press. The secondary goal was {{a continuation}} of the primary: it consisted of modifications of the RAIL process stages, allowing manufacture of non-flat laminates. For this purpose, aluminum molding dies were designed and manufactured and the process would then be a combination of lamination and a variant of pultrusion. The experiments that were carried out showed that it would be possible to replace prepregs with stacks of carbon fiber weave and thermoplastic <b>film</b> in the <b>RAIL</b> process. All experiments were done with Nylon™ as resin. Optical microscopy revealed that the process can heat the fiber weave enough to melt the resin and then evacuate the air in the stack at the consolidation stage. The cooling seemed sufficient as no voids were created. The preheat zone in the RAIL process was developed because impregnated carbon fibers were used at the time and it was necessary to melt the resin so that contact between the fibers could be achieved. Tests with carbon fiber weave and Nylon™ film indicated that the preheat station was not needed in order to reach the processing temperature because the majority of the heating occurs by induction heating inside each layer of the carbon fiber weave. However, preheating was still used for the evaluated laminates because the temperature distribution across the laminate turned out to be much easier to control with the preheating station active. The resulting laminate is very flexible and can easily be cut if desired. Molding dies were designed and manufactured. The purpose was to give the laminate a profile-type shape directly after the lamination stage. The cooling rollers would then have been replaced by the stationary molding dies.
