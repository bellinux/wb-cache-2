50|$|There are six {{stages in}} the {{hatching}} and development of brine shrimp <b>industrial</b> <b>hatchery.</b>|$|E
50|$|Galveston {{hatcheries}} (named after Galveston, Texas, {{where they}} were developed) are large-scale, <b>industrial</b> <b>hatcheries</b> using a closed and tightly controlled environment. They breed the shrimp at high densities in large (15-30 t) tanks. Survival rates vary between 0% and 80%, but typically achieve 50%.|$|R
50|$|In hatcheries, the {{developing}} shrimp are fed {{on a diet}} of algae and later also brine shrimp nauplii, sometimes (especially in <b>industrial</b> <b>hatcheries)</b> augmented by artificial diets. The diet of later stages also includes fresh or freeze-dried animal protein, for example krill. Nutrition and medication (such as antibiotics) fed to the brine shrimp nauplii are {{passed on to the}} shrimp that eat them.|$|R
40|$|Different {{species of}} microalgae, the rotifer, Brachionus spp., and the brine shrimp, Artemia spp., are {{essential}} live {{food in the}} farming of several species of molluscs (e. g. oyster, clam, scallop), crustaceans (e. g. marine shrimp, freshwater prawn, crabs) and fish (e. g. bass, bream, grouper, turbot, flounder, halibut, ayu). A brief overview is given of {{the latest developments in}} their production and use in <b>industrial</b> <b>hatcheries...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of sublethal morphological deformities {{represents one of}} the main bottleneck of the <b>industrial</b> finfish <b>hatchery</b> production, resulting in major economic loss due to reduced growth and marketing ability of the final product, that has to be transformed (filets) or sold for fish flour. Furthermore, the elimination of deformed fishes from the productive cycle needs for periodic selections at present carried out by manual sorting. This represents an additional economic cost, and a stress for fishes...|$|R
40|$|The {{controlled}} {{culture of}} larvae of molluscs of commercial importance (oysters, clams, etc.) till spatfall implies the daily production of substantial volumes of suitable species of microscopic algae. For economic reasons, <b>industrial</b> mollusc <b>hatcheries</b> cannot, however, upscale the very expensive indoor algal production {{to fulfill the}} increasing food demands of the growing spat. As too early transplantation of the postlarvae to the natural environment results in various technological and biological problems, the intermediate semi-controlled "nursery" culturing of the spat up to a few centimeters in length is presently more and more preconized. The different technologies utilized for nursery culturing are reviewed with special emphasis on the major problem: the mass production of live algal food under outdoor or greenhouse conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunity}} profile against H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) {{in the commercial}} poultry value chain network in Egypt was modeled {{with the use of}} different vaccination scenarios. The model estimated the vaccination coverage, the protective seroconversion level, and the duration of immunity for each node of the network and vaccination scenario. Partial budget analysis was used to compare the benefit-cost of the different vaccination scenarios. The model predicted that targeting day-old chick avian influenza (AI) vaccination in <b>industrial</b> and large <b>hatcheries</b> would increase immunity levels in the overall poultry population in Egypt and especially in small commercial poultry farms (from 60 %). This strategy was shown to be more efficient than the current strategy of using inactivated vaccines. Improving HPAI control in the commercial poultry sector in Egypt would have a positive impact to improve disease control...|$|R
