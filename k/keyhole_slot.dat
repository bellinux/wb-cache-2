50|$|VLTOR Weapon Systems had {{previously}} pursued a design {{which was the}} basis for the KeyMod system. While developing the first prototype systems Eric Kincel of VLTOR Weapon systems was approached by John Noveske of Noveske Rifleworks with a design for a universal accessory attachment system. After a short collaboration, during which Todd Krawczyk of Noveske Rifleworks suggested an improvement to the accessory lock/anti-rotation nut, John Noveske decided to adopt what became the KeyMod system for the NSR series of hand guards and accessories. Kincel's design was developed simultaneously, but without knowledge of the independently developed <b>keyhole</b> <b>slot</b> system by Accuracy International, until after KeyMod's release.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{separately}} available accessory is {{the distinctive}} left-hand wood grip with accessory shoe. Many manufacturers offer accessory grip or [...] "action grips" [...] such as Kowa, Bronica, Mamiya and Hasselblad the Pentax grip is arguably an iconic accessory for the camera. It {{attaches to the}} two lugs/posts {{at the front of}} the camera and is secured by tightening a finger-operated bolt onto a stud found at center. The grip is removed by untightening and lifting the bolt to slide off in a downward direction to allow the lugs to clear the <b>keyhole</b> <b>slots.</b>|$|R
5|$|In September 2015, {{flooding}} trapped a {{party of}} seven in <b>Keyhole</b> Canyon, a <b>slot</b> canyon in the park. The flash flood killed all seven members of the group, whose remains were located after a search lasting several days.|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} and experiment validation {{were conducted to}} optimize development of improved stripping harvesters. The header loss of the stripping harvesters was greatly influenced by parameters such as the height and rotational speed of the stripping rotor, the forward velocity of the machine, and the airflow field, etc. Mathematical models for the optimal design {{and the use of}} stripping harvesters were developed. During the operation, the center axis of the stripping rotor must be at the height below the ears of crops. When the cylinder was running, the linear velocity of the stripping teeth should be up to 14 â€“ 17 m/s (the <b>keyhole</b> center of <b>slotted</b> teeth). Also, the airflow velocity at the entrance should be higher than that at the exit and should not be lower than 5 m/s...|$|R
