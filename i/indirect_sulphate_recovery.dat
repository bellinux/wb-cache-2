Aluminium sulphate (alum) that coagulated with solids particles forming alum sludge. Alum sludge settles in the bottom of water treatment plant together with the solid particles. The significant {{of this study is to}} recover aluminium sulphate (alum) from alum sludge. Acidification process applied to alum sludge to recover aluminium sulphate (alum). Acidification using sulphuric acid will separate particulate solids and aluminium sulphate(alum). Aluminium sulphate (alum) will be recovered in aqueous solution, while particulate solids will remain in solid form. The research also done to obtain the optimum pH for acidification to obtain the best volume recovered of aluminium sulphate (alum). There are some other factors to recover aluminium sulphate (alum) at the optimum point that it has to do with stirring speeds and centrifugation time.

40|$|Atmospheric {{concentration}} {{changes and}} the resulting radiative forcing (RF) due to emissions from shipping and petroleum activity in the Arctic have been studied, using three-dimensional chemistry transport (OsloCTM 2) and radiative transfer models. The present work focuses on short-lived climate forcers, based on a coherent dataset of present day emissions from petroleum and shipping activities in the Arctic region. We find that the net forcing effect of Arctic shipping emissions of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) is negative, while the net effect from Arctic petroleum emissions of SLCFs is positive. The negative RF from Arctic shipping arises mainly from direct aerosol – and first <b>indirect</b> effects of <b>sulphate.</b> Positive RF from Arctic petroleum is mainly due to black carbon in air and deposited on snow and ice. Normalized forcing (RF per change in atmospheric burden) and global warming potentials (GWP) suggest that Arctic conditions (high solar angle, high surface albedo, summer season with midnight sun and polar night during winter) lead to different sensitivity to emissions here compared to lower latitudes...|$|R

A trial using a completely randomized design with 9 treatments and 3 replications, corresponding to the incorporation of organic byproducts, alone and in combination, a control (without application) and agronomic treatment (lime dolomite). The soil physical parameters were evaluated at 45 (sampling 1) and 165 days (sampling 2) after amendments application. The results indicated that the application of leaf litter, bagasse and fresh filter cake in the soil, generated a favorable response in the variables: bulk density and total porosity, after 45 days; in the second sampling, the best response in these variables was achieved with 6. 2 t/ha of leaf litter.

40|$|Abstract: Specific {{immunoglobulin}} (IgY) from {{egg yolk}} against Aeromonas hydrophila {{was produced by}} immunization of White Leghorn hens with formalin-killed whole cells of A. hydrophila. ELISA test using A. hydrophila as the coating antigen revealed that the specific antibody titer started to increase in the egg yolk at the 13 th day post-immunization (P/N= 2. 18), reached the peak at the 56 th day (P/N= 13. 82), and remained at high level until day 133 (P/N= 7. 03). The antibody was purified by saturated ammonium <b>sulphate</b> with a <b>recovery</b> rate of 63. 5 %. The specific IgY inhibited the growth of A. hydrophila at a concentration of 1. 0 mg/ml during the 18 h incubation. Pre-treatment of polyploid gibel carps Carassius auratus Gibelio with specific IgY had a protection rate of 60 % (6 / 10) against challenge with A. hydrophila, while none of the fishes in the control groups receiving sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or non-specific IgY survived the challenge. Treatment of fishes with the specific IgY 4 h after the challenge also had lower mortality (70 %, 7 / 10), a 30 % reduction against the control PBS or non-specific IgY groups (10 / 10). These results indicate that specific IgY antibodies could be obtained easily from hens immunized with an inactivated A. hydrophila and could provide a novel alternative approach to control of diseases in fishes caused by this organism...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of copper {{sulphate}} on the flotation of Mt Keith pentlandite ores was studied. As Mt Keith operates separate size flotation circuits, e. g. slime (− 8 μm), fine (− 25 μm) and coarse (− 160 μm) circuits, tests were conducted on streams of different particle size distributions prepared {{with the use of}} cyclones. The flotation response with and without the addition of copper sulphate was examined, first, on feed streams prepared by a laboratory grinding mill and cyclone and, second, on streams collected directly from the plant. It was found that copper sulphate had an adverse effect on flotation performance when the flotation feeds were prepared in the laboratory. In the flotation of slime-fine fractions that combined slime and fine particles, the addition of copper sulphate depressed nickel flotation while increasing gangue entrainment. In the flotation of coarse fractions, the addition of copper sulphate depressed nickel flotation without affecting gangue entrainment. However, when samples were collected directly from the plant streams and floated in a laboratory flotation cell, the addition of copper <b>sulphate</b> increased nickel <b>recovery</b> without affecting gangue entrainment in the flotation of slime, fine and coarse fractions. To explain this discrepancy, pulp chemistries in the two different types of tests were compared. It was found that the plant mills at Mt Keith produced a much more reducing grinding environment than the laboratory mill. This might contribute to the completely different behaviour which copper sulphate exhibited on flotation performance. This study also demonstrates the importance in considering plant pulp chemistry during research development in a laboratory...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{chemical}} environment determines the success of the flotation process, however its characterisation and control is difficult to achieve. This paper, as two parts, Part I and Part II, evaluates the use of various measurements and their interpretation to gain an understanding of the influence of varying parameters such as the type of milling media and copper sulphate addition on the flotation performance of sulphide minerals from a platinum group mineral (PGM) bearing Merensky ore. It shows the complexity of interpretation and the importance of analysing flotation performance holistically. Part I focuses on the pulp chemistry and mineral potential measurements have been used to show the differences in the response of the various mineral electrodes to different conditions. The final flotation recoveries of the sulphide minerals in the ore followed the same trend as the decrease in mineral potential due to collector addition viz. chalcopyrite > pentlandite > pyrrhotite. Type of milling media and copper sulphate addition slightly affected the mineral electrode potential and flotation recovery of chalcopyrite. Addition of copper <b>sulphate</b> increased the <b>recovery</b> of pentlandite and particularly pyrrhotite due to activation by copper (II) ions. The copper activation mechanism was likely to be in the form of initial adsorption of copper hydroxide followed by reduction to Cu+ at the surface. However, the changes in flotation performance of the different minerals in the ore could not be completely described by the electrochemical changes, demonstrating the limitations of these measurements. Part II addresses the effect of froth stability as demonstrated by the variations in the mass and water recovery data resulting from the different milling conditions and addition of copper sulphate which emphasised the importance of considering the froth phase in the evaluation of flotation data...|$|R
40|$|Silk-elastin-like {{polymers}} (SELPs) are protein-based polymers which {{composition is}} based on the repetition of amino acid sequence motifs present in silk fibroin (GAGAGS) and in mammalian elastin (VPGVG). These copolymers have proven its importance for several biomedical applications and in the fabrication of micro- and nano-structures. Previously, SELPs were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography with volumetric productivities of 25 - 30 mg/l. With advances in recombinant DNA technology it is possible to design and produce tailored synthetic genes, creating multifunctional complex polymers, with total control on its composition and structure. In this work we report the construction of four new SELPs which composition {{is based on}} silk fibroin crystalline blocks and elastin-like thermoplastic (VPAVG) blocks. All the copolymers were constructed on the basis of different number of silk/elastin blocks and silk:elastin block ratios. The rationale is that by modifying the polymer structure it will exhibit different properties that will be further explored. Recombinant protein expression was achieved in Escherichia coli strain BL 21 (DE 3) and purified by a chromatographic and non-chromatographic method. High levels of protein expression were obtained in bacterial cells cultured in terrific broth supplemented with lactose to allow auto-induction. The auto-induction cultures showed optimal recombinant expression in shake flask cultures with oxygen-limited conditions as determined by protein analysis in baffled and non-baffled flasks.

40|$|Explants of {{cartilage}} from tibiae of 11 – 12 days chick embryos {{were grown}} in organ culture. To one group hyaluronidase {{was added to}} the medium during the first 2 days of culture; the treated tissue was then cultured in medium without enzyme for a further 4 days. Control explants grown in hyaluronidase-free medium for 6 days grew rapidly in size and the total hexosamine content more than doubled during this time. After exposure to hyaluronidase, much of the hexosamine was lost from treated cartilage and appeared in the culture medium, but it was mostly replaced in the tissue during the subsequent recovery period. Analysis of cartilage and medium showed that net synthesis of hexosamine increased greatly in treated cartilage. The proteoglycans were extracted by two procedures from control and treated cartilage after 2, 4 and 6 days in culture. The hydrodynamic sizes of the purified proteoglycans were compared by gel chromatography and the composition of the gel-chromatographic fractions was determined. The proteoglycans from controls did not change during culture, but after exposure to hyaluronidase the proteoglycans from treated cartilage were of much smaller size and lower chondroitin <b>sulphate</b> content. During <b>recovery,</b> even though new proteoglycans were formed, they were nevertheless of smaller size and lower chondroitin sulphate content than control proteoglycans. They gradually became more like control proteoglycans during recovery from treatment, but even after 4 days they were not yet the same. After 2 days of treatment with the enzyme, the chondroitin sulphate in the cartilage was of shorter chain length than in controls but during recovery after 4 and 6 days in culture, the chain lengths in control and treated cartilage were similar. It is concluded that the proteoglycans formed in embryo cartilage in response to their depletion by enzyme treatment contained fewer chondroitin sulphate chains attached to the protein moiety of proteoglycans. This may have resulted from a failure under stress to glycosylate the protein moiety to the usual extent; alternatively the synthesis of normal proteoglycans of low chondroitin sulphate content may have increased, thus changing the proteoglycan population...|$|R
40|$|Using a coupled atmosphere/ocean general {{circulation}} model, we have simulated the climatic response to natural and anthropogenic forcings from 1860 to 1997. The model, HadCM 3, requires no flux adjustment {{and has an}} interactive sulphur cycle, a simple parameterization {{of the effect of}} aerosols on cloud albedo (first indirect effect), and a radiation scheme that allows explicit representation of well-mixed greenhouse gases. Simulations were carried out in which the model was forced with changes in natural forcings (solar irradiance and stratospheric aerosol due to explosive volcanic eruptions), well-mixed greenhouse gases alone, tropospheric anthropogenic forcings (tropospheric ozone, well-mixed greenhouse gases, and the direct and first <b>indirect</b> effects of <b>sulphate</b> aerosol), and anthropogenic forcings (tropospheric anthropogenic forcings and stratospheric ozone decline). Using an "optimal detection" methodology to examine temperature changes near the surface and throughout the free atmosphere, we find that we can detect the effects of changes in well-mixed greenhouse gases, other anthropogenic forcings (mainly the effects of sulphate aerosols on cloud albedo), and natural forcings. Thus these have all {{had a significant impact on}} temperature. We estimate the linear trend in global mean near-surface temperature from well-mixed greenhouse gases to be 0. 9 ± 0. 24 K/century, offset by cooling from other anthropogenic forcings of 0. 4 ± 0. 26 K/century, giving a total anthropogenic warming trend of 0. 5 ± 0. 15 K/century. Over the entire century, natural forcings give a linear trend close to zero. We found no evidence that simulated changes in near-surface temperature due to anthropogenic forcings were in error. However, the simulated tropospheric response, since the 1960 s, is ∼ 50 % too large. Our analysis suggests that the early twentieth century warming can best be explained by a combination of warming due to increases in greenhouse gases and natural forcing, some cooling due to other anthropogenic forcings, and a substantial, but not implausible, contribution from internal variability. In the second half of the century we find that the warming is largely caused by changes in greenhouse gases, with changes in sulphates and, perhaps, volcanic aerosol offsetting approximately one third of the warming. Warming in the troposphere, since the 1960 s, is probably mainly due to anthropogenic forcings, with a negligible contribution from natural forcings...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMajor fluxes of sulphur and {{dissolved}} inorganic nitrogen {{were estimated}} in Central European mountain ecosystems of the Bohemian Forest (forest lakes) and Tatra Mountains (alpine lakes) over the industrial period. Sulphur outputs from these ecosystems were comparable to inputs {{during a period}} of relatively stable atmospheric deposition (10 - 35 mmol m - 2 yr - 1) around the 1930 s. Atmospheric inputs of sulphur increased by three- to four-fold between the 1950 s and 1980 s to ~ 140 and ~ 60 mmol mm - 2 yr - 1 in the Bohemian Forest and Tatra Mountains, respectively. Sulphur outputs were lower than inputs due to accumulation in soils, which was higher in forest soils than in the sparser alpine soils and represented 0. 8 - 1. 6 and 0. 2 - 0. 3 mol m - 2, respectively, for the whole 1930 - 2000 period. In the 1990 s, atmospheric inputs of sulphur decreased 80 % and 50 % in the Bohemian Forest and Tatra Mountains, respectively, and sulphur outputs exceeded inputs. Catchment soils became pronounced sources of sulphur with output fluxes averaging between 15 and 31 mmol m - 2 yr - 1. Higher sulphur accumulation in the forest soils has delayed (by several decades) recovery of forest lakes from acidification compared to alpine lakes. Estimated deposition of dissolved inorganic nitrogen was 53 - 75 mmol m - 2 yr - 1 in the Bohemian Forest and 35 - 45 mmol m - 2 yr - 1 in the Tatra Mountains in the 1880 - 1950 period, i. e. below the empirically derived threshold of ~ 70 mmol m - 2 yr - 1, above which nitrogen leaching often occurs. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen was efficiently retained in the ecosystems and nitrate export was negligible (0 - 7 mmol m - 2 yr - 1). By the 1980 s, nitrogen deposition increased to ~ 160 and ~ 80 mmol m - 2 yr - 1 in the Bohemian Forest and Tatra Mountains, respectively, and nitrogen output increased to 120 and 60 mmol m - 2 yr - 1. Moreover, assimilation of nitrogen in soils declined from ~ 40 to 10 - 20 mmol m - 2 yr - 1 in the alpine soils and even more in the Bohemian Forest, where one of the catchments has even become a net source of nitrogen. In the 1990 s, nitrogen deposition decreased by ~ 30 % and DIN output decreased to - 2 yr - 1 in the Bohemian Forest and Tatra Mountains, respectively. New steady-state conditions, with negligible nitrogen export, could be reached in future but at lower nitrogen depositions than in the 1930 s.
