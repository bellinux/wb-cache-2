50|$|<b>Die</b> <b>swell,</b> {{also known}} as {{extrudate}} swell or Barus effect, is a common phenomenon in polymer processing. <b>Die</b> <b>swell</b> occurs in instances of polymer extrusion, in which a stream of polymeric material is forced through a die, a specialized tool in manufacturing to shape or cut polymeric materials. <b>Die</b> <b>swell</b> is an instance where a polymer stream is compressed by entrance into a die, and {{is followed by a}} partial recovery or “swell” back to the former shape and volume of the polymer after exiting the die, hence the term <b>die</b> <b>swell.</b>|$|E
50|$|The disentanglement of polymer chains is a kinetic process, and so {{the longer}} the die is, the more time is given for the {{physical}} entanglements within the polymer stream to disentangle. With a longer die and a slower polymer flow stream, less pronounced <b>die</b> <b>swell</b> will be observed. This {{is due to the}} longer die providing a longer time period for polymer, when subject to the increase flow rate, to disentangle. This characteristic relaxation time determines the length of time the polymer must spend inside the die to minimize <b>die</b> <b>swell.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Profile {{extrusion}}, the extrusion {{of complex}} shapes such as rain gutters, structural supports, and other components, {{brings with it}} {{some of the most}} complex die designs of any extrusion process. [...] This difficulty is due to two primary concerns: producing the initial, still molten profile, and then controlling for asymmetrical shrinkage and <b>die</b> <b>swell</b> due to varying wall thicknesses.|$|E
5000|$|Die forming {{typically}} occurs {{immediately after}} polymer melt has exited an [...] extruder. The most basic process involves guiding {{the stream of}} molten polymer under pressure through a die, which three distinct regions: manifold, approach, and lip. The 'manifold' serves to channel the polymer melt from its initial extrusion point to a near-net-shape of the final product. The 'approach' region further guides the melt into the final shape, and begins to correct for any non-uniform [...] flow. Finally, the 'lip' forms the melt into the final desired cross section and compensates for any remaining flow asymmetry. After exiting {{the lip of the}} die, the polymer melt will undergo <b>die</b> <b>swell</b> before curing. <b>Die</b> <b>swell</b> is an expansion of the melt as the pressure is released, and is dependent on polymer chemistry and die design. After curing, the solid, continuous part is drawn onto a take-up roller or cut into transportable lengths, {{depending on the type of}} part. This process may vary significantly depending on the type of die and extrusion process.|$|E
5000|$|A spider die {{consists}} of an internal mandrel connected to the outer die wall by several [...] "legs", and is a moderately complex design. The resulting film will feature weld lines wherever legs were present. These weld lines are weaker than the surrounding polymer, and may also have different optical characteristics, such as haze. This weakness is caused by incomplete healing of the polymer molecular matrix. Furthermore, a pressure gradient produced by the spider legs will cause nonuniform <b>die</b> <b>swell,</b> resulting in nonuniform film thickness.|$|E

50|$|<b>Die</b> <b>swell</b> is a {{phenomenon}} directly related to entropy and the relaxation of the polymer within the flow stream. Initially, a flow stream has a constant rate before entering the die, and the polymers within the stream occupy a roughly spherical conformation, maximizing entropy. Extrusion through the die causes an increase in flow rate through the polymer flow stream. As the polymer spends time inside the die and {{is subject to the}} much increased flow rate, the polymers lose the spherical shape, becoming longer due to the increased flow rate. Physical entanglements may relax, if the time scale of the polymer within the die is long enough. When the polymer stream leaves the die, the remaining physical entanglements cause the polymers in the die stream to regain a portion of its former shape and spherical volume, in order to return to the roughly spherical conformation that maximizes entropy.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike in blown film, pipe, and sheet {{extrusion}}, {{the dies}} used in profile extrusion are rarely round or completely flat. Whereas a round (or flat) profile has uniform flow rates along all edges, {{this is not}} the case for more complex shapes. Take, for instance, the example of a simple, solid, square profile. The velocity of the melt is highest at the center of the die, and slowest at the edges and corners due to friction between the melt and die walls. When moving from the center of the die to the midpoint of one of the edges, the velocity gradient is high, especially near the outer die wall. However, when moving from the center to one of the corners, the velocity gradient is more gradual. As a result, the extruded square profile will experience more <b>die</b> <b>swell</b> at the edges than the corners, causing the once square profile to become more circular. This can be compensated for by bowing in the sides of the die so it approximates the shape of a four-pointed star; the sides of the polymer melt will now swell to the intended dimensions.|$|E

Typical products are glass fibers, filters, insulating material, diapers or textile clothing. There {{are a variety}} of production processes, such a drawing with a take-up wheel, spunbond, meltblowing, rotational or electro-spinning, [1 – 5]. In general, a fluid (polymeric liquid or glass melt) is emerged from a orifice, pulled and stretched by outer forces to form a long thin fiber. The fiber jets can be considered as dynamic slender bodies. Topic of this work are viscoelastic jets. When spun, they might show a <b>die</b> <b>swell</b> effect, i.e. the fluid flow swells after exiting the nozzle and forms out a diameter that is significantly larger than the nozzle diameter.
