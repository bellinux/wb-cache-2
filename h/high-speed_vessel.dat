This guidance does not prescribe a solution. Rather, it provides a process that waterway management authorities and vessel operators can use to develop an appropriate solution for managing <b>high-speed</b> <b>vessel</b> wake. This guidance is consistent with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) High-Speed Craft Code (2000) and may be used to support the development of the route operational manual required by Regulation 18. 2. 2 of that Code.

40|$|A {{supercavitation}} propeller (SCP) {{that has}} high efficiency under supercavitating condition is expected {{as one of}} the most suitable propulsors for a <b>high-speed</b> <b>vessel.</b> To design a SCP with higher efficiency, a thinner cavity is recommended. However, less supercavitation sometimes occur contrary to the designer's expectation, thus the thrust becomes less than the design value and the efficiency becomes lower. In order to obtain the predicted thrust and high efficiency, it is necessary to let stable cavitation occur from the leading edge as predicted by theory. The authors propose a new cavitator that stimulates cavitation by a thin groove near the leading edge on the backside surface. Through the present comparative tests between propellers with and without the cavitator, it was clarified that the proposed cavitator is effective in stimulating and stabilizing a supercavity, and that it increases the propeller efficiency...|$|E

This data has been analyzed and a new regression formula for the progressive ventilation of the transom, as a function of the transom-draft Froude number has been developed. These formulas take into account both the transom beam-to-draft ratio and the transom-draft Reynolds number. There is now strong evidence that the transom-draft Reynolds number plays a much lesser rôle in this phenomenon than previously thought. Using these new formulas, one can now predict the resistance components with greater con-fidence.

40|$|Abstract. The {{potential}} impact of <b>high-speed</b> <b>vessel</b> wakes on the longshore drift of semi-sheltered, medium-energy beaches is evaluated based on recent studies in almost tideless Tallinn Bay, the Baltic Sea. Energy flux and wave propagation direction of vessel wakes is estimated based on high-resolution water surface profiling in summer 2008. The wind-wave time series in 1981 – 2008 is modelled {{on the basis of}} a simplified scheme for a long-term wave hindcast with the use of a triple-nested version of the WAM model. Longshore drift, created by wind waves and by vessel wakes, is estimated by the energy flux model, also known as the Coastal Engineering Research Centre (CERC) model. Vessel wakes cause longshore drift that in 2007 – 2008, as compared to the drift produced by wind waves on the SW coast of the Aegna Island at the entrance to Tallinn Bay, had a magnitude about 75 % less and the opposite direction...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop improved reliability-based structural design methods for stiffened aluminium. panels in <b>high-speed</b> <b>vessels.</b> In recent years aluminium <b>high-speed</b> <b>vessels</b> have grown larger and are venturing into increasingly hostile operating environments. Designing such vessels requires structural prediction techniques capable of producing a light structure with high confidence in its strength and safety. However, current aluminium marine structural design methods are largely simple modifications of steel methods that do not account {{for all of the}} differences between aluminium and steel. TTds thesis presents new reliability-based design techniques for the ultimate strength and fatigue strength of aluminium stiffened panels. A review of recent aluminium <b>high-speed</b> <b>vessels</b> is made, along with their structural configuration and hydrodynamic loading. Structural reliability techniques are discussed. Existing prediction methods, including marine approaches and civil engineering design codes are compared to experimental results for the compressive collapse of aluminium plates and stiffened panels. A modified technique is proposed to model the compressive collapse of such panels. The tensile response of welded aluminium, structures is investigated, including the influence of strain concentration in the reduced-strength region around welds. Reliability formulations are presented and discussed for ultimate strength predictions. A reliability based hot-spot S-N fatigue prediction method is developed for welded connections, including an analysis of the material and prediction uncertainty values and a comparison with existing design codes. Discussion of extending the fatigue prediction techniques to include through-life initiationpropagation fatigue models are presented, along with a simple trial application to butt welds. Conclusions from the techniques investigated are presented, and potential future developments are discussed.

40|$|Abstract: In {{designing}} the propulsion plant of a <b>high-speed</b> <b>vessel</b> {{it is important}} to investigate, in addition to the steady behaviour, the dynamic performance of the system over a wide range of operating conditions. This paper presents a mathematical model for the dynamic simulation of a waterjet propulsion system. The model, developed in a Matlab-Simulink software environment, is structured in modular form, in order to describe the various elements of the system as individuals blocks (hull, prime mover, gear, waterjet, etc.), taking into account their interactions. In this way it is possible to characterise the dynamic behaviour of both the single components and of the whole propulsion plant. The present work represents an extension to the high-speed vessels of a simulation model already developed and published by some of the authors for the performance prediction of marine propulsion plants. In its earlier version the model was provided with a block representing a controllable pitch propeller. In the present version this block has been substituted by a waterjet block, whose inclusion has required, however, some further modifications of the simulation scheme. A first validation of the model has been obtained by comparing the results given by the simulation with the experimental data surveyed on board of a built vessel, showing a good agreement between them...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the flow within a generic flush type water-jet inlet {{has been carried out}} to identify the principal flow features and provide a basis for devel-opment of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Tests were performed in a cavitation tunnel with the model inlet fitted to the test section ceiling, and effects of thickening the ingested tunnel wall boundary layer were investigated. The model was fitted with a range of instrumentation to investigate the ramp pressure distribution and boundary layer development, lip incidence, and pump face flow properties. Obser-vations of lip and duct cavitation inception and behavior were also made. The results showed the inlet performance to be generally improved with the ingestion of a thicker boundary layer. The thickened boundary layer significantly reduced ramp boundary layer separation and distortion of flow at the notional pump face. However, a greater range of lip incidence occurred with the thickened boundary layer with consequent greater likelihood of lip separation and cavitation occurrence. Ideal lip incidence and pump face flow uniformity occurred at flow parameters significantly different from those for ideal pump face pressure recovery. Large developed cavities on the inlet lip were observed for a range of conditions typical of conventional <b>high-speed</b> <b>vessel</b> operation. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{particle}} image velocimetry (PIV) {{technique has}} become a reliable method for capturing the velocity field and its derivatives, even in complex flows and is now also widely used for validation of numerical codes. As the imaging system is sensitive to vibrations, the application in environments such as towing tanks makes it a challenging task. Especially when operating the towing tank carriage at higher speeds structural vibrations increase significantly. However, to apply this technique {{for the analysis of}} planing and semi-planing vessels, this is absolutely necessary. To assess the ability of a PIV system to capture the flow features close to a ship model while being towed at high speeds, a stereo PIV system was installed in the TU Delft towing tank. Measurements are conducted in the transom region of a generic <b>high-speed</b> <b>vessel</b> hull with a flat bottomed aft section, which is equipped with an interceptor at the transom. It is shown that with increasing carriage speed, vibrations of the imaging system increase, which ultimately can affect the quality of PIV recordings. The effect of vibrations is quantified by analysis of successive recordings and based on this, a shift correction is applied. A comparison with numerical results shows that the flow around the interceptor is well captured by the PIV syste...|$|E

In the 7 th Fleet area of responsibility {{the main component of}} the mobile supply line, the Combat Logistics Force (CLF) ship, has become a possible target with the development of the anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM). With the ability to target and disable a CLF with an ASBM, an enemy can now disable a deployed CTF/CRUDES fleet by eliminating its required replenished resources, rendering it combat ineffective and more vulnerable to attack.

40|$|Current {{projections}} {{show that}} U. S. international trade {{is expected to}} reach nearly two billion tons by 2020, approximately double today's level. With such a large forecasted growth in trade coming through the United States and growing problems associated with highway congestion, air pollution, and national security, building short sea shipping networks will be difficult, but possible, and potentially of great benefit to the nation. By bringing together shipping providers, customers, and with support from the federal government, short sea shipping can become a reality. This paper outlines the need for a change in our maritime transportation system. It {{takes a look at the}} current uses of short sea shipping in the United States as well as the system used in Europe. The technology associated with this concept is described and <b>high-speed</b> <b>vessel</b> design is investigated. Issues relating to the integration of short sea shipping are brought to light, including customer requirements, capital financing, and government policy. A computer-based simulation model calculates a total cost analysis for two modes of transporting goods, trucking and short sea shipping. The model is applied to a group of products of different size, weight, and value. (cont.) The quantitative results of the model show that in most cases, for lower value products, the savings in transportation costs from short sea shipping offset the increase in inventory costs. These results are then used to look at other commodities listed on the 2002 commodity flow survey to show the potential for short sea shipping use. by Peter H. Connor. Thesis (S. M.)
