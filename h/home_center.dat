25|$|In 1997, Home Depot {{entered the}} Chilean and Argentine markets. While the venture was viewed with great {{optimism}} by founders Bernard Marcus and Arthur Blank, it eventually proved unprofitable. In October 2001, Chilean partners Falabella bought out Home Depot's {{share of the}} five Chilean <b>Home</b> <b>Center</b> stores and rebranded them Home Store. In 2003, after merging with Sodimac, all stores adopted that brand. The company has since expanded across Latin America very profitably and successfully. It's currently the N°1 Home Improvement company in South America.|$|E
25|$|On October 10, 1984, in South Pasadena, California, a {{major fire}} broke out at an Ole's <b>Home</b> <b>Center</b> {{hardware}} store located in a shopping plaza. The store was completely destroyed by the fire, and four {{people died in the}} blaze, including a two-year-old child named Matthew and 17 year old employee Jimmy Cetina.

25|$|The Home Depot {{began to}} branch out of Georgia to Florida in 1981 with stores opening in Hollywood and Ft. Lauderdale. By 1984 The Home Depot was {{operating}} 19 stores {{with sales of}} over $256 million. To enter the Dallas market The Home Depot acquired Bowater <b>Home</b> <b>Center</b> from Bowater Inc. on October 31, 1984 for $40 million. The increased expansion of The Home Depot in the mid-1980s created financial difficulties with earnings falling at 42% and debt rising to $200 million. The financial difficulties of The Home Depot also caused the stock price to fall. To curb The Home Depot difficulties it opened only 10 stores in 1986 with a stock offering 2.99 million shares at $17 per share that helped The Home Depot to restructure its debts.|$|E

Tommy Hanson, making the first Opening Day {{start of his}} career, faced Mets ace Johan Santana, who was making his first Major League appearance since September 2010.

In the bottom of the sixth, Mets third baseman David Wright singled <b>home</b> <b>center</b> fielder Andrés Torres to give the Mets a 1–0 advantage, which would end up being the final score of the game. Hanson took the loss, giving up just the one earned run in five plus innings of work.
