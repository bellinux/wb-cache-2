2500|$|Stoat skins are prized by the fur trade, {{especially}} in winter coat, {{and used to}} trim coats and stoles. The fur from the winter coat {{is referred to as}} ermine. There is also a design called ermine inspired by the winter coat of the stoat and painted onto other furs, such as rabbit. In Europe these furs are a symbol of royalty and high status; the ceremonial robes of members of the UK House of Lords and the academic hoods of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge are traditionally trimmed with ermine although in practice rabbit or <b>fake</b> <b>fur</b> is now often used instead due to expense or animal rights concerns. [...] Prelates of the Catholic Church still wear ecclesiastical garments featuring ermine (a sign of their status equal to that of the nobility). [...] Cecilia Gallerani is depicted holding an ermine in her portrait, Lady with an Ermine, by Leonardo da Vinci. Henry Peacham's Emblem 75, which depicts an ermine being pursued by a hunter and two hounds, is entitled [...] "Cui candor morte redemptus" [...] ("Purity bought with his own death"). Peacham goes on to preach that men and women should follow the example of the ermine and keep their minds and consciences as pure as the legendary ermine keeps its fur.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fake</b> <b>fur</b> is {{used for}} all {{purposes}} where otherwise real fur (of animal origin) would be used, but also for stuffed animals, fashion accessory and home decorations like pillows, bedding and throws.
