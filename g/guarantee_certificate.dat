40|$|The Yasuní-ITT {{initiative}} was {{proposed by the}} Government of Ecuador in 2007 as a new model for achieving climate regulation, conservation of biodiversity, protection of indigenous peoples and sustainable development. The initiative seeks to receive financial compensation from the international community, in exchange for maintaining 846 {{million barrels of oil}} underground in perpetuity. This mechanism challenges existing climate regulation and development paradigms by offering a supply oriented climate regulation policy. Large scale financial contributions to the initiative are issued with non-expiring, redeemable <b>guarantee</b> <b>certificates</b> that allow the bearer to claim back the contribution if the ITT block is ever exploited. The fund is seeking to capture $ 3. 6 billion dollars by the year 2020; if successful this means that Ecuador would be forgoing approximately half of the profits it would otherwise receive from extraction of the oil. This research examines the legal and political structures that are being created as part of the initiatives’ development, promotion and implementation, in order to assess the immediate and long term viability of the initiative as well as its effectiveness in achieving its overall goals. In order to better understand some of the key issues both document analysis and interview techniques were used to assess the details of the proposed mechanisms as well as the key political issues that surround its implementation. It was found that whilst the initiative is for the most part, clearly structured, there are some specific issues which are currently acting as barriers to commitment of funds from external parties. These are primarily centred on political perceptions of Ecuador’s ability to guarantee non-exploitation, or at least the return of funds if exploitation does occur, at varying timescales. Also the current threshold for issuance of <b>guarantee</b> <b>certificates</b> is likely a considerable disincentive for individuals and small organisations to contribute to the initiative...|$|R

50|$|The Yasuni-Ishpingo, Tambococha, and Tiputini (ITT) Initiative, {{referring}} to the corridor of oil reserves within the Yasuni National Park, is the first post-oil development initiative that recognizes that the benefits gained from the Amazon are greater than the economic benefits from oil extraction. The aim of the initiative is therefore to protect the biodiversity of the area, which UNESCO has declared a biodiversity reserve, by keeping the oil reserves in the ground, in return for compensation {{from the international community}} for {{at least half of the}} projected benefit Ecuador would receive from the oil extraction (approximately $3.5 billion). These funds would be used to fund other economic initiatives to alleviate poverty and develop the renewable energy sector. The importance of keeping the oil in the ITT area in the ground has been argued as of international importance to mitigate the effects of global climate change by preventing CO2 emissions and the local environmental devastation the extraction would cause. The Rights of Nature and other articles of the new constitution also make the protection of the park a legal imperative, as the extraction would be a violation of nature's rights. Though there originally was some difficulty evoking a sense of international responsibility to fund the initiative, especially with the national constitution requiring this law already, eventually in August 2010 Ecuador came to an arrangement with the UNDP for funding of the initiative through the issue of Yasuní <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Certificates,</b> denoting the amount of CO2 emissions avoided and their monetary value, which can potentially be used in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme.|$|R
