5|$|Aristotle, {{a student}} of Plato, {{observed}} an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this he concluded that Mars must lie further from the Earth than the Moon. He noted that other such occultations of stars and planets had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians. Aristotle used this observational {{evidence to support the}} Greek sequencing of the planets. His work De Caelo presented a model of the universe in which the Sun, Moon, and planets circle about the Earth at fixed distances. A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus when he proposed that Mars moved along a circular track called the <b>epicycle</b> that, in turn, orbited about the Earth along a larger circle called the deferent.|$|E
5|$|The planets {{were thought}} by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and <b>epicycle</b> motions. Although {{the idea that}} the planets orbited the Sun had been {{suggested}} many times, {{it was not until the}} 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observation data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.|$|E
25|$|In the Ptolemaic system, each {{planet is}} moved {{by a system}} of two spheres: one called its deferent; the other, its <b>epicycle.</b> The deferent is a circle whose center point, called the {{eccentric}} and marked in the diagram with an X, {{is removed from the}} Earth. The original purpose of the eccentric was to account for the differences of the lengths of the seasons (autumn is the shortest by a week or so), by placing the Earth away from the center of rotation {{of the rest of the}} universe. Another sphere, the <b>epicycle,</b> is embedded inside the deferent sphere and is represented by the smaller dotted line to the right. A given planet then moves around the <b>epicycle</b> at the same time the <b>epicycle</b> moves along the path marked by the deferent. These combined movements cause the given planet to move closer to and further away from the Earth at different points in its orbit, and explained the observation that planets slowed down, stopped, and moved backward in retrograde motion, and then again reversed to resume normal, or prograde, motion.|$|E
50|$|This {{is because}} <b>epicycles</b> can be {{represented}} as a complex Fourier series; so, {{with a large number}} of <b>epicycles,</b> very complicated paths {{can be represented}} in the complex plane.|$|R
50|$|The first {{planetary}} model {{without any}} <b>epicycles</b> {{was that of}} Ibn Bajjah (Avempace) in 12th century Andalusian Spain, but <b>epicycles</b> were not eliminated in Europe until the 17th century, when Johannes Kepler's model of elliptical orbits gradually replaced Copernicus' model based on perfect circles.|$|R
25|$|The geocentric {{model was}} {{eventually}} {{replaced by the}} heliocentric model. The earliest heliocentric model, Copernican heliocentrism, could remove Ptolemy's <b>epicycles</b> because the retrograde motion could {{be seen to be}} the result of the combination of Earth and planet movement and speeds. Copernicus felt strongly that equants were a violation of Aristotelian purity, and proved that replacement of the equant with a pair of new <b>epicycles</b> was entirely equivalent. Astronomers often continued using the equants instead of the <b>epicycles</b> because the former was easier to calculate, and gave the same result.|$|R
25|$|The Moon {{itself would}} move uniformly (with some mean motion in anomaly) on a {{secondary}} circular orbit, called an <b>epicycle,</b> that itself would move uniformly (with some mean motion in longitude) over the main circular {{orbit around the}} Earth, called deferent; see deferent and <b>epicycle.</b> Apollonius demonstrated that these two models were in fact mathematically equivalent. However, all this was theory and had not been put to practice. Hipparchus was the first astronomer we know attempted to determine the relative proportions and actual sizes of these orbits.|$|E
25|$|This {{showed that}} with a Ptolemaic cosmology, the Venus <b>epicycle</b> can be neither {{completely}} inside nor completely outside of the orbit of the Sun. As a result, Ptolemaics abandoned {{the idea that the}} <b>epicycle</b> of Venus was completely inside the Sun, and later 17th century competition between astronomical cosmologies focused on variations of Tycho Brahe's Tychonic system (in which the Earth was still {{at the center of the}} universe, and around it revolved the Sun, but all other planets revolved around the Sun in one massive set of epicycles), or variations on the Copernican system.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus {{devised a}} {{geometrical}} method {{to find the}} parameters from three positions of the Moon, at particular phases of its anomaly. In fact, Ptolemy did this separately for the eccentric and the <b>epicycle</b> model. Ptolemy describes the details in the Almagest IV.11. Hipparchus used two sets of three lunar eclipse observations, which he carefully selected to satisfy the requirements. The eccentric model he fitted to these eclipses from his Babylonian eclipse list: 22/23December 383, 18/19June 382, and 12/13December 382. The <b>epicycle</b> model he fitted to lunar eclipse observations made in Alexandria at 22September 201, 19March 200, and 11September 200.|$|E
50|$|Although Copernicus' models {{reduced the}} {{magnitude}} of the <b>epicycles</b> considerably, whether they were simpler than Ptolemy's is moot. Copernicus eliminated Ptolemy's somewhat-maligned equant but at a cost of additional <b>epicycles.</b> Various 16th-century books based on Ptolemy and Copernicus use about equal numbers of <b>epicycles.</b> The idea that Copernicus used only 34 circles in his system comes from his own statement in a preliminary unpublished sketch called the Commentariolus. By the time he published De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, he had added more circles. Counting the total number is difficult, but estimates are that he created a system just as complicated, or even more so. Koestler, in his history of man's vision of the universe, equates the number of <b>epicycles</b> used by Copernicus at 48. The popular total of about 80 circles for the Ptolemaic system seems to have appeared in 1898. It may have been inspired by the non-Ptolemaic system of Girolamo Fracastoro, who used either 77 or 79 orbs in his system inspired by Eudoxus of Cnidus. Copernicus in his works exaggerated the number of <b>epicycles</b> used in the Ptolemic system; although original counts ranged to 80 circles, by Copernicus's time the Ptolemic system had been updated by Peurbach towards the similar number of 40; hence Copernicus effectively replaced the problem of retrograde with further <b>epicycles.</b>|$|R

25|$|In the 12th century, Arzachel {{departed}} from the ancient Greek idea of uniform circular motions by hypothesizing that the planet Mercury moves in an elliptic orbit, while Alpetragius proposed a planetary model that abandoned the equant, <b>epicycle</b> and eccentric mechanisms, though {{this resulted in a}} system that was mathematically less accurate. Alpetragius also declared the Ptolemaic system as an imaginary model that was successful at predicting planetary positions but not real or physical. His alternative system spread through most of Europe during the 13th century.|$|E
25|$|A major {{flaw in the}} Eudoxan {{system is}} its {{inability}} to explain changes in the brightness of planets as seen from Earth. Because the spheres are concentric, planets will always remain at the same distance from Earth. This problem was pointed out in Antiquity by Autolycus of Pitane. Astronomers responded by introducing the deferent and <b>epicycle,</b> which caused a planet to vary its distance. However, Eudoxus' importance to Greek astronomy is considerable, as {{he was the first}} to attempt a mathematical explanation of the planets.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemy's unique {{contribution}} to this theory was the equant—a point about which {{the center of a}} planet's <b>epicycle</b> moved with uniform angular velocity, but which was offset from the center of its deferent. This violated one of the fundamental principles of Aristotelian cosmology—namely, that the motions of the planets should be explained in terms of uniform circular motion, and was considered a serious defect by many medieval astronomers. In Copernicus's day, the most up-to-date version of the Ptolemaic system was that of Peurbach (1423–1461) and Regiomontanus (1436–1476).|$|E
50|$|The {{apparent}} {{motion of}} the heavenly bodies with respect to time is cyclical in nature. Apollonius of Perga realized that this cyclical variation could be represented visually by small circular orbits, or <b>epicycles,</b> revolving on larger circular orbits, or deferents. Hipparchus calculated the required orbits. Deferents and <b>epicycles</b> in the ancient models did not represent orbits in the modern sense.|$|R
50|$|Any path—periodic or not, {{closed or}} open—can be {{represented}} with {{an infinite number}} of <b>epicycles.</b>|$|R
500|$|To {{describe}} this forward-and-backward motion, Apollonius of Perga (...) developed {{the concept of}} deferents and <b>epicycles,</b> according to which the planets are carried on rotating circles that are themselves carried on other rotating circles, and so on. Any orbit can be described with {{a sufficient number of}} judiciously chosen <b>epicycles,</b> since this approach corresponds to a modern Fourier transform. Roughly 350 years later, Claudius Ptolemaeus published his Almagest, in which he developed this system to match the best astronomical observations of his era. To explain the <b>epicycles,</b> Ptolemy adopted the geocentric cosmology of Aristotle, according to which planets were confined to concentric rotating spheres. This model of the universe was authoritative for nearly 1500 years.|$|R
25|$|Greek {{geometrical}} astronomy developed {{away from}} the model of concentric spheres to employ more complex models in which an eccentric circle would carry around a smaller circle, called an <b>epicycle</b> which in turn carried around a planet. The first such model is attributed to Apollonius of Perga and further developments in it were {{carried out in the}} 2nd century BC by Hipparchus of Nicea. Hipparchus made a number of other contributions, including the first measurement of precession and the compilation of the first star catalog in which he proposed our modern system of apparent magnitudes.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemy {{inherited}} from his Greek predecessors a geometrical toolbox and a partial set of models for predicting where the planets {{would appear in}} the sky. Apollonius of Perga (c. 262 – c. 190 BC) had introduced the deferent and <b>epicycle</b> and the eccentric deferent to astronomy. Hipparchus (2nd century BC) had crafted mathematical models of {{the motion of the}} Sun and Moon. Hipparchus had some knowledge of Mesopotamian astronomy, and he felt that Greek models should match those of the Babylonians in accuracy. He was unable to create accurate models for the remaining five planets.|$|E
25|$|In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus, {{aware of}} the {{extraordinary}} accuracy with which Babylonian astronomers could predict the planets' motions, insisted that Greek astronomers achieve similar levels of accuracy. Somehow he had access to Babylonian observations or predictions, and used them to create better geometrical models. For the Sun, he used a simple eccentric model, based on observations of the equinoxes, which explained both changes in {{the speed of the}} Sun and differences in the lengths of the seasons. For the Moon, he used a deferent and <b>epicycle</b> model. He could not create accurate models for the remaining planets, and criticized other Greek astronomers for creating inaccurate models.|$|E

25|$|The {{prevailing}} astronomical {{model of}} the cosmos in Europe in the 1,400 {{years leading up to}} the 16th century was that created by the Roman citizen Claudius Ptolemy in his Almagest, dating from about 150 A.D. Throughout the Middle Ages it was spoken of as the authoritative text on astronomy, although its author remained a little understood figure frequently mistaken as one of the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt. The Ptolemaic system drew on many previous theories that viewed Earth as a stationary center of the universe. Stars were embedded in a large outer sphere which rotated relatively rapidly, while the planets dwelt in smaller spheres between—a separate one for each planet. To account for apparent anomalies in this view, such as the apparent retrograde motion of the planets, a system of deferents and epicycles was used. The planet was said to revolve in a small circle (the <b>epicycle)</b> about a center, which itself revolved in a larger circle (the deferent) about a center on or near the Earth.|$|E
500|$|Nicole Oresme (c.1323-1382) {{explained}} {{the motion of}} the spheres in traditional terms of the action of intelligences but noted that, contrary to Aristotle, some intelligences are moved; for example, the intelligence that moves the Moon's <b>epicycle</b> shares {{the motion of the}} lunar orb in which the <b>epicycle</b> is embedded. [...] He related the spheres' motions to the proportion of motive power to resistance that was impressed in each sphere when God created the heavens. [...] In discussing the relation of the moving power of the intelligence, the resistance of the sphere, and the circular velocity, he said [...] "this ratio ought not to be called a ratio of force to resistance except by analogy, because an intelligence moves by will alone... and the heavens do not resist it." ...|$|E
500|$|In his Planetary Hypotheses, Ptolemy (c.90–168) {{rejected}} the Aristotelian {{concept of an}} external prime mover, maintaining instead that the planets have souls and move themselves with a voluntary motion.

500|$|Shen is {{also known}} for his cosmological {{hypotheses}} in explaining the variations of planetary motions, including retrogradation. His colleague Wei Pu realized that the old calculation technique for the mean Sun was inaccurate compared to the apparent Sun, since the latter was ahead {{of it in the}} accelerated phase of motion, and behind it in the retarded phase. Shen's hypotheses were similar to the concept of the <b>epicycle</b> in the Greco-Roman tradition, only Shen compared the side-section of orbital paths of planets and variations of planetary speeds to points in the tips of a willow leaf.
