5|$|Children, ages 11–17, {{volunteer}} to become altar servers {{not only to}} serve the church {{but also because it}} has always been looked upon as an honor. It is a chance for children to serve their priest and become closer to Jesus by being on the altar. In addition, it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for them to try to make themselves more holy and therefore more worthy of the position.|$|E
5|$|In western societies, {{voluntary}} {{blood donation}} is a common, yet less extreme, form of risk taking. Costs {{associated with these}} donations include pain and risk of infection. If blood donation <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to send costly signals, then donors will be perceived by others as generous and physically healthy. In a survey, both donors and non-donors expressed perceptions of the health, generosity, and ability of blood donors to operate in stressful situations.|$|E

5|$|Question Time <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for the British {{public to}} put {{questions}} to politicians of every ideological hue. Politicians from the UK's biggest parties appear most frequently, but {{from time to}} time representatives of parties with many fewer supporters – from the Scottish Socialists and Respect to the Green party – also take their seats on the stage. Question Time is the most prominent programme of its kind on British television, and we carefully study the support gained in elections by each of the parties, large and small, before deciding who to invite and how frequently they should appear. It is a straightforward matter of fact that, with some 6% of the vote and the election of two MEPs in this spring's European elections – and with some success in local elections as well – the BNP has demonstrated a level of support that would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on Question Time. It is for that reason – not for some misguided desire to be controversial, but for that reason alone – that the invitation has been extended.|$|E
25|$|Workers' Memorial Day <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to {{highlight}} the preventable nature of most workplace incidents and ill health and to promote campaigns and union organisation {{in the fight for}} improvements in workplace safety.

25|$|Most {{states will}} have a {{representative}} speaking about issues concerning their country and the hopes {{for the coming year}} as to what the UNGA will do.

25|$|In Greenland more {{reindeer}} {{are harvested}} {{than any other}} big game land mammal species. Reindeer meat is an important staple in most households, and the populace waits with great anticipation for the autumn hunting season to begin.

40|$|The Leave campaigns {{point out}} that quitting the EU would give the UK control over its border and {{immigration}} policy. They are right, says Chris Bickerton. It would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to open Britain’s borders to anyone who wished to work here – not just European citizens. Brexit would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for the UK to decide whether it wants to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> society that <b>is</b> open or hostile to immigration, and draw up its own laws accordingly...|$|R

25|$|Campus Ministry runs several {{different}} retreat programs during the academic year. The Frosh Getaway, offered annually on a September weekend, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for freshmen, led by sophomore leaders, {{to get to}} know their new classmates and to adjust to college life with a fun stress-free weekend. The Retreat on the Rock is designed as a college adaptation of Kairos-style retreats. The Fifth Week Retreat is intended as a follow-up to Kairos, Search, TEC, Retreat on the Rock, or similar style retreats, offering ample time for personal reflection and group discussion. The Busy Persons Retreat, offered annually in the spring, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for spiritual guidance and reflection within the context and schedule demands of daily college life. The SuperNatural Christian's retreat is a six-day backpacking retreat in upper Michigan's Sylvania Wilderness Tract. This retreat is offered biannually along with the Lumberjack Service Retreat, which offers students the chance to travel to Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula (specifically the town of Hancock) and chop wood for elderly residents of the area.|$|E

25|$|Dancers {{at social}} events {{usually have a}} wide range of skill levels, so {{cooperating}} with one's partner matters as much as dancing skill. Dancing with a new partner is a study in flexibility and calibration. What can the new partner do? What are his or her limitations? What does he or she like to do? Dancing with a regular partner <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to play and practice difficult moves, such as aerials (which are dangerous without regular practice).|$|E
25|$|October 2006:Synagogue proposal: Uri Ariel, {{a member}} of the Knesset from the National Union party (a right wing {{opposition}} party) ascended to the mount, and said that he is preparing a plan where a synagogue will be built on the mount. His proposed synagogue would not be built instead of the mosques but in a separate area in accordance with rulings of 'prominent rabbis.' He said he believed that this will be correcting a historical injustice and that it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for the Muslim world to prove that it is tolerant to all faiths.|$|E
25|$|In a {{classroom}} {{there may be}} many different guided instruction groups. Each group may be working on a different skill or at a different level. Fisher's model recommends meeting with groups 1–3 times per week, with some groups meeting more frequently and other stronger groups meeting less often. The size of the groups will also vary {{depending on how much}} face time is required for the particular skill. It is a common misconception that guided instruction is only for struggling students. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for teachers to provide enrichment for strong students. Guided instruction is based on the pedagogical principles of scaffolding.|$|E

25|$|At first, {{observers}} of Kwanzaa avoided {{the mixing of}} the holiday or its symbols, values, and practice with other holidays, as doing so would violate the principle of kujichagulia (self-determination) and thus violate {{the integrity of the}} holiday, which is partially intended as a reclamation of important African values. Today, many African American families celebrate Kwanzaa along with Christmas and New Year's. Frequently, both Christmas trees and kinaras, the traditional candle holder symbolic of African American roots, share space in Kwanzaa-celebrating households. For people who celebrate both holidays, Kwanzaa <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to incorporate elements of their particular ethnic heritage into holiday observances and celebrations of Christmas.|$|E
25|$|The story often {{provides}} much of {{the entertainment}} in the game. Because these games have strong storylines, they can often make effective use of recorded dialog and voiceover narration. Players of these games tend to appreciate long cutscenes more than players of faster action games. While most games advance the plot when the player defeats an enemy or completes a level, role-playing games often progress the plot based on other important decisions. For example, a player may {{make the decision to}} join a guild, thus triggering a progression in the storyline that is usually irreversible. New elements in the story may also be triggered by mere arrival in an area, rather than completing a specific challenge. The plot is usually divided so that each game location <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to reveal a new chapter in the story.|$|E
25|$|This {{election}} {{is the last}} election - presidential, local and general - scheduled in Turkey until 2019. Arguments as to whether this is by chance, {{or whether it was}} planned by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government when they proposed to reduce the parliamentary terms from five years to four in the 2007 constitutional referendum, are still ongoing. Speculation as to what the AKP government will do during four years of electorally unchecked power should they win generated both favourable predictions and concerns. While four years without elections may allow the government to undertake widespread necessary economic reforms, critics of the AKP argue that it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to further erode the diminishing checks and balances and separation of powers in the Turkish political and legal systems. The AKP also support a presidential system, which would give greater powers to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.|$|E
