Forests that are managed separately, such as Allegheny National Forest and Monongahela National Forest, are listed as separate forests. But forests that are managed together {{may or may not}} be listed separately. Forests managed together and with hyphenated names, such as Salmon-Challis National Forest, are considered to be a single National Forest. Forests that are managed together under titles such as Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests, are considered to be separate forests. National Forests listed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>column</b> in small text are constituent National Forests managed by, but not included in the name of, the named National Forest in normal text. If you are counting to reach 154 National Forests, count hyphenated names as two forests, with the exception of Manti-La Sal, which is the official name of one forest. Uinta-Wasatch-Cache is counted as three and George Washington and Jefferson is counted as two.|$|E

The remaining 368 Portuguese, with a few Lascarins, formed themselves into three equal columns. D. Gastão Coutinho led the first column as a vanguard. With the second column came Empress Dona Catarina, mounted on an elephant, and the Captain-General’s small son, Diogo Lopes de Sousa.

500|$|Not all reviews were so positive. The Dallas Morning News writer Ed Bark called Williams' a [...] "sometimes overly {{transparent}} {{effort to}} underscore the grief of the victims' survivors", and said the episode [...] "works overtime" [...] {{to make the world}} seem like a [...] "bleak and scary place". Bark also said the show made itself a [...] "target for charges of racism" [...] by making the three murderers black, but also credited the script with making one of the perpetrators so sympathetic. Tom Shales of The Washington Post said the writers [...] "try a little too hard" [...] to create sympathy for the three murder suspects, and the episode suffers due to the absence of actor Andre Braugher, who plays Detective Frank Pembleton. But Shales also praised Williams' performance and said the episode was particularly powerful because the actual violence is off-screen. Buzz McCain, columnist with The Washington Times, called the episode [...] "irritating" [...] and [...] "as pointless as the killing". He particularly criticized the script, which he said was clichéd and overly [...] "misty-eyed", particularly the extended moments of Williams talking about the shooting. In a later article, McCain said, [...] "Nothing I've written <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>column</b> generated as much visceral response as my nine paragraphs about ("Bop Gun")." [...] In addition to responses from angry fans, McCain received a call from David Mills, who McCain said [...] "simply wanted some insight as to what specifically I didn't like about his show and how the writers might improve on the next one." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{writer in}} the Yorkshire Evening Post is very angry indeed with my {{performances}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>column.</b> His precise terms of reproach are, [...] "Mr. G. K. Chesterton is not a humourist: not even a Cockney humourist." [...] I do not mind his saying that I am not a humourist--in which (to tell the truth) I think he is quite right. But I do resent his saying that I am not a Cockney. That envenomed arrow, I admit, went home. If a French writer said of me, [...] "He is no metaphysician: not even an English metaphysician," [...] I could swallow the insult to my metaphysics, but I should feel angry about the insult to my country. So I do not urge that I am a humourist; but I do insist that I am a Cockney. If I were a humourist, I should certainly be a Cockney humourist; if I were a saint, I should certainly be a Cockney saint. I need not recite the splendid catalogue of Cockney saints who have written their names on our noble old City churches. I need not trouble you with {{the long list of}} the Cockney humourists who have discharged their bills (or failed to discharge them) in our noble old City taverns. We can weep together over the pathos of the poor Yorkshireman, whose county has never produced some humour not intelligible {{to the rest of the}} world. And we can smile together when he says that somebody or other is [...] "not even" [...] a Cockney humourist like Samuel Johnson or Charles Lamb. It is surely sufficiently obvious that all the best humour that exists in our language is Cockney humour. Chaucer was a Cockney; he had his house close to the Abbey. Dickens was a Cockney; he said he could not think without the London streets. The London taverns heard always the quaintest conversation, whether it was Ben Johnson's at the Mermaid or Sam Johnson's at the Cock. Even in our own time it may be noted that the most vital and genuine humour is still written about London. Of this type is the mild and humane irony which marks Mr. Pett Ridge's studies of the small grey streets. Of this type is the simple but smashing laughter of the best tales of Mr. W. W. Jacobs, telling of the smoke and sparkle of the Thames. No; I concede that I am not a Cockney humourist. No; I am not worthy to be. Some time, after sad and strenuous after-lives; some time, after fierce and apocalyptic incarnations; in some strange world beyond the stars, I may become at last a Cockney humourist. In that potential paradise I may walk among the Cockney humourists, if not an equal, at least a companion. I may feel for a moment on my shoulder the hearty hand of Dryden and thread the labyrinths of the sweet insanity of Lamb. But that could only be if I were not only much cleverer, but much better than I am. Before I reach that sphere I shall have left behind, perhaps, the sphere that is inhabited by angels, and even passed that which is appropriated exclusively to the use of Yorkshiremen.|$|E
