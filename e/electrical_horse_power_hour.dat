5000|$|Primary flight {{training}} in PT-17 (220 <b>horse</b> <b>power)</b> Stearman Biplanes {{took place at}} Moton Field,in Tuskegee, Alabama. Charles “Chief” Anderson was the instructor for all black pilots. Rodgers flew the PT-17 65 hours. Pilot trainees then returned to Tuskegee Army Air Field and closer military scrutiny, while they flew the Vultee BT-13A (450 <b>horse</b> <b>power)</b> for 80 <b>hours</b> in what was called basic training. The PT-17 had more power and was easy to land, but the new training challenged the pilots in other ways, such as acrobatics and navigation. The advanced phase {{for the next two}} months included the AT-6 (550 horse-power), which was much harder to land but easy to ground loop. Upon completion of his training in February, 1944, Rodgers earned the coveted [...] "Silver Wings' badge of an air force pilot [...] In a biography prepared by Commemorative Air Force for its Red Tail project, he said [...] "I made it, somehow, and was very proud. It was a segregated program. All the instructors in Basic and Advanced Training were white, but most were fair and conscientious. A few should have been somewhere else. [...] " ...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays,air {{pollution}} {{has become}} a major concern. Typically construction equipment {{plays a major role in}} emitting a huge amount of pollutants. In order to address this issue, there is a need to measure the level ofuncertainty for decision making of air quality modeling and emission inventories' This paper aims to propose a methodology for quantifuing uncertainty of emission rates of heavyduty diesel (IIDD) consffuction equipment. The objective of this paper is to quantifu the variability and uncertainty of emission rates of HDD construction equipment for three different pollutants (NO*, CO, and HC). The study conducts its study based on 17 backhoes obtained from the City of Stillwater's fleet management database. <b>Horse</b> <b>power</b> (IIP), cumulative <b>hours,</b> activity factor, and emission factors at steadystate condition are assigned as uncertain variables. Monte Carlo simulation was used to model the distributions of the uncertain variables by randomly selecting input values to produce a wide range of output using cumulative distribution functions. A sensitivity analysis was also performed in order to determine which variables that have the greatest impact on the total emission rates...|$|R

5000|$|The {{commercial}} Hugon engine {{appeared in}} 1865, and in appearance much resembled the Lenoir engine, but with flame ignition and water spray injection into the cylinder {{to control the}} temperatures. It was manufactured in England by Fred B. Vallance at the Alicel Works, Bridge Street, Greenwich.

50|$|The {{need for}} more power comes from {{necessity}} and desire when driving in steep sand dunes. This has driven sandrail engine builders to add performance features to engines such as the stock (24 to 50 <b>horse</b> <b>power)</b> Volkswagen engine. These include: larger pistons, turbochargers, dual racing carburetors, fuel injection, and high performance cylinder heads. Some performance engines can run on premium unleaded gasoline. However, many high performance engines must use racing fuel or fuel additives. A high performance sandrail Volkswagen engine can produce well into the 170-200+ <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> range and as high as 700 <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> with methanol fuel.|$|R

5000|$|The 1841 act of {{parliament}} authorized the building of an engine to drain Bourne North Fen, replacing engines (probably windmills), erected after an act of 1776, which were described as [...] "dilapidated, decayed and entirely removed". The act of 1843 transferred all responsibility for this engine and the drainage from the Black sluice commissioners to the Bourne North Fen Commissioners, [...] a separation of responsibilities that continued until after the Second World War. [...] The machinery for lifting the water off the fen is situated {{on the side of}} the Forty-Foot drain at Gutheram Cote, and was erected by the Butterly Iron Company. It consists of a condensing beam engine of 30 N.H.P, the boiler pressure being originally 6lbs., but now increased to 9lbs. The cylinder is 45 inches in diameter and the stroke 6 ft. The engine works an iron scoopwheel, 15ft. in diameter, and 4ft. 3in. wide, having 30 scoops, their length being 3ft. 10in. The dip is regulated by a vertical shuttle placed near the wheel, and the dip allowed being about 2ft. The maximum lift is 4ft., the head and dip being 6ft. The engines are stopped when this lift is attained, as the water is then level with the gauge fixed under the clause in the Act. The wheel makes 4.5 revolutions a minute and the engine 19. With a full head, 2.5 tons of coal are consumed in 24 hours. This gives a coal consumption of 200.37 lbs. per <b>horse</b> <b>power,</b> per <b>hour,</b> of water actually lifted, which is very extravagant, modern engines and centrifugal pumps running with a consumption of 4.5lbs. per hour whilst the maximum allowed by the Dutch authorities is 6.60lbs.The area of land drained is about 4,000 acres, but only 3,500 acres are liable to taxation.The level of the Fen varies from 4ft. to 6ft. above the Ordnance datum, or from 12ft. to 13ft. above the sill of the Black Sluice which is 20 miles distant. Wheeler, W. H. The book goes on to describe how proposals for a replacement engine were made in 1881, but were not taken up before Wheeler went to press.|$|R
