5|$|Although in his preface, Barker cites {{his primary}} source of {{inspiration}} as John Smith's The Generall Historie of Virginia (1624), he was likely more influenced {{by a series of}} popular books by John Davis, including, Travels of Four Years and a <b>Half</b> <b>in</b> the United States of America (1803), Captain Smith and Princess Pocahontas (1805), and The First Settlers of Virginia (1806) which featured a more sexualized and romanticized characterization of Pocahontas.|$|E

5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} {{cross-country}} skiing in 1952, 1960, 1968, 1980 to 1998, and since 2006. The two Australian representatives in 1952 occupied {{the last two}} places, and before 1984, no Australian finished above the bottom 15% of racers. Results have slowly improved, but most Australian entrants {{in the last two}} decades have placed in the bottom 25%. In 1992, Anthony Evans became the first Australian to place in the top half, finishing in the top 40 in two events. Australia fielded three competitors in cross-country skiing in 2006, its largest contingent in the event. Paul Murray and Esther Bottomley competed in the sprint; Clare-Louise Brumley was selected for the pursuit and 30km freestyle, but competed only in the former due to illness. Nobody broke into the top <b>half</b> <b>in</b> their respective races. At the 2010 Games, Australia had three representatives. Ben Sim came in the top <b>half</b> <b>in</b> one event, but he, Bottomley and Murray finished in the bottom 20% in their remaining four events. Australia has never competed in ski jumping, and their sole entry in Nordic combined was by Hal Nerdal in 1960, who came last.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend half their time on land and <b>half</b> <b>in</b> the ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating and hunt in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating and hunt in deeper water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males are smaller, they crawl and swim faster than females.|$|E

5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} latitude the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses the Andes. At this latitude, {{half of the}} precipitation falls in summer and the other <b>half</b> <b>in</b> winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This {{is the reason why}} the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E
5|$|Contrasted {{with the}} flourishing {{state of trade}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century is the rapid and {{sustained}} decline during the second <b>half.</b> <b>In</b> the period of 40 years from 1841 to 1881, the population fell from 2836 to 1192, a loss of over 57%. By the end of the century, all that remained of the major industries of the town was the malthouse of F.A. Waller & Co., while all smaller industries had vanished completely.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a lack}} {{of space}} at the University of Chicago, Spedding {{proposed}} to organize part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa State College, where he had colleagues who were willing to help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and <b>half</b> <b>in</b> Chicago. The intention was that staff at Ames would eventually move to Chicago when space became available, but this never happened. The success of the Ames Project ensured that it became a separate laboratory within the Manhattan Project.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{kept his}} {{pledge not to}} run for re-election, retired {{to his home in}} Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom said his greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had set in after Abraham Lincoln's death. Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end of the bottom <b>half</b> <b>in</b> historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|Hispanic men {{and women}} have reached the top ranks of the Coast Guard, serving their country in {{sensitive}} leadership positions on domestic and foreign shores.

Rábago was the first Hispanic-American promoted to Rear Admiral (lower <b>half).</b> <b>In</b> 2009, Rear Admiral Joseph R.

Hispanics currently account for 11% of the enlisted personnel, and 9% of the United States Coast Guard Academy's student body.|$|E
5|$|In 1153 or 1154, Chesney was the {{recipient}} of the lordship of a hundred and a <b>half</b> <b>in</b> Norfolk, possibly in compensation for the loss of the manor of Mileham.

5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the <b>half</b> <b>in</b> which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.|$|E
