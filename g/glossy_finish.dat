5|$|Since medieval times, dubbin, a waxy product, {{was used}} to soften and {{waterproof}} leather; however, it did not impart shine. It was made from natural wax, oil, soda ash and tallow. As leather with a high natural veneer became popular in the 18th century, a high <b>glossy</b> <b>finish</b> became important, particularly on shoes and boots. In most cases, a variety of homemade polishes were used to provide this finish, often with lanolin or beeswax as a base.|$|E
5|$|The spire is a {{protruding}} part of {{the shell}} that includes all of the whorls except the largest and final whorl (known as the body whorl). It is usually more elongated than in other strombid snails, such as the closely related and larger goliath conch, Lobatus goliath that is endemic to Brazil. In L.gigas, the <b>glossy</b> <b>finish</b> or glaze around the aperture of the adult shell is primarily in pale shades of pink. It may show a cream, peach or yellow colouration, {{but it can also}} sometimes be tinged with a deep magenta, shading almost to red. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost {{part of the}} shell surface, is thin and a pale brown or tan colour.|$|E

25|$|Magna, {{a special}} artist use acrylic paint was {{developed}} by Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden in 1947 and reformulated in 1960, specifically for Morris Louis and other stain painters of the color field movement. In Magna pigments are ground in an acrylic resin with alcohol-based solvents. Unlike modern water-based acrylics, Magna is miscible with turpentine or mineral spirits and dries rapidly to a matte or <b>glossy</b> <b>finish.</b> It was used extensively by Morris Louis, and Friedel Dzubas and also by Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. Magna colors are more vivid and intense than regular acrylic water-based paints. Louis used Magna to great effect in his Stripe Series, where the colors are used undiluted and are poured unmixed directly from the can.|$|E
25|$|Pottery {{produced}} by the Caddoan Mississippian culture {{is some of the}} finest known in North America. It is usually found in the areas of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma. About 1200 CE as the Caddoan culture emerged from local woodland cultures such as Fourche Maline, a distinctive pottery tradition emerged, unmistakable because of its designs, materials and fine execution. These early pots were often grog tempered, although sometimes finely ground bone was used. Two main forms emerged that would become Caddoan pottery standards for the next 1000 years, a long slender necked bottle and a carinated form of bottles and bowls. Caddo pottery is considered to be some of the finest Mississippian pottery because of its thinness, symmetry, and very smooth finish, with some of its best examples being bottle forms with extensive geometric engravings. Pieces are often dark brown and black with a <b>glossy</b> <b>finish</b> achieved by the application of a fine slip made from a mixture of sifted fine clay or paint and buffed to a high finish. The first Europeans to encounter Caddoan pottery were members of the Hernando de Soto Expedition in 1541, who described it as matching even the finest potters of their European homeland.|$|E

500|$|During the MacWorld Expo keynote on January 6, 2009, Phil Schiller {{announced}} a 17-inch MacBook Pro with unibody construction. This version diverged from its 15-inch sibling with an anti-glare [...] "matte" [...] screen option (with the <b>glossy</b> <b>finish</b> standard) and a non user-removable lithium polymer battery. Instead of traditional round cells inside the casing, the lithium-ion polymer batteries are shaped and fitted into each laptop to maximally utilize space. Adaptive charging, {{which uses a}} chip to optimize the charge flow to reduce wear and tear, extends the battery's overall life. Battery life for the 17" [...] version is quoted at eight hours, with 80percent of this charge remaining after 1,000 charge-discharge cycles.|$|E
500|$|At E3 2010, Microsoft {{revealed}} a new US$299.99 Xbox 360 SKU known officially as the Xbox 360 S {{and referred to}} as the [...] "Slim" [...] by various media outlets. It replaced the Elite and comes with an integrated 802.11n WLAN adapter, integrated TOSLINK port, 5 USB ports and a 250GB HDD. It also does not require an additional power supply to make use of Microsoft Kinect motion control accessory. A US$199.99 version was released on August 3, 2010 in the US which replaced the Arcade model. It has 4GB and a 250GB model of internal memory, it has a matte or <b>glossy</b> <b>finish</b> and it comes with a headset. At E3 2013 Microsoft revealed the Xbox 360 E, the final iteration of the Xbox 360 series, to be succeeded by Xbox One. The Xbox 360 E was originally priced at US$199.99 for a 4GB model, and US$299.99 for the 250GB model. The 360 E featured a new square design with a simplified exterior akin to the Xbox One.|$|E
2500|$|Reportedly costing A$1million, the radically {{different}} Series II model of April 1992 primarily benefitted from a higher capacity 6-cylinder engine (up 35cubic centimetres or from 3949cc to 3984cc), bringing its nominal total swept capacity to 4.0-litres. The transmission and electronics were also improved and, externally, styling changes abounded including the base model now having body-coloured bumpers and its matte black plastic exterior door handles in a <b>glossy</b> <b>finish.</b> Other {{aspects of this}} upgrade consisted of improvements in safety, electronics and overall refinement. For example: the car now featured an advanced [...] "Smartlock" [...] security locking system standard across all models; anti-lock brakes became optional; a lap sash centre rear seatbelt became standard (from 1993); foam-filled A-pillars helped deliver better crash protection and Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) reductions.|$|E
50|$|Buddhism, the {{dominant}} {{religion of the}} time in Korea, increased the demand for celadon-glazed wares (cheongja), causing cheongja celadon to evolve very quickly, with more organic shapes and decorations, such as animal and bird motifs. When making cheongja wares, a small amount of iron powder was added to the refined clay, which was then coated with a glaze and an additional small amount of iron powder, and then finally fired. This allowed the glaze to be more durable, with a shinier and <b>glossier</b> <b>finish</b> than white wares.|$|R

5000|$|Solido {{was known}} for {{realistic}} details that generally rejected the blatant commercialism of other toy companies. For example, Corgi and Dinky used flashy, but inauthentic [...] "jewels" [...] for head and tail lights while Solido distinguished itself by prudently using clear plastics for enhanced realism. If Solido had a weakness, {{it may have been}} in paint. At times colors seemed odd (like the bright green for the 1961 Thunderbird) and paint application was often thin and rather grainy (Rixon referred to it as [...] "slightly hammered"; Rixon 2005,83). By comparison, Bburago or Eligor Models had rich paint jobs with smooth and <b>glossy</b> <b>finishes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Martin {{learned to}} do many things. In {{the course of the}} first week, in one afternoon, he and Joe {{accounted}} for the two hundred white shirts. Joe ran the tiler, a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked on a steel string which furnished the pressure. By this means he ironed the yoke, wristbands, and neckband, setting the latter at right angles to the shirt, and put the <b>glossy</b> <b>finish</b> on the bosom. As fast as he finished them, he flung the shirts on a rack between him and Martin, who caught them up and [...] "backed" [...] them. This task consisted of ironing all the unstarched portions of the shirts.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} characteristic of porcelain enamel, from an industrial perspective, is its resistance to corrosion. Mild steel {{is used in}} almost every industry and a huge array of products; porcelain enamel is a very economic way of protecting this, and other chemically vulnerable materials, from corrosion. It can also produce very smooth, <b>glossy</b> <b>finishes</b> in {{a wide array of}} colours; these colours will not fade on exposure to UV light, as paint will. Being a fired ceramic, porcelain enamel is also highly heat-resistant; this allows it to be used in high-temperature applications where an organic anti-corrosion coating or galvanization may be impractical or even dangerous (see Metal fume fever).|$|R
50|$|Whilst Foster and Partners, Ateliers Jean Nouvel and PTW Architects {{worked in}} {{collaboration}} {{to form the}} basis of the One Central Park architectural team, two interior architects were separately utilised for the east and west towers. Koichi Takada was commissioned with designing the east tower of One Central Park. He gave the apartments an organic feel that blended the outside foliage and gardens with the wooden interiors. William Smart of Smart Design Studios was appointed to style the west tower. Smart's designs, based on the idea of luxury that comes from high-end sports cars and motor yachts, used sophisticated curves and <b>glossy</b> <b>finishes</b> in the apartments in the west tower.|$|R

The Horsfield’s bronze cuckoo chose females that would choose similar breeding sites to previous years and were likely to raise several broods in one season. Generally the superb fairy wren will not reject the cuckoo's egg, fairy wrens make oval dome nests that can be dark inside, meaning it is harder for the fairy wren to distinguish between their own egg and the host’s egg, furthermore the mimicry in eggs from the Horsfield’s bronze cuckoo have evolved over time and are hard to distinguish besides their slight elongation and <b>glossier</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|R

50|$|In paint technology, the sheen is the {{glossiness}} of a paint <b>finish.</b> <b>Glossy</b> {{and flat}} (or matte) are typical extreme levels of glossiness of a <b>finish.</b> <b>Glossy</b> paints are shiny and reflect most {{light in the}} specular (mirror-like) direction, while on flat paints most of the light diffuses {{in a range of}} angles.
