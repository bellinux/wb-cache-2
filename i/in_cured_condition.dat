40|$|An {{innovative}} type {{of connections}} for glass components, called laminated connections, has been developed in the last years. Two materials {{have been used for}} laminated connections: the transparent ionomer SentryGlas® (SG) from Kuraray (former Dupont) and the Transparent Structural Silicon Adhesive (TSSA) from Dow Corning. In this paper, the mechanical behaviour of SG and TSSA bulk materials is studied under uniaxial tensile stress condition. The effects of strain rate and temperature variations are investigated. Particular attention is paid (i) to the study of these polymers <b>in</b> <b>cured</b> <b>condition</b> and (ii) to the computation of true stress and strain field during the tests. Firstly, it is observed that the mechanical behaviour of both SG and TSSA are temperature and strain rate dependent. These effects are quantitatively determined in the paper. Secondly, two additional phenomena are observed. For TSSA, it is observed that the material goes from fully transparent to white colour, exhibiting the so-called whitening phenomenon. For SG, instead, it is observed that the strain field distribution is dependent on the temperature. More specifically, the material exhibits a non-uniform strain field distribution due to the occurring of the necking phenomenon. Measurements along the specimens, using Digital Image Correlation techniques, showed that the localized strain propagates over the full specimen length, resulting in a cold-drawing phenomenon. Finally, it is also shown that engineering and true stress–strain definition exhibits large deviation indicating that the finite deformation theory should be used for the computation of the stress–strain curves to be implemented in numerical modelling.

This paper presents the findings of a preliminary investigation carried out on the performance of industrial waste incineration bottom ash as CLSM. CLSM mixes were designed using industrial waste incineration bottom ash, and cement. Tests for density, setting time, bleed, and compressive strength on cubes under various <b>curing</b> <b>conditions,</b> corrosivity, and leaching of heavy metals and salts were carried out on the CLSM mixtures, and the results discussed. Compressive strength for the designed CLSM mixtures ranged from 0. 1 to 1. 7 MPa. It is shown that the variations <b>in</b> <b>curing</b> <b>conditions</b> have less influence on the compressive strength of CLSM at high values of water to cement ratio (w/c), but low values of w/c influences the strength of CLSM. The CLSM produced does not exhibit corrosive characters as evidenced by pH. Leaching of heavy metals and salts is higher in bleed than in leachate collected from hardened CLSM. Cement reduces the leaching of Boron in bleed. It is concluded that there is good potential for the use of industrial waste incineration bottom ash in CLSM. Â© 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Heat curing {{processes}} {{are often used}} to ensure the production rate in industrial plants that fabricate precast concrete structures like Uniblok-Ormazabal. Heat curing may influence both the microstructural properties and the durability parameters of the reinforced concrete; thus, {{it is necessary to}} take into account these influences {{in the design of the}} concrete when a given performance has to be achieved. This paper deals with the evaluation of the influence of the heat curing process on several concrete parameters. Four different types of samples, made of identical concrete composition, have been evaluated: - Concrete directly cast at the plant and stored <b>in</b> standard <b>curing</b> <b>conditions.</b> - Concrete made in the laboratory and stored <b>in</b> standard <b>curing</b> <b>conditions.</b> - Concretes cores extracted from a precast structure made in plant, after the heat curing process. - Concrete made in the laboratory, submitted to a heat curing process that reproduced the one carried out in the plant. The parameters evaluated in the four sample types were: mechanical properties, porosity, capillary suction coefficient, microstructure (using Back Scattered Electron Microscopy), and resistance against carbonation and against chloride penetration. The obtained results show that the heat curing process can be well reproduced in a laboratory scale giving a concrete with the same properties than those obtained in the concrete fabricated in the plant production rate. Regarding the results obtained in the concrete properties evaluated, first of all it must be said that the concrete mix studied showed a very good performance, exceeding the requirements defined for this type of concrete. Moreover, when comparing the obtained results with several durability indicators found in the literature, the concrete mix studied can be defined as a high durability material. With regard to the influence of the heat curing on the concrete properties, it can be said that this process modifies the properties of the material and decreases the quality as compared to the concrete <b>cured</b> <b>in</b> standard <b>conditions.</b> However, once these changes are quantified, they can be compensated for in the mix design process and the resulting product can be compliant with the performance-based specifications.

In large projects, stringent quality control procedures are usually followed {{under the supervision}} of experienced engineers and skilled labors. However, in the case of small projects and particularly at distant locations from major cities, proper quality control is often an issue. It has been found from experience that such quality related issues mainly arise from inappropriate proportioning of concrete mixes and improper <b>curing</b> <b>conditions.</b> <b>In</b> most cases external curing method is followed which requires supply of adequate quantity of water along with proper protection against evaporation.

40|$|Abstract. Cement {{hydration}} at {{early age}} is sometimes {{in a certain}} thermal environment probably caused by hydration heat of mass concrete as well as cement productions curing at high temperature. And phases composition and strength development in thermal environment are commonly different from those <b>in</b> normal <b>curing</b> <b>conditions.</b> Phases composition and strength development of concrete containing different fly ash content <b>curing</b> <b>in</b> different thermal environment are studied in this paper. Experimental results show that compressive strengths of concrete with 0. 3 {{water to binder ratio}} increase with the increase of curing temperature. Splitting tensile strength of concrete not containing any fly ash curing at about 50 is the highest among those curing at temperature between 40 and 80. For concrete with different fly ash content, splitting tensile strengths increase approximately with the increse of curing temperature. Dehydration of ettringite and formation of monosulfate solid solution and AFm at higher temperature perhaps relate to the development of concrete splitting tensile strength along with different curing temperature. Adding fly ash to binder, curing temperature at which hydration phases change occurs is raised, which helps to explain that splitting tensile strengths of concrete with different fly ash content decrease little with the increase of curing temperature between 60 and 80...|$|R

Finally, the mitigation method of alkali-silica reaction by using fly ash or glass powder was discussed...|$|R
40|$|Many {{underground}} concrete structures {{suffer from}} issues of concrete cracking due to shrinkage during hydration, which furthermore results in water leakage. In {{order to improve}} the anti-crack ability of concrete, expansive agents were used to compensate for concrete shrinkage. This paper investigates enhancing the behavior of large volume underground concrete structures with expansive agents. Field measurements of strain and laboratory specimen tests were conducted. The results of concrete specimen <b>in</b> laboratory <b>curing</b> <b>condition</b> indicate that the restrained expansion ratio of concrete with expansive agents rapidly increases within the first 3 days. Restrained expansion ratio reaches the peak value after 14 days and then decreases with the elapsed time. The restrained expansion ratio was found to maintain a value of approximately 0. 030 % after 28 days. The developing trend of restrained expansion ratio of the field cured specimen {{was found to be}} similar as that of the specimen <b>cured</b> <b>in</b> laboratory. However, the peak value and average value of restrained expansion ratio of the field cured specimen was found to be smaller than those of the laboratory cured specimen. The field test results indicate that the post-poured strips and post-poured expansive reinforcing band with expansive agents can effectively increase the expansive strain of concrete, which furthermore indicates that expansive agents can enhance the crack prevention behavior of concrete structure in the field...|$|R
