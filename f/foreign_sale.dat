Between 1938 and 1940, the VVKJ obtained 24 Hurricane Mk I's from early production batches, marking the first <b>foreign</b> <b>sale</b> of the aircraft. Twenty additional aircraft were built by Zmaj under licence in Yugoslavia. When {{the country was}} drawn into World War II by the German-led Axis invasion of April 1941, a total of 41 Hurricane Mk I's were in service as fighters.

60|$|It is evident, that if {{trade and}} foreign {{commerce}} {{were held in}} great honour in China, from the plenty of labourers, and the cheapness of labour, she might work up manufactures for <b>foreign</b> <b>sale</b> to an immense amount. It is equally evident that from the great bulk of provisions and the amazing extent of her inland territory she could not in return import such a quantity as would be any sensible addition to the annual stock of subsistence in the country. Her immense amount of manufactures, therefore, she would exchange, chiefly, for luxuries collected {{from all parts of}} the world. At present, it appears, that no labour whatever is spared in the production of food. The country is rather over-people in proportion to what its stock can employ, and labour is, therefore, so abundant, that no pains are taken to abridge it. The consequence of this is, probably, the greatest production of food that the soil can possibly afford, for it will be generally observed, that processes for abridging labour, though they may enable a farmer to bring a certain quantity of grain cheaper to market, tend rather to diminish than increase the whole produce; and in agriculture, therefore, may, in some respects, be considered rather as private than public advantages.|$|E

60|$|But {{to clear}} up my ideas on this subject,--a revenue from America {{transmitted}} hither. Do not delude yourselves: you can never receive it,--no, not a shilling. We have experience that from remote countries {{it is not to}} be expected. If, when you attempted to extract revenue from Bengal, you were obliged to return in loan what you had taken in imposition, what can you expect from North America? For, certainly, {{if ever there was a}} country qualified to produce wealth, it is India; or an institution fit for the transmission, it is the East India Company. America has none of these aptitudes. If America gives you taxable objects on which you lay your duties here, and gives you at the same time a surplus by a <b>foreign</b> <b>sale</b> of her commodities to pay the duties on these objects which you tax at home, she has performed her part to the British revenue. But with regard to her own internal establishments, she may, I doubt not she will, contribute in moderation. I say in moderation; for she ought not to be permitted to exhaust herself. She ought to be reserved to a war; the weight of which, with the enemies that we are most likely to have, must be considerable in her quarter of the globe. There she may serve you, and serve you essentially.|$|E

50|$|In its amicus curiae brief, the US Government {{argued that}} Mallinckrodt had been wrongly decided in 1992 {{and in any}} case it had been {{overruled}} sub silentio in Quanta. It stated:In the view of the United States, the first authorized sale of a patented article in the United States wholly exhausts the patentee’s exclusive rights in that article, notwithstanding any post-sale restriction imposed by the patentee.The government also argued that the decision of Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States International Trade Commission (2001) should be partially overruled in light of Kirtsaeng insofar as it held that foreign sales can never exhaust US patent rights. When the patentee neither makes nor authorizes a <b>foreign</b> <b>sale,</b> as occurred in Boesch v. Graff, it is proper to say no exhaustion occurred. But when the patentee makes or authorizes a <b>foreign</b> <b>sale,</b> and fails expressly to reserve its US rights, then exhaustion should be found. In the present case, Lexmark made the foreign sales and failed to expressly reserve its US rights; therefore, the sale exhausted the patent rights.|$|E
