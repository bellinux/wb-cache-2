5|$|As <b>is</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> apeomyines, Apeomyoides {{was a large}} eomyid with high-crowned cheekteeth and a large {{gap between}} the incisors and cheekteeth.

Other features distinguish Apeomyoides from other apeomyines, including the rectangular shape of the cheekteeth. The fourth lower premolar (p4) {{is larger than the}} molars behind it and has two roots, while the lower molars have three.|$|E

The femora (third segments) of the back pair of legs are greatly enlarged for jumping. The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs are armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which <b>is</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> each species. The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.|$|E
5|$|Named in 1976 by Sergei Kurzanov, Alioramus {{is another}} genus of tyrannosaurid from {{slightly}} older sediments in Mongolia. Several analyses have concluded Alioramus was quite {{closely related to}} Tarbosaurus.

This led Currie to speculate that Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but {{he noted that the}} much higher tooth count and row of crests on top of the snout suggested otherwise.|$|E

A band of double triangles runs around the sculpture with a carved cord or rope and may symbolise the bat's wings.|$|E
5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον <b>is</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E

5|$|As <b>is</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> Sigmodontinae, Oryzomys couesi has {{a complex}} penis, with the baculum (penis bone) ending in three {{cartilaginous}} digits at its tip.

The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the penis is covered with small spines, a character Oryzomys couesi shares only with Oligoryzomys and the marsh rice rat among oryzomyines examined. On the urethral process, located in the crater {{at the end of the}} penis, a fleshy process (the subapical lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except the marsh rice rat and Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E

5|$|As {{the home}} country of {{beetroot}} borscht, Ukraine boasts great {{diversity of the}} soup's regional variants, with virtually every province having its own recipe. Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used (meat, bone, or both), the kind of meat (beef, pork, poultry, etc.), the choice of vegetables and the method of cutting and cooking them. For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, chicken, duck or goose. The use of zucchini, beans and apples <b>is</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> the Chernihiv borscht; in this variant, beetroots are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard, and the sour taste comes solely from tomatoes and tart apples. The Lviv borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of Vienna sausages.|$|E
