500|$|The {{day after}} the game, Vézina was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and advised to return home. He made a last trip into the Canadiens' dressing room on [...] to say a final goodbye to his teammates. Dandurand would later describe Vézina as sitting in his corner of the dressing room with [...] "tears rolling <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks.</b> He was looking at his old pads and skates that Eddie Dufour [...] had arranged in Georges' corner. Then, he asked one little favour—the sweater he had worn in the last world series." [...] Vézina returned to his hometown of Chicoutimi with his wife Marie, where {{he died in the}} early hours on Saturday, March 27, 1926, at l'Hôtel-Dieu hospital. Though he played only one period for the Canadiens during the entire season, the team honoured his entire $6,000 salary, a testament to how important Vézina had been to the team.|$|E
500|$|They {{passed a}} week that saw no action in Cambridge and Bury St Edmunds, hearing on 20 July that the Council in London had {{declared}} for Mary. Staying at Cambridge, Northumberland himself proclaimed Mary Tudor as queen at the market place. Warwick was {{with him as he}} threw up his cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears ran <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> for grief." [...] The city that had welcomed the Duke splendidly was nervous to please the new queen. A large group of townsmen and university scholars surrounded King's College to arrest the Duke, who was with his son lodged on the premises. In contrast to his father, Warwick resisted arrest. A letter from the Council arrived that everyman could go his way, so the Duke asked to be set free, [...] "and so continued they all night [...] ". At dawn the Earl of Warwick [...] "was booted ready to have ridden in the morning", and escape. It was too late, however, as the Earl of Arundel arrived to again arrest the Duke and his entourage. The prisoners returned riding side by side through London, the guards having difficulties protecting them against the hostile populace.|$|E
500|$|Supported by gentry and nobility in East Anglia and the Thames Valley, Mary's {{military}} {{camp was}} gathering strength daily and, through luck, came into possession of powerful artillery from the royal navy. In the circumstances the Duke deemed fighting a campaign hopeless. The army proceeded from Cambridge to Bury St Edmunds and retreated again to Cambridge. On 20 July {{a letter from}} the Council in London arrived, declaring that they had proclaimed Queen Mary and commanding Northumberland to disband the army and await events. Dudley did not contemplate resistance. He explained to his fellow-commanders that they had acted on the Council's orders all the time and that he did not now wish [...] "to combat the Council's decisions, supposing that they have been moved by good reasons ... and I beg your lordships to do the same." [...] Proclaiming Mary Tudor at the market place, he threw up his cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears ran <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> for grief." [...] The next morning the Earl of Arundel arrived to arrest him. A week earlier Arundel had assured Northumberland of his wish to spill his blood even at the Duke's feet; now Dudley went down on his knees as soon as he caught sight of him.|$|E
60|$|The weak smile {{which had}} seemed pinned on Gerald's face vanished. A tear rolled <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek.</b> <b>His</b> {{intoxication}} {{had reached the}} maudlin stage.|$|R

60|$|She laughed, and, {{making a}} small, moaning noise, as if of weariness and helplessness, she sank {{her head on}} his chest. He put <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> against hers.|$|R
2500|$|The Michigan Stadium crowd, sensing a major upset, began {{screaming}} and chanting. Michigan {{tried to run}} down the clock, but Ohio State stalled with timeouts and got the ball back after a Wolverine punt. With 29 seconds left, Maciejowski fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by Cecil Pryor. The Buckeyes had committed an unheard-of seven turnovers on the day, six interceptions and a fumble. Moorhead took a knee as the crowd counted down the final seconds, then rushed the field in ecstasy. ABC-TV play-by-play announcer Bill Flemming exclaimed, [...] "There it is! What {{has to be the}} upset of the century!" [...] Schembechler was carried off on players' shoulders (he was accidentally dropped, but Bo noted [...] "it was the only thing [...] fumbled all day."), and Jim Mandich was seen being carried, with tears of joy streaming <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After Goforth’s {{address the}} first morning an elder stood up before all the people and confessed to having embezzled church funds. The effect on the hearers was “instantaneous”. One person gave a [...] “piercing cry” then many, now in tears, began {{spontaneous}} prayer and confession. For three days these incidents continued. Goforth recorded, [...] "On the fourth morning an unusually large congregation had assembled. The people seemed tense, expectant… Just then the hymn ended, and I rose to speak. All through that address I was acutely conscious {{of the presence of}} God. Concluding, I said to the people: [...] "You may pray." [...] Immediately a man left his seat and, with bowed head and tears streaming <b>down</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> came up {{to the front of the}} church and stood facing the congregation. It was the elder who, two days before, had given vent to that awful cry. As if impelled by some power quite beyond himself, he cried out: [...] "I have committed adultery. I have tried three times to poison my wife." [...] Whereupon he tore off the golden bracelets on his wrist and the gold ring from his finger and placed them on the collection plate, saying: [...] "What have I, an elder of the Church, to do with these baubles?" [...] Then he took out his elder's card, tore it into pieces and threw the fragments on the floor. [...] "You people have my cards in your homes," [...] he cried. [...] "Kindly tear them up. I have disgraced the holy office. I herewith resign my eldership." [...] For several minutes after this striking testimony no one stirred. Then, one after another, the entire session rose and tendered their resignations. The general burden of their confession was: [...] "Though we have not sinned as our brother has, yet we, too, have sinned, and are unworthy to hold the sacred office any longer." [...] Then, the deacons one by one got up and resigned from their office. [...] "We, too, are unworthy," [...] they confessed. For days I had noticed how the floor in front of the native pastor was wet with tears. He now rose and in broken tones said, [...] "It is I who am to blame. If I had been what I ought to have been, this congregation would not be where it is to day. I'm not fit to be your pastor any longer. I, too, must resign." [...] Then there followed one of the most touching scenes that I have ever witnessed. From different parts of the congregation the cry was heard: [...] "It's all right, pastor. We appoint you to be our pastor." [...] The cry was taken up until it seemed as if every one was endeavouring to tell the broken man standing there on the platform that their faith and confidence in him had been completely restored. There followed a call for the elders to stand up; and as the penitent leaders stood in their places, with their heads bowed, the spontaneous vote of confidence was repeated, [...] "Elders, we appoint you to be our elders." [...] Then came the deacons' turn. [...] "Deacons, we appoint you to be our deacons." [...] Thus were harmony and trust restored. That evening the elder whose confession had had such a marked effect was remonstrated with by one of his friends. [...] "What made you go and disgrace yourself and your family like that?" [...] he was asked. [...] "Could I help it?" [...] he replied." ...|$|E
