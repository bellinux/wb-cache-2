30|$|Based on {{the basic}} {{functions}} of the eCall system, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> that faster accident notification and improved location information (1) decrease the number of traffic fatalities (and severity of injuries in general) and (2) improve incident management.

5|$|In {{ascending}} cholangitis, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> that organisms migrate backwards up the {{bile duct}} {{as a result}} of partial obstruction and decreased function of the sphincter of Oddi. Other theories about the origin of the bacteria, such as through the portal vein or transmigration from the colon, are considered less likely.|$|E
5|$|Kelly is {{generally}} considered to be the Ripper's final victim, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> that the crimes ended because of the culprit's death, imprisonment, institutionalisation, or emigration. The Whitechapel murders file details another four murders that happened after the canonical five: those of Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, the Pinchin Street torso, and Frances Coles.|$|E
5|$|No {{historical}} information {{exists on the}} Cadore region from {{the fall of the}} Roman Empire until the Lombard period. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> that during the Barbarian invasions, the inhabitants fled to the Fassa, Badia, Cordevole and Ampezzo valleys.|$|E

5|$|The Do 17P-2 was {{identical}} to the P-1, with the additional installation of an ETC 500 bomb rack under the fuselage.

5|$|The {{chronological order}} of the kings from the second kingdom era is highly uncertain; nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> that the letter of Enna-Dagan lists them in a chronological order. Many of the kings were attested through their own votive objects {{discovered}} in the city, and the dates are highly speculative.|$|E
5|$|Very little {{information}} exists about the education given to Przemysł II. Diplomatic sources have retained only {{the names of}} two of his teachers: Dragomir and Przybysław. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> (although without any direct evidence) that the prince had some knowledge of at least Latin in speech and writing.|$|E
30|$|These {{results are}} subject to several assumptions. Firstly, for all the {{calculations}} and formalisms, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> that there <b>is</b> no significant cell repopulation during 8 days of incubation. A more complex formulation is required to offset the repopulation effect [10, 42]. Secondly, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> that 90 YCl 3 was uniformly distributed in the well. This assumption was {{used to calculate the}} absorbed dose to cells for each 90 YCl 3 activity.|$|R

50|$|The {{sources are}} unclear {{on the extent}} of such {{military}} operations. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> that they took place near the Limes. The few sources that suggested otherwise <b>were</b> <b>assumed</b> to <b>be</b> unreliable.|$|R
5|$|While large {{portions}} of the Old Testament are missing, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> that the codex originally contained the whole of both Testaments. About half of the Greek Old Testament (or Septuagint) survived, along with a complete New Testament, the entire Deuterocanonical books, the Epistle of Barnabas and portions of The Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after {{starting}} work on the canal, the Member had an artificial lake built on a flat piece of land {{to the front of}} the mansion house. The landscape gardener William S Gilpin was carrying out work on the adjacent Strichen estate at about the same time, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> he gave help with the work at Pitfour. The lake extends to almost 50 acres and was based on the artificial lake at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic process, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> that the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This {{approach is}} now more used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically separable.|$|E

5|$|Bulk {{francium}} {{has never}} been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> that francium would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together {{to be viewed as}} a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.|$|E
5|$|During this engagement, Wilcke {{shot down}} a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber and a North American P-51 Mustang fighter, but was then {{shot down in}} his Bf 109G-6 (Werknummer 160 613—factory number) near Schöppenstedt. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> that the victors were Captain Don Gentile and Captain John Trevor Godfrey of the 4th Fighter Group. By this date, Wilcke had claimed 162 enemy {{aircraft}} in 732 combat missions. His death was announced in the Wehrmachtbericht, an information bulletin issued by {{the headquarters of the}} Wehrmacht, on 30 March.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to {{the realization}} that our Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the Universe. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an increasing rate. The majority of mass in the Universe appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E

5|$|Polish {{historian}} Rafał Jaworski {{states that}} the estimates {{of the size of}} Bolesław's army range between 2,000–5,000 Polish warriors, in addition to Thietmar's reported 1,000Pechenegs, 300German knights, and 500Hungarian mercenaries. Less is known about Yaroslav's army, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> that he managed to collect a force of similar size.

Bomber Command had targeted Peenemünde and the V-weapons test centre that night. Schnaufer, who had been tasked with leading one of the first Zahme Sau missions under Y-Control, had to abort the mission early due to engine trouble.|$|E
