5|$|For many years, {{the islanders}} had {{no means of}} {{contacting}} the mainland in emergencies other than signalling with hand lamps and hoping that someone would see them. A radio telephone was installed in 1935, and in 1953 a telephone cable was laid. A red telephone box was installed in {{the centre of the}} island, symbolic of the 6 millionth phone box installation in the UK. It <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>there</b> today, though no longer in use.|$|E
5|$|His {{body was}} 'translated' (the ecclesiastical term for {{relocation}} of relics) from Jarrow to Durham Cathedral around 1020, {{where it was}} placed in the same tomb with Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne. Later Bede's remains were moved to a shrine in the Galilee Chapel at Durham Cathedral in 1370. The shrine was destroyed during the English Reformation, but the bones were reburied in the chapel. In 1831 the bones were dug up and then reburied in a new tomb, which <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>there.</b> Other relics were claimed by York, Glastonbury and Fulda.|$|E
5|$|Patrick {{gets on the}} bus to go {{home but}} accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to get on the}} bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits in a very long line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

Only in Gladstone's Little Bay de Noc do these conditions hold true.(Sources: The highway features <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>there.)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|The balcony is {{topped by}} a niche {{consisting}} of allegorical figures of Justice and Truth, as well as triumphal sculptures of a winged female figure and a putto. Some parts of the sculptures, such as the scales held by Lady Justice, are now missing. The empty spaces between these figures contained Pinto's bust and coat of arms, but they were removed during the French occupation of Malta or in the early 19th century. It is not known how the bust of Pinto looked like, however {{it may have been}} either sculpted similar to the bust on the façade of Auberge de Castille or an original work. In either case it was probably made of bronze, and stood on a marble plinth which <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>there.</b> Similar to other busts of the time, {{it may have been the}} work of Jacques Saly. The triumphal figures are similar to those found on the 17th century funerary monument of Nicolas Cotoner sculpted by Domenico Guidi, but it is unknown who worked on the replica of the Castellania.|$|E

Dr. Coppelius becomes confused and then saddened when he finds a lifeless Coppélia behind the curtain.|$|E
25|$|Beside the Clearwater River at {{the base}} of White Horse Bluff, there is a natural refrigerator. The McDiarmid family {{operated}} four fishing camps along the river from 1944 to 1970. One summer, they noticed a cold draft of air blowing outward from some cracks here. They enlarged it, built some walls and were able to keep ice solid and perishable foods cold even in the summer heat, truly a luxury in the wilderness. The refrigerator <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>there</b> today (although partly fallen in) and, when measured by this writer in June 2003, was 2 degrees Celsius inside.|$|E
25|$|The Croydon Canal {{ran from}} New Cross {{to the site}} of West Croydon station. As it passed through South Norwood, pubs sprang up near its course. The Jolly Sailor still stands at the {{intersection}} of South Norwood Hill and High Street. The Ship, a few yards to the east, was beside the loading point for bricks from a nearby brick field across what is now High Street. The passageway through which bricks passed to the canal <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>there.</b> The Goat House pub (which has since been demolished) was said to have been named after an island in the canal on which goats were kept.|$|E

25|$|The {{exhibition}} {{closed in}} the late 1990s {{and almost all of}} the exhibits were taken away. The locomotive The Queen was too expensive to remove, so, rather than being cut up, it was incorporated as a feature of a restaurant on the concourse. It <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>there</b> today, but looking a little tired. The tender– the only original (and historic) part of the replica engine– was sold to a scrap dealer and cut up, although the springs and axleboxes were salvaged for use in the replica LB Atlantic project at the Bluebell Railway, and part of one side was rescued by the Slough and Windsor Railway Society, where it is now on display.|$|E
25|$|An {{extensive}} area of parkland stretches up {{the hill}} {{to the west of the}} house. Some of the trees planted by Joseph Stubs are still present, although coming to the end of their lives. The formal garden <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>there</b> and a garden for the disabled has been constructed by Frodsham Round Table. In the park there are play facilities for children. The coach house has been developed into the Castle Park Arts Centre which has a small café and showrooms for the arts. Other outbuildings are now used as offices for small businesses. The park and gardens have been designated at GradeII in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.|$|E
25|$|She then visits Ann Sheppard, an {{old woman}} {{suffering}} from Alzheimer's disease {{and the mother of}} two sons, one of which drowned in rainwater in a hole in a construction site, and the other who was then adopted. Madison finds the identity of the killer, Scott Shelby, and investigates his apartment. There, she may find the address where Shaun Mars, Ethan's son, is being held. Shelby eventually arrives, and sets the place ablaze while Madison <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>there.</b> Madison may die in the blaze, or the player may manage to have her escape. If she escapes and has found Shaun's location, the player may have her phone and tell either Norman or Ethan it, or have her go there alone. If the player fails to find the address and/or dies, she will be removed from play for the final level where the killer is confronted.|$|E

25|$|From 1491 to 1518, Kynaston {{supposedly}} lived a {{life that}} would match the fictional character Robin Hood. It seems he {{had a reputation for}} robbing from the rich, and giving to the poor. In return, the locals protected him, and gave him and his horse ('Beelzebub') food. One time, in an attempt to capture Kynaston, the local sheriff removed several planks from Montford Bridge, to keep him from crossing the River Severn, but his horse managed to leap and safely clear the distance. It is also said that he was a regular patron at the Old Three Pigeons tavern at Nesscliffe in Shropshire, and his original seat <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>there.</b> He may have been pardoned by Henry VII in 1493, but some accounts state that in 1513, Humphrey provided 100 men to aid Henry VIII in France, and in return received a royal pardon 3 to 5 years later.|$|E
25|$|By 1967, {{there were}} nine Polish Americans in Congress {{including}} four from the Chicago area. The three best known were Democrats who specialized in foreign policy, taxes and environmentalism. Clement J. Zablocki of Milwaukee served 1949–83, and became chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee from 1977 {{until his death in}} 1983; although liberal on domestic issues, he was a hawk regarding the Vietnam War. Dan Rostenkowski served 1959–95, and became chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, which writes the tax laws. His father was an influential alderman and party leader from the center of Polonia on the Northwest side of Chicago. Even more influential has been John Dingell of Detroit, who was first elected to Congress in 1955 and <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>there</b> (with the second longest tenure on record). A liberal Democrat known for hard-hitting investigations, Dingell has been a major voice in economic, energy, medical and environmental issues. His father John D. Dingell, Sr. held the same seat in Congress from 1933 to 1955. He was the son of Marie and Joseph A. Dzieglewicz, Polish immigrants.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Giuntoli retired. For {{the next}} 18 years, the {{building}} was mostly closed, available only on a rental basis for private parties. One notable series of dates was in 1975 when local promoter David Allen put The Tubes on stage, extending their show week after week in response to standing-room only crowds. The Stooges also appeared once in early 1974, playing to a sparse crowd, with lead singer Iggy Pop wearing only bikini briefs and boots on stage. During his performance, he jumped into {{a small group of}} fans in front of the stage and his bikini briefs were removed by one of them. He regained the stage while yelling in anger at a female fan who had been handling his male member. In 1988, Giuntoli's grandson Michael Cerchiai reopened the property for a run as a live entertainment venue. As of 2014, the club <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>there,</b> owned and run by his Cerchiai, who celebrated his eight birthday there with a Batman-themed cake, while Smokey Robinson played live.|$|E
