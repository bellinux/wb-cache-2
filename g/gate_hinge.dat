40|$|Abstract: As the key {{components}} of large-scale hydraulic radial <b>gate,</b> <b>hinge</b> system {{play an important role}} in supporting the gate and sustaining loads. They must satisfy the requirements of intensity, rigidity and supporting stability. Due to the complicated working conditions of the gate, it is difficult to calculate stress and strain of the hinge system based on traditional design method. In this paper, taking the radial gate in Silin hydropower station as an example, finite element technology is introduced into the analysis of the hinge system. The approach of this work includes steps of (1) obtaining the maximum load of the hinge system by analyzing and comparing different working conditions of the gate, (2) modeling the hinge system by meshing, loading and boundary constraints, and (3) computing stress and strain of its major components under the most dangerous condition. The results verify design feasibility and structural reliability of the hinge system...|$|E
40|$|Northern States Power Company (NSP) is {{examining}} various alternatives {{to modify the}} automatic spillway gates at the Wissota Hydro Plant on the Chippewa River at Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. The gates are called "stauwerke" gates. The main {{purpose of the study}} is to assure that the automatic spillway gates operate properly during a probable-maximum-flood (PMF) as required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The position of the gates must be controllable {{so that they can be}} fully lowered or raised with Lake Wissota at its normal elevation of 898. 0 ft. The gates must go down for the design flood which currently is the PMF. The spillway has 13 automatic gates, each 64 feet, wide in the configuration shown in Fig. 1. NSP conducted field tests on Gate 1 at the south end of the spillway on April 15, 1988, in which the gate was pulled down to 7. 2 ft. It was not possible to test the prototype gates from 7. 2 ft down to the fully lowered position of 10. 8 ft. During the tests, pulldown forces, piezometric pressures, and water surface profiles were measured. The results of the field tests down to 7. 2 ft were correlated with a physical hydraulic model at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. These studies are summarized in a previous project report* by the Laboratory. As reported in these studies, good correlation was observed between the field tests and the model tests. The model studies were expanded to include gate positions down to 10. 8 ft (the full-down position of the gate), and the results were extrapolated to the prototype. It was concluded from the calculated <b>gate</b> <b>hinge</b> moments that the gates would probably not remain in the full-down position at the higher discharges without additional force being applied.

40|$|Comparison of {{the crystal}} {{structures}} of the KcsA and MthK potassium channels suggests {{that the process of}} opening a K(+) channel involves pivoted bending of the inner pore-lining helices at a highly conserved glycine residue. This bending motion is proposed to splay the transmembrane domains outwards to widen the gate at the "helix-bundle crossing". However, in the inwardly rectifying (Kir) potassium channel family, the role of this "hinge" residue in the second transmembrane domain (TM 2) and that of another putative glycine <b>gating</b> <b>hinge</b> at the base of TM 2 remain controversial. We investigated the role of these two positions in heteromeric Kir 4. 1 /Kir 5. 1 channels, which are unique amongst Kir channels in that both subunits lack a conserved glycine at the upper hinge position. Contrary to the effect seen in other channels, increasing the potential flexibility of TM 2 by glycine substitutions at the upper hinge position decreases channel opening. Furthermore, the contribution of the Kir 4. 1 subunit to this process is dominant compared to Kir 5. 1, demonstrating a non-equivalent contribution of these two subunits to the gating process. A homology model of heteromeric Kir 4. 1 /Kir 5. 1 shows that these upper "hinge" residues are in close contact with the base of the pore alpha-helix that supports the selectivity filter. Our results also indicate that the highly conserved glycine at the "lower" <b>gating</b> <b>hinge</b> position is required for tight packing of the TM 2 helices at the helix-bundle crossing, rather than acting as a hinge residue...|$|R

The {{wrought iron}} {{building}} structures constituting {{part of the}} architectural heritage, e. g. handrails, <b>gate</b> <b>hinges,</b> columns, arch ties and wall ties represent incorporeal value, but operate as load bearing structures as well. There are few information on their mechanical properties and quality. Due to the inhomogeneity of the material of wrought iron building structures generated during the production, the known metal testing methods, as the tensile and hardness tests or metallographic examination, are not enough to survey the properties of such structures in depth. For the further and more accurate examinations, the application of X-ray and back-wall echo ultrasonic tests are essential. The goal of our paper is {{the presentation of the}} application of the examinations used extensively in the machine industry for the testing of wrought iron building structures...|$|R

40|$|AbstractVoltage-gated sodium {{channels}} {{are members of}} a large family with similar pore structures. The mechanism of opening and closing is unknown, but structural studies suggest gating via bending of the inner pore helix at a glycine hinge. Here we provide functional evidence for this gating model for the bacterial sodium channel NaChBac. Mutation of glycine 219 to proline, which would strongly favor bending of the α helix, greatly enhances activation by shifting its voltage dependence − 51 mV and slowing deactivation by 2000 -fold. The mutation also slows voltage-dependent inactivation by 1200 -fold. The effects are specific because substitutions of proline at neighboring positions and substitutions of other amino acids at position 219 have much smaller functional effects. Our results fit a model in which concerted bending at glycine 219 in the S 6 segments of NaChBac serves as a <b>gating</b> <b>hinge.</b> This <b>gating</b> motion may be conserved in most members of this large ion channel protein family...|$|R
