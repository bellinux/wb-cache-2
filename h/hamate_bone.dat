500|$|Entering 2011, the Giants made a publicized {{campaign}} called [...] "Operation Panda", {{which was}} aimed at getting Sandoval into better shape during the offseason. By the end of 2010, he had weighed 278 pounds. Sandoval hired Triple Threat Performance of Tempe, Arizona, to help him lose weight and help improve his performance. [...] "Operation Panda" [...] worked masterfully, with the third baseman losing 30-plus pounds, and more importantly, it led to results on the field for Sandoval. After a subpar 2010 season, Sandoval returned to his 2009 form. He {{got off to a}} good start in 2011, but suffered a broken right <b>hamate</b> <b>bone</b> in late April and missed 41 games. He was activated off the disabled list (DL) on June 14 and had a 22-game hitting streak from June 19 through July 14. On July 10, 2011, Sandoval was selected to the National League All-Star team, becoming the first All-Star position player for the Giants since Barry Bonds in 2007. In his first All-Star at bat, Sandoval hit an RBI ground-rule double against Brandon League, helping the NL win the 2011 MLB All-Star Game.|$|E
500|$|On April 26, 2012, Sandoval hit {{a single}} in the fourth inning of {{a game against the}} Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. This was the 19th {{consecutive}} game since Opening Day in which Sandoval had a hit, setting a Giants franchise record for longest consecutive hitting streak to begin a season. The previous record – of 18 games – was set by Johnny Rucker in 1945. Sandoval ran it up to 20 before it was snapped. However, in May, Sandoval fractured his left <b>hamate</b> <b>bone,</b> an injury which kept him out until early June. Giants' head athletic trainer Dave Groeschner said the day before Sandoval had surgery, [...] "I guess the good news is both [...] will be gone tomorrow and he can't do it again." [...] On July 1, 2012, it was announced that Sandoval had beaten out David Wright for his second All-Star team, as the starting third baseman for the National League. The choice was considered somewhat controversial by fans and executives (particularly Sandy Alderson), as David Wright had a significantly higher batting average than Sandoval at the time. Wright made the team as a reserve, and as a reporter pointed out, Sandoval in 2009 [...] "outperformed Wright, who was the fans' choice to start." [...] On July 10, at Kansas City's Kauffman Stadium, Sandoval highlighted the NL's five-run opening inning with the first bases-loaded triple {{in the history of the}} Midsummer Classic, off of reigning American League (AL) Cy Young Award winner Justin Verlander.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two rows}} of eight carpal bones in the wrist. An easy memory aid to help one {{remember}} their order is: (First row: starting from the thumb and moving toward the pinky finger) Some Lovers Try Positions (Second Row: again from thumb to pinky) That They Can't Handle.

50|$|There are {{differences}} between knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and gorillas: juvenile chimpanzees engage in less knuckle-walking than juvenile gorillas. Another {{difference is that}} the hand bones of gorillas lack key features that were once thought to limit the extension of the wrist during knuckle-walking in chimpanzees. For example, the ridges and concavities features of the capitate and <b>hamate</b> <b>bones</b> have been interpreted to enhance stability of weight-bearing; on this basis, they have been used to identify knuckle-walking in fossils. These are found in all chimpanzees but in only two out of five gorillas. They are also less prominent when found in gorillas. They are however found in primates that do not knuckle-walk.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Muscular {{variations}} of the flexor compartment of forearm are usual and can result in multiple clinical conditions limiting the functions of forearm and hand. The {{variations of}} the muscles, especially accessory muscles may simulate soft tissue tumors and can result in nerve compressions. During a routine dissection of the anterior region of the forearm and hand, an unusual muscle was observed {{on the left side}} of a 65 -year-old male cadaver. The anomalous muscle belly arose from the medial epicondyle approxiamately 1 cm posterolateral to origin of normal flexor carpi ulnaris muscle (FCU), and from proximal part of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle. It inserted to the triquetral, <b>hamate</b> <b>bones</b> and flexor retinaculum. Passive traction on the tendon of accessory muscle resulted in flexion of radiocarpal junction. The FCU which had one head, inserted to the pisiform <b>bone</b> hook of <b>hamate</b> and palmar aponeurosis. Its contiguous muscles displayed normal morphology. Knowledge of the existence of muscle anomalies as well as the location of compression is useful in determining the pathology and appropriate treatment for compressive neuropathies. In this study, a rare accessory muscle has been described...|$|R

40|$|Four-corner fusion (4 CF) is an {{accepted}} and regularly performed procedure when managing posttraumatic degenerative disorders in the wrist. This procedure consists of excision {{of the entire}} scaphoid in association with midcarpal fusion of the remaining four ulnar carpal <b>bones</b> (<b>hamate,</b> capitate, lunate, and triquetrum). In the majority of cases, the long-term outcome is a functional painless wrist. However, the exact procedure to best achieve a rapid solid bone union of the fusion mass without hardware complications remains controversial. The authors have developed a precise system to ensure precise positioning, firm fixation, and fusion at the midcarpal joint together with an early postoperative recovery, avoiding {{some of the issues}} reported with other implants used for 4 CF. The described implant is a circular plate accommodating variable angle locking screws as well as compression screws that can firmly fix the plate to the carpal bones. The locking technology produces a very solid construct. A special reaming-distraction-compression guide has also been developed to both countersink the plate on the underlying carpal bone mass and allow distraction of the midcarpal joint for debridement and cancellous bone graft interposition. The features of the implant, its surgical technique, and a relevant case are described...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} the macroscopic anatomy and histological {{characteristics of the}} transverse carpal ligament and the flexor retinaculum of the wrist and to {{investigate the}}ir anatomical relationships and define appropriate terminology. METHODS: The volar regions of the wrists of 30 unembalmed subjects were examined by dissection and by histological and immunohistochemical staining. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging studies were also carried out on 10 subjects. RESULTS: The dissection study showed that the antebrachial fascia at the volar aspect of the wrist presents a reinforcement. From a histological point of view, it is composed of 3 layers of undulated collagen fiber bundles. Adjacent layers show different orientations of the collagen fibers. Many nerve fibers and Pacini and Ruffini corpuscles were found in all specimens. Under this fibrous plane is another fibrous structure, placed transversely between the ulnar-sided <b>hamate</b> and pisiform <b>bones,</b> and the radial-sided scaphoid and trapezium bones. The deeper fibrous structure shows completely different histological characteristics, having parallel, thicker collagen fiber bundles and few nerve fibers. Magnetic resonance images confirm the presence of 2 clearly distinguished fibrous structures in the wrist, the first in continuity with the antebrachial fascia and the second located in a deeper plane between the hamate and scaphoid. CONCLUSIONS: Two different fibrous structures with different histological characteristics {{are present in the}} volar wrist: the more superficial one is in continuity with the antebrachial fascia and could be considered its reinforcement; the deeper one is composed of strong lamina, with histological features similar to those of a ligament. For these reasons, we suggest that the term transverse carpal ligament should be used to indicate the fibrous lamina connecting the hamate and pisiform to the scaphoid and trapezium and that the term flexor retinaculum of the wrist should be abandoned because it does not correspond to any specific, autonomous structure...|$|R

40|$|The study {{presented}} in the dissertation describes clinical and molecular analysis of five consanguineous families (A, B, C, D, E) showing different types of skeletal disorders. These families were collected from different remote regions of Pakistan. The {{study was conducted in}} three phases; clinical examination and collection of blood samples, genetic linkage analysis using microsatellite markers/SNPs and DNA sequencing. Affected individuals in two families (A and B) presented autosomal recessive forms of Postaxial Polydactyly type A (PAPA) with slightly variable phenotypes. At least two affected individuals from each family were examined by medical officers either at local government hospital or at Pakistan Institute for Medical Sciences (PIMS) Islamabad. In order to characterize deformities radiographic analysis was performed by obtaining consents from the affected subjects or their guardians. In family A, after failing to establish linkage to known loci of postaxial polydactyly, whole genome scan, using 534 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, showed linkage of the family on chromosome 13 q 13. 3 -q 21. 2. Linkage was supported by obtaining maximum multipoint LOD score of 3. 84 with several markers. Sequencing of the ten prioritized genes, located in the linkage interval, failed to identify any pathogenic sequence variant. In family B, after failing to identify pathogenic copy number variation (CNV) by scanning aCGH, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on DNA samples of three affected individuals. This resulted in identification of a first disease causing variant (c. 1421 C>T; p. Thr 474 Ile) in the gene ZNF 141, mapped on chromosome 4 p 16. 1 -p 16. 3. In two families (C and D), clinical investigation revealed segregation of a rare form of Frontonasal Dysplasia (FND) phenotype in autosomal recessive manner. After excluding linkage in the families to known loci of autosomal recessive ALX-related FND, both the families were subjected to human genome scan. Family C was scanned using 250 K Nsp 1 array using DNA from one parent and two affected siblings of the family. Analysis of array results by homozygosity mapper revealed a novel locus of FND on chromosome 16 q 24. 1 -q 24. 2. Statistical analysis of the constructed haplotype identified a maximum multipoint LOD score of 3. 00. From the 30 genes located in 2. 9 Mb linkage interval, 7 genes were prioritized for sequencing however; no pathogenic sequence variant was identified. In the second family with FND, human genome scan using more than 400 microsatellite markers initially identified fourteen homozygous regions. However, genotyping in rest of the family members and haplotypes analysis failed to reveal linkage in the family to any of the homozygous regions. Affected individuals in the fifth family, E, presented features of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EvC); broad, short hands with postaxial polydactyly, short, dysplastic and hypoplastic finger nails, broad and swollen feet with thick nails, foot syndactyly, hypodontia, ankyloglossia and macroglossia. Radiographic analysis of hands and feet showed fusion of <b>hamate</b> and capitate <b>bones,</b> coned epiphysis, postaxial polydactyly, bowing of the humerus and fusion of proximal tibia and fibula. Genotyping using microsatellite markers established linkage of the family to EvC syndrome locus on chromosome 4 p 16. Sequencing of the genes EVC and EVC 2 identified a novel homozygous missense mutation (c. 617 G>A; p. Ser 206 Asn) in the gene EVC.
