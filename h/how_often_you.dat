500|$|Privacy {{advocates and}} other critics have {{expressed}} concern regarding Windows10's privacy policies and its collection and use of customer data. Under the default [...] "Express" [...] settings, Windows10 is configured to send various information to Microsoft and other parties, including the collection of user contacts, calendar data, and [...] "associated input data" [...] to personalize [...] "speech, typing, and inking input", typing and inking data to improve recognition, allowing apps to use a unique [...] "advertisingID" [...] for analytics and advertising personalization (functionality introduced by Windows 8.1) and allow apps to request the user's location data and send this data to Microsoft and [...] "trusted partners" [...] to improve location detection (Windows8 had similar settings, except that location data collection did not include [...] "trusted partners"). Users can opt out from most of this data collection, but telemetry data for error reporting and usage is also sent to Microsoft, and this cannot be disabled on non-Enterprise versions of Windows10. Microsoft's privacy policy states, however, that [...] "Basic"-level telemetry data is anonymized and cannot {{be used to identify}} an individual user or device. The use of Cortana also requires the collection of data [...] "such as your device location, data from your calendar, the apps you use, data from your emails and text messages, who you call, your contacts and <b>how</b> <b>often</b> <b>you</b> interact with them on your device” to personalize its functionality.|$|E
