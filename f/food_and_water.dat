Widespread medical teams assisted {{tens of thousands of}} homes, and due to prevention measures, there were no outbreaks of diseases.

By 16:00 that day, the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd US Infantry Division, a unit newly arrived in Korea, was sent to the region. Church immediately ordered it to attack the North Korean salient at the bulge. 9th Infantry was fresh and well-equipped. They were also inexperienced, many of their number being reservists. Despite a tenacious attack, the 9th Infantry was only able to regain part of Cloverleaf Hill before intense fighting stalled its movement.|$|E

5|$|Costly {{religious}} rituals such as male circumcision, <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> deprivation, and snake handling look paradoxical {{in evolutionary}} terms. Devout religious beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced therefore appear maladaptive. Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup cooperation. Cooperation leads to altruistic behaviour, and costly signalling could explain this. All religions may involve costly and elaborate rituals, performed publicly, to demonstrate {{loyalty to the}} religious group. In this way, group members increase their allegiance to the group by signalling their investment in group interests. However, as group size increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows. Costly signalling theory accounts for this by proposing that these religious rituals are costly enough to deter free riders.|$|E
