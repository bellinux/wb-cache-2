40|$|Although {{animal welfare}} issues have become {{increasingly}} important to the economic fortunes of many producers the interests of animals themselves are absent from standard economic analysis. By contrast scholars from other disciplines such as philosophy and law have examined animal issues in considerable detail. This paper outlines a simple way of formally incorporating the insights of these discipines within a traditional economics framework. If animals have economic standing then current practice makes excessive use of animals as production inputs and is thus economically inefficient. However efficiency would not in <b>general</b> <b>entail</b> zero use. Optimal usage depends on the costs to animals and the benefits to humans and thus reflects the usual cost-benefit tradeoff inherent in economics.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{begin with}} a puzzle: why do some {{know-how}} attributions entail ability attributions while others do not? After rejecting the tempting response that know-how attributions are ambiguous, we argue that a satisfactory answer to the puzzle must acknowledge the connection between know-how and concept possession (specifically, reasonable conceptual mastery, or understanding). This connection appears at first to be grounded solely in the cognitive nature of certain activities. However, we show that, contra anti-intellectualists, the connection between know-how and concept possession can be generalized via reflection on the cognitive nature of intentional action and the potential of certain misunderstandings to undermine know-how even when the corresponding abilities and associated propositional knowledge are in place. Such considerations make explicit the intimate relation between know-how and understanding, motivating a general intellectualist analysis of the former {{in terms of the}} latter. Recent philosophical discussion of the nature of know-how has focused on the relation between know-how and ability. This relation seems rather puzzling. On the one hand, many philosophers have noted that know-how attributions do not in <b>general</b> <b>entail</b> possession of the correspondin...|$|R

In the paper we show that full preconditioning is beneficial for explicit time integration while the implicit scheme turns out to be efficient and accurate using just the modified numerical flux function. Thus the implicit scheme could also be used for time accurate computations. The performance of the method is demonstrated by solving an inviscid flow past a NACA 0012 airfoil at different low Mach numbers using various degrees of polynomial approximations. Computations with and without preconditioning are performed on different grid topologies to analyze the influence of the spatial discretization on the accuracy of the DG solutions at low Mach numbers...|$|R

Our work addresses {{the problem of}} constructing quantum circuits to implement an arbitrary given quantum computation, in the special case of two qubits. We pursue circuits without ancilla qubits and as small a number of elementary quantum gates [1] as possible. Our lower bound for worst-case optimal two-qubit circuits calls for at least 17 gates: 15 one-qubit rotations and 2 CNOTs. To this end, we constructively prove a worst-case upper bound of 23 elementary gates, of which at most 4 (CNOTs) entail multi-qubit interactions. Our analysis shows that synthesis algorithms suggested in previous work, although more <b>general,</b> <b>entail</b> much larger quantum circuits than ours in the special case of two qubits.

Four variables are observed monthly on each tree over many years: disease severity and conidial sporulation intensity on young leaves, and severity and stroma density on mature leaves. In order to simplify this field assessment method, we tested the resistance of eight rubber tree clones to M. ulei in Ecuador in a Fisher block design with four replicates per treatment. Three months after planting, monthly observations were made for a period of 12 months on the foliage focusing on the four variables, in order to quantify disease development. Given the correlations between the four variables, assessment of conidial sporulation intensity on young leaves and stroma density on mature leaves should be sufficient. The most suitable period to start the assessment was 6 months after planting, for a duration of six to nine months. As repeated observations on the same trees were autocorrelated, it was possible to reduce the assessment frequency to once every 2 months.

This hypothesis and its consequences can be studied by kinetic models in which enzyme profiles are chosen by optimality principles. In enzyme-optimal states, active enzymes must provide benefits: a higher enzyme level must provide a metabolic benefit to justify the additional enzyme cost. This <b>entails</b> <b>general</b> relations between metabolic fluxes, reaction elasticities, and enzyme costs, the laws of metabolic economics. The laws can be formulated using economic potentials and loads, state variables that quantify how metabolites, reactions, and enzymes affect the metabolic performance in a steady state. Economic balance equations link them to fluxes, reaction elasticities, and enzyme levels locally in the network. Economically feasible fluxes must be free of futile cycles and must lead from lower to higher economic potentials, just like thermodynamics makes them lead from higher to lower chemical potentials. Metabolic economics provides algebraic conditions for economical fluxes, which are independent of the underlying kinetic models. It justifies and extends the principle of minimal fluxes and shows how to construct kinetic models in enzyme-optimal states, where all enzymes have {{a positive influence on}} the metabolic performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} which seeks {{the essence of}} something, (ti ēn einai), according to the argument of this thesis, was fashioned by Aristotle because of ambiguity or 'homonymy' inherent {{in the nature of}} universal predicates. However successful the conceptual analysis of universals may be as such, their meaning or significance cannot be fully fixed or determined except {{as a function of the}} subjects to which they are applied. The distinction between understanding a universal predicate as such and understanding its application to a particular subject may be roughly expressed as that between the ability to recognize the presence of an attribute in a subject and the knowledge of what the predicate says about the subject. It is in order to transform knowledge of the first kind into knowledge of the second that the 'essence-question' is asked. It is shown that the Aristotelian notion of an essence (to ti ēn einai) is explained through the notions of a subject (ypokeimenon) and of an actuality (energeia). Aristotelian 'essences' express the actuality or activity of a substance conceived from the 'categorical' point of view as the subject of qualities and universal predicates in general. An 'essence', insofar as the term applies to sensible substances, is the being of something as the subject of qualities and material predicates, i. e. universal predicates in <b>general.</b> <b>Entailed</b> is the denial that an essence in Aristotle's sense is constituted by attributes, characteristics, or universal predicates of any sort whatsoever.

Moreover, any inequality x &le; y can be expressed equivalently as an equation, either x&and;y = x or x&or;y = y. This along with the equations axiomatizing lattices and monoids then yields a purely equational definition of residuated lattices, provided the requisite operations are adjoined to the signature (L, &le;, •, I) thereby expanding it to (L, &and;, &or;, •, I, /, \). When thus organized, residuated lattices form an equational class or variety, whose homomorphisms respect the residuals {{as well as the}} lattice and monoid operations. Note that distributivity x•(y&or;z) = (x•y) &or; (x•z) and x•0 = 0 are consequences of these axioms and so {{do not need to be}} made part of the definition. This necessary distributivity of • over &or; does not in <b>general</b> <b>entail</b> distributivity of &and; over &or;, that is, a residuated lattice need not be a distributive lattice.

Alternative notations for the residuals are x &rarr; y for x\y and y &larr; x for y/x, suggested by the similarity between residuation and implication in logic, with the multiplication of the monoid understood as a form of conjunction that need not be commutative. When the monoid is commutative the two residuals coincide. When not commutative, the intuitive meaning of the monoid as conjunction and the residuals as implications can be understood as having a temporal quality: x•y means x and then y, x &rarr; y means had x (in the past) then y (now), and y &larr; x means if-ever x (in the future) then y (at that time), as illustrated by the natural language example at the end of the examples.|$|R
