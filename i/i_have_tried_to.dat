As {{an extension of}} her abolitionist ideals, she wrote to her brother Charles Beecher, however, about her potential role in the endeavor: My plan...is not in any sense a mere worldly enterprise. I have for many years had a longing to be more immediately doing Christ's work on earth. My heart is with that poor people whose cause in words <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> plead, and who now, ignorant and docile, are just in that formative state in which whoever seizes has them.|$|E

500|$|In 1979, de Lucía, John McLaughlin, and Larry Coryell formed The Guitar Trio and {{together}} made {{a tour of}} Europe and released a video recorded at London's Royal Albert Hall entitled Meeting of the Spirits. Pohren said that de Lucía's decision to work with musicians like McLaughlin, Di Meola, Coryell, and Chick Corea {{must have been an}} [...] "exciting and stimulating" [...] experience for him, given their technical musical knowledge and ability to improvise and said that they carried him [...] "so far afield that at times he must have been profoundly confused, a man running the risk of losing his musical identity." [...] This concerned de Lucía, who said in a late 1990s interview, [...] "I have never lost the roots in my music, because I would lose myself. What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do is have a hand holding onto tradition and the other scratching, digging in other places, trying to find new things I can bring into flamenco." ...|$|E
500|$|Lulla Rosenfeld {{writes that}} Henry Irving, the great Shylock before that time, played Shylock as [...] "morally {{superior}} to the Christians around him... driven to cruelty only by their more cruel persecutions." [...] In contrast, [...] "Adler scorned justification. Total vindication was his aim." [...] In Adler's own words, [...] "Shylock from the first was governed by pride rather than revenge. He wishes to humble and terrify Antonio for the insult and humiliation he has suffered at his hands. This is why he {{goes so far as}} to bring his knife and scales into the court. For Shylock, however, the desired climax was to refuse the pound of flesh with a gesture of divine compassion. When the verdict goes against him, he is crushed because he has been robbed of this opportunity, not because he lusts for Antonio's death. This was my interpretation. This is the Shylock <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> show." [...] The road from this to method acting is clear.|$|E
500|$|Ursula Franklin {{explains}} in {{a prelude to}} her 2006 collection of papers, interviews and talks that her lifelong interest in structures, in what she terms [...] "the arrangement and interplay of the parts within a whole," [...] {{has been at the}} root of most of her activities. Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, [...] "I can see how <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> wrestle with just one fundamental question: 'How can one live and work as a pacifist {{in the here and now}} and help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise?'" [...] As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. [...] "Increasingly I found the maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels," [...] she writes. [...] "I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of 'them' and 'us,' of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement." [...] Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls [...] "the real world" [...] by [...] "the maps of pacifism and feminism".|$|E

500|$|Robyn was {{involved}} in the writing process for the entirety of My Truth, co-writing all fourteen tracks. She teamed up with Swedish rapper Petter for a Swedish-language duet titled [...] "Det gör ont ibland". The collaboration came about when the two were at a friend's country house. Petter said the song came together quickly, despite their different musical styles. The track was produced by rapper Thomas Rusiak with additional production by Robyn, Lindström and Ekhé. She recorded another duet for the album, titled [...] "Healthy Love", with singer Cindy Heinold. In the fall of 1998, Robyn had an abortion, which she revealed to the public months later in an issue of Café Magazine. Following the abortion, she penned the songs [...] "88 Days" [...] and [...] "Giving You Back", to help her cope with the incident. At the time of the album's completion, she deemed the latter among the best songs she had written thus far. She began using songwriting as a coping mechanism during production of Robyn Is Here when she wrote [...] "In My Heart" [...] about her parents' divorce. She wanted My Truth to be positive in spirit, but acknowledged there is [...] "some sadness expressed". She said, [...] "Every song is about something I've been through that I think is important to talk about. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> turn these experiences into inspiring songs about my life." [...] Eric Broms photographed the artwork for My Truth, which sees Robyn wearing a feather headpiece designed by Sebastian Wahl.|$|E
500|$|With Somerset runners-up in the English 2009 Twenty20 Cup, Trescothick and his county {{travelled}} to India {{to partake}} in the Champions League Twenty20 in October. Though both Kieswetter and Hildreth were anticipated as successes, it was Trescothick who {{was described as}} having [...] "been in sparkling form all season" [...] and began the tournament under media scrutiny given his previous difficulties playing on tour. There was much speculation regarding any [...] "recurrence of his stress-related illness that originally occurred in 2006", as {{this was to be}} his first overseas outing since an aborted attempt in 2008. Trescothick himself responded to the media by making a statement to the BBC World Service which read [...] "I know the risk and I know what happens when it goes wrong. In the last couple of times <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> go on tour it's failed, so of course ... Let's try and break the tradition of what has happened over the last few times... I can only try. It's a big competition for the players and for the club. I have got to try and make it happen." [...] Meanwhile, Langer assured the media that Trescothick could pull out whenever he wished to. Somerset, who began the tour without Trescothick as he was arriving later than most of the squad, commenced their warm up with a victory over the Otago Volts. The opener arrived three days later, confident in his ability to complete the tour. Somerset began with a close victory against the Deccan Chargers on 10 October, winning from the last ball. Trescothick was dismissed for 14 from 12 in his first match outside England since 2006, [...] "after offering a fleeting glimpse of his talent" [...] according to ESPNcricinfo.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1990s, Keaton had {{established}} herself {{as one of}} the most popular and versatile actors in Hollywood. She shifted to more mature roles, frequently playing matriarchs of middle-class families.

2500|$|The {{riddle of}} the early Academy is epitomized in the {{discrepancy}} between Aristotle's account of Plato's theory of ideas and that theory {{as we know it}} from Plato's writings. To explain that discrepancy, scholars have constructed the hypothesis of an oral Platonic doctrine. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> show that that hypothesis is unsatisfactory not only because the evidence for Plato's one attested lecture fails to support it, but also because the inconsistency in Aristotle's testimony itself appears to contradict it… ...|$|E

2500|$|Statues were {{erected in}} Trafalgar Square, London, in Chatham, Gravesend, Melbourne (Australia), and Khartoum. Southampton, where Gordon had stayed with his sister, Augusta, in Rockstone Place before his {{departure}} to the Sudan, erected a memorial in Porter's Mead, now Queen's Park, near the town's docks. On 16 October 1885, the [...] "light and elegant structure" [...] was unveiled; it comprises a stone base on {{which there are}} four polished red Aberdeen granite columns, about twenty feet high. The columns are surmounted by carved capitals supporting a cross. The pedestal bears {{the arms of the}} Gordon clan and of the borough of Southampton, and also Gordon’s name in Chinese. Around the base is an inscription referring to Gordon as a soldier, philanthropist and administrator and mentions those parts {{of the world in which}} he served, closing with a quotation from his last letter to his sisters: [...] "I am quite happy, thank God! and, like Lawrence, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do my duty." [...] The memorial is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
2500|$|Holmes was {{partially}} modelled on his former university teacher Joseph Bell. In 1892, {{in a letter}} to Bell, Doyle wrote, [...] "It is most certainly to you that I owe Sherlock Holmes... round the centre of deduction and inference and observation which I have heard you inculcate <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> build up a man," [...] and, in his 1924 autobiography, he remarked, [...] "It is no wonder that after the study of such a character [...] I used and amplified his methods when in later life I tried to build up a scientific detective who solved cases on his own merits and not through the folly of the criminal." [...] Robert Louis Stevenson was able, even in faraway Samoa, to recognise the strong similarity between Joseph Bell and Sherlock Holmes: [...] "My compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of Sherlock Holmes.... can this be my old friend Joe Bell?" [...] Other authors sometimes suggest additional influences—for instance, the famous Edgar Allan Poe character C. Auguste Dupin. Dr. (John) Watson owes his surname, but not any other obvious characteristic, to a Portsmouth medical colleague of Doyle's, Dr James Watson.|$|E
2500|$|But {{despite all}} the fanfare {{surrounding}} the big-money contract the Nets gave Borg {{and the presence of}} one of the world's top male players on the team, Nets owner Joe Zingale found a way to shine the spotlight even brighter on his team when he signed transsexual Renée Richards to a contract on June 2. At the press conference announcing her signing, Richards said, [...] "I am thankful that I'm being given the opportunity to play professional tennis at the level that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> play, but which has been met with so much frustration that I have been unable to do." [...] When he was asked about whether WTT had approved Richards as a female player, Zingale said, [...] "I didn't ask them. That's not the way I work. There's a lot of politics involved when you try to get approval from everybody for such a move." [...] At the time of the signing, Richards was embroiled in litigation with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) which had denied her entry into the United States Open Tennis Championships as a female player, because she refused to take the Barr body test of her chromosomes as required by USTA rules. Not wanting to lock horns with the USTA, WTT ruled Richards not eligible to play as a female player until her court case was decided.|$|E
5000|$|David Bowie's song titled [...] "The Supermen", {{from his}} 1970 album The Man Who Sold the World, was {{inspired}} by the work of Nietzsche.
