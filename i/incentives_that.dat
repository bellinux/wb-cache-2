Additionally, the bank's chairman, Peter Kurer, would no longer receive any extra variable compensation, only a cash salary and a fixed allotment of shares that could not be sold for four years. In April 2009, UBS announced that it agreed to sell its Brazilian financial services business, UBS Pactual, for approximately US$2.5billion to BTG Investments. UBS rejected proposals to break apart the bank and divest its investment banking division.|$|E
5|$|Until 1976, {{federal tax}} {{incentives}} were virtually non-existent for {{buildings on the}} National Register. Before 1976 the federal tax code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures. In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide tax <b>incentives</b> <b>that</b> promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax incentives. A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Properties and sites listed in the Register, {{as well as those}} located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the federal tax benefits.|$|E

Filming locations included Johannesburg and Cape Town Film Studios (Dredd {{was the first}} project filmed at the studio). The project involved a majority of Cape Town crew members and about 40 imported crew. The producers chose to film in South Africa because of the lowered cost of employing cast and crew compared to locations in Europe and North America, and government <b>incentives</b> <b>that</b> offered to rebate up to 25% of the production costs. The film was shot digitally and primarily in 3D using RED MX, SI2K and Phantom Flex high-speed cameras. Multiple camera rigs were used. Some 2D elements were converted to 3D in post-production.|$|E

40|$|Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) {{anonymous}} {{communication systems}} {{are vulnerable to}} free-riders, peers that use the system while providing little or no service to others and whose presence limits the strength of anonymity {{as well as the}} efficiency of the system. Free-riding can be addressed by building explicit incentive mechanisms into system protocols to promote two distinct aspects of cooperation among peers—compliance with the protocol specification and the availability of peers to serve others. In this paper we study the use of payments to implement an <b>incentive</b> mechanism <b>that</b> attaches a real monetary cost to low availability. Through a game theoretic analysis, we evaluate the effectiveness of such an <b>incentive,</b> finding <b>that</b> peer availability can be significantly increased through the introduction of payments under many conditions. We also demonstrate how a payment-based <b>incentive</b> <b>that</b> preserves anonymity can be implemented and integrated with a popular class of P 2 P anonymity systems. ...|$|R

25|$|Emissions trading gives polluters an {{incentive}} to reduce their emissions. However, there are possible perverse <b>incentives</b> <b>that</b> can exist in emissions trading. Allocating permits {{on the basis of}} past emissions ("grandfathering") can result in firms having {{an incentive}} to maintain emissions. For example, a firm that reduced its emissions would receive fewer permits in the future (IMF, 2008, pp.25–26). This problem can also be criticized on ethical grounds, since the polluter is being paid to reduce emissions (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, p.38). On the other hand, a permit system where permits are auctioned rather than given away, provides the government with revenues. These revenues might be used to improve the efficiency of overall climate policy, e.g., by funding reductions in distortionary taxes (Fisher et al.., 1996, p.417).|$|E
25|$|Hybrid {{sales in}} Japan almost tripled in 2009 as {{compared}} to 2008 {{as a result of}} government <b>incentives</b> <b>that</b> included a scrappage program, tax breaks on hybrid vehicles and other low-emission cars and trucks, and a higher levy on gasoline that rose prices in the order of US$4.50.

In contrast, the U.S. market share was 2.8% for the same year. These record sales allowed Japan to surpass the U.S. in total new hybrid sales, with the Japanese market representing almost half (48%) of the worldwide hybrid sales in 2009 while the U.S. market represented 42% of global sales.
