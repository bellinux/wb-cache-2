[...] "Rex" [...] Lewis / The Doctor / Cobra Commander [...] The Baroness's brother, {{a former}} soldier who {{was thought to}} have been killed during a mission led by Duke [...] instead, he became the {{disfigured}} head scientist of Military Armament Research Syndicate (MARS). USA Today reported that Gordon-Levitt would play multiple roles. He wore prosthetic makeup under a mask that was redesigned from the comics because the crew found it too reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan. Upon seeing concept art of the character, Gordon-Levitt signed on because; [...] "I was like, 'I get to be that? You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> [...] in real life and stick it on me? Cool. Let me do it.' That's a once-in-lifetime opportunity." [...] Gordon-Levitt is a friend of Tatum and they co-starred in Stop-Loss and Havoc. His casting provided extra incentive for Tatum to join the film. Gordon-Levitt described his vocal performance as being [...] "half reminiscent" [...] of Chris Latta's voice for the , but also half his own ideas, because he felt rendering it fully would sound ridiculous.|$|E
2500|$|One of Laughlin's {{concerns}} was {{the issue}} of domestic abuse. He became involved in this after witnessing a neighbor, a police officer, beating his wife. He blamed the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson on domestic abuse, saying:O.J. Simpson was my neighbor up the street on Rockingham. He lived at 300 Rockingham Drive, I lived at 100 Rockingham. I've known O.J. forever. This {{is one of the}} sickest, sorriest days in our culture, that he was [...] not guilty... I've told him since 1985 he'd end up in jail... Eight times [...] cried out and eight times, because it was O.J. and it was woman-battering, it was dismissed. But now, with the trivialization, people are afraid to call because they don't trust that the system will help them. The fact that he was found not guilty is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> 10 times worse.|$|E
2500|$|Titans {{running backs}} coach Earnest Byner said of Ringer “You {{can see the}} running skills, {{the things that we}} saw when we watched him at Michigan State, Good patience, good body lean, the ability to set the inside zones, acceleration, vision. Can he go in and compete on offense? Yes he can. With the way things are progressing, with the {{competition}} … that competition is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> third position much better." [...] When describing the role of the 3rd string running back, Jeff Fisher said [...] "The rotation is, for the most part, like it was last year, So the third running back will be called upon if the second back can’t play, and to be a good player on special teams." [...] Ringer commented on the role, saying [...] "Special teams can help you win or lose a game. My goal coming in here was to be a productive player anyway possible. If special teams is it then that will be it. I know that’s {{going to be a big}} deal. I know I’ll get my chance sooner or later.” ...|$|E

60|$|The party all breakfasted {{together}} the next morning, {{and they went}} down {{into the dining room}} for their breakfast, instead of taking it in Mrs. Gray's room.

6000|$|I could see, of course, that Uncle William did {{not like}} the idea of selling {{pictures}} for money.

Whatever is the [...] reason of this {{extraordinary}} dislike to Sandbourne? It is a nice [...] healthy place, and you are likely to do much better than either of our [...] elder sisters, if you follow straight on in the path you have chosen. [...] Of course, if such good fortune should attend me that I get rich by my [...] contrivances of public story-telling and so on, I shall share [...] everything with you and the rest of us, in which case you shall not [...] work at all.

So, though I don't mean to be [...] harsh, I must impress upon you the necessity of going on as you are [...] going just at present. I know the place must be dull, but we must all [...] put up with dulness sometimes. You, being next to me in age, must aid [...] me as well as you can in doing something for the younger ones; and if [...] anybody at all comes and lives here otherwise than as a servant, it [...] must be our father--who will not, however, at present hear of such a [...] thing when I mention it to him. Do think of all this, Picotee, and [...] bear up! Perhaps we shall all be happy and united some day. Joey is [...] waiting to run to the post-office with this at once. All are well.

6000|$|JULY 5.--Why did {{you never}} {{tell me how}} charming Metelill is? I never {{supposed}} the Fulford features capable of so much beauty, and the whole manner and address are so delightful that I do not wonder that all her cousins are devoted to her; Uchtred, or Butts, as they are pleased to name him, has brightened into another creature since she came, and she seems like sunshine to us all. As to my namesake, I am sorry to say that I perceive the appropriateness of Charley; but I suppose it is style, for the masculine dress which in Pica and Avice has an air of being worn for mere convenience' sake, and is quite ladylike, especially on Avice, has in her an appearance of defiance and coquetry. Her fox-terrier always shares her room, which therefore is eschewed by her sister, and this has made a change in our arrangements. We had thought the room in our house, which it seems is an object of competition, would suit best for Jane Druce {{and one of her}} little sisters; but a hint was given by either Pica or her mother {{that it would be a}} great boon to let Jane and Avice share it, as they are very great friends, and we had the latter there installed. However, this fox-terrier made Metelill protest against sleeping at the hotel with her sister, and her mother begged us to take her in. Thereupon, Emily saw Isa looking annoyed, and on inquiry she replied sweetly, [...] "Oh, never mind, aunty dear; I daresay Wasp won't be so bad as he looks; and I'll try not to be silly, and then I daresay Charley will not tease me! Only I had hoped to be with dear Metelill; but no doubt she will prefer her Bird--people always do." [...] So they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> poor child the victim! For it seems Pica has a room to herself, and will not give it up or take in any one. Emily went at once to Avice and asked whether she would mind going to the hotel, and letting Isa be with Metelill, and this she agreed to at once. I don't know why I tell you all these details, except that they are straws to show the way of the wind, and you will see how Isabel is always the sacrifice, unless some one stands up for her. Here comes Martyn to beguile me out to the beach.|$|E

50|$|Every author {{agreed on}} T0, T1, and T2. For the other axioms, however, {{different}} authors could use significantly different definitions, {{depending on what}} they were working on. These differences could develop because, if one assumes that a topological space satisfies the T1 axiom, then the various definitions are (in most cases) equivalent. Thus, if one is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> assumption, then one would {{want to use the}} simplest definition. But if one did not make that assumption, then the simplest definition might not be the right one for the most useful concept; in any case, it would destroy the (transitive) entailment of Ti by Tj, allowing (for example) non-Hausdorff regular spaces.|$|E
