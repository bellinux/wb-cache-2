40|$|Background: Ganz {{surgical}} hip dislocation {{is useful}} {{in the management of}} severe <b>hip</b> <b>diseases,</b> providing an unobstructed view of the femoral head and acetabulum. We present our early experience with this approach in pediatric <b>hip</b> <b>diseases.</b> Methods: Twenty-three <b>hips</b> of 21 patients with pediatric <b>hip</b> <b>diseases</b> treated using the Ganz surgical hip dislocation approach were the subjects of this study. The average age at the time of surgery was 15. 7 years. There were 15 male and 6 female patients who were followed for an average of 15. 1 months (range, 6 to 29 months). Diagnoses included hereditary multiple exostoses in 9 hips, slipped capital femoral epiphysis in 7, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease in 4, osteoid osteoma in 1, pigmented villonodular synovitis in 1, and neonatal septic hip sequelae in 1. Medical records were reviewed to record diagnoses, principal surgical procedures, operative time, blood loss, postoperative rehabilitation, changes in the range of hip joint motion, and complications. Results: Femoral head-neck osteochondroplasty was performed in 17 patients, proximal femoral realignment osteotomy in 6, open reduction and subcapital osteotomy for slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) in 2, core decompression and bone grafting in 2, hip distraction arthroplasty in 2, and synovectomy in 2. Operative time averaged 168. 6 minutes when only osteochondroplasty and/ or synovectomy were performed. Hip fl exion range improved from a preoperative mean of 84. 7 ° to a mean of 115. 0 ° at the latest follow-up visit. Early continuous passive motion and ambulation were stressed in rehabilitation. No avascular necrosis of the femoral head was noted up to the time of the latest follow-up visit, except for in one SCFE patient whose surgical intervention was delayed for medical reasons...|$|R

40|$|Disorders {{of the hip}} are {{encountered}} {{frequently in}} paediatric orthopaedic practice.

The challenge is to distinguish between disease processes that are benign and self-limiting (e. g. transient synovitis), acute and joint threatening (e. g. septic arthritis) or chronic and disabling (e. g.

30|$|Total hip {{resurfacing}} {{has long}} been conceptually attractive to both surgeons and patients. However, historically it {{has been plagued by}} limited durability and marked acetabular bone loss. The recent development of wear-resistant bearings such as metal-on-metal has led to renewed interest in hip resurfacing in the orthopaedic community. We report the clinical and radiological results of 350 consecutive surface arthroplasties performed in 325 patients (mean follow-up 20 months). Harris Hip Score increased over time from 57 pre-operatively to 98 at 2 years follow-up. Complication’s rate was low. Four patients required revision surgery. The overall survival rate was 98.8 %. Considering the positive results of more than 350 implants of our series, we now believe that there is evidence showing that this surgical concept deserves consideration, particularly when treating young patients with <b>hip</b> <b>diseases.</b>|$|R

The fixator allowed flexion and extension motion and remained in place for six to ten weeks. The follow-up period ranged from five to eight years.
