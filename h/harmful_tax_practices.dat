Action item 13 of the BEPS Action Plan suggests to reform {{the structure of the}} transfer pricing documentation and introduce a new reporting requirement {{in the form of a}} countryby-country reporting template. Although such new reporting requirement is meant to provide an informative tool for the up-front identification of transfer pricing risks within the group, its unexpected area of application may become the improvement of the global acceptance of the formulary apportionment idea for the allocation of multinational enterprises’ profits.

We find strong evidence that FDI in (out) flows are affected by tax regimes in the host (home) countries and FDI flows in turn affect the corporate tax base. Simulations of European Union (EU) harmonization (isolating the revenue effect of FDI on the tax base from direct effects through the rate harmonization) suggest that high (low) tax countries would gain (lose) revenue from harmonization; these effects may be substantial. Our results also suggest that EU tax harmonization would significantly affect the net FDI position of some countries.

In many cases, {{it is not just}} the Government of Gibraltar but the British Government as well which is traduced. It is deeply regrettable that allegations are made that cannot be sustained by a basis in fact. If concrete evidence of wrong-doing were produced, the British Government should act promptly to deal with the problem. But so long as allegations are unsubstantiated, the British Government should continue to rebut them promptly and decisively.Referred to as an [...] "international financial centre", Gibraltar was among 35 jurisdictions identified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as a tax haven in June 2000. As a result of having made a commitment in accordance with the OECD's 2001 Progress Report on the OECD's Project on <b>Harmful</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>Practices,</b> Gibraltar was not included in the OECD's list of uncooperative tax havens. However, in its April 2009 progress report, the OECD listed Gibraltar in the list of jurisdictions that, although committed, had not [...] "substantially implemented" [...] yet the internationally agreed tax standard. Following Gibraltar's signing of 12 additional Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs), as of October 2009, with jurisdictions including the UK, USA and Germany, Gibraltar was listed in the OECD [...] "white list". It is currently listed as [...] "largely compliant" [...] by the OECD's Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes.|$|E

40|$|On 13 March 2009 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) {{announced}} that Austria, Luxembourg and Switzerland {{had agreed to}} introduce laws {{to allow for the}} exchange of information on tax evaders. The OECD has been actively trying to protect the national tax bases of its member states and this has now become an imperative with the global financial crisis and government deficits. The OECD 2 ̆ 7 s <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> competition project has been actively pursued for the past 12 years and appears to be receiving worldwide acceptance.

In this article we summarise the official communiqué, evaluating whether the tendency of each single member state to the Commission proposal is positive or negative. Afterwards we confront the most frequent arguments of the member states with the proposal of the Commission to find out its weaknesses and strength.
