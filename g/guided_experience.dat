Due to these gaps in the literature, and the recognised potential of psychological theories to enhance studies of stress and emotions in tourism settings, this study explored stress and emotions resulting from employer-guide interactions in an adventure tourism context from a psychological perspective. Longitudinal autoethnographical data was recorded during a river guiding season in South America. A reversal theory framework guided data analyses of key motivational states, sources of stress, and resulting emotions. Analyses identified potential transactional sources of stress and negative emotions for adventure tourism guides, and motivational states associated with stress and emotional outcomes in the employer-guide relationship. Results are discussed in relation to psychological theory and stress and coping research. Recommendations for practice, that could alleviate stressful experiences between employers and guides, are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|How guided outdoor {{activity}} participants perceive {{hazards and}} risks, and what attitudes {{they bring to}} the <b>guided</b> <b>experience</b> regarding safety and responsibility, has not been widely investigated in the academic literature to date. This report documents research which seeks to address this gap, conducted over the summer of 2006 - 2007 in the South Island of New Zealand. The study developed a two-stage questionnaire to investigate participants' levels of experience in two soft-adventure activities (sea-kayaking and walking), their reasons for undertaking a guided trip and their awareness of hazards they expected to encounter. Their opinions and attitudes towards safety and responsibility were also explored {{through a series of}} 7 -point Likert-type questions both pre- and post-experience. The researchers worked in cooperation with an adventure tourism company that offered guided walking (hiking) and sea-kayaking experiences. Consequently, the sampling method employed was one of convenience, and resulted in 103 guided kayaking and multi-day walking participants completing the questionnaires. Results indicate that considerations of risk and safety play an important, but complex, role in the decision making of soft-adventure tourists. Furthermore the <b>guided</b> <b>experience</b> makes significant difference to participants' perceptions of safety and risk, their attitudes toward shared responsibility, and the acceptance of hazards as part of the outdoor experience. The research finds limited evidence that these nature-based tours have unrealistic expectations about management of their safety during the activities.

Participants' life journeys provided experiences that developed their understandings and established their personal identity as a leader and mentor. We considered the journey motif {{in terms of its}} inextricable connection with lived time and used Heidegger's ecstasies of temporality as a lens to understand how the temporal dimensions of past, present and future influenced and shaped the development of nurse leader mentors.

The target audience of my creative project was anyone interested in live theatre or theatrical clothing. My creative project consisted of designing costumes for The Wizard of Oz at Muncie Civic Theatre, performed April 28 -May 6. I generated ideas with the director, Darrin Murrell, pulled costumes from Muncie Civic's extensive stock collection, made alterations as needed and built pieces from scratch as needed. I learned to accommodate for issues such as choreography and movement, quick changes, and theatrical enhancements. In addition, I learned to work with a budget and with a specific timeline for the show's requirements. The outcome of my project was a huge success. I received many compliments on the final costumes, and I gained quite a bit of insight to the costume process. I fulfilled all of my goals: utilizing skills learned from the classroom setting, gaining the experience of working with a live production and actualizing a concept through time and budget management.

40|$|Background: There is {{evidence}} that group therapy for people with aphasia is effective, but {{the skills needed to}} interact with people with aphasia are complex. There is also evidence that training and <b>guided</b> <b>experience</b> can improve the skills of family members and health professionals in communicating with people with aphasia. However, there is limited research into how student speech pathologists learn to develop the communication strategies that they will teach others to use when interacting with people with aphasia. Aim: This qualitative study aimed to explore perceptions of the student learning experience in aphasia group therapy of four student speech pathologists, their clinical educator and group members with aphasia. Methods & Procedures: Four student speech pathologists, three clients with aphasia and two spouses participated in four consecutive aphasia group therapy sessions under the supervision of a speech pathology clinical educator. Semi-structured interviews with each student and the clinical educator, following the first, third and final group session, were audio recorded. Following the final session, each participant with aphasia was also interviewed. The interviews were transcribed and qualitative content analysis was used to describe the perspectives of the participants. Outcomes & Results: Analysis of the interviews revealed that student perceptions of their experience were linked to their understanding of group therapy for aphasia, their understanding of the role of communication strategies and their ideas concerning saving face and discourse equality. Findings indicated a close alignment of the perspectives of students, clinical educator and participants with aphasia in their understanding of the contribution of aphasia group therapy to student learning and client benefits. Conclusions: The findings of the present study provide preliminary information for the development of educational practices relevant to speech pathology students preparing for work with people with aphasia. 19 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Many {{kinds of}} “my map ” {{applications}} {{allow us to}} create maps that display places we have visited, along with photographs, videos, texts, etc. We assume one of the next requirements {{for this kind of}} map application is to facilitate map-based storytelling. In relation to this requirement, the concept of geographical storytelling has been suggested (Cartwright 2004), in which users may construct their own story, or be “talked ” through an area. The objective {{of this paper is to}} identify and discuss the characteristics of map-based stories and the effectiveness of maps in editing them. We define a map-based story as follows:- The entire story is composed of a sequence of locations. - Each part of the story is conveyed so that it accompanies each location. - Story narration is recorded in the form of text, audio, movies, etc. - The order of the sequence that composes an entire story is pre-designed by the author. - For those watching it, the story basically progresses from start to finish automatically, or by just clicking buttons such as “next ” at each break point. As an example of map-based stories, Google Earth has a function to create a tour, which is a <b>guided</b> <b>experience</b> in which viewers fly from one location to another in accordance with pre-recorded navigation. Among stories created as Google Earth tours, “Map the Fallen ” (Askay 2010), which tells the story of soldiers who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, has gained a reputation for its impressive expression. As another unique example, “The 21 Steps ” (Cumming 2008) is a digital suspense novel written by a professional novelist. The entire story is told on Google Maps and unfolds across a map of the world as the reader follows the both the hero and his journey.
