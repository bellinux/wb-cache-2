40|$|One of the {{obstacles}} to progress in dairy cattle selection is that milk production traits are only expressed after the first calving. However, {{the use of the}} quantitative trait loci (QTL) technology will improve the efficiency of dairy industry with a positive image for the consumers. QTL are part of the genome showing a preponderant action and explaining the major part of variation of the trait production. At the present time, the two major strategies developed to detect such QTL are the candidate gene approach and the positional genetics approach. The somatotropic axis contains the most promising candidates in this respect, as it strongly regulates milk production. Then, the identification of favorable QTL associated with the somatotropic axis that are significantly correlated with <b>genetic</b> <b>merits</b> for milk production could lead to more effective selection programs.

The method used Ethnographic Decision Tree Modelling to elicit decision criteria {{used by the}} decision makers when making real-world decisions. The objectives of the research were to identify the main decision criteria or reasons for adopting the new breeds, and to identify the main decision criteria or reasons for rejecting the new breeds. Rather than using diffusion or economic models to study farmers' decision making, this research has presented an alternative approach to understand farmer's decisions {{from their point of}} view. The approach was called Ethnographic Decision Tree Modelling. Forty farmers consisting of 26 adopters and 14 non-adopters from different parts of the Canterbury Region were involved. Ethnographic interviews and participant observation were used to elicit decision criteria in order to build a decision tree. The decision tree model was also tested against an independent sample of 20 adopters and non-adopters in order to test the model's predictability. It is concluded that ethnographic decision tree modelling can be used to elicit the main criteria used by farmers in their decisions whether to adopt or reject agricultural innovations such as new sheep breeds. These decision criteria were either specific aspects or constraints which the farmers used in the decision processes from their own perspectives. These criteria were presented in a decision tree. The results showed that those farmers who believed that the new breeds of sheep could improve the <b>genetic</b> <b>merits</b> of their stock and expect to produce financial returns and did not have the constraints of time, ram availability and its cost would adopt the breeds. Those who did not believe that the breeds could improve the <b>genetic</b> <b>merits</b> would not adopt the breeds.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to estimate the effects of <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> for milk yield on energy balance, DM intake (DMI), and fertility for cows managed on three different grass-based feeding systems and to estimate possible interactions between <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> and feeding system. Individual animal intake estimates were obtained at pasture on 11 occasions across three grazing seasons. The data set contained 96 first lactation, 96 second lactation, and 72 third lactation cows in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. Half of these cows were of high <b>genetic</b> <b>merit,</b> and half were of medium <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> for milk solids production. Genetic effects for the traits of interest were estimated as the contrast between the two genetic groups and by the genetic regression of phenotypic performance on the estimated breeding value for fat and protein yield, based on pedigree index. Significant effects of feeding system were observed on yields, DMI, and energy balance, with no effect on live weight, condition score, or reproductive performance. The interaction between <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> and feeding system was not significantly different from zero for any of the traits. Yields, grass DMI, and total DMI were all higher for cows of high <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> than for those of medium <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> and were positively correlated (P < 0. 001) with pedigree index. Furthermore, condition score, conception to first and second services, and pregnancy rate were significantly negatively correlated with pedigree index.

An algorithm for derivative-free restricted maximum likelihood was developed based on Henderson 2 ̆ 7 s total-merit model that is the basis for a reduced number of equations. The same values for the logarithm of the likelihood can be calculated from components of the equations for the total-merit model and from components of the equations for the individual effects model.

Covariances between sire and maternal grandsire effects were modelled using a numerator relationship matrix based on male ancestors. Field data consisted of 23 953 records collected between 1989 and 1998 from 4741 herd-year-seasons. Variance and covariance components were estimated using two alternative approximate marginal maximum likelihood (MML) methods, {{one based on}} expectation-maximization (EM) and the other based on Laplacian integration. Inferences were compared to those based on three separate runs or sequences of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling {{in order to assess}} the validity of approximate MML estimates derived from data with similar size and design structure.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to add a maternal grandsire (MGS) effect to the existing sire model for national calving ease genetic evaluations. The Animal Improvement Programs Laboratory (AIPL) of USDA assumed responsibility for conducting the national ge-netic evaluation for calving ease and maintaining the associated database in 1999. Existing evaluations used a sire threshold model. Adding an MGS effect to the model was expected to improve accuracy by partially accounting for merit of mates and differences in mater-nal ability of the dams. Dystocia data were migrated to a relational database integrated with the AIPL pro-duction database. This database design allowed more rigorous data edits by comparison with the production data and improved MGS identification (ID) rate by uti-lizing pedigrees from the production records. Integra-tion of dystocia data with production data increased MGS ID rate from 58 to 73 %. In addition, nearly 200, 000 duplicate records were identified using the new edit system. Sire and sire-MGS models were compared using over 10 million observations available for the August 2002 national genetic evaluation. The sire model included herd-year, season, sex of calf, parity of dam, birth year group of sire, and sire. For the sire-MGS model, MGS and birth year group of MGS were added, year-seasons rather than seasons were used, and sex of calf and parity of dam were combined into a single interaction effect. Herd-year, sire, and MGS were random effects.

Methods A total of 297, 614 field records of CE, from 2000 to 2015, from first parity Holstein heifers were recorded initially. After necessary data pruning such as age at first calving (18 to 42 mo), gestation length, and presence of sire information, final datasets for CE consisted of 147, 526 and 132, 080 records for service sire calving ease (SCE) and daughter calving ease (DCE) evaluations, respectively. The CE categories were ordered and scores ranged from CE 1 to CE 5 (CE 1, easy; CE 2, slight assistance; CE 3, moderate assistance; CE 4, difficult calving; CE 5, extreme difficulty calving). A linear transformation of CE score was obtained on each category using Snell procedure, and a scaling factor was applied to attain the spread between 0 (CE 5) and 100 % (CE 1). A sire-maternal grandsire model analysis was performed using ASREML 3. 0 software package. Results The estimated direct heritability (h 2) from SCE and DCE evaluations were 0. 11 ± 0. 01 and 0. 08 ± 0. 01, respectively. Maternal h 2 estimates were 0. 05 ± 0. 02 and 0. 04 ± 0. 01 from SCE and DCE approaches, respectively. Estimates of genetic correlations between direct and maternal genetic components were − 0. 68 ± 0. 09 (SCE) and − 0. 71 ± 0. 09 (DCE). The average direct genetic effect increased over time, whereas average maternal effect was low and consistent. The estimated direct predicted transmitting ability (PTA) was desirable and increasing over time, but the maternal PTA was undesirable and decreasing. Conclusion The evidence on sufficient genetic variances in this study could reflect a possible selection improvement over time regarding ease of calving. It is expected that the estimated genetic parameters could be a valuable resource to formulate sire selection and breeding plans which would be directed towards the reduction of calving difficulty in Korean Holsteins...|$|R

Se encontró una relación estadísticamente significativa (p The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to establish the <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> for milk yield influence on energy balance, energy metabolic profiles and the postpartum ovarian resumption. In this research, 10 pure-Holstein Friesian dairy cows, varying in <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> values for milk yield and fed on a rotational-grazing system with a supplementary concentrate ration were used. A serial of examinations were performed on 10. 4 (± 2. 5), 21. 6 (± 4. 3), 31. 8 (± 4. 5), 42. 3 (± 4. 2), and 51. 9 (± 3. 9) postpartum days. In every sampling day animals were weighed by tape measure, their body condition score were calculated and the energy balance was estimated for every cow. In addition, blood serum tests were performed to analyze glucose and cholesterol blood concentration and an ultrasonographic assessment was executed to determine ovarian resumption. Nearly all cows had an ovarian resumption on the second week postpartum and more than a half had shown their first postpartum ovulation on the trial period. The <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> values for milk yield were not related with production values, therefore, the dependent variables of milk yield did not fluctuated with <b>genetic</b> <b>merit.</b> There was a significant negative relationship (p< 0. 05) between <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> for milk production and the nadir extent of net energy balance (NEB). Although, the <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> did not have significant influence on the number of days between calving to the nadir-attaining day, because high <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> cows as low <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> cows increased the intake and milk yield following similar patterns, but with different extents. In the same way, the <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> did not have significant relationship with the interval of calving to first ovulation. Furthermore, no one of the energy balance variables or blood metabolites influenced the interval of calving to first ovulation or the amount of follicles classified by size. In spite of these facts, the ovulating-cow group in the trial period had plasmatic cholesterol concentration significantly higher (p= 0. 07) and plasmatic glucose concentration significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than non-ovulating-cow group in the same period. These results suggest that, genetic improvement for milk production could influence the cow energy balance on early postpartum; in spite of these results, the <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> for milk production did not affect, by itself, the postpartum ovarian resumption...|$|E
40|$|Increases in <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> {{for milk}} yield are {{associated}} with increases in mobilization of body reserves. This study assessed the effects of genotype by environment (GxE) interactions on milk yield and energy and protein balances. Heifers (n = 100) with high or low <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> for milk yield were milked 2 or 3 {{times a day and}} received rations of low or high caloric density. The management factors were selected to induce substantial differences in milk production levels and model different management strategies. The 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement enables the assessment of the effects of genotype, environment, and GxE interactions. Mean daily energy-corrected milk production in the first 100 d in milk varied between 21. 8 and 35. 2 kg among the groups. The experimental factors affected milk production in the presumed direction. Ration was the most determinant factor on milk production. Effects of milking frequency and <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> were significant only in the groups that were fed rations with high caloric density. Signs for severe negative energy balances, protein balances, and low body condition scores, all of which may be indicative of health risks, were not concentrated in the highest producing cows. Feed caloric density and milking frequency had stronger effects on energy balances and protein balances, with unfavorable effects of low caloric density feed and an extra milking. This emphasizes the possible effect of mismanagement on animal health risks. High <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> cows had significantly lower postpartum body condition scores. Genotype x environment interactions existed, but more information is needed to determine if cows of different <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> for milk yield are differently at risk for disease under specific conditions. High milk production levels per se will increase allostatic load, but need not compromise the health status of relatively young cows. Ongoing one-sided selection for high yield may be combined with good animal health, but because high <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> for milk yield seems intrinsically connected to the allocation of resources from maintenance toward milk, this puts increasing demands on farmers¿ time and management skills...|$|E
40|$|Because not all animal factors {{influencing}} profitability can {{be included in}} total merit breeding indices for profitability, the association between animal total merit index and true profitability, taking cognisance of all factors associated with costs and revenues, is generally not known. One method to estimate such associations is at the herd level, associating herd average <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> with herd profitability. The objective {{of this study was}} to primarily relate herd average <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> for a range of traits, including the Irish total merit index, with indicators of performance, including profitability, using correlation and multiple regression analyses. Physical, genetic and financial performance data from 1131 Irish seasonal calving pasture-based dairy farms were available following edits; data on some herds were available for more than 1 year of the 3 -year study period (2007 to 2009). Herd average economic breeding index (EBI) was associated with reduced herd average phenotypic milk yield but with greater milk composition, resulting in higher milk prices. Moderate positive correlations (0. 26 to 0. 61) existed between <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> for an individual trait and average herd performance for that trait (e. g. <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> for milk yield and average per cow milk yield). Following adjustment for year, stocking rate, herd size and quantity of purchased feed in the multiple regression analysis, average herd EBI was positively and linearly associated with net margin per cow and per litre as well as gross revenue output per cow and per litre. The change in net margin per cow per unit change in the total merit index was h 1. 94 (s. e. 50. 42), which was not different from the expectation of h 2. This study, based on a large data set of commercial herds with accurate information on profitability and <b>genetic</b> <b>merit,</b> confirms that, after accounting for confounding factors, the change in herd profitability per unit change in herd <b>genetic</b> <b>merit</b> for the total merit index is within expectations. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is no {{reliable}} serum marker available to monitor incipient pancreas or islet-cell rejection. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} quantification of donorspecific genomic DNA in serum (from tissue damage) {{can serve as a}} marker of rejection. Methods: Using a recently developed panel of HLAspecific quantitative PCR assays (Q-PCR), we tested 158 sera from 42 pancreas-kidney transplant recipients. Temporally related biopsies for 65 sera permitted analysis for correlation of donor DNA concentrations with rejection. Results: Donor DNA concentrations were higher in sera from recipients who had experienced allograft rejection (n � 31) than from those who had not (n � 34). Median concentrations, expressed as the genome-equivalent (gEq) number of donor cells per 10 6 host cells, were 2613 and 59 gEq/ 10 6, respectively (P � 0. 03). Conclusion: Q-PCR for donor-specific <b>genetic</b> polymorphisms <b>merits</b> further investigation as a noninvasive approach to monitor pancreas-kidney as well as other types of allograft rejection...|$|R

40|$|Cross{{breeding}} {{is widely}} used in pig breeding to benefit from advantages of heterosis effects and breed complementarity. Breeding programs are specialized between sire and dam lines, with different selection objectives. Sire lines are mainly selected for production traits (e. g., growth, carcass quality, feed efficiency). Moreover, selection is often in purebred lines while the goal of selection is to improve crossbred performances. Hence, genetic selection of purebred parents involved in crossbreeding requires models accounting for crossbreeding effects, and able to combine data from different genetic types (purebreds and crossbreds) and different environmental conditions. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} thesis was to develop genetic models to estimate genetic parameters and breeding values for production traits in crossbred populations of pigs. A genetic model was developed to estimate the genetic potential of Walloon purebred Piétrain boars for growth performances in crossbreeding based on test station and on-farm data from purebred and crossbred pigs. Weight records from both systems were considered as different traits. Results showed that weights recorded in test station and on-farm were different traits but genetically correlated. Moreover, combining both sources of data allowed to increase reliability of estimated breeding values and Genotype x Environment interactions were detected for growth in the Walloon breeding program. The introduction of dominance effects, linked to crossbreeding, into the genetic model for growth in the crossbred population showed that dominance effects existed on growth of crossbred pigs. Moreover, the total and the additive <b>genetic</b> <b>merits</b> were better estimated than with a strictly additive model. Research conducted on commercial crossbred data from US Duroc sires displayed that the sire genetic effects were not negligible on traits like piglet birth weight, preweaning mortality, mortality at different stages of the grow-finishing period and hot carcass weight. Furthermore, sire genetic effects increased with age. Genetic studies of mortality in the population from US Duroc sires showed that mortality traits had a low heritability, increasing with age and that mortality was not antagonistic with market weight. Besides, genetic parameters estimated for birth weight and its relation with other production traits in crossbred populations from Piétrain and Duroc sires showed that birth weight could be used as an early indicator trait to improve latter performances. Finally, production traits were genetically correlated and should be selected simultaneously to reach the breeding goal...|$|R
