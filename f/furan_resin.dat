Interestingly, for the same catalyst concentration the index value also increases significantly with the period of ageing of the catalyst solution.

Temperature and the evolution of partial gas pressure have been analysed in moulds bonded with bentonite with or without the addition of seacoal, water glass or <b>furan</b> <b>resin.</b> Moulds were poured with ductile iron. For comparison, also tests with the grey iron have been executed. It was found that the gas atmosphere near the interface depends mainly on the content of a carbonaceous substance in the mould. In the green sand moulds with 5 % of seacoal or bonded with <b>furan</b> <b>resin,</b> after the mould filling, a sudden increase in the hydrogen content and the drop of oxygen is observed. This gas evolution results from the oxidation of carbon and reduction of water vapour in the mould material, and also from the reduction of water vapour and alloy reoxidation.

40|$|A full biocomposite was {{fabricated}} from Cordenka CR fibre and <b>furan</b> <b>resin.</b> High fibre mass fractions (FMF) {{were achieved}} by pressing the CR fibres into unidirectional sheets prior to {{incorporation into the}} resin. Results of testing indicated that the tensile properties of the biocomposite were improved by the initial increase of FMF from 51 to 64 %, with a subsequent increase of FMF to 75 % resulting in a deterioration of those properties. Examination of the tensile fracture surfaces with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed moderate deterioration in fibre-matrix adhesion after the initial increase of FMF. Further increase of the FMF to 75 % was shown by SEM to result in worse fibre-matrix adhesion. On the other hand, the flexural, interlaminar-shear, and dynamic mechanical properties were adversely affected by the increase in fibre-mass fraction from 51 through 75 %. These effects were mainly attributed to reduced fibre wetting that resulted in weakened fibre-matrix interfacial bonding and subsequent poor stress exchange at the fibre-matrix interface. Observations made with a digital microscope revealed normal crack behaviour in the laminated composite, and the shear fracture modes were I and II.

30|$|In theory, any PL changes, {{including}} the PL intensity, wavelength, anisotropy, or lifetime, {{in the presence}} of different concentration of specific analytes have potential for application in fluorescence-based sensing. To allow for interaction/binding with analytes, the surface of CDs needs to contain a specific chelating agent able to bind a specific analyte. Generally, the chelating agents on the surface of CDs can be designed through the introduction of functional groups during the synthesis process, post-functionalization, or integration with other molecules such as quenchers or fluorophores. Generally, most synthetic routes introduce functional groups on the surface of CDs, either from the precursors or solvent. For instance, in the hydrothermal synthesis of nitrogen-doped CDs from P. avium fruits, the carbonyl groups in the precursors react with ammonia forming ammonium salts [35]. At high temperature, the hydroxyl groups are dehydrated and converted into furfural derivatives. Subsequently, these derivatives polymerize and condensate, producing water-soluble polymers that undergo carbonization via aldol condensation, cycloaddition, and <b>furan</b> <b>resins,</b> producing fluorescent CDs. The as-synthesized CDs were decorated with functional groups such as carboxylic and hydroxyl groups, serving as a passivation layer and endowing the CDs with high water solubility and stability. At the same time, these functional groups can act as chelating agents for Fe 3 + metal ion sensing. Similarly, CDs prepared through microwave-assisted synthesis, electrochemical synthesis routes, chemical oxidation, and other synthetic methods can be decorated with functional groups that have specific binding affinity toward targeted analytes.|$|R

Investigations concerned producing of granules of the determineddimensions and strength parameters. Granules were formed from the dusts mixture consisting in 50 mass% of dusts obtained after the reclamation of the furane sands and in 50 mass % of dusts from sands with bentonite. Dusts from the bentonite sands with water were used as a binder allowing the granulation of after reclamation dusts from the furane sands. The following parameters of the ready final product were determined: moisture content (W), shatter test of granules (Wz) performeddirectly after the granulation process and after 1, 3, 5, 10 days and nights of seasoning, water-resistance of granules after 24 hours of being immersed in water, surface porosity ep and volumetric porosity ev. In addition the shatter test and water-resistance of granulate dried at a temperature of 105 oC were determined. Investigations were performed at the bowl angle of inclination 45 o, for three rotational speeds of the bowl being: 10, 15, 20 rpm.

40|$|Epoxy resins {{containing}} Diels-Alder (DA) furan and maleimide moieties {{are presented}} with the capability to self-heal after exposure to an external heat source. A conventional epoxy amine system has been combined with furfuryl and maleimide functional groups in a two-step process, to avoid major side-reactions, and the concentration of a thermo-reversibly binding cross-linker was considered to balance thermoset and thermoplastic behaviours, and the subsequent selfhealing performance. In the context of self-repair technologies an inbuilt ‘intrinsic’ self-healing system is deemed favourable as the healing agent can be placed in known ‘hot spot’ regions (i. e. skin-stringer run outs, ply drops and around drilled holes) where operational damage predominately occurs in load bearing aerospace structures. In this study, the mechanical and selfhealing performance of <b>furan</b> functionalised epoxy <b>resins</b> containing varying amounts (10, 20, 30 or 40 pph) of bismaleimide were investigated using a bulk epoxy polymer tapered double cantilever beam test specimen geometry.
