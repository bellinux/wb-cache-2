5|$|The two-story IDF outpost sat {{northwest}} of the junction. Two six-story Palestinian blocks (known as the twins or twin towers and described variously as offices or apartments) lay directly behind it. South of the junction, diagonally across from the IDF, there was a Palestinian National Security Forces outpost {{under the command of}} Brigadier-General Osama al-Ali, a member of the Palestine National Council. The concrete wall that Jamal and Muhammad crouched against was <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> building; the spot was less than 120 metres from the most northerly point of the Israeli outpost.|$|E
5|$|The {{first was}} floor was {{accessed}} via the main staircase, {{situated in the}} east tower. The first room encountered was the great hall, which rose three floors. To the viewer's immediate left was a kitchen (with clerestory lighting), and further on to the left was a butlery and pantry with a garderobe. To the viewer's back right was a small passage containing a private staircase and {{the entrance to the}} oratory (its roof vaulted with an east window) in the east tower. The oratory was entered via a five-and-a-half high pointed-arch doorway and contained an altar and piscina, of which only an ornamental niche remains. There was a fireplace on the north wall of the great hall and behind the north wall was the great chamber containing a fireplace, garderobe and a window seat on the east wall. To the west of the hall {{was the head of the}} west window. The portcullis is believed to have been raised into the hall <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> window.|$|E
25|$|Klee {{created in}} 1940 a picture which {{strongly}} {{differs from the}} previous works, leaving it unsigned on the scaffold. The comparatively realistic still life, Ohne Titel, later named as Der Todesengel (Angel of Death), depicts flowers, a green pot, sculpture and an angel. The moon on black ground is separated from these groups. During his 60th birthday Klee was photographed <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> picture.|$|E

25|$|This {{is a small}} {{entrance}} {{seems to}} be developed by breaking main wall (outer boundary) at latter stage by the locals as a short passage to an adjacent jungle. There is a bastion next to this gate. There is also located a dipilated pond <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> gate within the fort, since {{the construction of the}} fort, for this reason it is now called “Sar Gate” as “Sar” means water pond.|$|E
25|$|His dispositions were {{anchored}} on {{the right}} on the subsidiary dike which runs parallel with the sea dike at Petten. Then they ran east along the dike of the Zijpe polder, with reinforcements at the villages of Krabbendam, Eenigenburg, and Sint Maarten, and finally at the Oude Sluys {{on the coast of}} (then) the Zuyder Zee (the Wieringermeer polder did not yet exist in those days). The villages <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> line, like Schagen were occupied as outposts.|$|E
25|$|Structure L5-1 is {{a ruined}} {{building}} {{on the east side}} of the plaza containing a vaulted crypt 9meters beneath its summit. Inside were found the remains of an individual wearing a heavy jade collar and wristlets accompanied by offerings of fine painted ceramics and almost 400pieces of shell mosaic that once formed a headdress. Due to the nearby Stela8, positioned <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> structure and containing a text relating the life, death and burial of king Itzamnaaj K'awiil, the tomb is presumed to be that of this king.|$|E

25|$|Villach – Apart {{from a few}} {{fragments}} of wall, tower and evidence for a moat at the NW corner of the defensive circuit, none of the walls or gates now survive. Merian’s plan of the town in 1649 and the prospect view of 1679 show extensive fortifications.There were six gate towers and a defended bridgehead across the river Drau. The bridgehead was walled with a further gate-tower and a bastion in front. The river Drau curves round Villach, and on the river frontage there was a single wall, but on the western and southern sides there was a secondary wall with a series round towers. <b>In</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> secondary wall there was a wide moat fed by the Drau.|$|E
25|$|Friesach – The site of {{town was}} given by Ludwig the German to the Archbishop of Salzburg in 860 AD, and the town later housed the Archbishop’s mint. The town defences were {{the subject of a}} notable early study by A Essenwein in 1863. An {{impressive}} town wall, 11 metres high, in three angled lengths, runs from the ruins of the Petersburg Castle in the NW to the Vergilienberg Castle in the S. This is {{on the east side of}} the town and <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> wall is a secondary wall surrounded with moat filled with water- the three gate towers have been demolished. On the west side, walls still remain linking a further small castle, the Rotturm, to the other two castles.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the early}} colonial art stemmed from the codices (Aztec {{illustrated}} books), aiming to recover and preserve some Aztec and other Amerindian iconography and history. From then, artistic expressions in Mexico were mostly religious in theme. The Metropolitan Cathedral still displays works by Juan de Rojas, Juan Correa and an oil painting whose authorship {{has been attributed to}} Murillo. Secular works of art of this period include the equestrian sculpture of Charles IV of Spain, locally known as El Caballito ("The little horse"). This piece, in bronze, was the work of Manuel Tolsá and it has been placed at the Plaza Tolsá, in front of the Palacio de Mineria (Mining Palace). Directly <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> building is the beautiful Museo Nacional de Arte (Munal) (the National Museum of Art).|$|E

25|$|On {{the south}} side {{there is a small}} stone church built into the Cathedral. This is a {{symbolic}} copy of the Chapel of Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Built between the end of the 13th and the beginning the 14th centuries, it was erected here to mark Svetitskhoveli as the second most sacred place in the world (after the church of Jerusalem), thanks to Christ’s robe. <b>In</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> stone chapel, the most westerly structure aligned with the columns between the aisle and the nave marks Sidonia’s grave. Remains of the original life-giving pillar are also here. It was built in the 17th century. Scenes of the lives of King Mirian and Queen Nana, and portraits of the first Christian Byzantine Emperor, Constantine I, and his mother Helena, were painted by G. Gulzhavarashvili at that time. Traces of the foundations of the 4th-century church have been found here.|$|E
25|$|In {{some regions}} of the country milk is offered along with {{crystallized}} sugar, rice pudding (kheer in local parlance). A special feature is of offering a lotus flower which is placed in a silver bowl. <b>In</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> bowl, a rangoli (coloured design pattern) of snake is created on the floor with a brush made of wood or clay or silver or gold with sandalwood or turmeric paste as the paint. The design pattern will resemble a five hooded snake. Devotees then offer worship to this image on the floor. In villages, the anthills where the snakes are thought to reside, are searched. Incense is offered to the anthill as prayer along with milk (a myth of folk lore to feed milk to the snakes) to ensnare snakes {{to come out of the}} anthill. After this, milk is poured into the hole in the anthill as a libation to the snake god.|$|E
25|$|Inigo Jones {{had brought}} the {{classical}} renaissance style to England in the early 17th century. His followers took the new classical style into the country, characterised by its symmetry and proportion and such classical elements as pilasters, while wide eaves took {{the place of a}} cornice. Often a bricklayer would also be the principal contractor, controlling the other trades, and he could avoid the necessity to employ a mason for stonework if he could produce the classical elements in brick. So in this house we have brick pilasters, one above the other, with capitals and bases shaped in brickwork. The rebuilding seems to have been carried out in two stages, though without a long gap between them. There is a straight joint in the brickwork {{to the left of the}} second pilaster on the north side. <b>In</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> the bricks are laid in English bond, but Flemish bond is used towards the back, indicating that this part was built a little later.|$|E
50|$|On {{the south}} side on the pendopo, there are three {{miniature}} temples with a square stone basin <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> it. <b>This</b> small temple probably served a religious purpose, {{as some kind of}} Hindu or Buddhist shrine in the Ratu Boko complex.|$|R

25|$|From 1930 to 1975, the Great Falls High School {{building}} housed Paris Gibson Junior High School. The north entrance {{was closed}} in the 1940s after the front steps were discovered to be sinking. The driveway <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> entrance was removed in the 1970s and replaced with sod. The south entrance {{was used as the}} main entrance after 1940. In the late 1960s, while repairs to the structure's roof were being made, a student broke into the building and climbed atop the elevator. He rode the elevator to the roof. But he touched a power line as he climbed off the elevator, giving him a severe electrical shock and causing his shirt to catch fire. He survived with minimal injuries. Another accident occurred shortly before the building was {{closed in the}} 1970s. A student in the gymnasium (which was housed in the brick annex), attempted to do chin-ups on a water pipe. The pipe snapped, causing the gym to be flooded.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} {{it was used}} as barracks, a {{tenement}} and tobacco warehouse. From 1864 to 1949, it {{was used as the}} state penitentiary. In 1949 the building was converted into the Museo Regional de Guanajuato, documenting the history of the area and its role in Mexican national history from the pre-Hispanic period to the present divided among fourteen halls on the upper floor. The ground floor there are large mascarons of José Mariano Jiménez, Vicente Guerrero, Ignacio Allende and Ignacio Aldama. The main hall has mascarons of Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos y Pavón who “guard” the national coat of arms. <b>In</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> an eternal flame that is renewed each 28 September. The walls of the main stairwell contain mural work by José Chávez Morado that alludes to Independence. It houses a large collection of ceramics from western parts of Mesoamerica, especially from Chupícuaro. It contains works by Guanajuato artist Hermeneguildo Bustos and photographer Romualdo García. There are displays related to the building itself, in its construction, its original function as a granary and its role in one of the first battles of the War of Independence. The large courtyard within the Alhondiga is a traditional place to celebrate Mexico’s Independence Day with the reenactment of Miguel Hidalgo’s “El Grito de Dolores.” It is one of the sites for a number of the events of the Festival Cervantino. The museum was restored in 2010 for the Bicentennial by the INAH at a cost of 5.7 million pesos as part of similar museums in Dolores Hidalgo and San Miguel de Allende to form the Ruta de Independencia (Independence Route). The work was the first renovation of the building in 20 years.|$|E
