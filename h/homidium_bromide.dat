40|$|The efficacies {{of three}} {{trypanocidal}} drugs, diminazene aceturate, isometamidium chloride and <b>homidium</b> <b>bromide,</b> were evaluated in four representative areas of Cote d'Ivoire with different production systems, degree of integration of different trypanosomosis control approaches {{and delivery of}} veterinary inputs. Herds were selected as follows: (i) twelve traditional, sedentary herds around Boundiali {{with a mixture of}} cattle genotypes, dominantly crosses between trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible cattle: (ii) eleven groups of Zebu cattle at the Ferkessedougou feedlot, originating dominantly from Mali {{at the time of the}} experiments; (iii) fifteen private N'Dama cattle herds in the Bouake area: (iv) sixteen herds of N'Dama cattle at the Marahouse State Ranch. Groups of animals or herds in the four locations were systematically treated with one of the three drugs at given doses (3. 5 mg/kg or 7 mg/kg for diminazene aceturate, 0. 5 or 1 mg/kg for isometamidium chloride and 1 mg/kg for <b>homidium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Screening for relapse of infection post treatment was done either at 3 week intervals in three sites, or at monthly intervals in the Boundiali area by the buffy coat parasite detection technique. Failures of at least one of the three drugs to control trypanosome infection were observed to a vary ing degree in all but one location. Table 1 indicates the frequency of recurrent infections in the four regions. There was evidence of drug resistance for all three drugs in Boundiali (Coulibaly et al., this volume), for diminazene aceturate and isometamidium chloride, the two drugs tested in Ferkessedougou (Atse et al., this volume), and for <b>homidium</b> <b>bromide</b> in Bouake. Most parasitaemias detected in cattle in Boundiali were associated with T. vivax (86 percent). The prevalence of T. congolense had previously been reduced through the introduction of tsetse control in the location. Trypanosoma vivax was also more prevalent than T. congolense in cattle sampled at Ferkessedougou. Further south T. congolense was the dominant species and in one herd in Bouake with a high prevalence of trypanosomes a large number of relapses occurred to <b>homidium</b> <b>bromide.</b> At Marahoue Ranch the prevalence of recurrent infection was less than 5 percent. In conclusion: there was evidence for resistance to all three trypanocidal drugs at Boundiali and to isometamidium at Ferkessedougou in cattle imported from southern Mali; at Ferkessedougou, a dose of 7 mg/kg body weight seemed necessary for successful application of diminazene; both T. congolense and T. vivax species appeared to express resistance to the three trypanocidal drugs in the tsetse controlled area of Boundiali, it might be difficult to control the residual T. vivax population; further south, there was less evidence of resistance to the three trypanocidal drugs, except possible for homidium at Bouake. The self-cure ability of the N'Dama may have helped to prevent evidence for drug resistance being revealed in this area...|$|E
2500|$|Ethidium bromide {{is thought}} {{to act as a}} mutagen because it intercalates double {{stranded}} DNA (i.e., inserts itself between the strands), deforming the DNA. This could affect DNA biological processes, like DNA replication and transcription. [...] Ethidium bromide {{has been shown to be}} mutagenic to bacteria via the Ames test, but only after treatment with liver homogenate, which simulates the metabolic breakdown of the molecule being tested. The lack of detected mutagenicity without liver homogenate indicates that ethidium bromide is not directly mutagenic, but that its metabolites are. [...] The identity of these mutagenic metabolites are unknown. [...] The National Toxicology Program states it is nonmutagenic in rats and mice. These conclusions are supported by a subchronic carcinogenicity study in mice, whereby no mutagenic effects were detected. Ethidium <b>bromide</b> (<b>Homidium</b> brand) use in animals to treat trypanosome infection suggests that toxicity and mutagenicity are not high. [...] Studies have been conducted in animals to evaluate EtBr as a potential antitumorigenic chemotherapeutic agent. Its chemotherapeutic use is due to its toxicity to mitochondria. A more recent study shows that EtBr acts as a topoisomerase I poison, just like several anticancer drugs used in humans. [...] The above studies do not support the commonly held idea that ethidium bromide is a potent mutagen in humans, but they do indicate that it can be toxic at high concentrations.|$|R

This indicated that cattle suffer due to T. vivax is quite prevalence in the area, the rate is high with seasonality. The trypanocidal drug resistance studies of T. vivax stock isolated from non-tsetse area were conducted in 32 goats. Trypanocidal drug tested were <b>Homidium</b> <b>bromide</b> (16 goats). The doses tested for <b>homidium</b> <b>bromide</b> were the recommended treatment dose of 0. 5 /kg body weight and double that dose. The doses tested for diminazine aceturate were the recommended treatment dose (7 mg/kg). The T. vivax stocks tested against both drugs relapsed indicating the development of drug resistance against both drugs at the tested doses. Both groups of goat treated showed significant reduction in PCV Hb. WBC and RBCs count. The pathological effect of T. vivax stocks isolated from non tsetse area was conducted by experimental infection of 10 Kenana calves.

40|$|Twelve {{traditional}} {{herds of}} cattle {{in the area}} of Boundiali, northern Cote d'Ivoire, were examined monthly from 1990 to 1992 for the presence of trypanosomes. The herds were randomised into 3 treatment groups, cattle in 4 herds received diminazene aceturate at 3. 5 or 7 mg/kg body weight (b. w.) when detected parasitaemic; cattle in 4 herds received isometamidum chloride at 0. 5 or 1 mg/kg when detected parasitaemic; and cattle in 4 herds <b>homidium</b> <b>bromide</b> at 1 mg/kg when detected parasitaemic. Thirty one percent of 236 cases that were parasitaemic and treated were parasitaemic at the next month's sample when treated with diminazene aceturate or within two months when treated with isometamidium chloride or <b>homidium</b> <b>bromide.</b> This percentage was much higher than the monthly incidence of new infections (mean 4 percent, 85 percent of infections T. vivax, 15 percent T. congolense) and suggested that approximately 27 percent of infections may have been drug resistant. Some animals continued to be detected parasitaemic over several months. In order to relate the number of detected parasitaemias to the number of spearate individual infections. an estimated new infection was defined as a case of parasitaemia preceded by at least two months without detection of the same species of trypanosome. The infections were then examined to determine the proportion that may have recurred. There {{were no significant differences in}} rates of recurrence of infection among the three drugs (20 / 68 (29 percent) for diminazene aceturate, 15 / 39 (38 percent) foor isometamidum chloride, and 18 / 62 (29 percent) for homidium bromie) or between different doses for each drug. However, when cattle greater than 36 months of age were compared with those less than 36 months of age, the mean treatment failure rate in the older cattle was half that in younger cattle (22 percent and 41 percent, respectively; x 2 = 8. 1, P< 0. 01). This implies that the overall failure rate of the drugs to cure infections presumably due to drug resistance, was compensated to some extent by an acquired immunity to trypanosomal infections as the animals grew older...|$|E

All animals originated from or grazed during transhumance in south west Mali. The groups were assigned to different treatment regimes {{as they enter the}} feed lot. All animals of six groups were treated with diminazene aceturate {{on the first day of}} sampling, three groups at a dose of 3. 5 mg/kg and three groups at 7 mg/kg body weight. Similarly three groups were treated with isometamidium chloride at a dose of 0. 5 mg/kg. As the feed lot ceased its operations, only one group was treated with the same drug at a dose of 1 mg/kg and an 11 th group was treated with <b>homidium</b> <b>bromide</b> at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Every animal was thus treated with either diminazene aceturate, isometamidum chloride or <b>homidium</b> <b>bromide</b> at the time of first sampling and with a "sanative pair" if detected parasitaemic again. No animals were detected parasitaemic at any time in the one group initially treated with homidium. Five animals were detected parasitaemic at week 0 in two groups treated with isometamidium chloride at 1 mg/kg bodyweight. Two of these animals were detected parasitaemic again, one at 3 weeks and one at 12 weeks following treatment. Infections were then treated with dimianzene aceturate at 7 mg/kg body weight and apparently cured. No animals were detected parasitaemic at any time in the other two groups treated with isometamidium chloride diminazene aceturate at 3. 5 mg/kg, and in 2 of the 22 animals detected parasitaemic 3 and receiving diminazene aceturate at 7 mg/kg body weight. There was 15 subsequent cases of parasitaemia in animals first treated with diminazene aceturate at 3. 5 mg/kg body weight that were sampled on at least three occasions following further treatment with isometamidum chloride. Parasitaemia was detected again in 8 animals (53 percent) within 9 weeks of treatment. These results provide evidence of a problem of drug resistance to isometamidum having developed among trypanosomes in two of the eleven groups of animals. Diminazene aceturate at 3. 5 mg/kg body weight had apparently failed to cure infections in 14 animals in these two groups. there was however less evidence of drug failure when the higher dose of 7 mg/kg body weight was used in two other groups...|$|E

Cattle in this area have long been affected by tsetse-borne trypanosome infections. The causative organism, Trypanosoma brucei brucei was first identified by Bruce in the late 1800 ’s.

Four sentinel herds were selected from populations exposed to similar trypanosome challenges. The baseline trypanosome incidence rate was determined for each herd, after which each herd was subjected to a different trypanosome control measure. Two of the herds were subjected to topical pyrethroid treatment (Cyfluthrin pour-on and Flumethrin plunge-dip) as vector-control measures, one herd was treated 6 weekly with an injectable trypanocidal drug (isometamidium hydrochloride), and one herd served as an untreated control group. Monthly incidence rates were determined using the ‘dark-ground buffy smear technique’. The monthly incidence rates were standardized in order to account for variation in trypanosomosis challenge between the 4 herds. The standardized rates were then compared and the impact of the control strategies was quantified using the Area Under The Curve method. The cost efficacy of each control strategy was evaluated based on a partial budget system. Both the cyfluthrin pour-on and the injectable trypanocide were cost effective and had a dramatic trypanosomosis control effect with the pour-on having the greater impact/ control. The flumethrin plunge-dip displayed moderate trypanosomosis control properties, but proved not to be cost effective. Dissertation (MSc (Veterinary Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|Control of trypanosomes in cattle, {{sheep and}} goats in endemic areas has {{depended}} largely {{on the use of}} chemotherapeutic or chemoprophylactic agents. One such agent is homidium. The normal use of homidium has been in the treatment of infections due to both Trypanosoma congolense and T. vivax in cattle, {{sheep and goats}} at the recommended does rate of 1. 0 mg kg- 1 b. w. This paper describes the results of an investigation into the chemotherapeutic activity of homidium against T. congolense infections in cattle. Two groups of five Boran cattle were infected with two populations of T. Congolense; one drug-sensitive IL 1180 and one drug-resistant (IL 3330). Parasitaemia was estimated using the methods of Murray et al. (1977); the serum drug levels by the method described by Murilla (1996) and the pharmacokinetic parameters using the formulae described by Baggot (1977). After infection, there was a rapid drop in packed cell volume (PCV) values from a mean pre-infection value of approximately 40 % to approximately 25 % within 14 days of infection in cattle infected with IL 1180. However, in cattle infected with IL 3330, the drop in PCV was more gradual from approximately 40 % to approximately 30 % within the same period of time. The animals were treated with <b>homidium</b> <b>bromide</b> at a dose rate of 1. 0 mg kg- 1 body weight (b. w.) seven days after the last animal in each group was detected positive. Following intermuscular (i. m.) treatment of cattle infected with drug-sensitive trypanosomes, no parasites were detected in the bloodstream of four out of five cattle within 24 hours; the fifth within 48 hours. During this period and for the next 10 days after treatment, an accelaration in the rate of drug elimination was observed. Thereafter, the rate of elimination reverted back to that observed in Non-infected cattle (Murilla, 1996). This was accompanied by an elevation in PCV to pre-infection values. The animals remained aparasitaemic up {{to the end of the}} 90 days observation period with low serum drug concentrations of between 0. 1 and 0. 3 ng ml- 1 in circulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of seven populations of T. congolense to the salts of three trypanocides, diminazene, isometamidium and homidium, were determined in vitro using in vitro-derived metacyclic trypanosomes. The trypanosomes were incubated at 35 degree centigrade for 48 hours with various drug concentrations (0. 5 ng- 50 ug/ml) and {{then transferred to}} cultures containing bovine endothelial-cell monolayers, to assess their viability over the following 5 days as compared to control trypanosomes that had been incubated without drug. The sensitivity to each drug was expressed as the minimum effective drug concentration which killed 100 percent of the trypanosomes in a given population within the 5 days. Using this assay, population IL 1180, characterised as being highly sensitive to all three drugs in vivo, required 10 ng/ml isometamidium chloride, 50 ng/ml <b>homidium</b> <b>bromide</b> or chloride and 5000 ng/ml diminazene aceturate to kill the entire population in vitro. In contrast, two derivatives of IL 1180 in which resistance to isometamidium had been induced in mice, IL 3343 and IL 3344, required isometamidium chloride at a concentration of 1000 ng/ml and 2000 ng/ml, respectively, to eliminate the populations. The in vitro {{results showed that the}} increase in level of resistance to isometamidium in these populations was associated with at least a 200 -fold increase in resistance in both populations to homidium, but no increase in resistance to diminazene. KE 2887 and CP 81, two isolates expressing high levels of resistance to both isometamidium and homidium in mice and cattle, were both resistant in vitro to isometamidium chloride and homidium salts at 100 ng/ml. Furthermore, while the former population was resistant to 10 000 ng/ml diminazene aceturate, the latter was sensitive to 5000 ng/ml. IL 3274 and IL 3330, characterised as expressing high levels of resistance to all three drugs in vivo, were shown to be resistant to isometamidium chloirde and homidium salts at 1000 ng/ml, and to diminazene aceturate at 10 000 ng/ml. Finally, the in vitro IC 100 (concentration of drug required to eliminate 100 percent of the population) results were consistent with the maximum amounts of each drug detected in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Isometamidium {{chloride}} (Samorin Trypamidium), diminazene aceturate (Berenil, Veriben), homidium chloride (Novidium), <b>homidium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Ethidium) and the salts of quinapyramine (Trypacide, Triquin) are all anti-trypanosomal {{compounds that}} are routinely used in domestic livestock. However, the salts of quinapyramine {{are restricted to}} use in horses and camels. All four compounds {{have been used in}} the field for at least 35 years and the incidence of resistance to each compound appears to be increasing. Furthermore, in some instances, multiple-drug resistance has been Reported and is a particular threat to livestock production. Because isometamidium, homidium, diminazene and quinapyramine are chemically closely related, cross-resistance has been suggested to occur between a number of these compounds and may therefore contribute to the multiple-drug resistance phenotypes observed in the field. However a clear definition of the cross-resistance relationships has not been possible {{due to the lack of}} trypanosome populations in which resistance to individual trypanocides has been unequivocally induced. Trypanosoma congolense IL 1180 is a cloned population that expressed a high level of sensitivity to isometamidium chloride, quinapyramine sulphate, homidium chloride and diminazene aceturate; the dose required to cure 50 percent of infected mice (CD 50 value) are 0. 018 mg/kg body weight (b. w.), 0. 23 mg/kg b. w., 0. 37 mg/kg b. w. and 2. 3 mg/kg b. w., respectively. In the work described here repeated subcurative treatment of infected Swiss white mice with either isometamidium chloride (Samorin) or quinapyramine sulphate (Trypacide) was used to independently increase the resistance of T. congolense IL 1180 to these two compounds. In the first experiment the resistance of T. congolense IL 1180 to isometamidium was increased to a CD 50 of 1. 7 mg/kg b. w. over an 11 -month period of drug selection to produce a population designated t. congolense IL 3343. Trypanosoma congolense IL 3341 and T. congolense IL 3342 were intermediate populations produced after 5 and 7 months drug selection, respectively. In order to determine whether Development of resistance to isometamidium resulted in cross-resistance to other anti-trypanosomal compounds, T. congolense IL 3343 was characterised in mice for its sensitivity to diminazene aceturate, homidium chloride and quinapyramine sulphate and had CD 50 values of 7. 8 mg/kg b. w., 12. 1 mg/kg b. w., respectively. Thus, a 94 -fold increase in resistance to isometamidium chloride was associated with a 3 -fold increase in resistance to diminazene, a 33 -fold increase in resistance to homidium, and a 4 -fold increase in resistance to quinapyramine. Values for T. congolense IL 3341 and T. congolense IL 3342 were intermediate between those of T. congolense IL 1180 and T. congolense IL 3343. In a second study, resistance to quinapyramine sulphate was induced in T. congolense IL 1180 over a 7 -month period of drug selection, resulting in a population designated T. congolense IL 1180 /Stabilate 12. This population had a quinapyramine sulphate CD 50 of > 9. 6 mg/kg b. w., and diminazene aceturate, homidium chloride and isometamidium chloride CD 50 values of 12. 7 mg/kg b. w., 10. g mg/kg b. w. and 0. 10 mg/kg b. w., respectively (Table 2). Thus, an approximately 40 -fold increase in resistance to quinapyramine was associated with a 6 -fold increase in resistance to isometamidium, 1 28 -fold increase in resistance to homidium and a 6 -fold increase in resistance to diminazene. In summary, these data indicate that Development of resistance to isometamidium in T. congolense IL 1180 was associated with a high level of cross-resistance to homidium, but low levels of cross-resistance to diminazene and quinapyramine. In contrast, the present data and those from goats indicate that Development of resistance to quinapyramine in the same trypanosome clone was associated with relatively high levels of cross-resistance to isometamidium, homidium and diminazene. These data therefore confirm the rationale for using isometamidium and diminazene as a "sanative" combination, and indicate that the use of quinapyramine in cattle, sheep and goats is contra-indicated since Development of resistance to the compound results in relatively high levels of cross-resistance to all three anti-trypanosomal compounds recommended for use in these livestock species. Finally, since resistance to diminazene is difficult to induce experimentally with diminazene, and such resistance usually occurs in the field as part of a multiple-resistance phenotype (Peregrine, 1994) ...|$|E

A trial for the treatment of T. evansi with Cymelarsan supplemented with zinc and copper was also conducted. Parasitological, clinical and pathological investigations were also made. Drugs under experimentation were also studied for their residual status. The study consisted of 10 experiments conducted in 380 Nubian goats and 65 camels (Camels dromedarius), divided randomly into different groups of both sexes each of ten goats and five camels. Three groups were defined as control groups such as uninfected, untreated group, infected with T. evansi or T. vivax were also used. The infection was done first in 5 albino rats in both sexes, and then the animals were infected after many passages with rats’ blood each experiment was taken from 79 - 86 days. These ten experiments targeted: (1) Toxicity and efficacy of CymelarsanR in goats infected with T. evansi at single and multiple doses. (2) Toxicity and efficacy of oxytetracycline in goats infected with T. evansi and given single and multiple dosages of oxytetracycline. (3) Efficacy and clinicopathological effects of Cymelarsan and oxytetracycline in goats infected with T. evansi (4) Clinicopathological effects and efficacy of Cymelarsan in Nubian goats infected with T. evansi, supplemented with zinc and copper.

Various parameters pertaining to existence or removal of parasites from blood as well as survival or death and the experimental animals have been recorded with respect to the drug given alone singular or in combination. Liver impression smears indicated parasitaemia in the different experimental groups. A number of clinical signs were observed in goats in different groups with respect to hypothermia and various manifestations and thriftiness or posture and state of health. Post treatment all goats dosed with Cymelarsan showed swelling at injection site which disappeared after 1 - 2 days in a few goats but never in other majority of the groups. Severity of the clinical signs developed with the high dosing of the drugs. Some goats showed decrease in body temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate, body weight and blood pressure, others showed severe signs, including lacrimation, nasal discharge, shivering, and pyrexia, loss of appetite, keratitis, diarrhoea, weak respiration and pulse rate. Some camels exhibited crying sounds Pharmacotoxicity of some trypanocidal drugs in food animals (Nubian goats and camels) and restlessness with episodes of diarrhoea whereas in goats most prevalent lesions were congestion, oedema and haemorrhage and frothing at the mouth plus necrosis of livers and kidneys in addition to nephritis, gastritis, enteritis, peritonitis and hydroperitoneum, spleenomegaly, and orchitis post infection. Post treatment these signs disappeared in some groups while in other groups they remained with different severities. Similar observations were made with respect to histopathological findings pre and post dosing. Minor effects were noticed with respect to haematocrit parameters and minerals and enzymatic activity. Residues of Cymelarsan were measured by determination of arsenic. The residue of Cymelarsan, OTC and quinapyramine was measured in serum, organs (liver, kidney, heart, lung, spleen, cerebellum, cerebrum, fat, site of injection, leg muscle, uterus, ovary and testis), bile and urine. Generally the drug concentration increased when the dose is increased. The residual status of Cymelarsan, quinapyramine and OTC was studied and relevant data obtained. Serum arsenic (for Cymelarsan) values were monitored under the various circumstances. Kinetics of these drugs was studied with respect to different manipulations...|$|E
