40|$|Twenty-four {{patients}} with intra-peritoneal infections were studied sequentially to evaluate neutrophil chemotaxis, spontaneous migration, and chemiluminescence. In six patients, infection {{was due to}} spontaneous disease processes and 18 others, infection was a sequel of intra-abdominal operation. In the patients studied prior to drainage, operation chemotaxis, spontaneous migration and chemiluminescence were all significantly <b>depressed.</b> <b>Operation</b> resulted in a further depression of these functions, and recovery of neutrophil migratory responses was delayed for two weeks. During the period of functional depression, 16 patients developed recurrent infections (nine episodes of intra-abdominal abscess, and 12 episodes of extra-abdominal infection). These infection were associated with a fall-off in neutrophil migratory and chemiluminescence responses prior to clinical evidence of infection. This study suggests that the delayed recovery of neutrophil function {{may be related to}} the recurrent infection seen in this patient population. Further, monitoring of neutrophil function in patients recovering from intra-abdominal infection may provide early evidence of recurrent infection...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of high-power gyrotrons (118 GHz, 140 GHz) in continuous-wave (CW) operation for heating nuclear fusion plasmas {{has been in}} progress for several years in a joint collaboration between different European research institutes and industrial partners. The 140 -GHz gyrotron being under development for the installation at the W 7 -X stellarator now under construction at the IPP Greifswald, Germany, operates in the TE 28, 8 mode and {{is equipped with a}} diode type magnetron injection electron gun, an improved beam tunnel, a high mode- purity low-Ohmic loss cavity, an optimized nonlinear up-taper, a highly efficient internal quasi-optical mode converter, a single-stage depressed collector and An edge-cooled, single disk CVD-diamond window. RF measurements at pulse duration of a few milliseconds yielded an RF output power of 1. 15 MW at a beam current of 40 A and a beam voltage of 84 W. <b>Depressed</b> collector <b>operation</b> has been possible up to decelerating voltages of 33 kV without any reduction of the output power. Long pulse operation (10 s at 1 MW) was possible without any signs of a limitation caused by the tube. For this output power the efficiency of the tube could be increased from about 30 % without to about 50 % with depression voltage. The best performance reached so far has produced an energy per pulse as high as 90 MJ (power 0. 64 MW, pulse length 140 s) which is the highest value achieved in gyrotrons operating at this frequency and power level. The pulse-length limitations so far are mainly due to the external system...|$|R
40|$|B {{lymphocyte}} function m vitro {{was measured}} in patients undergoing open-heart surgery. Conventional balanced anaesthesia, or high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia was used. Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) induced lymphocyte transformation was depressed {{at the end of}} the operation, but the response to formalinized Stapkylococcus aurtut Cowan I (StaCw) was not. The numbers of immunoglobulin producing and secreting cells measured by an indirect protein A plaque-forming cell assay decreased after PWM-stimulation, but remained unchanged after StaCw stimulation {{at the end of the}} operation. IgG, IgM and IgA secretion by PWM- and StaCw-stimulated lymphocytes, into the culture medium, was depressed in the period after <b>operation.</b> <b>Depressed</b> immnrw functions occurred after open-heart surgery, but not in association with anaesthesia alone before surgery. The decreases were not mediated by hydrocortisone-sensitive suppressor cells. Minor differences between the two anaesthetic techniques were found in lymphocyte proliferative responses. Anaesthesia and surgery affect the immune defence mechanisms, but it has been shown that anaesthesia per se has either none, or only minor immunological effects. In contrast, surgical trauma can cause im...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of the reticuloendothelial (RE) system may be <b>depressed</b> by surgical <b>operation.</b> As this system is an important defence mechanism against tumour growth and metastasis, {{it would be an}} advantage if this depression could be prevented by the administration of a suitable agent. The agents studied in this case were levamisole, Corynebacterium parvum (C. parvum) and glucan. As a measure of RE function a carbon clearance test was performed in rats, 1 hr after partial colectomy, animals having received pre-operative treatment with one of these substances. The results show that operation produced a significant fall in clearance (P less than 0. 001). Both C. parvum and glucan were very effective in preventing any fall of clearance following operation (P less than 0. 01). Both of these produced marked RE stimulation and values in animals given these agents remained above control values even after surgery. Levamisole had some effect in preventing the RE depression (P less than 0. 02), but was not as effective as either C. parvum or glucan...|$|R
40|$|Somatosensory evoked {{potentials}} (SEPs) {{were studied}} in 20 children {{with cerebral palsy}} and severe lower extremity spasticity before and after selective partial dorsal root rhizotomy of the lumbosacral cord. The potentials from stimulating nerves in the lower extremity were abnormal in {{two thirds of the}} children before the operation, whereas the potentials were generally normal from upper extremity nerves. Dorsal root rhizotomies caused an attenuation of nerve root entry volleys recorded over the lumbar cord but did not change SEPs recorded over the cortex. The exception to this was that the incidence of abnormal sural nerve SEPs decreased postoperatively. Lumbar cord functions measured by H-reflexes or by tendon jerks were <b>depressed</b> following the <b>operation.</b> These results indicate a significant degree of abnormality of somatosensory transmission from the lower extremity in a group of cerebral palsied children with severe spasticity. Moreover, selective sectioning of approximately 50 % of the dorsal root fibers in the lumbosacral cord had little influence on cortical evoked potentials. © 1989, American Medical Association.

40|$|Summary. Seminal changes {{following}} fifty-five high ligations {{of different}} sizes of varicocele have been compared with those following ligation of the spermatic vein {{in the absence of}} a varicocele. The criteria for selection of cases for operation have been discussed and it has been shown that even very small varicoceles are worthy of ligation. An initial depression of the sperm count is generally followed by a gradual increase for as long as 15 months after <b>operation.</b> <b>Depressed</b> sperm motility associated with an adequate sperm count is a strong indication for operation but good results can also be antici¬ pated when there is complete necrospermia. Approximately 75 % of cases with low sperm counts can be expected to return to normal levels. Congenital or pathological changes in the testes — other than those produced by a varicocele are a contra-indication to operation. In a previous communication (Scott, 1958), the results of seminal and histological studies in patients with different sizes of varicocele were presented and it was noted that all grades of varicocele appeared to play a definite part in the production ofmale subfertility. That particular study was undertaken to make possible the more accurate selection of cases for operation; the present study sets out to justify these criteria for elective surgery based on the seminal changes following ligation of the different sizes of varicocele...|$|R
40|$|Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) -mediated {{monocyte}} (M phi) {{suppressor activity}} and inadequate T-helper cell function represent the mechanistic keystones of trauma-induced impairment of cell-mediated immunity (CMI). In a prospective randomized trial, the immunorestorative {{potential of a}} combined therapy with the thymomimetic substance Thymopentin (TP- 5; Timunox, Cilag GMBH, Sulzbach, FRG) and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (Indo) in 60 patients (mean age, 63 +/- 2 years) undergoing open heart surgery was studied. Perioperative immunologic screening was carried out on days - 2, 3, 1, 5, and 7 and included the in vivo delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin response, phenotyping for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) -specific and nonspecific induction of lymphoproliferative responses, in vitro interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) synthesis, {{as well as the}} serum concentration of D-erythro-Neopterin (NPT) and of gamma interferon (gamma-IFN). The study protocol comprised three groups (n = 20) : PA (Indo 150 mg administered intravenously on days 0 to 5), PB (TP- 5 administered subcutaneously on days 0, 2, 4, and Indo), and PC (control). In contrast to PC, significant immunorestoration could be demonstrated in PB, as DTH scores on day 7, as well as proliferative responses in cell cultures were not <b>depressed</b> after <b>operation</b> (p less than 0. 05). Cell-surface receptor expression for the CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and IL- 2 receptor-positive (IL- 2 R+) lymphocyte subpopulations following surgery was reduced to 75 % of baseline values in PC, while in PB, receptor protection for CD 4 + and IL- 2 R+ subpopulations (more than 15 % above baseline) was observed. Interleukin- 2 synthesis (average baseline value, 0. 7 + 0. 08 U/mL) in cell cultures of PC was massively suppressed, with lymphokine concentrations in the supernatants never more than 0. 27 +/- 0. 05 U/mL. In PA cultures, IL- 2 synthesis was impaired as well but not as precipitously as in PC. In contrast, in PB cultures, the average IL- 2 production on consecutive postoperative days was never below baseline values. This study clearly demonstrates that the combined Indo/TP- 5 therapy is superior to single Indo administration and can adequately preserve and/or restore intact M phi T-cell interaction and thus appears to be a feasible approach to maintain normal host defense activity in traumatized individuals...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the effect on some leucocyte functions of 1) an elective surgical procedure; 2) nutritional repletion provided by parenteral alimentation (TPN). The rates of cellular proliferation and protein synthesis in lymphocyte cultures were measured by the incorporation of respectively 3 H-thymidine and 3 H-leucine; both measures were performed without and with additions of mitogenic agents. Random migration and chemotaxis of PMN leucocytes were measured under agarose. In 10 well-nourished patients, both lymphocyte proliferation and protein synthesis in stimulated cultures decreased after elective surgery, respectively by 50 % (p < 0. 01) and by 32 % (p < 0. 05) while random migration of PMN leucocytes was increased by 50 % (p < 0. 02). Stimulated lymphocyte proliferation and protein synthesis measured in 10 nutritionally depleted non-cancer patients prior to TPN were lower in comparison to the values obtained in a control population (respectively p < 0. 006 and p < 0. 04). These parameters rose progressively during TPN and reached the normal range after 3 weeks. Before TPN, PMN leucocyte random migration was slower in depleted patients than in control subjects; this parameter reached normal values after one week of TPN, while chemotaxis tended to decrease. Both parameters were in the normal range after 3 weeks of TPN. Conclusions 1) an elective <b>operation</b> <b>depresses</b> lymphocyte functions but stimulates PMN leucocyte random migration in well-nourished patients; 2) in depleted patients, previously depressed leucocyte responses are restored within 3 weeks of adequate nutritional support. © 1985.

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the effects of myocardial ischemic preconditioning in adult and aged patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods: Eighty patients with 3 -vessel disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized {{into one of the}} following groups: adult ischemic preconditioning, adult control, aged ischemic preconditioning, and aged control. Hemodynamic data and cardiac troponin I values were compared between the groups. The ischemic preconditioning groups received 2 periods of 2 minutes of ischemia, followed by 3 minutes of reperfusion. The Student t test, χ 2 test, and analysis of variance for repeated measures were used for the statistical analysis. Results: The baseline for right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index was similar. Right ventricular ejection fraction was <b>depressed</b> after the <b>operation</b> in all groups. Ischemic preconditioning significantly improved the recovery of right ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index after the operation in adult patients (P =. 013 and. 001, respectively), but in the aged group {{there was no difference in}} the changes of ejection fraction and cardiac index (P =. 232 and. 889, respectively). The cardiac troponin I value in the adult patients subjected to ischemic preconditioning was lower than that in the adult control subjects (P =. 046), but in aged patients undergoing ischemic preconditioning, the value was similar to that in aged control subjects (P =. 897). Ischemic preconditioning also resulted in a shorter postoperative mechanical ventilation time and in less inotropic use in the adult group. Conclusion: Ischemic preconditioning protects the heart from ischemic reperfusion injury in adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The beneficial effects of ischemic preconditioning are manifested as a better recovery of right ventricular and global hemodynamic function, cellular viability, and surgical outcome. The protective effect of ischemic preconditioning is diminished in aged patients undergoing coronary bypass. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2001; 122 : 972 -...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} if a reduction of serotonin (5 -HT) synthesis in the brain would provide any protection from the behavioral alterations induced by hippocampal brain-damage. The development of open-field activity (5 minute sessions) over two weeks and the acquisition of a passive avoidance task were chosen for study. Methods: There were 3 groups of lesioned rats - those hippocampal aspiration lesions, those with only damage to the neocortex overlying the hippocampus, and a sham-operated group. Half of each group was treated 300 mg/kg p-chlorphenylalanine (PCPA) for 3 successive days to deplete levels of 5 -HT and the other half were given the saline vehicle alone. [Hippocampal damage is associated with increased activity in the open field and impaired learning of the step-through passive avoidance response. ] Results: 1 / Animals with hippocampal damage became hyperactive in the second week after operation. 2 / PCPA treatment had no effect on locomotion, (nor on the frequently observed thigmotaxic nature of the behavior) 3 / Rearing was initially <b>depressed</b> after the <b>operation,</b> and PCPA treatment facilitated its recovery - but PCPA decreased rearing in intact animals during the second week of testing. 4 / Reduced levels of grooming were seen in hippocampal animals, while PCPA reduced grooming in those with neocortical damage 5 / The animals with hippocampal damage were impaired in witholding response in the passive avoidance task - those treated with PCPA performed even worse in not witholding the shock-reinforced step-through response. This contrasted with the intact animals, where PCPA treatment reduced the amount of footshock the animals were exposed to in the task Conclusions:. The results are consistent with a role for mesolimbic 5 -HT innervation of the dorsal hippocampus having an influence on novelty-elicited responses (e. g. grooming in home vs. novel cage and investigative rearing behavior) and in modulation of the sensitivity of response to electric footshock (hypersensitive in PCPA-intact animals, hyposensitive in PCPA-hippocampal animals) ...|$|R
