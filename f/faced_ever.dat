50|$|Deep {{underground}} (dai-shindo chika) is a Japanese {{concept for}} the public use of deep underground, enabled by a 2001 law. It was first thought of in the late 1980s as Japan <b>faced</b> <b>ever</b> increasing land values in the economic bubble, to allow the utilization of heretofore unused deep underground for necessary water and utility ducts and other city tunnels.|$|E
50|$|Since Poland's {{return to}} liberal {{democracy}} in the early 1990s, the Polish State Railways have <b>faced</b> <b>ever</b> increasing competition from private automotive transport and the country's rapidly expanding network of motorways and express roads. However, ever decreasing journey times, better schedules which allow for well-coordinated connections, the rise of private operators and large-scale investment in infrastructure {{as well as new}} rolling stock is slowly enticing people back onto the railways.|$|E
50|$|Dissenters {{often were}} tenants rather than landowners, and <b>faced</b> <b>ever</b> {{increasing}} rents as landowners sought {{to increase their}} income. Any improvements made to the land by a tenant increased its value giving landlords an excuse to raise the rent. Other landlords simply demanded and raised rents on a whim. Those who {{could not afford to}} pay were forcibly evicted without warning. Tenants also had to follow the landlords' preferred choice in elections, which then were not held by secret ballot. One way to alleviate problems was to gain the favour of the landlord.|$|E

5000|$|The Lada Samara {{was very}} much in the budget sector, but during its years on sale in Britain, it <b>faced</b> <b>ever</b> stiffer {{competitors}} such as the Škoda Favorit, Hyundai Pony and Proton [...] "Aeroback". Strong initial sales soon dropped, as the competition leapt ahead with newer models from Daewoo, Hyundai, Kia and Proton, pushing Lada sales into terminal decline. The aging Samara came bottom of the annual 1996 and 1997 JD Power and Top Gear surveys in Great Britain. In countries where ruggedness was more important, it did manage some success, selling reasonably well in Canada, Australia, and Finland for instance.|$|E
5000|$|During the First World War, the {{enormous}} logistical demands of trench warfare {{led to the}} development of military narrow-gauge railway or [...] networks, also referred to as trench railways. Throughout World War I, the British and French also used trench railways, called War Department Light Railways and Decauville Railways respectively. However, the German approach was less improvised and more permanent. With each successful advance, the British and French forces <b>faced</b> <b>ever</b> lengthening supply lines, while the Germans retreated deeper into their homeland. As a result, the [...] was an organic growth of existing agricultural, industrial and mining railways. After the war, much remaining trackage and rolling stock was put to use in more conventional narrow-gauge applications throughout Europe.|$|E

50|$|There were 139 {{competitors}} for {{the second}} event. The inaugural race received little media attention, but this changed in 1984 with James Daniels from the 3ZM radio station in Christchurch competing in the event.

Competitors who were slower <b>faced</b> <b>ever</b> higher water levels and could not undertake the many river crossings by themselves, but had to wait for others to link arms. The temperature at Goat Pass was 4 degrees Celsius. Despite the conditions, John Howard finished the first day 10 minutes faster than the 1983 winner's time; Howard had missed the event the previous year as he wanted to save himself for a major triathlon a week later in the United States (which, due to an administrative bungle, he could not get to).|$|E

40|$|In today's modern society, {{companies}} are <b>faced</b> <b>ever</b> {{more with the}} increased demands in terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR) towards the economic, social, cultural and ecological environment.

In this regard, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to develop a methodology based on the Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach in order to compare the probability of the companies ' success regarding to the implementation of the concept of corporate social responsibility. For achieving this goal, first the main aspects in the CSR field and their related criteria are recognized through the comprehensive survey of the relevant literature. In this paper, Shannon‟s entropy method is applied to determine weights of these main aspects according to the experts ' opinions. Finally VIKOR method is used in order to rank the companies as our alternatives. Implementing this framework is demonstrated in an illustrative example...|$|E
40|$|The inner-city {{neighborhoods of}} America {{continue}} to struggle with the economic blight they have <b>faced</b> <b>ever</b> since American urban growth began to abandon the urban city core fifty years ago. One of the most salient characteristics of the American inner-city is how it is constantly overlooked by private investment. This has many negative effects on the economic livelihood of these neighborhoods, including leaving these {{areas of the city}} void of much of the retail its residents need for their own purchases and for local economic activity. Recent theories have focused on the idea {{that one of the reasons}} there is a lack of investment is because of an information gap that exists in the inner-city, through which inner-city economic and demographic conditions are not accurately represented in the market data used for retail development market analysis. This thesis researches how improved retail market analysis data can help spur more inner-city retail development, with a specific focus on how Social Compact!s 2009 Neighborhood Market DrillDown report for the City of Miami can support increased inner-city retail development in the city. The research looked at the history of inner-cities, the retail development process, and the use of DrillDown reports in Cleveland, Ohio and Houston, Texas, and then studied Miami!s economic development context and its developing strategy for the dissemination of the DrillDown report. It is concluded that the Neighborhood Market DrillDown reports have the potential to be an important enabler of increased inner-city retail development. (cont.) However, this success is completely contingent on the data!s passage through the Retail Market Information Flow framework that this thesis stipulates that actionable market data flows through in a city!s development process. The essence of the flow framework is that it is a series of networking and collaboration steps that determine how effectively a city!s public, private, and non-profit actors work together to support the use and acceptance of improved data and apply it effectively to retail development deals. by Dickson Benjamin Power.
