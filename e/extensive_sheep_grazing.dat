Western grey kangaroos M. fuliginosa were confined to the south and west of the state, their distribution being related more directly to climate than to vegetation or land use. They live in the winter rainfall zone.

40|$|The {{protection}} of biodiversity {{is a key}} national and international policy objective. While pro- tected areas provide one approach, a major challenge lies in understanding how the con- servation of biodiversity can be achieved {{in the context of}} multiple land management objectives in the wider countryside. Here we analyse metrics of bird diversity in the Scottish uplands in relation to land management types and explore how bird species composition varies in relation to land managed for grazing, hunting and conservation. Birds were sur- veyed on the heather moorland areas of 26 different landholdings in Scotland. The results indicate that, in relation to dominant management type, the composition of bird species var- ies but measures of diversity and species richness do not. Intensive management for grouse shooting affects the occurrence, absolute and relative abundance of bird species. While less intensive forms of land management appear to only affect the relative abundance of species, though <b>extensive</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>grazing</b> appears to have little effect on avian community composition. Therefore enhanced biodiversity at the landscape level is likely to be achieved by maintaining heterogeneity in land management among land management units.

40|$|Many {{valuable}} and threatened taxons {{of the family}} Orchidaceae, including the representatives of genus Ophrys, are disappearing from semi-natural grasslands because of the advancing secondary succession. Conservation and restoration of calcareous grasslands rich in species at the Devínska Kobyla Mt. requires appropriate interventions after the traditional forms of management will be finished. Bromus erectus is the dominant species at the Devínska Kobyla Mt., hence {{it is necessary to}} choose adequate intervention aim of which would be the reduced dominance of this species. Restoration of <b>extensive</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>grazing</b> in this calcareous grassland is not realistic. This is the reason why it is proposed to mow every year or at least every two years (and remove the mown mass) the growths where the taxons of genus Ophrys occur. The best moment for mowing is after maturation of the Orchid Genus Ophrys seeds. With regard to the phenologic cycles of the species concerned, the following mowing terms are proposed: end of June for the locality with occurrence of Early Spider Orchid (Ophrys sphegodes), July for localities with occurrence of Late Spider Orchid (O. holosericea) and Fly Orchid (O. insectifera). The locality with Bee Orchid (Ophrys apifera) does not require mowing due to shallow soil (Lithosol) and vegetation that is close to Poo badensis-Festucetum pallentis association. If mowing cannot be used on the particular dates, it is proposed to mow the growths with the dominating species Bromus erectus in October.

40|$|To {{determine}} the environmental {{factors associated with}} bryophyte diversity in remnants in a fragmented, agricultural landscape. Location Eighty-two remnants of tussock grassland, eucalypt woodland and eucalypt forest in the subhumid Midlands region of Tasmania, Australia. Methods Remnants were surveyed for bryophytes and predictor variables, such as vascular plant cover, climate, and topography. Management histories for each remnant were compiled using both site observation and landowner surveys. Bryophyte cover, richness, and composition {{were related to the}} independent variables using simple correlation and general linear models. Results We found weak relationships between the dependent variables and the fragmentation variables (remnant area, remnant perimeter to area ratio, distance to nearest remnant, distance to nearest larger remnant, and remnant age). Instead, climatic variables were important in predicting bryophytes, in particular those affecting humidity (minimum temperature of the coldest month, precipitation). Despite <b>extensive</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>grazing</b> in this landscape, grazing was not correlated with bryophyte diversity. Bryophyte diversity was not explained by vascular plant richness and was only weakly explained by composition, but was predicted by the cover of vascular plants. There was greater bryophyte cover and richness and different composition where the cover of native vascular plants was lower. Main conclusions The implications of our results are that all remnants, regardless of area, age and isolation, appear to be valuable for bryophyte conservation in this highly altered landscape. Our results also suggest that the cover of the vascular plant community, rather than its diversity, holds promise as a guide to bryophyte diversity. Bryophyte composition was similar between sites and a focus on the most species-rich sites may be the best conservation strategy in this ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|Sheep {{nematode}} control utilising refugia-based {{strategies have}} been shown to delay anthelmintic resistance, but the optimal indices to select individuals to be left untreated under <b>extensive</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>grazing</b> conditions are not clear. This experiment tested the hypothesis that high body condition can indicate ability of mature sheep to better cope with worms and therefore remain untreated in a targeted treatment programme. Adult Merino ewes from flocks on two private farms located in south-west Western Australia (Farm A, n = 271, and Farm B, n = 258) were measured for body condition score (BCS), body weight and worm egg counts (WEC) on four occasions between May and December (pre-lambing, lamb marking, lamb weaning and post-weaning). Half of the ewes in each flock received anthelmintic treatments to suppress WEC over the experimental period and half remained untreated (unless critical limits were reached). Response to treatment was analysed in terms of BCS change and percentage live weight change. No effect of high or low initial WEC groups was shown for BCS response, and liveweight responses were inconsistent. A relatively greater BCS response to treatment was observed in ewes in low BCS pre-lambing compared to better-conditioned ewes on one farm where nutrition was sub-optimal and worm burdens were high. Sheep in low body condition pre-lambing were more than {{three times more likely to}} fall into a critically low BCS (< 2. 0) if left untreated. Recommendations can be made to treat ewes in lower BCS and leave a proportion of the higher body condition sheep untreated in a targeted selective treatment programme, to provide a population of non-resistant worms to delay the development of resistance...|$|E

30|$|The {{absence of}} a common period of reduced fire {{activity}} at our sample sites may indicate differences in Native American customs and Euro-American settlement patterns between the western and eastern sides of the Sierra Nevada. Anthropological studies of the local Mono Indians suggest {{that they did not}} use fire to clear forest or increase browse for hunting (Blake and Wagner 1987, Lewis 1993) as did many Central Valley and Sierra Nevada western slope tribes (Anderson and Moratto 1996). In the western Sierra Nevada, a reduction in understory fuel from <b>extensive</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>grazing</b> {{may have contributed to the}} change in fire frequency at the end of the nineteenth century (Douglass and Bilbao 1975, Vankat and Major 1978, Anderson 2005, Farquhar 2007). In the 1880 s and 1890 s in the eastern Sierra Nevada, cattle and sheep ranches were established to feed rapidly growing mining communities such as Bodie and Cerro Gordo (Wedertz 1969). Grazing, however, was largely limited to stream-fed meadows in the Owens Valley (Chalfant 1933). Without these broad-scale effects on ignitions and fuels, local patterns of settlement may explain some of our site-by-site differences in modern fire patterns. Roads to the three higher-elevation sites with modern records (Rock Creek, Cottonwood Meadow, and Onion Valley) were completed in the 1930 s and 1940 s, but no structures were built (Chalfant 1933, Smith 2003), and there was no apparent change in the fire regime. In contrast, fires at Whitney Portal virtually stop once the road from Lone Pine was completed in 1935 and structures are built at the road’s end. Three sample sites record few fires (Green Creek, Sierraville) or no fires (Bridgeport) after the 1870 s and 1880 s when mining and sawmill operations expanded in the northern half of the eastern Sierra Nevada.|$|E
40|$|Six {{agricultural}} landscapes in Poland (PL), the Netherlands (NL), France (FR), Italy (IT), Scotland (UK) and Denmark (DK) were studied, and {{a common}} method was developed for undertaking farm inventories and the derivation of farm nitrogen (N) balances and N surplus from the in total 222 farms and 11 440 ha of farmland. In all landscapes, a large variation in the farm N surplus was found, and thereby a large potential for reductions. The highest average N surpluses {{were found in the}} most livestock-intensive landscapes of IT, FR, and NL; on average 202 ± 28, 179 ± 63 and 178 ± 20 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1, respectively. However, all landscapes showed hotspots, especially from livestock farms, including a special UK case with landless large-scale poultry farming. So, whereas the average N surplus from the land-based UK farms dominated by <b>extensive</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>grazing</b> was only 31 ± 10 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1, the landscape average was similar to those of PL and DK (122 ± 20 and 146 ± 55 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1, respectively) when landless poultry were included. However, the challenge remains how to account for indirect N surpluses and emissions from such farms with a large export of manure out of the landscape. We conclude that farm N balances are a useful indicator for N losses and the potential for improving N management. Significant correlations to N surplus were found, both with ammonia air concentrations and nitrate levels in soils and groundwater, measured during the landscape data collection campaign from 2007 – 2009. This indicates that farm N surpluses may be used as an independent dataset for validation of measured and modelled N emissions in agricultural landscapes. However, no significant correlation was found to N measured in surface waters, probably because of the short time horizon of the study. A case study of the development in N surplus from the landscape in DK from 1998 – 2008 showed a 22 % reduction, related to statistically significant effects (p < 0. 01) of measures targeted at reducing N emissions from livestock farms. Based on the large differences between the average and the most modern and N-efficient farms, it was concluded that N-surplus reductions of 25 – 50 % as compared to the present level were realistic in all landscapes. The implemented N-surplus method was thus effective at comparing and synthesizing results on farm N emissions and the potentials of mitigation options, and is recommended for use in combination with other methods for the assessment of landscape N emissions and farm N efficiency, including more detailed N sink and N source hotspot mapping, measurements and modelling...|$|E
40|$|L'évolution de la chimie des sols et des eaux dans trois petits bassins-versants subméditerranéens granitiques recevant d'importants apports atmosphériques de S 04 et de poussières sahariennes a été simulée, de 1845 à 2125, en utilisant le modèle MAGIC. Ce modèle biogéochimique global comporte une série de {{relations}} d'équilibre entre les phases gazeuse, liquide et solide (adsorption de soufre, solubilité de l'aluminium, échanges cationiques, système C 02 /carbonates, dissociation des acides organiques) et une comptabilisation des flux d'éléments (entrées atmosphériques, sorties hydrologiques, immobilisation biologique, altération). Les bassins versants diffèrent par l'historique récente de leur utilisation par l'homme : la pelouse pâturée qui les recouvraient en 1845 n'a subsisté que dans un bassin : elle a été remplacée vers 1930 par une pessière dans l'un des bassins, et colonisée, après abandon, par une hêtraie dans l'autre. Les simulations montrent que le bassin couvert de pelouse a peu souffert de l'augmentation de l'acidité des pluies au cours du XXe siècle, et pourrait subir les apports actuels pendant plus de 100 ans sans dommage. Les deux bassins forestiers s'acidifient fortement depuis 1970 par les effets combinés de la pollution et des reboisements. Pour la pessière, seule une réduction d'au moins 60 % des apports soufrés permettrait d'inverser le processus. Le vieillissement naturel de la hêtraie produirait une amélioration même sans réduction des dépôts acides, en diminuant le taux d'assimilation de cations. Les deux facteurs acidifiants agissent donc en synergie, mais dans le cas de la pessière l'augmentation des apports acides due à l'effet filtrant des frondaisons est prépondérant, {{alors que}} dans la hêtraie, la forte immobilisation cationique dans la biomasse perenne jolie un plus grand rôle. Introduction. The combined acidifying effects of afforestation and acid deposition are well documented for sites in North-Western Europe and North America. In acid-sensitive mediterranean areas, acidification {{has been delayed}} by lower deposition rates and alkaline aeolian dust input to the ecosystems. Here, the evolution of stream water and soil chemistry, from 1845 to 2125, in three small submediterranean catchments of Southern France, is assessed using the MAGIC model. Sites and methods. Three granitic catchments have been monitored since 1981 in the South-Eastern Massif Central. The mean elevation is 1300 m above sea level and the soils are rankers and acid brown earth. The catchments are submitted to heavy atmospheric deposition of industrial acidic oxides (mainly sulphate : more than 20 kg. ha- 1 •year- 1 of S-S 04) and of alkaline saharan dust. The land use was similar in all the catchments up to 1930, and consisted mainly of <b>extensive</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>grazing</b> on semi natural grassland. Then one catchment (19. 5 ha) was afforested with conifers (spruce), another catchment (54 ha) was abandoned and progressively settled by a beech coppice, while the other catchment (81 ha) remained covered with grassland. MAGIC is a lumped, process-oriented biogeochemical model, where the soil physical and chemical characteristics are described by a single set of mean variables. The processes in soils are modelled {{by a series of}} equilibrium equations : Aluminium solubility, cation exchange, sulphate adsorption, C 02 and carbonates equllibria, organic acids dissociation. The changes in the stocks of elements are calculated from the main input, output and internal fluxes : atmospheric deposition, river load, biological uptake and weathering. The calibration aims to get the best fit between measured and simulated values to the « target variables », i. e., the present day exchangeable cations amounts in soils and river chemical composition. Hindcast and forecast runs need historical and prospective scenarios for atmospheric deposition, dry deposition factor, nutrient uptake and discharge. Here, the growth of the forest was modelled by increasing dry deposition factor and nutrient uptake and decreasing the discharge according to the field observations. The sequence of sulphate deposition was derived from S 02 emission data. Three scenarios were tested in the forecasts : a constant deposition al the present level, a 30 % reduction and a 60 % reduction within 2010. In both cases, the nutrient uptake of the spruce stand and grassland was kept constant, white those of the beech coppice was progressively decreased to simulate a natural ageing of the forest. Results. The model successfully reproduced the chemistry of the catchments. The values of the optimised parameters suggest that :- the soils of the area have a very high sulphate adsorption capacity;- the weathering rates are similar in the three catchments except for the calcium (lower in the beech catchment) and the magnesium (much higher in the spruce catchment);- the initial conditions calculated by the model for 1845 are slightly different; the alkalinity and cations concentrations are lower, and the base saturation higher, in the beech catchment. The simulations show that for the grassland catchment, there has been little change due to increasing of S 04 wet deposition over the last 100 years. The simulations for the other two catchments (beech and spruce stands) show that they have been acidifying since 1970 due to the combined effects of air pollution and afforestation. This trend could lead to a severe decline of soil base saturation and streamwater quality by 2050. Concerning the coniferous catchment, only a 60 % reduction of the sulphur input could allow a recovery. The natural ageing of the beech stand, resulting in a decrease of the biological uptake, would permit a recovery even under constant sulphur deposition. Conclusion. This exercise show that although the effects afforestation and acid deposition are synergetical and difficult to distinguish, their relative importance in acidification processes varies according to the vegetation. In the spruce catchment, the enhanced deposition due to the scavenging properties of the canopy is the determining factor. If no emission reduction occurs and no mitigating measures are taken, the decline of soil and water quality is a serious threat. In the beech catchment, the dynamics of biological uptake prevail, because the trees store a large amount of base cations. If the stand is allowed to age, a recovery can be observed even if no sulphur emission reduction occurs. This is also partly due, in this context, to the scavenging of the alkaline aeolian dust...|$|E
