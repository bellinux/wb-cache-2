2500|$|In late 1940, Minton hired Teddy Hill, {{a former}} bandleader, {{to manage the}} club. Building in the same {{direction}} that Minton had started, Hill used his connections from the Savoy Ballroom (where his band used to play), and the Apollo Theatre to increase the interest in the club. Hill put together the house band which included Thelonious Monk on piano, Joe Guy on trumpet, Nick Fenton on bass, and Kenny Clarke on drums. Both Clarke and Guy were in Teddy Hill's band before it disbanded in 1939. According to Clarke, Teddy Hill wanted to [...] "do something <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> that had worked with him" [...] by giving them work during difficult times.

[...] Tony Asher remembered: [...] "All those guys in the band, certainly Al, Dennis, and Mike, were constantly saying, 'What the fuck do these words mean?' or 'This isn't our kind of shit!' Brian had comebacks, though. He'd say, 'Oh, you guys can't hack this.'...But I remember thinking that those were tense sessions." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Duggars are devout {{independent}} Baptists. They only watch programs {{they consider}} to be wholesome family television and various historical events. Their Internet service is filtered. They adhere to certain standards of modesty in clothing in accordance with their religious beliefs. Shorts and tank tops are prohibited, and the women do not wear skirts that go above the knee. According to Michelle Duggar, such standards are mandated by scripture. They believe that baring the thigh is [...] "nakedness and shame", and runs the risk of [...] "defrauding" [...] others—or stirring up and arousing [...] "desires in someone else that cannot be righteously fulfilled." [...] They avoid beaches and public swimming areas [...] "because it's just too hard <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> to try to keep their eyes averted in those situations."
