All the affection <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> for a wife went out to those sisters; and I have never desired to recall it." [...] On Sunday, February 7, 1869 {{the left side of}} Brady's body was paralyzed. He {{died at the age of}} 53 at his home in New York on February 9 at 4:45 pm. Brady's funeral occurred at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and he was interred at Calvary Cemetery.|$|E
500|$|The {{interlude}} {{was followed}} by a Cabaret-like performance of [...] "Hanky Panky", which started the Circus act. Next a jazz version of [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] was performed with her two female back-up dancers. Then followed [...] "Die Another Day", with Madonna and her dancers in a Tango-like choreography and backdrops displayed an old man in his deathbed. After that, she was strapped into an electric chair as she started singing [...] "Lament" [...] from the soundtrack of the film Evita and the platform rises with her to the top. Madonna commented later that [...] "Lament" [...] was her [...] "favorite part, [...] I like the idea of being restrained. I'm singing about all the things <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had,</b> but my ego got in the way and I destroyed all my happiness." [...] The Orbital remix/video interlude of [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] was performed as dancers swung on trapezes. An acoustic-style segment started with [...] "Nothing Fails", with the guitar being played by Madonna herself. After that, she sang [...] "Don't Tell Me", recreating the choreography from the song's video with her dancers. The next song played was [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] where symbols of the 72 names of God were displayed on the backdrops. During the performance of the combined [...] "Mother and Father", Catholic images along with Madonna's Mother were displayed on the backdrops. Madonna then performed John Lennon's pro-peace song [...] "Imagine" [...] when photo montages of war-ravaged children, bombed-out villages and artillery were displayed in the backdrops. Asked why she chose to cover this song Madonna simply said: [...] "I wanted to make a statement with the ultimate peace song." ...|$|E

In what {{was described as a}} [...] "sparkling" [...] innings Nurse made 70 runs before lofting the England off spinner Ray Illingworth to mid on where he was caught by M. J. K. Smith. Commenting on the dismissal some years later, Nurse said, [...] "Inexperience got the better of me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> an easy hundred, but that's life."

2500|$|Six {{months after}} graduating from Webber Douglas, Dormer won the role of Victoria in Casanova. This was her film debut and it was {{released}} in 2005. The director, Lasse Hallström, {{was so impressed with}} Dormer's comedic timing that he had the script writer expand her part. On the strength of her audition for the role and her performance, she secured a three-film deal with Touchstone Pictures, which was never exercised. In 2005, Dormer had a small part in Distant Shores. After the filming of Casanova, Dormer was out of work for ten months, which she ascribes to [...] "bad representation". She was attached to an independent film which kept being delayed because of financial problems. Taken off the audition circuit, Dormer waitressed and worked in data entry to support herself. She has said that her being out of work for so long [...] "was the best lesson <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> in the first 12 months of my career".|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2009, Epic {{ended their}} {{contract}} with Norwood following {{the appointment of}} Amanda Ghost, making Human her only album with the label. A Los Angeles Times article later revealed Norwood's discontent {{with the success of}} the project the following year when asked about the commercial failure of Human: [...] "It was lacking my belief in it. It lacked my vision. Pretty much bottom line, if you don't believe in something it's not going to go," [...] she said. [...] "So do I believe that Human was as creative as Never Say Never and Full Moon? No, I do not. You definitely want to put something out that's like that. I felt at the same time <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> much better songs and a much better set-up." [...] A statement she made during a 2010 interview with Out magazine turned out more harsh: [...] "To hell with that album! [...] Where I felt creatively it could've gone and the space I was in creatively, I needed everybody around me to be in that same space. It would've been a different album, but with the same inspiration and same blessing for other people. It would've been hotter music and a hotter look." ...|$|E

[...] I got to play for two great schools, but playing at Michigan {{was one of the}} greatest thrills <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had.</b> [...] When I was at Michigan, I was the happiest guy in the world." [...] Asked what it means to have played an important part in the football traditions at both Minnesota and Michigan, Daley said: [...] "It means a lot to me. Both programs have been so wonderful to me long after I played. I am a member of both Hall of Fames and that is very special." [...] Daley said his one disappointment about his college football career was that he never played on a team that beat Notre Dame. [...] In 1943 Michigan lost to Notre Dame, 35-12. [...] Despite 135 yards on 24 carries by Daley (the most yards gained on Notre Dame by any back in 1943), Michigan suffered its only loss to Notre Dame. [...] Said Daley, [...] "I wanted to beat them so bad, and I played one of the best games of my life, but it wasn't to be." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{learn more}} about {{how to write a}} {{successful}} comic-book script, he asked advice from his friend, comic-book writer Steve Moore, whom he had known since he was fourteen. Interested in writing for 2000AD, one of Britain's most prominent comic magazines, Alan Moore then submitted a script for their long running and successful series Judge Dredd. Whilst having no need for another writer on Judge Dredd, which was already being written by John Wagner, 2000ADs editor Alan Grant saw promise in Moore's work – later remarking that [...] "this guy's a really fucking good writer" [...] – and instead asked him to write some short stories for the publication's Future Shocks series. While the first few were rejected, Grant advised Moore on improvements, and eventually accepted the first of many. Meanwhile, Moore had also begun writing minor stories for Doctor Who Weekly, and later commented that [...] "I really, really wanted a regular strip. I didn't want to do short stories... But that wasn't what was being offered. I was being offered short four or five-page stories where everything had to be done in those five pages. And, looking back, it was the best possible education that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> in how to construct a story." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Apples {{changed their}} {{name to the}} Wallflowers and began playing clubs around Los Angeles, {{specifically}} the Sunset Strip, such as the Whisky a Go Go, Gazzarri's and the Viper Room. While they were playing clubs the band was also sending their demo tape to record companies and figures within the music industry. One of those tapes {{caught the attention of}} Andrew Slater, who would eventually become the Wallflowers' manager. [...] Slater brought the Wallflowers to Virgin Records, who signed the band to a record contract. The Wallflowers then set out to make their first album. [...] However, finding a producer who was willing to work with them proved to be difficult. The band was intent on recording live and few producers were willing to produce that way. Paul Fox eventually stepped in and agreed to produce the album. By the time the Wallflowers got into the studio in 1991, they had a small catalog of songs they had been performing live which they wanted to record for their debut album. All of the songs were written by Dylan {{with the rest of the}} band members contributing input on the music. When in the studio, the band were intent on using as little recording equipment as possible. [...] Dylan explained: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> it my way I would not have seen a microphone or a cable anywhere." [...] When it came to recording, the songs were drawn out past the 3 to 4 minute norm; many songs were close to 5 minutes in length with two exceeding 7 minutes. The Wallflowers finished recording and released their debut album on August 25, 1992. After the release they began touring nationwide as an opening act for bands such as the Spin Doctors and 10,000 Maniacs.|$|E
