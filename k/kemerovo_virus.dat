40|$|AbstractWe {{determined}} the complete genome sequences of Tribeƒç virus (TRBV) and <b>Kemerovo</b> <b>virus</b> (KEMV), two tick-transmitted Orbiviruses {{that can cause}} diseases of {{the central nervous system}} and that are currently classified into the Great Island virus serogroup. VP 2 proteins of TRBV and KEMV show very low sequence similarity to the homologous VP 4 protein of tick-transmitted Great Island virus (GIV). The new sequence data support previous serological classification of these Orbiviruses into the Kemerovo serogroup, which is different from the Great Island virus serogroup. Genome segment 9 of TRBV and KEMV encodes several overlapping ORF's in the + 1 reading frame relative to VP 6 (Hel). A co-phylogenetic analysis indicates a host switch from insect-borne Orbiviruses toward Ixodes species, which is in disagreement with previously published data...|$|E
40|$|Many novel {{emerging}} orbiviruses {{have been}} {{isolated in the}} past 15 years. Important viruses include Peruvian horse sickness virus (PHSV) and Yunnan orbivirus (YUOV), pathogens of equids which were originally isolated almost simultaneously from 1997 to 1999 in the People's Republic of China, Australia and Peru. YUOV has also been isolated from cattle, sheep and a dog. The isolation of YUOVfrom a dog {{is not the first}} case of an orbivirus being isolated from a carnivore. Bluetongue virus and African horse sickness virus were earlier detected in carnivores which fed on contaminated meat. PHSV and YUOV both offer an opportunity to study the emergence of a single pathogen in geographically distant locations, although the original point of emergence is still unidentified. PHSV has been isolated from horses with neurological disease both in Australia and in Peru (where it is now endemic). Serological and molecular diagnostic assays have been developed for these viruses to assist in their identification and diagnosis. Other orbiviruses, such as Palyam virus and Equine encephalosis virus, have more recently been identified outside their geographical boundaries and may represent a threat to domesticated livestock and horses, respectively. The article also reviews four zoonotic orbivirus species (Corriparta virus, Changuinola virus, <b>Kemerovo</b> <b>virus</b> and Orungo virus) which have been identified in livestock and/or wildlife...|$|E

5000|$|Kemerovo tickborne viral fever is an aparalytic febrile illness {{accompanied}} by meningism following tick-bite. [...] The causative agent is a zoonotic Orbivirus first described in 1963 in western Siberia by Mikhail Chumakov and coworkers. [...] The virus has some 23 serotypes, and {{can occur in}} coinfections with other Orbiviruses and tick-transmitted encephalitis viruses, complicating the course of illness. [...] Rodents and birds are the primary vertebrate hosts of the virus; Ixodes persulcatus ticks are a vector of the <b>virus.</b> [...] <b>Kemerovo</b> and related <b>viruses</b> may be translocated distances in the environment by migratory birds.|$|R
40|$|Ticks (Ixodes (Ceratixodes) uriae] were {{collected}} from two seabird colonies on the Isle of May in Scotland. Viruses were isolated from three tick pools, one from ticks collected during 1979 and two from ticks collected during 1981. The viruses replicated in suckling mouse brain, chick embryo fibroblasts, Vero and BHK- 21 cells, but not in Xenopus cells. By virtue of their morphology in infected cells, physicochemical properties and reactions in complement fixation tests, they were identified as <b>Kemerovo</b> serogroup <b>viruses</b> belonging to the Great Island Complex (Orbivirus:Reoviridae). Ihe three isolates were distinguished from each other by plaque reduction neutralization tests. After three cycles of plaque purification, the replication of one isolate, Mill Door/ 79 virus, was examined in Vero and BHK- 21 cells. The virus grew to maximum titres 8 to 9 hours post infection (p. i.); over 99 % of the infectivity was cell-associated. Twelve virus-specified polypeptides, p 141, p 93, p 69, p 65, p 53 / 51, p 44, p 37, p 36, p 30, p 27, p 21 and p 20 were identified in infected Vero cell lysates by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Similar polypeptide profiles were observed in infected BHK- 21 cell lysates. Attempts to purify the virus, by polyethylene glycol- 6000 precipitation, resulted in the detection of p 93, p 69, p 53 / 51, p 37, p 21 and p 20 after PAGE, whereas only four, p 93, p 69, p 53 / 51 and p 37 were detected after attempts at purification using ether extractions. Results using pr~ase inhibitors and partial proteolysis indicated that three virus-specified polypeptides (p 36, p 30 and p 27) may be cleavage products. All virus-specified polypeptides, {{with the exception of}} p 30 and p 20, were labelled in infected cell cultures with both [14 c] mannose and [14 c] glucosamine.

5000|$|Chumakov {{graduated}} in 1931 from Moscow State University Medical School {{that was later}} transformed into I.M. Sechenov Moscow Medical Academy. In 1937 Chumakov participated in a scientific expedition to Khabarovsk region of Soviet Far East that was led by Professor Lev A. Zilber. Together with his colleagues he discovered the etiology of a new transmissible neurological disease called tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and isolated {{the virus that causes}} it. He was accidentally infected with the virus and developed encephalitis that led to a permanent loss of hearing and paralysis of the right arm. For this discovery he was awarded Stalin Prize of First Degree in Science and Technology in 1941. In 1948 Chumakov became a corresponding member, and in 1960 a full member of Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR. Beginning in the 1940s Chumakov organized multiple medical expeditions to Siberia and other regions of the Soviet Union to investigate outbreaks caused by new viruses. Among viruses discovered and studied by Chumakov are Omsk hemorrhagic fever and <b>Kemerovo</b> fever <b>viruses,</b> hantavirus causing renal syndrome, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus, and many others. From 1950 he was the Director of the Ivanovsky Institute of Virology in Moscow. In 1952 {{as a part of the}} anti-Semitic campaign in the Soviet Union known as Doctors' plot he was removed from the Ivanovsky Institute for refusal to fire Jewish associates. In 1955 he organized a new research institute near Moscow to work on vaccines against poliomyelitis. His work on vaccines against poliomyelitis was done in close collaboration with American scientists including Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin. [...] In 1958-1959 he organized the first mass production and clinical trials of Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (OPV) made from live attenuated strains developed by Albert Sabin. This made the Soviet Union the first country to develop, produce, license and widely use this highly effective vaccine that practically eliminated poliomyelitis from the country in the first few years of its use. The vaccine produced by Chumakov's Institute was exported into more than 60 countries, and was instrumental in stopping large outbreaks of poliomyelitis in Eastern Europe and Japan. The success of the Russian clinical trials was critical to OPV licensing in the United States in 1962, and the vaccine becoming the main tool used in global poliomyelitis eradication campaign. Chumakov also created a number of other human and veterinarian vaccines, including inactivated vaccine against TBE, measles, influenza and vaccine against Canine distemper virus that is widely used to protect farmed fur animals. Chumakov published more than 960 research papers, scholarly articles and books.|$|R
