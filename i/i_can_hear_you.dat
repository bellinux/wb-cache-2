500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> knocking at the front door/ And I know exactly what you came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E

'You speak so like my {{dear old}} master,' cried {{the old man}} with a childish delight, 'that I almost think I hear him. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> quite as well as I used to hear him. It makes me young again. He never spoke unkindly to me, and I always {{understood}} him. I could always see him too, though my sight was dim. Well, well! He's dead, he's dead.

"There {{are lots}} of stumps of trees here, Bertie, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> take half a turn round {{one of them and}} so let you down easily; then when you shout I will fasten the rope there and come to the edge, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> whether <b>you</b> want me to haul or not. Of course it must depend whether there are any jagged rocks {{sticking}} out. If so, {{it would be better for}} you to climb, as the rope might chafe against them if I pulled." ...|$|R

"Mr. Pordage," [...] says Captain Maryon, {{looking out}} of his hammock again, [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> what <b>you</b> say, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> answer it without troubling the gentleman.

6000|$|... "It {{is a long}} story, sir; I {{will tell}} it you some other time. Let it be enough to say now that I have found you. Will Mrs. Noel be back again at the house to-day? A little louder, sir; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>hear</b> <b>you.</b> So! so! Not back again for a week! And where has she gone? To London, did you say? And what for?--I am not inquisitive, Mr. Noel; I am asking serious questions, under serious necessity. Why has your wife left you here, and gone to London by herself?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{had been}} wanting to say {{something}} else to you when I had got rid of my dreadful message. I do not know if you still care to hear it. But you were once generous enough to think that I had done you a service in bringing a letter to your commander. Although I know better than anybody else the genuine devotion to your duty that made you accept my poor service, from all that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear,</b> <b>you</b> have never had the credit of it. Will you not try me again? I am more in favor here, and I might yet be more successful in showing your superiors how true you have been to your trust, even if you have little faith in your friend, Matilda Faulkner." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE PRINCESS. Oh dear! [It rings again. She looks scared. It rings again. She {{approaches}} it timidly. It rings again. She retreats hastily. It rings repeatedly.

Oh, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> speaking quite distinctly. [She sits down, delighted, and settles herself for a conversation.] How wonderful! What! A lady? Oh! a person. Oh, yes: I know. Yes, please, send her up. Have my servants finished their lunch yet? Oh no: please don't disturb them: I'd rather not. It doesn't matter. Thank you. What? Oh yes, it's quite easy.

In the meanwhile everything will go on as usual.

6000|$|... "May I {{ask your}} name, sir?" [...] Von Bost said to Ned. [...] "My wife and I {{would like to}} know to whom we owe a lifelong debt of gratitude. I will take your advice and ride at once for Sluys. I have many friends there who will conceal us and get us on board a ship.

6000|$|... "From {{all that}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear,</b> <b>you</b> {{will have to}} reckon Miss Grantly among the sinners," [...] said Mrs. Harold Smith--seeing that Lady Lufton with her young friend was approaching--"unless, indeed, {{you can make a}} saint of Lady Hartletop." [...] And then Lady Lufton entered the room, and Miss Dunstable came forward to meet her with more quiet respect in her manner than she had as yet shown to many of her guests. [...] "I am much obliged to you for coming, Lady Lufton," [...] she said, [...] "and the more so, for {{bringing}} Miss Grantly with you." [...] Lady Lufton uttered some pretty little speech, during which Dr. Thorne came up and shook hands with her; as did also Frank Gresham and his wife. There was a county acquaintance between the Framley people and the Greshamsbury people, and therefore there was a little general conversation before Lady Lufton passed out of the small room into what Mrs. Proudie would have called the noble suite of apartments. [...] "Papa will be here," [...] said Miss Grantly; [...] "at least so I understand. I have not seen him yet myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> {{saying in}} your hearts, even the bravest of you, [...] "The time is past for all that." [...] Gentlemen, {{it is not}} so. The {{time has come for}} more than all that. Hitherto, {{soldiers}} have given their lives for false fame, and for cruel power. The day is now when they must give their lives for true fame, and for beneficent power: and the work is near every one of you--close beside you--the means of it even thrust into your hands. The people are crying to you for command, and you stand there at pause, and silent. You think they don't want to be commanded; try them; determine what is needful for them--honorable for them; show it them, promise to bring them to it, and they will follow you through fire. [...] "Govern us," [...] they cry with one heart, though many minds. They can be governed still, these English; they are men still; not gnats, nor serpents. They love their old ways yet, and their old masters, and their old land. They would fain live in it, as many as may stay there, if you will show them how, there, to live;--or show them even, how, there, like Englishmen, to die.|$|E
50|$|Arends {{began her}} career as a {{songwriter}} at Benson Music Publishing. In 1995, Carolyn began touring and releasing albums as a singer and guitarist. Her debut release that year (<b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>You)</b> was released through Reunion Records. <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>You</b> reached No. 37 on Billboard Magazine's Contemporary Christian Chart in 1996.

6000|$|Maxwell {{walked toward}} the door, still keeping his glance fixed on Gabriel's clear, honest eyes. On the {{threshold}} he paused, and leaning against it, wiped his mouth with a slow gesture, and said--"From all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear,</b> Gabriel, <b>you</b> are a simple, honest fellow, and I frankly confess to you, but for the admission you have made to me, I would have thought you incapable of attempting to wrong a woman. I should have supposed it some mistake. I am not a judge of the motives of men; I am too old a lawyer, and too familiar with things of this kind to be surprised at men's motives, or even to judge their rights or wrongs by my own. But now that we understand each other, would you mind telling me what was your motive for this peculiar and monstrous form of deception? Understand me; it will not alter my opinion of you, which is, {{that you are not}} a bad man. But I am curious to know how you could deliberately set about to wrong this woman; what was the motive?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} {{you will have to}} deliver the message; it is hardly {{possible}} that she should not, as my uncle has done, believe me to be guilty. Still, I do cling to the possibility of it. That is why I hesitate in giving you the commission, for if it fails I shall lose my last pleasant thought of home. If you find she has believed in me, write to me at Sacramento, to the care of Woolfe & Company, of whom I always get my stores. There is no saying where I may be in four or five months' time, for it will take that before <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> from <b>you.</b> It may be, in that case, she too will write. If she does not believe in me, do not write at all; I shall understand your silence; and, above all, unless you find she believes in me, say no more than that I am alive and well, and give no clue whatever to the part of the world where we have met." ...|$|R

5000|$|Horton Hears a Who! {{was adapted}} into a half-hour {{animated}} TV special by MGM Animation/Visual Arts in 1970, directed by Chuck Jones (who also directed the television version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas!), produced by Theodor Geisel, and with narration by Hans Conried, who also voiced Horton. In this direction, the Sour Kangaroo's name is Jane, while {{her son is}} named Junior. Jane was voiced by June Foray. In Russia, Alexei Karayev directed <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>You</b> in 1992, a 19-minute paint-on-glass-animated film {{which is based on}} the Russian translation of Seuss's poetry but features a very different visual style.|$|E

[...] The four resulting plays are The Ant and the Cicada, Revolt. She Said. Revolt again., <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>You,</b> and This is Not an Exit. The series has been reviewed by major newspapers like The Guardian, The Independent, the Telegraph, or the Birmingham Post, but also by more specialised media, like the feminist blog The F-Word.|$|E
60|$|The actual Man {{who built}} it {{scarcely}} cared {{to tell you}} he did so; nor do the historians brag of him. Any quantity of heraldries of knaves and fainéants you may find in what they call their 'history': but {{this is probably the}} first time you ever read the name of Robert of Luzarches. I say he 'scarcely cared'--we are not sure that he cared at all. He signed his name nowhere, that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> of. <b>You</b> may perhaps find some recent initials cut by English remarkable visitors desirous of immortality, here and there about the edifice, but Robert the builder--or at least the Master of building, cut his on no stone of it. Only when, after his death, the headstone had been brought forth with shouting, Grace unto it, this following legend was written, recording all who had part or lot in the labour, within the middle of the labyrinth then inlaid in the pavement of the nave. You must read it trippingly on the tongue: it was rhymed gaily for you by pure French gaiety, not the least like that of the Théâtre de Folies.|$|R
500|$|US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt {{also worked}} on Waller's behalf. Historian Richard B. Sherman states that she became {{involved}} {{after receiving a}} letter from Murray, which prompted her to write Governor Price requesting that he investigate whether Waller had received a fair trial and delay the execution. Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, in contrast, holds that the First Lady intervened after receiving a handwritten note from Waller himself saying [...] "I have heard lots of people speak of what a nice lady {{you are and what}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> is that <b>you</b> believe in helping the poor ... Please write to the Governor and get him to have mercy on me and allow me a chance."

5000|$|Some {{letters that}} Yanovsky and Dostoevsky sent {{to each other}} are {{preserved}} to this day. So, {{in the spring of}} 1868, after [...] "The Idiot" [...] had been published, Yanovsky wrote to the author about its reception to the public. [...] "In a club, in small saloons, in railway carriages... everywhere <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> only 'Have <b>you</b> read Dostoevsky's last novel?'" [...] In 1872, Dostoevsky wrote to Yanovsky a letter in which he expressed his gratitude to the doctor and to the mate of his youth: [...] "You are one of the unforgettable people, one of those who echoed sharply in my life... Because you are a benefactor, you loved me and spent your time with me, with the one who had a soul illness (now I realize this), before my trip to Siberia, where I was cured... Sincerely yours till death..." ...|$|R
