5000|$|Federal {{courts have}} {{traditionally}} {{adhered to the}} related doctrines of res judicata (claim preclusion) and collateral <b>estoppel</b> (<b>issue</b> preclusion). Under RJ, a final judgment {{on the merits of}} an action precludes the parties [...] [...] [...] from re-litigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action. Under collateral estoppel, once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision may preclude re-litigation of the issue in a suit on a different cause of action involving a party to the first cause. As this court and other courts have often recognised, res judicata and collateral estoppel relieve parties of the costs and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage reliance on adjudication.|$|R
5000|$|The Court of Appeals, in {{an opinion}} {{authored}} by Judge Thorne, affirmed the trial court's denial of mother's claim for retroactive child support {{prior to the}} filing of a paternity action. The mother had sought an award from the father for retroactive child support dating {{to the time of}} their separation which was {{a few months after the}} birth of the minor child. The mother presented evidence to the trial court of child support worksheets and verification of income earned by the parties during the time for which she sought support. At trial, the <b>issue</b> of <b>estoppel</b> or laches was raised and the trial court was presented evidence by mother's consul that the sums sought were for reimbursement rather than child support. The trial court ruled that the mother was seeking reimbursement rather than child support and since she could not demonstrate either an agreement or unmet needs on the part of the child the trial court denied her claim. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling and refused to hear a new issue on appeal not raised in trial court. Additionally, the Court noted that the mother invited the error by agreeing she was seeking reimbursement rather than child support. http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/appopin/lachance020311.pdf ...|$|R

50|$|On 1 August 1945 he {{was made}} a Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria. He held that {{position}} until his appointment to the High Court on 8 February 1950, when he filled the vacancy left by the resignation of Sir Hayden Starke. Later that year {{he was made}} a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. On the High Court, he came {{to be regarded as}} one of the greatest Australian judges of his generation. He contributed to the Australian High Court being considered in the 1950s as one of the leading appellate courts in the common law world, and many of his judgments in a variety of areas of law are still regarded as classics. Important cases on which he sat included Jackson v Goldsmith (1950) (where his dissenting judgment set out the law relating to <b>issue</b> <b>estoppel),</b> the Communist Party Dissolution Case (1951), Wilson v Darling Island Stevedoring (1956) (an influential exposition of the exceptions to privity of contract), Williams v Hursey (1959) (a trade union case arising from the ALP/DLP split) and Dennis Hotels v Victoria (1960) (a constitutional case concerning excise duties).|$|E
5000|$|Their Lordships {{considered}} {{at some length}} previous decisions of the English courts in relation to abuse of process, and stressing that the courts strive to find a balance between proper administration of justice and avoiding defendants being vexed by duplicative litigation, {{and the need to}} ensure that persons with a proper claim were able to have those claims heard and determined. The court stressed that what was known as [...] "the rule in Henderson v Henderson" [...] had now actually evolved a very long way from the original judgment after which it was named. The rule against abuse of process was similar to rule relating to cause of action estoppel (or res judicata) and <b>issue</b> <b>estoppel,</b> but they were not the same. However both were concerned with the same underlying public interest. The court was reluctant to set down hard and fast rules as to what would amount to abuse of process when claims which might conveniently have been brought at an earlier were only made at a later time. Courts need to be mindful not to confuse the fact that a litigant could have brought his claims at an earlier stage with the proposition that he should have done so. Only in the latter case would it be an abuse of process to subsequently litigate those claims.|$|E

Another prevailing view is that the term 2 ̆ 2 sudden 2 ̆ 2 is ambiguous because it has more than one meaning and therefore under insurance law doctrines requires the issue be resolved in favor of the plaintiff insured. A third still developing view has asked the courts to not rely on the definition of 2 ̆ 2 sudden 2 ̆ 2 but to determine the <b>issue</b> through regulatory <b>estoppel.</b> The New York Court of Appeals in Northville Industries v.

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of estoppel precludes a person (asserter) from asserting something different or {{contrary to what}} is implied by a previous action, conduct or statement of that person or by a previous pertinent judicial determination. While there are various types of estoppel, this article is primarily focused on the application of <b>issue</b> <b>estoppel</b> in relation to {{certain aspects of the}} directors’ fiduciary duties in South Africa (s 76 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 (Companies Act 2008)), in light of the judgment in Royal Sechaba v Coote (366 / 2013) [2014] ZASCA 85 (30 May 2014) (Royal Sechaba case). <b>Issue</b> <b>estoppel</b> could be defined to include instances where a person is precluded from re-litigating or raising a particular issue in a cause of action that was previously decided by a final judgment of a competent court between the same parties in future cases that have a different cause of action involving such parties. <b>Issue</b> <b>estoppel</b> is closely related to res judicata. For instance,both <b>issue</b> <b>estoppel</b> and res judicata are generally aimed at preventing the re-litigation of the same issues and same cause of actions that were previously decided by a final judgment in the relevant courts between same parties. Nonetheless, it is widely acknowledged that the application these two concepts is quite different in practice. For instance, some jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa employs English law and Roman-Dutch law (common law) principles respectively, to distinguish between <b>issue</b> <b>estoppel</b> and res judicata. Likewise, similar common law principles are employed in the United States of America (USA), Canada and Australia to distinguish res judicata and <b>issue</b> <b>estoppel</b> in various ways. For example, <b>issue</b> <b>estoppel</b> is sometimes referred to as collateral estoppel, issue preclusion, claim preclusion or cause of action estoppel in USA, Canada and Australia. Despite this, {{it should be noted that}} a detailed discussion of the different requirements, merits and demerits of <b>issue</b> <b>estoppel</b> and res judicata in various jurisdictions is beyond the scope of this article. Put differently, this article provides a brief discussion of the application of <b>issue</b> <b>estoppel</b> to commercial agreements (certain aspects of the directors’ fiduciary duties) in South Africa in accordance with the Royal Sechaba case. This is done to investigate whether the requirements of <b>issue</b> <b>estoppel</b> were correctly applied and enforced in Royal Sechaba case...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contrasts}} {{the litigation}} of disputes in {{intellectual property rights}} between China and England. China is comparable with England in its substantive IPR law, but less so {{in terms of its}} enforcement. The thesis examines the judiciary’s role in IPR litigation and analyses the guidance on anti-piracy and unfair competition implied in IPR judicial enforcement. The thesis attempts to draw some basic criteria to achieve a clear just IPR protection in China. The thesis investigates in actual legal practice how, and to what degree from a similar legal base, IPR protection varies greatly between China and England. This involves: an analysis of case management, the discovery of evidence, the ascertainment of facts and issues of law, the legal finality, and the evaluation of judgment. The thesis considers whether there is a basic, just and practical standard of enforcement that might be followed for China. The main nature of my thesis lies in its originality in taking the first hand IPR cases to do comparative research on IPR enforcement through the lens of res judicata, overlapping multi-claims and issues of case management. It reveals the correlation between case management, judicial ascertaining of facts and issues of law, legal finality and <b>issue</b> <b>estoppel,</b> and arriving at a just result. By reviewing jurisprudential theories and their practical influence in English appellate cases, the study tries to show that transparency, equality of treatment and consistency form the basic core standard in enforcing IPR protection in China, and in providing a solid powerful foundation, from bottom to top, to promote and reform the structure of the Chinese legal regime...|$|E
40|$|From {{the case}} studies on various {{important}} aircraft accident investigation reports both in New Zealand and Hong Kong, {{this study suggests that}} they are deficient and inadequate in a number of ways. As a consequence they may be challenged either on merit or procedure, or both. In this study, various analytical human factors tools are examined and considered in relation to their potential contribution to challenging the merits of investigative reports. In addition, the legal aspects of these reports are also examined to determine how extant legislation and common law could be applied to challenge the reports on the basis of law and procedure. It is demonstrated in the analysis how aircraft accident investigation and the reports that are compiled can be challenged on different fronts. Procedural irregularities, such as inadequate opportunity given to those adversely affected to be heard; acting beyond the terms of reference of a public inquiry; or the lack of independence of the investigation itself, may give rise to a cause of action to have the report quashed completely or partially. Those whose reputation is adversely affected may challenge the findings and conclusions in the Board of Review by calling independent experts to attend the hearing to challenge the opinion given by the Chief Inspector. Parties to Court proceedings may seek discovery or disclosure of the records or information collected in the investigation and ask the Court to rule on the causation of the accident in personal injury cases. Among the different channels or methods of investigation, the Chief Inspector's reports are most vulnerable to challenge given the legal position in Hong Kong and the lack of statutory non-disclosure protection of the records, information and evidence gathered, and the compellability of the Inspectors to give evidence in Court. Aircraft accident investigation reports may, at best, be used or taken as a piece of evidence setting out the factual information of the accident, and as an expert opinion of the probable cause thereof in subsequent civil proceedings in establishing the causation of the accident and liability in common law negligence in personal injury or fatal accident cases. Those reports are by no means conclusive or binding on the parties or the Court in civil proceedings, and <b>issue</b> <b>estoppel</b> does not arise...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the preclusive effects generated in subsequent proceedings in England {{by a foreign}} civil and commercial judgment, once recognised as a res judicata according to either the common law rules of recognition (including the related statutory registration schemes), or the rules supplied by the Brussels and Lugano Conventions. In particular, this thesis examines four preclusive pleas which a foreign judgment might support: cause of action estoppel; the plea of former recovery under section 34 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982; issue estoppel; and, the abuse of process plea associated with the rule in Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100. Chapter One introduces the four preclusive pleas and the schemes for the recognition (or registration) of foreign judgments. Chapter Two {{considers the}} pleas that preclude the contradiction or reassertion of a cause of action where the foreign judgment has been recognised at common law, and then examines the common law recognition process {{to ensure that it}} verifies the res judicata status of the judgment (including that process as reflected in the common-law-related statutory registration schemes). Chapter Two also examines the generic requirements for the res judicata preclusive pleas, namely: that the subject matter in the foreign and subsequent English proceedings must be identical, and that the parties (or their privies) must be the same. Much of the analysis of these requirements is useful for the discussion in Chapter Three of the issue preclusive effects of foreign judgments recognised at common law. Only relatively recently has the common law accepted that foreign judgments can support a plea of <b>issue</b> <b>estoppel,</b> and even more recently has issue preclusion by a final interlocutory issue decision of a foreign court been acknowledged. Thus, in light of these developments, adjustments in the recognition/ res judicata requirements necessary to found the plea in subsequent English proceedings, are considered. In Chapter Four the traditional res judicata pleas so far discussed are contrasted with the Henderson abuse of process plea. If it applies at all in respect of earlier foreign proceedings, the Henderson rule precludes subsequent proceedings in England which seek to litigate subject matter that could and should have been litigated in the foreign proceedings, but which was not. Chapter Five examines the preclusive effects of judgments recognised in England according to the rules of the Brussels and Lugano Conventions. The underlying nature of the Conventions ensures that these judgments are effective as regards cause of action preclusion, since automatic recognition (which suggests full faith and credit) enables claim preclusive effects to result - the English court extending the law of the foreign rendering state in such cases. But it is argued that a different approach should be taken where issue preclusion and abuse of process preclusion are concerned. Finally, Chapter Six summarises the preclusive effect of a foreign judgment in subsequent proceedings in England, and conclusions are drawn. </p...|$|E
