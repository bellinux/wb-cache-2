40|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>chicory,</b> Cichorium intybus L., is {{cultivated}} for {{the production}} of inulin. Most varieties of <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> exhibit rather poor early growth, which limits further yield improvements in their European cultivation area. The poor early growth could be due to suboptimum adaptation of the gene pool to growth at low temperatures, sometimes in combination with high light intensities, which is typical of early-spring mornings. We have used chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence to evaluate the response of young plants of the cultivar 'Hera' to low temperatures and high light intensities. Plants were grown at three temperatures: 16 A degrees C (reference), 8 A degrees C (intermediate), and 4 A degrees C (cold stress). Light-response measurements were carried out at different light intensities in combination with different measurement temperatures. Parameters that quantify the photosystem II (PSII) operating efficiency (including PSII maximum efficiency and PSII efficiency factor) and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) are important to evaluate the stress in terms of severity, the photosynthetics processes affected, and acclimation to lower growth temperatures. The results clearly demonstrate that in young <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> plants the photosynthetic system adapts to lower growth temperatures. However, to fully understand the plant response to the stresses studied and to evaluate the long-term effect of the stress applied on the growth dynamics, the subsequent dark relaxation dynamics should also be investigated. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>chicory,</b> Cichorium intybus L., has rather poor early vigour {{under the}} typical early spring morning {{conditions}} of low temperatures and high light intensity. Screening tools {{are being developed}} to assess the cold tolerance/sensitivity of young <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> plants under these conditions. Refinement of such tools requires {{better understanding of the}} plants' physiological responses. In this paper we discuss the effects of growth temperature (GT), measurement temperature (MT), and measuring light intensity (ML) on the relaxation of the Kautsky curve. We chose the chicory variety 'Hera', as it is known to possess a good average early vigour. Young plants of the variety 'Hera' were grown at three temperatures (GT) : 16 A degrees C (reference), 8 A degrees C (intermediate), and 4 A degrees C (cold stress). The dark relaxation kinetics were analyzed at different light intensities (ML) in combination with different measurement temperatures (MT). The three components of the nonphotochemical quenching process (NPQ(E), NPQ(T), and NPQ(I)) were determined. NPQ(E) was not affected by GT but was significantly affected by MT and ML. NPQ(T) and NPQ(I) were affected by all factors and their interactions. An acclimation effect for plants grown at low GT was detected. Acclimation resulted in lower NPQ(T) and NPQ(I) values. The halftime of the inhibition depending on NPQ (NPQ(I)) was not affected by any of the factors investigated. Based on the data generated, we conclude that NPQ(I) is a valuable parameter for screening the cold sensitivity of young <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> plants. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Study of the {{potentialities}} {{of machine}} vision used for optical selection of immature seeds of <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus L.). The commercial production of <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> seeds (cypselae) includes the postharvest elimination of non-viable seeds by non-destructive tools. For this purpose, two machine vision methods are described {{for the detection of}} non-viable seeds: color vision and fluorescence imaging. The analysis of color images of 1, 500 seeds of the 'Nausica' variety allows only the recognition of desiccated and undeveloped seeds. This is caused by the large variability of seed color, shape and texture. Fluorescence imaging is set up in order to analyze the repartition of chlorophyll fluorescence, a marker of seed maturity, on different areas of the seed (pericarp, radicle tip and pappus). A very sensitive system is needed due to the low chlorophyll content and the large amount of seeds to be sorted. A fluorescence imaging system is proposed. Its distinctive feature is the possibility to modify the spectrum of the light source (in order to optimize the sensibility of the machine vision system) and to record the evolution of fluorescence repartition with time. The system is functional and delivers images of fluorescence repartition within external cypsela tissues. It could allow to analyze the fluorescence of a large sample of seeds to correlate fluorescence features to germinability and maturity...|$|E

Considering the great importance {{of different types of}} drug distillates and different uses of traditional & industrial, the amount of fungal and bacteria pollution in sweat chicory, Tp and forty traditional essences was studied in Birjand shops. Materials and Methods: In this method 30 sample of traditional and <b>industrial</b> sweat <b>chicory,</b> Tp and forty traditional was selected from Birjand city for bacterial (total coli form, fecal coli forms) and fungal pollution and was transferred to laboratory and were analyzed according 7725 - 1 and 997 number standard of Iran. Results: Based on the results, in 1 case of TP and forty traditional essences fungus penicillium and sweat chicory aspergillus and penicillium fungi were isolated. In 80 % TP and forty traditional essences & sweat chicory samples microbial pollution were detected and from these samples 20 % sweat chicory and TP had coli form pollution & 20 % TP and sweat chicory & forty traditional essences had fecal coli form pollution. 80 % industrial samples of sweat chicory had microbial pollution and from these 100 % had coli form pollution. Conclusion: According to the results, surveillance should be done more in various stages of preparation and distribution of these essences...|$|R
40|$|The cold stress {{effect on}} early vigour and {{photosynthesis}} efficiency was evaluated for five <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> varieties with contrasting early vigour. The {{relationships between the}} growth and physiological parameters were assessed. The varieties were examined at three growth temperatures: 16 (reference), 8 (intermediate) and 4 A degrees C (stress). The effect was measured using physiological processes (growth, photosynthesis, chlorophyll a fluorescence), and pigment content. The analysis of the measured growth parameters (dry leaf and root mass, and leaf area) indicated that temperature {{had a significant effect}} on the varieties, but the overall reaction of the varieties was similar with lowering temperatures. The photosynthesis and chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements revealed significant changes for the photosynthesis (maximum net photosynthesis, quantum efficiency, light compensation point and dark respiration) and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters (photochemical and non-photochemical quenching) with lowering temperatures for Hera and Eva, two extremes in youth growth. No significant differences could be found between the extremes for the different temperatures. The pigment content analysis revealed significant differences at 4 A degrees C in contrast to 16 and 8 A degrees C, especially for the xanthophyll/carotenoid pool, suggesting a protective role. Subsequently, the relationship between the physiological processes was evaluated using principal component analysis. At 4 A degrees C, 2 principal components were detected with high discriminating power for the varieties and similar classification of the varieties as determined in the growth analysis. This provides a preview on the possible relationships between photosynthesis and growth for <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> at low temperatures. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory,</b> Cichorium intybus, is {{a member}} of the Asteraceae family that accumulates fructan of the inulin type in its root. Inulin is a low {{calories}} sweetener, a texture agent and a health promoting ingredient due to its prebiotic properties. Average inulin chain length is a critical parameter that is genotype and temperature dependent. In the context of the study of carbohydrate metabolism and to get insight into the transcriptome of chicory root and to visualize temporal changes of gene expression during the growing season, we obtained and characterized 10 cDNA libraries from chicory roots regularly sampled in field during a growing season. A leaf and a nodule libraries were also obtained for comparison. Results Approximately 1, 000 Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) were obtained from each of twelve cDNA libraries resulting in a 12, 226 EST dataset. Clustering of these ESTs returned 1, 922 contigs and 4, 869 singlets for a total of 6, 791 putative unigenes. All ESTs were compared to public sequence databases and functionally classified. Data were specifically searched for sequences related to carbohydrate metabolism. Season wide evolution of functional classes was evaluated by comparing libraries at the level of functional categories and unigenes distribution. Conclusion This chicory EST dataset provides a season wide outlook of the genes expressed in the root and to a minor extent in leaves and nodules. The dataset contains more than 200 sequences related to carbohydrate metabolism and 3, 500 new ESTs when compared to other recently released chicory EST datasets, probably because of the season wide coverage of the root samples. We believe that these sequences will contribute to accelerate research and breeding of the <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> as well as of closely related species. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{cultivation}} area of <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory,</b> Cichorium intybus L. cv Sativum, {{coincides with}} the natural distribution area of its wild relative, C. intybus L. {{which could lead to}} gene flow between wild and cultivated types. The genetic diversity within and between the two types has therefore been studied using AFLP genotyping of samples from 12 wild populations collected in Belgium and ten commercial varieties. The genotyping of 233 individuals allowed the identification of 254 AFLP markers. Similar levels of genetic diversity were observed within wild populations and cultivated varieties, suggesting the absence of any strong bottleneck {{in the history of the}} cultivated types. The phylogenetic analysis pointed to a monophyletic origin of cultivated varieties as compared to the local wild populations studied, hence the two types of chicory form two separate gene pools. The genotyping of some individuals sampled in ruderal sites clearly showed that they belong to the cultivated gene pool, which suggests the existence of feral or weedy types. The low differentiation observed among wild populations indicates that gene flow might be important in this species. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus L.) root is {{the main}} {{commercial}} source of inulin, a linear fructose polymer used as dietary fiber. Post-harvest, inulin is depolymerized into fructose which drastically increases processing cost. To identify genetic variations associated with enhanced susceptibility to post-harvest inulin depolymerization and related free sugars content increase, we used a candidate-gene approach focused on inulin and sucrose synthesis and degradation genes, {{all members of the}} family 32 of glycoside hydrolases (GH 32). Polymorphism in these genes was first investigated by carrying out EcoTILLING on two groups of chicory breeding lines exhibiting contrasted response to post-harvest inulin depolymerization. This allowed the identification of polymorphisms significantly associated with depolymerization in three fructan exohydrolase genes (FEH). This association was confirmed on a wider panel of 116 unrelated families in which the FEH polymorphism explained 35 % of the postharvest variance for inulin content, 36 % of variance for sucrose content, 18 % for inulin degree of polymerization, 23 % for free fructose content and 22 % for free glucose content. These polymorphisms were associated with significant post-harvest changes of inulin content, inulin chainlength and free sugars content...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThis work {{focuses on}} the culture of <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory,</b> also named “coffee” chicory (Cichorium intybus L. var. sativum), made in Ribatejo in 2008, {{especially}} in what concerns agricultural component. It was aimed mainly to assess the conditions {{for the development of}} roots, fertilization needs, fight against weeds, diseases and the evaluation of general behaviour of three cultivars of this crop: hera, orchies, and fluor. The plants emerged a few days after sowing but accompanied by weeds, which brought additional problems to the production, since this operation was delayed in relation to what was expected because the occurrence of rain before the sowing. This led to the need for enhanced application of herbicides not only in pre-sowing but also in post-emergency, bringing difficulties over time of the crop in the soil. Despite this fact, the problem was solved and the production results were relatively good. In addition it was tried to reduce the crop cycle, usually of 6 months, based on business needs for raw materials for industry due to its scarcity in the international market in the year concerned, implying therefore the reduction of the productive potential of culture...|$|E
40|$|Tests for distinctness, {{uniformity}} {{and stability}} (DUS) are {{an essential component}} of variety registration and granting plant breeders' rights. This study, performed on <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus L.), included (1) an evaluation of the discriminating power of the UPOV characteristics and (2) a comparison of the root shape between the UPOV-based characteristics and characteristics determined via image analysis. Five consecutive growing periods were studied to assess the long-term stability of the parameters. Lack of discriminating power of characteristics for examining distinctness may impede breeding progress by failing to discriminate novel candidate varieties. However, a balance needs to be set so that newly introduced characteristics or new evaluation methodologies are not too powerful as to damage the protection of registered varieties. The results showed great differences in the discriminating power of the UPOV characteristics. The elimination of some of these low-discriminating characteristics would probably result in savings, but would have no consequences on the decisions taken by DUS testing authorities. Image analysis-derived characteristics could either replace currently-used parameters or provide additional characteristics with good discriminating power, determined in an objective and standardized way. Here we discuss possible implications for variety registration...|$|E
40|$|Somatic {{hybridization}} in Cichorium {{species has}} already been extensively investigated. Hybrid or cybrid characterization requires an effective plasmotype screening method. We evaluated high resolution melting (HRM) analysis {{for the detection of}} specific mitochondrial (mt) and chloroplast (cp) markers to distinguish two <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) plasmotypes from five wild type chicory (C. intybus) and two endive (C. endivia) plasmotypes. Three mt (coxII- 2, cob- 1, and cob- 2) and three cp HRM markers (trnL-trnF, trnL-trnF- 2, and ndhF- 1) were successfully developed. Two markers (coxII- 2 and trnL-trnF) were additionally able to discriminate heterozygous plasmotypes containing at least 25 % of one parental plasmotype. Moreover, the technique was successfully used to characterize the cytoplasms of 50 simple sequence repeats (SSR) confirmed somatic hybrids of C. intybus var. sativum ‘VL 52 ’ and C. endivia var. crispum ‘Wallone Despa’. HRM enables a rapid (less than 2 h) and efficient high-throughput scanning of multiple fragments due to the 384 -well plates and is cost efficient because of its small reaction volume of 10 μl. This is the first report on the use of HRM analysis on Cichorium species. The technique is a fast and simple alternative for laborious and costly sequencing in plasmotyping regenerants obtained after somatic fusion...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{polyphenols}} {{represent a}} huge reservoir of bioactive compounds. <b>Industrial</b> <b>chicory,</b> an important crop from northwestern Europe, accumulates an original combination of such compounds i. e. chlorogenic, isochlorogenic, caftaric and chicoric acids {{arising from the}} phenylpropanoid pathway. For a complete understanding of these biochemical pathways, analyses of gene expression using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) should be considered. Because cell cultures are a model of choice for secondary metabolism investigations, this study described {{for the first time}} the validation of reference genes for this system in chicory. Eighteen potential reference genes were obtained by mining expressed sequence tag databases of chicory for orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana genes currently used as reference genes. Twelve genes passed the qRT-PCR standard requirements and their expression stability across different samples was tested using three distinct softwares: geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. In cell cultures grown under various conditions, TIP 41 (TIP 41 like protein) was shown to be the most stable gene. Further validation of the proposed reference genes was done by normalization of expression levels of a group of genes of interest. In order to assess the potentiality of the proposed list of candidate reference genes, theses genes were in parallel tested on another experimental design i. e. chicory seedlings. In this case, the best reference gene identified was Clath (Clathrin adaptator complex subunit). The results highlight the importance of the use of properly validated reference genes to achieve relevant interpretation of qRT-PCR analyses. Here, we provide a list of reference genes suitable for future gene expression studies in chicory...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} used 15 simple {{sequence}} repeat loci to characterize the genetic diversity of the germplasm that originated the current <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> and to establish the relationships between and inside Cichorium intybus L. and Cichorium endivia L. Initially we analyzed 19 cultivated C. endivia accessions, 27 wild and 155 cultivated C. intybus accessions distributed among three groups: 83 root chicories, 42 Witloof and 30 leaf chicories. The leaf chicories comprised cultivars corresponding to the Radicchio, Sugarloaf and Catalogne subgroups. The latter has not been previously included in any genetic diversity study. Subsequently, 1297 individuals from the 15 modern root chicory cultivars at {{the origin of the}} breeding of the current industrial root chicory cultivars were analyzed. Although the accessions of C. endivia and C. intybus were clearly separated from each other, seven wild C. intybus individuals were genetically closer to C. endivia than to C. intybus, revealing complex genetic interrelationships between these species. The differentiation of C. intybus into three cultivar groups (Witloof, root chicory and leaf chicory) was confirmed. The leaf chicory individuals were divided into three genetic subgroups, corresponding to the Radicchio, Sugarloaf and Catalogne cultivars, thus attesting to the validity of the classification based on morphological factors. Clear differentiation was ob- served among the Belgian, Polish and Austrian modern industrial root cultivars, but not among the French industrial modern root cultivars. The high phenotypic and genetic variability of the modern industrial root cultivars indicates that this germplasm constitutes a useful gene pool for cultivar improvement and selection...|$|E
40|$|Inulin is a {{fructose}} polymer {{extracted from}} the root of <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus L.). The quality of the root extract {{is determined by the}} polymerization degree of inulin molecules and the free fructose concentration. Low autumnal temperatures trigger an inulin degradation phase which decreases the quality of the root extract. Therefore, the objective of this thesis was to understand the genetic determinism of the synthesis and the cold induced degradation of inulin. To do so, we evaluated the chicory genetic resources, conducted a candidate gene approach and a genome wide association study (GWAS). The assessment of the chicory genetic resources of the C. intybus germplasm confirmed the validity of the available classification, identified a new leaf cultivar subgroup and revealed a high genetic variability in most chicory groups. The candidate gene analysis investigated the associations between genetic polymorphisms in candidate genes involved in the inulin metabolism and the susceptibility to cold-induced inulin degradation. An indel in 1 FEH IIb was responsible for up to 35 % of the variance of traits describing the susceptibility to cold-induced inulin degradation, in a panel of 112 lines. A genome draft covering 85 % of the chicory genome was created to map the SNPs identified by genotyping by sequencing in a panel of 366 lines, characterized by a very low linkage disequilibrium extent. The GWAS conducted on the panel identified, along with the 1 FEH IIb indel, new SNPs significantly associated to {{a small fraction of the}} variability of several traits describing the inulin and carbohydrates synthesis and the cold induced degradation of inulin. Therefore we concluded that the genetic determinism of inulin synthesis is multigenic and determined by several minor effect QTLs when cold induced inulin degradation result from the action of one major effect QTL and at least one minor effect QTL.

40|$|The {{commercial}} production of <b>industrial</b> <b>chicory</b> seeds (cypselae) includes the postharvest elimination of nonviable seeds by non-destructive tools. For this purpose, two machine vision methods {{were set up}} for the detection of nonviable seeds: color vision and fluorescence imaging. In addition, the appropriate criteria to estimate the efficiency of seed sorting were defined using a sorting optimization curve which describe the trade-off between the quality improvement of a seed lot and the loss of material. The analysis of color images of 1, 500 seeds of the ‘Nausica’ variety allows only the recognition of desiccated and undeveloped seeds. This is caused by the large natural variability of seed color, shape and texture. Fluorescence imaging was set up in order to analyze the repartition of chlorophyll fluorescence (CF), a marker of seed maturity, on different areas of the seed (pericarp and pappus). It comprised a monochromatic light source, a highpass filter and a monochromatic CCD camera sensitive to red and infrared. With this device, blue light reflected by the seeds was blocked whilst red fluorescence was measured by the camera. A segmentation algorithm was designed to estimate separately the fluorescence intensities of the pappus, a crown of scales, and {{the main body of the}} pericarp. Experiments were carried out on five clones of cross-pollinated chicory plants used for seed production and four series of 30 plants from 2 common varieties grown in different weather conditions. The flower heads were labelled at flowering and harvested at different times during the maturation process expressed in "days after flowering" (DAF). Germination tests were performed according to the recommendations of the International Seed Testing Association to measure the germination percentage (GP) and the germination rate (GR), an indicator of seed vigour. The dry weight (DW), water content (WC), maturation duration, germination percentage (GP), and germination rate (GR) were measured to estimate seed quality. For all experiments, the chlorophyll fluorescence diminished mainly between 16 and 33 DAF during the filling phase of seed development. The correlations between CF and maturity parameters (DW, WC) were comprised between 0. 25 and 0. 75 in absolute value for seeds that matured 16 to 44 days on the stalk. Sorting simulations were made on the basis of CF alone or in combination with the achene area density (AD) (mg/mm²). The CF was efficient to select seeds produced outdoor or in the greenhouse with the aim of increasing GP or GR but AD was an even better sorting feature. In the greenhouse, where developing seeds were submitted to temperatures higher than 25 °C, the use of CF in combination with AD improved the sorting efficiency...|$|E
