5|$|In 1320 King Edward II of England confiscated the lordship of Gower on {{the grounds}} that Braose had <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his {{son-in-law}} Mowbray without royal permission. Over the preceding years Braose had promised Gower to a number of persons, including Humphrey de Bohun, the Earl of Hereford, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and Roger Mortimer of Wigmore. Mowbray then in late 1319 took custody of Gower to protect his rights. Despenser persuaded the king in 1320 to take Gower into royal hands in October, and was appointed keeper of the honour in November. The other lords in the Welsh Marches resented this seizure, feeling that the king's excuse for it was not applicable. The seizure was one of the precipitating causes of the baronial rebellion that led to the exile of the Despensers in 1321. In 1322 Gower was given to the younger Despenser again, who then traded it for the honours of Usk and Caerleon. Braose was then induced to sue the new holder of Gower for the return of the barony in April 1324, which action succeeded in June 1324. Braose then promptly gave Gower to the elder Despenser, returning the property to the Despenser family once more. The lordship of Gower eventually ended {{up in the hands of}} the Beauchamp family, but it was not until the 1350s that the issue was decided.|$|E

[...] "Let's get them!" [...] a passenger cries. A hijacker shouts, [...] "Allahu akbar". Jarrah repeatedly pitched {{the plane to}} knock passengers off their feet, but the passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey!

[...] The plane crashed into an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 580 miles an hour, killing everyone on board. The plane was twenty minutes of flying time away from its suspected target, the White House or the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. According to Vice President Dick Cheney, President George W. Bush had given the order to shoot the plane down had it continued its path to Washington.|$|R

25|$|Herod had {{to lease}} back the royal estate at Jericho from Cleopatra, after Mark Antony had <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{her as a}} gift. After their joint suicide in 30 BC, Octavian assumed control of the Roman Empire and granted Herod {{absolute}} rule over Jericho, {{as part of the}} new Herodian domain. Herod's rule oversaw the construction of a hippodrome-theatre (Tell es-Samrat) to entertain his guests and new aqueducts to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palaces built at the site of Tulul Abu el-Alaiq (also written Alayiq). In 2008 the Israel Exploration Society published an illustrated volume of Herod's third Jericho palace.|$|E

Mahon had taken the pistol away from him and <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the constable, asking him to take the prisoner to his house for the wound to be dressed.

In 1945, at the Clifton Gardens Hotel in Sydney, she had <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> an army {{lieutenant}} named Alf Boxall, who was serving at the time in the Water Transport Section of the Royal Australian Engineers. Thomson told police that, after the war ended, she had moved to Melbourne and married. She said that she had received a letter from Boxall and had replied, telling him that she was now married. (Subsequent research suggests that her future husband, Prosper Thomson, {{was in the process of}} obtaining a divorce from his first wife in 1949, and that he did not marry Jessica Harkness until mid-1950.) There is no evidence that Boxall had any contact with Harkness after 1945.|$|E
25|$|Although the Palace was taken, {{the battle}} was not yet over. A {{detachment}} from the 3rd Bombay Regiment was sent to overcome the Afghan troopers who were bodyguards of Rani Laxmibai and although the Afghans inflicted significant casualties on the Regiment, they were eventually all disposed of and the standard of the Rani was retrieved. An English union flag of silk was also retrieved. Lord William Bentinck had <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the grandfather of the husband of the Rani, with the permission to have it carried before him, {{as a reward for}} his fidelity-a privilege granted to no other Indian prince. The soldiers were allowed to hoist the flag on the place. The fighting in the city continued for a further day culminating in Lieutenant Baigrie of the 3rd Bombay European Regiment announcing that he had entered an abandoned fort, and so the fall of Jhansi was claimed. Described as a significant tactical victory, the toll on the Regiment was 7 killed in action and 52 wounded.|$|E

The specimen had been acquired by shipmaster and naturalist Alan Owston, who had <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Professor Kakichi Mitsukuri at the University of Tokyo, who in turn had brought it to Jordan. Thus, Jordan named the shark Mitsukurina owstoni in honor of these two men.

In 1774, he founded the [...] "Society for Inoculating the Poor Gratis", {{in order to help}} the poor people of Philadelphia afford inoculation. In his autobiography, Franklin writes: [...] "In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the smallpox taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly and still regret that I had not <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him by inoculation.

500|$|Graham found {{writing for}} two Doctors easy, as Smith's Doctor had a {{constant}} [...] "internal dialogue" [...] {{and was always}} finishing his own sentences. He wanted each character to be different {{and did not want}} all of them to become evil, and the Doctor would help them discover their humanity. Graham wanted Jennifer to be the antagonist as he liked the idea of the quietest character becoming the most evil. The original script explained that she has a perfect memory, and so her Ganger was able to remember every terrible thing that had happened to the Flesh. Several other sequences were cut from the final version of [...] "The Almost People". In the original script, the Doctor quizzes the Flesh Doctor about the events of The Mind of Evil (1971) and mentions former companions Jo Grant, Sarah Jane Smith, Romana, Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, and Donna Noble. There was also a montage of happy memories of the Doctor's life stored in the Flesh Doctor, which included flashbacks of previous episodes and serials of the show as well as events that had not transpired onscreen. Also cut was the TARDIS providing the Doctor with another sonic screwdriver after he had <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Flesh Doctor, in a similar fashion to [...] "The Eleventh Hour".|$|E

Though {{initially}} cast as a series regular, the character was replaced with Elaine Benes when the series was picked up for a first season.

Warren Littlefield has said that it was because the character's occupation: [...] "I thought that as a waitress she'd never be one of the gang. She'd be relegated to pouring coffee, catching up. So I insisted they create a female character they wanted to spend time with". Dennis Bjorklund of Seinfeld Reference has suggested that the character was dropped in favor of a female character with more sex appeal. However, Alexander said that Garlington was written out of the series because she had re-written her scene and <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> David, who was not happy with this. Seinfeld has, however, stated that this was not the reason the character was removed from the show, but rather that the producers were looking for [...] "someone who was more involved". Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who would go on to replace Garlington, has stated that she was not aware of the pilot before becoming a regular on the show, and she will never watch it out of superstition.|$|E
500|$|Although Chelsea Girl is well-regarded {{by music}} critics, Nico was {{dissatisfied}} with it: [...] "The first time I heard the album, I cried.

They were together in California in July and August 1967, often driving into the desert and experimenting with peyote. Morrison, who encouraged Nico to write down her dreams, read Mary Shelley, William Blake and Samuel Taylor Coleridge to her. He recorded his chemical visions and dreams, using the material for his songs as he imagined the opium-addicted Coleridge had worked. In 1986 Nico said, [...] "He taught me to write songs. I never thought that I could... He really inspired me a lot. It was like looking in a mirror then." [...] She began writing her own material and performing it to an intimate audience at Steve Paul's club, the Scene. Nico composed her music on a harmonium bought, according to Richard Witts, from a San Francisco hippie; manager Danny Fields recalled, [...] "I think Leonard Cohen may have <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her, or {{had something to do}} with her getting it." [...] With that instrument, [...] "she discovered not only her own artistic voice but a whole new realm of sound." [...] The droning pump organ became her trademark.|$|E
