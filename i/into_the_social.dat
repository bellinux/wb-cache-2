On 27 October 1991, the first entirely free Polish parliamentary elections since the 1920s took place. This completed Poland's transition from a communist party rule to a Western-style liberal democratic political system.|$|E
5|$|With Marais's loans {{combined}} with the Ebden scholarship, Smuts began to enjoy a degree of financial security. Though far from affluent {{he was at least}} able to meet his basic expenses. From his second year onwards Smuts began to enter more <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> arena of the university. He ceased to be lonely, making a number of friends and acquaintances, principally amongst the other colonial students. Though no longer so reclusive as he had been during his first year, he remained extremely serious and devoted to his work; an attitude which served as a barrier separating him from the English undergraduates, though not from the Fellows at Cambridge, with many of whom he struck up friendships.|$|E

25|$|The first {{field to}} claim descent from Kuhn’s ideas was the {{sociology}} of scientific knowledge. Sociologists working within this new field, including Harry Collins and Steven Shapin, used Kuhn’s emphasis {{on the role of}} non-evidential community factors in scientific development to argue against logical empiricism, which discouraged inquiry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> aspects of scientific communities. These sociologists expanded upon Kuhn’s ideas, arguing that scientific judgment is determined by social factors, such as professional interests and political ideologies.|$|E

25|$|Ciani (2008) {{concludes that}} support of World War I fostered an {{identity}} among Irish Catholics as loyal citizens and helped integrate them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> {{fabric of the}} nation. Rev. Michael Fallon, the Catholic bishop of London, sided with the Protestants against the French Catholics. His primary motive was to {{advance the cause of}} Irish Catholics in Canada and abroad; he had significant support from the Vatican. He opposed the French Canadian Catholics, especially by opposing bilingual education. French Canadians did not participate in Fallon's efforts to support the war effort and became more marginalized in Ontario politics and society.|$|E

Cupcea ultimately became a Doctor of Medicine in March 1939.|$|E

25|$|The book {{offers an}} {{in-depth}} account of Ion Creangă's early life {{in what was}} then the state of Moldavia, with much insight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> landscape of his childhood universe, describing relationships between its hero, mainly referred to with his hypocorism and patronymic Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei or Nic-a lui Ștefan a Petrei ("Nică of Ștefan of Petru"), and the various people in his life.

The narrative flow is often interrupted by lengthy and characteristic soliloquies, imparting Creangă's worldview and regrets. The text itself is noted for its characteristic use of the Romanian lexis, including its accomplished rendition of Moldavian dialectal particularities.|$|E
