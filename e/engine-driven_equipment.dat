25|$|There are {{synthetic}} pathways {{for using}} electricity to reduce {{carbon dioxide and}} water to liquid hydrocarbon or alcohol fuels. These pathways begin with electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen, and then reducing carbon dioxide with excess hydrogen in variations of the reverse water gas shift reaction. Non-fossil sources of carbon dioxide include fermentation plants and sewage treatment plants. Converting electrical energy to carbon-based liquid fuel has potential to provide portable energy storage usable by the large existing stock of motor vehicles and other <b>engine-driven</b> <b>equipment,</b> without the difficulties of dealing with hydrogen or another exotic energy carrier. These synthetic pathways may attract attention in connection with attempts to improve energy security in nations that rely on imported petroleum, but have or can develop large sources of renewable or nuclear electricity, {{as well as to}} deal with possible future declines in the amount of petroleum available to import.|$|E

The company supplies {{products to the}} industrial, commercial, and portable generator markets through many different distributors.In December 2009, Generac introduced Generac Industrial Power (a rebranding of its industrial products division) to include new engines, new enclosures, ergonomic changes and aesthetic changes. This included a partnership with Fiat Powertrain Technologies to supply Generac with industrial diesel engines for use in industrial generators.|$|R
