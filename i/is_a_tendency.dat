5|$|Because of {{its high}} {{resistance}} to P.cinnamomi dieback, the feasibility of using B.integrifolia as a rootstock for susceptible Banksia species in the cut flower trade is under investigation. Presently, the success rate for grafting is only 30–40%, and even with successful grafts there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for the union to fail under stress. More research is needed before the technique {{will be ready for}} commercial use.|$|E
5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
5|$|Measurements for the russet sparrow vary geographically, {{between the}} three {{subspecies}}, and also within the Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus. The subspecies cinnamomeus is generally larger than the others, and within this form there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for birds at higher altitudes to be larger, and a clinal variation in size with the smallest birds in {{the west of the}} range and the largest in the east.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} ouabain on the stomatal {{opening and closing}} of {{epidermal}} strips of Vicia fava was observed both in the light and dark. Experimentation revealed that, by adding ouabain, both in the light and dark there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for the closed stomata to open, while there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for the open stomata not to close {{as compared with the}} control...|$|R

5|$|No {{subspecies}} are recognised, and {{the only}} geographic variation recorded in plumage <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for females from more arid regions to have paler plumage. Testing of the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of Australian members of the genus Petroica suggests the red-capped robin's closest relative within the genus is the scarlet robin.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> by some modern {{scholars}} to ascribe to ancient barbarians {{a degree of}} ethnic solidarity that did not exist, according to A.H.M. Jones. Germanic tribes were constantly fighting each other and even within such tribal confederations as the Franks or Alamanni there were bitter feuds between the constituent tribes and clans. Indeed, a primary reason why many tribal sub-groups surrendered to the Roman authorities (dediticii) and sought to settle in the empire as laeti was in order to escape pressure from their neighbours. The few known conflicts of loyalty only arose when the Roman army was campaigning against a barbarian-born soldier's own specific clan. Ammianus himself never characterises barbarian-born troops as unreliable. On the contrary, his evidence is that barbarian soldiers were as loyal, and fought as hard, as Roman ones.|$|E
5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread out in the open ocean, though there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for individuals from different colonies to overwinter in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination of the availability of food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.|$|E

50|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> to {{eliminate}} final consonants in Vulgar Latin, either by dropping them (apocope) or adding a vowel after them (epenthesis).|$|R
5000|$|Mystical Anarchism <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> {{within the}} Russian Symbolist {{movement}} after 1906, especially between 1906 and late 1908. It was created and popularized by Georgy Chulkov.|$|R
5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> to trot with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, {{and appears to be}} heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of the heels.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{the largest}} tagma of the insect, which {{typically}} consists of 11–12 segments and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax. Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum and sternum. Terga are separated {{from each other and}} from the adjacent sterna or pleura by membranes. Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites. During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal segments are present. In modern insects there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> toward {{reduction in the number of}} the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable. If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for pterygotes, confusion reigns: adult Protura have 12 segments, Collembola have 6. The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 segments, and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10-segmented abdomen.|$|E

40|$|Two {{interesting}} {{results are}} obtained from CASS national household surveys of 1988 and 1995. First, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for intra-provincial inequality in both earnings per worker and household income per capita {{not only to}} rise in each province but also to converge across provinces. Second, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for both province mean earnings per worker and household mean incomes per capita not only to rise in each province but also to diverge across provinces. The paper is concerned to establish these patterns and then to explain them...|$|R

25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> {{to abandon}} {{traditionally}} gender-invariable adjectives {{in favour of}} marked ones, something prevalent in Occitan and French. Thus, one can find bullent/bullenta ("boiling") in contrast with traditional bullent/bullent.|$|E

50|$|There {{appears to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for more male parrots {{relative}} to females to be born. This {{may be to}} counter the increased predation that males appear to suffer in the wild.|$|R
50|$|As per J.A. Tomlin, Special Order Sets {{provide a}} {{powerful}} means of modeling nonconvex functions and discrete requirements, though there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> {{to think of}} them only in terms of multiple-choice zero-one programming.|$|R

25|$|Within theistic mysticism {{two broad}} tendencies can be identified. One <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> to {{understand}} God by asserting what He {{is not and}} the other by asserting what He is. The former leads to what is called apophatic theology and the latter to cataphatic theology.|$|E
50|$|Oligopoly meant there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> for {{the rate}} of surplus to rise, but this surplus did not {{necessarily}} register in statistical records as profits. It also {{takes the form of}} waste and excess production capacity.|$|R

25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> in the 18th {{century to}} use hyphens excessively, that is, to hyphenate all {{previously}} established solid compound verbs. American English, however, has diminished {{the use of}} hyphens, while British English is more conservative.|$|R
25|$|Comparative {{cooking method}} studies {{generally}} find that, if properly used, microwave cooking {{does not affect}} the nutrient content of foods to a larger extent than conventional heating, and that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> towards greater retention of many micronutrients with microwaving, probably due to the reduced preparation time.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part, Shelties are {{athletic}} and healthy. Like the Rough Collie, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> toward inherited malformation and {{disease of the}} eyes. Each individual puppy should have his/her eyes examined by a qualified veterinary ophthalmologist. Some lines may be susceptible to hypothyroidism, epilepsy, hip dysplasia, or skin allergies.|$|E
25|$|Mormons' {{political}} affiliations tend to vary geographically: {{while in}} Utah and Idaho {{the majority of}} members incline to vote Republican, in traditionally more Democratic U.S. regions such as New England and California, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> to have more Democratic members. Outside the United States, Mormons tend to follow national and geographical political trends.|$|E
2500|$|Literary Catalan {{allows the}} use of words from {{different}} dialects, except those of very restricted use. However, from the 19th century onwards, there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> towards favoring words of Northern dialects {{to the detriment of}} others, ...|$|R
50|$|Various {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{have been cited}} in support of mantle plumes. There is some confusion regarding what constitutes support, as there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> to re-define the postulated characteristics of mantle plumes after observations have been made.|$|R
40|$|In the {{research}} literature on white-collar crime, there seems to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> to claim individual failure rather than systems failure. Occupational crime is often emphasized {{at the expense of}} corporate crime. In {{the research}} literature on misconduct and crime by police officers, however, there seems to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> to claim systems failure. It is argued that police crime <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of bad practice, lack of resources or mismanagement, rather than acts of criminals. Based on two empirical studies in Norway of business and police crime, this paper is concerned with {{the extent to which the}} rotten apple theory versus the rotten barrel theory can explain crime in business organizations and police organizations...|$|R
