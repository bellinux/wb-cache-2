Seeing smoke seeping into her room, she opened the bedroom <b>door</b> <b>and</b> called to her brother, then closed the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> placed the hang-up 9-1-1 call that alerted police. She then crawled out of her bedroom window to escape the fire.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, {{believed}} his wife Nyssia to be the world's most beautiful woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom <b>door</b> <b>and</b> secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he slipped out of the room afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel security <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front <b>door</b> <b>and</b> ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates whether lifting the trawl <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps from the seabed can reduce bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries. We {{carried out a}} catch {{comparison}} and catch ratio analysis between two gear setups, one with the trawl <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps at the seabed (the traditional way) {{and the other with}} the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps lifted. The study was carried out on American plaice. The results showed that when fishing with the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps at the seabed, the gear is significantly more efficient at catching flatfish. The gear setup with the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps at the seabed captures between 50 % and 70 % more American plaice than the gear setup with the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps lifted. This difference is significant for sizes between 10 and 36 cm. Further, this efficiency is size dependent and increases with fish size. The results obtained are encouraging for the shrimp fishing industry as lifting the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps from the seabed could help mitigate fish bycatch problems, and reduce bottom impact. Further studies are recommended to investigate if lifting the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps from the seabed is equally efficient at reducing bycatch of other species, and if it also affects the shrimp catches...|$|R
