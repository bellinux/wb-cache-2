25|$|The drug {{causes a}} delay in the onset, and {{decrease}} in the duration of REM sleep. Following discontinuation of the drug, REM sleep rebound {{has been reported in}} some studies. Nitrazepam is reported to significantly affect stages of sleep - a decrease in stage 1, 3, and 4 sleep and an increase in stage 2. In young volunteers, the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam were found to produce sedation and impaired psychomotor performance and standing steadiness. EEG tests showed decreased alpha activity and increased the beta activity, according to blood plasma levels of nitrazepam. Performance was significantly impaired 13 hours after dosing with nitrazepam, as were decision-making skills. EEG tests show more drowsiness and light sleep 18 hours after nitrazepam intake, more so than amylobarbitone. Fast activity was recorded via EEG 18 hours after nitrazepam dosing. An animal study demonstrated that nitrazepam induces a drowsy pattern of spontaneous EEG including high-voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increase in the cortex and amygdala, while the hippocampal theta rhythm is desynchronized. Also low-voltage fast waves occur particularly in the cortical EEG. The EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus and centromedian thalamus is significantly suppressed. The photic driving response elicited by a flash light in the visual cortex is also suppressed by nitrazepam. <b>Estazolam</b> was found to be more potent however. Nitrazepam increases the slow wave light sleep (SWLS) in a dose-dependent manner whilst suppressing deep sleep stages. Less time is spent in stages 3 and 4 which are the deep sleep stages, when benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam are used. Benzodiazepines are therefore not good hypnotics in the treatment of insomnia. The suppression of deep sleep stages by benzodiazepines may be especially problematic to the elderly as they naturally spend less time in the deep sleep stage.|$|E

50|$|Adinazolam was {{reported}} to have active metabolites in the August 1984 issue of The Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology. The main metabolite is N-desmethyladinazolam. NDMAD has an approximately 25-fold high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors as compared to its precursor, accounting for the benzodiazepine-like effects after oral administration. Multiple N-dealkylations lead to the removal dimethyl-aminoethyl side chain, leading to the difference in its potency. The other two metabolites are alpha-hydroxyalprazolam and <b>estazolam.</b> In the August 1986 issue of that same journal, Sethy, Francis and Day reported that proadifen inhibited the formation of N-desmethyladinazolam.|$|E

It is sold in 5 mg tablets known as Erimin and Lavol. It is generally prescribed for the short-term treatment of severe insomnia in patients who have difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep. The sole global manufacturer of Nimetazepam (Sumitomo Japan) has ceased manufacturing Erimin since early November 2015.

50|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{actions of}} benzodiazepines at the GABAA receptor {{are similar to}} those of neurosteroids. Neuroactive steroids are positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor, enhancing GABA function and in turn have effects on mood and other functions. Many benzodiazepines (diazepam, medazepam, <b>estazolam,</b> temazepam, flunitrazepam and nitrazepam) potently inhibit the enzymes involved in the metabolism of neurosteroids. The tetrahydroxazole ring that cloxazolam and oxazolam have decreases the inhibitory potency of benzodiazepines on neurosteroids. Thus there could be subtle differences between cloxazolam and other benzodiazepines. However, because the parent prodrugs of cloxazolam and oxazolam were tested rather than the active metabolites, this is purely speculative.|$|E
50|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults {{of all ages and}} that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines including <b>estazolam,</b> the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. It was concluded that {{more research is needed to}} evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.|$|E

40|$|Objective. Insomnia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common sleep disorders. Hypnotics have poor {{long-term}} efficacy. Mongolian medical warm acupuncture has significant efficacy in treating insomnia. The paper evaluates the role of Mongolian medical warm acupuncture in treating insomnia by investigating the Mongolian medicine syndromes and conditions, Pittsburgh sleep quality index, and polysomnography indexes. Method. The patients were diagnosed in accordance with International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD- 2). The insomnia patients were divided into the acupuncture group (40 cases) and the <b>estazolam</b> group (40 cases). The patients underwent intervention of Mongolian medical warm acupuncture and <b>estazolam.</b> The indicators of the Mongolian medicine syndromes and conditions, Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and polysomnography indexes (PSG) have been detected. Result. Based on the comparison of the Mongolian medicine syndrome scores between the warm acupuncture group and the drug treatment group, the result indicated P< 0. 01. The clinical efficacy result showed that the effective rate (85 %) in the warm acupuncture group was higher than that (70 %) in the drug group. The total scores of PSQI of both groups were approximated. The sleep quality indexes of both groups decreased significantly (P< 0. 05). The sleep quality index in the Mongolian medical warm acupuncture group decreased significantly (P< 0. 01) and was better than that in the <b>estazolam</b> group. The sleep efficiency and daytime functions of the patients in the Mongolian medical warm acupuncture group improved significantly (P< 0. 01). The sleep time was significantly extended (P< 0. 01) in the Mongolian medical warm acupuncture group following PSG intervention. The sleep time during NREM in the Mongolian warm acupuncture group increased significantly (P< 0. 01). The sleep time exhibited a decreasing trend during REM and it decreased significantly in the Mongolian warm acupuncture group (P< 0. 01). The percentage of sleep time in the total sleep time during NREM 3 + 4 in the Mongolian medical warm acupuncture group increased significantly. Conclusion. Mongolian medical warm acupuncture is efficient and safe in treating insomnia. It is able to better improve the patients’ sleep time and daytime functions. It is better than that in the <b>estazolam</b> group following drug withdrawal in terms of improving the sleep time. It is more effective in helping the insomnia patients than hypnotics...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA gas chromatography-ion trap tandem mass {{spectrometry}} method for simultaneous detection of 22 benzodiazepines is presented. Four operating modes were first optimized: the {{electron impact ionization}} and chemical ionization modes were compared on both underivatized and trimethylsilylated drugs. Results were compared in terms of sensitivity in MS-MS experiments. The trimethylsilylation of benzodiazepines including a protic functional group allows decreasing their detection threshold {{by a factor of}} 10 - 100. In terms of sensitivity, the comparison between both ionization modes shows that the most efficient one depends on the benzodiazepine considered. The use of an ion trap analyzer allows switching from an ionization mode to another one during the chromatographic process. It also provides a great selectivity owing to the MS-MS and multiple reaction monitoring acquisition modes. The detection thresholds are in the range 10 - 500 pg/microl for all the studied benzodiazepines but the three "triazolo" ones: <b>estazolam,</b> alprazolam and triazolam, have a detection threshold of 1 ng/microl.
