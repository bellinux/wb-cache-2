Model inputs include {{the set of}} risk points and the likely spill scenarios and response requirements for each, the sites of existing storage locations and the <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> at each, and potential sites for new storage locations. It prescribes a minimum total cost plan to build new storage locations and/or expand existing ones and to purchase new components and pre-position them, and a contingency plan which determines what response systems should be composed to enable an effective time-phased response for each likely spill scenario. A family of heuristics based on linear programming (LP) is devised to resolve this strategic problem, providing an area-wide contingency plan.

40|$|In {{the medical}} device industry, many {{companies}} {{rely on a}} high inventory strategy {{in order to meet}} their customers' urgent requirements, sometimes leading to excessive inventory. This problem is compounded when it involves a long supply chain with several stages of activities and with long delivery and processing lead times. It is further exacerbated when high inventory leads to the frequent expiry of items with short shelf lives, which is typical of surgical items that have to be sterilized. Good supply chain strategies can potentially lead to a significant reduction of the supply chain cost. Through the use of relevant mathematical formulae and Strategic Inventory Placement optimization method, this paper examines the extent of the usefulness of a few possible strategies, such as kitting architecture change and continuous review system, for a family of medical emergency surgical kits across the whole supply chain for a medical device company. The result shows that reducing production lead time and review period, as well as adopting certain kitting architecture changes can reduce inventory value by more than 60 % and operating cost by more than 20 %. In addition, the paper shows that the Strategic Inventory Placement method can further reduce the total inventory value and operating cost by increasing the inventory of finished products and reducing the <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> in the supply chain. by Poi Chung Tjhin and Rachita Pandey.

40|$|Access to safe, clean {{drinking}} {{water is a}} major challenge for many communities. These communities are often near seawater and/or brackish groundwater sources, making desalination a possible solution. Unfortunately, desalination is energy intensive and a reliable, inexpensive power supply is also challenging for remote locations. Photovoltaic reverse osmosis systems (PVRO) {{can be used to}} provide water for underserved communities. A feasibility study which demonstrates the economic viability of such systems is discussed here. PVRO systems are assembled from mass-produced modular components. This approach reduces manufacturing costs. However, designing a system optimized for a specific location is difficult. For even a small <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>components,</b> the number of design choices is enormous. A designer with significant expertise is required to tailor a PVRO system for a given location, putting this technology out of reach of many communities. This thesis develops a modular design architecture which can be implemented in a computer program to enable non-experts to configure systems from inventories of modular components. This architecture is not limited to PVRO systems, but {{can also be used to}} design other systems composed of modular components such as cars, electronics, and computers. The method uses a hierarchy of filters to limit the design space based on design principles and calculations. The system is then configured from the reduced design space using optimization methods and detailed system models. In this thesis, the modular design architecture is implemented for PVRO systems. A set of detailed physics-based system models are developed to enable this process. A novel method of representing a PVRO system using a graph is developed to enable rapid evaluation of different system configurations. This modeling technique is validated using the MIT Experimental PVRO system constructed as part of this research. A series of case studies are conducted to validate the modular design approach for PVRO systems. The first set of case studies considers a deterministic solar input and water demand. The design goal is to determine the lowest cost system that meets the water demand requirements. It is shown that the method is able to tailor systems for a wide range of locations and water demands from a large system inventory. The validity of these solutions is demonstrated by simulating a custom designed system in the wrong location. Another case study shows that the approach can be used to determine market potential of new components. The second set of case studies considers variations in the solar radiation and water demand. The design goal is to determine the lowest cost PVRO system that meets the water demand profile with a specified probability. Two methods that use historical solar insolation and water demand to account for variations are presented. The first method characterizes the historical data and develops models to synthetically generate solar insolation and water demand profiles, and then simulates the system performance over 100 years to calculate the loss-of-water probability. In the second method, distributions of solar radiation and water demand are calculated from historical data and used to directly calculate the probability of running out of water in the worst month of the year. Both methods are implemented and shown to produce feasible system configurations. The direct calculation method is shown to reduce the required computation time and is suitable for different systems with variable inputs. by Amy M. Bilton. Thesis (Ph. D.)

In the future, service composition will play an increasingly important role in e-commerce, and automation will be desirable to improve speed and efficiency of customer response.

The algorithms will withdraw from one set of possible auctions and move to another set if this will produce a better-expected outcome, but will effectively manage the risk of accidentally winning outstanding bids/offers during the withdrawal process.

In contrast to the usually assumed first-come-first-served (FCFS) component allocation rule in the literature, a NHB rule allocates a component to a product demand only if it will yield immediate fulfillment of that demand. We identify metrics as well as cost and product structures under which NHB rules outperform all other component allocation rules. For systems with certain product structures, we obtain key performance expressions and compare them to those under FCFS. For general product structures, we present performance bounds and approximations. Finally, we discuss the applicability of these results to more general ATO systems. ...|$|R

When machines are composed <b>of</b> <b>components</b> that can be replaced independently, they {{can be considered as}} complex machines. The performance of such machines is computable as some function of the performance <b>of</b> the constituent <b>components.</b> This concept <b>of</b> operations, sometimes known as modular upgrades, can require the coordination <b>of</b> a large <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> machines and <b>components</b> in different conditions, sometimes geographically distributed over large areas. This dissertation introduces the concept <b>of</b> an effective <b>inventory</b> as an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> interchangeable and upgradeable components acquired to meet a set <b>of</b> goals. <b>Inventory</b> effectiveness can be defined by composing a function that includes key parameters and design characteristics <b>of</b> an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> complex machines. These definitions allow us to determine not only the impact <b>of</b> individual <b>components</b> and machines on the goals for the short term planning horizon, but allows an evaluation of various options for the long term planning horizon. The capability of improving the effectiveness <b>of</b> a <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> complex machines is built upon the foundation of industry and academic research in areas such as modular design, closed-loop supply chain, reliability, design for replacement and other related areas of study.

Orders are lost if not filled within the product-specific target leadtime. Production facilities for each component are geographically distant from the assembly facility, and the transportation leadtime is deterministic. Each shipment <b>of</b> <b>components</b> incurs a fixed cost and a variable cost per unit. The system manager must initially invest in production capacity for each component, and then dynamically control component production-expediting, salvaging and shipping, and the sequencing of customer orders for assembly. The objective is to minimize expected discounted costs for lost sales, production and shipping. We prove that as the order arrival rate becomes large, a simple policy with independent control <b>of</b> each <b>component</b> is asymptotically optimal. The policy is parameterized by 5 numbers for each component. We provide expressions for these 5 parameters and approximations for expected discounted cost and the long run average rates of salvaging and expediting, based on Harrison and Taksar's (1983) solution of a singular diffusion control problem. For a PC assemble-to-order system, we implement the asymptotically optimal policy and find that the diffusion approximations are accurate. ...|$|R
