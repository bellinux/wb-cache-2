5|$|<b>Insectivorous</b> <b>insects,</b> or {{insects that}} feed on other insects, are {{beneficial}} to humans if they eat insects {{that could cause}} damage to agriculture and human structures. For example, aphids feed on crops and cause problems for farmers, but ladybugs feed on aphids, {{and can be used}} as a means to get significantly reduce pest aphid populations. While birds are perhaps more visible predators of insects, insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption. Ants also help control animal populations by consuming small vertebrates. Without predators to keep them in check, insects can undergo almost unstoppable population explosions.|$|E

50|$|The small conical {{teeth that}} line {{the edges of the}} upper and lower jaws and the surface of the palate suggest that Pamelaria was <b>insectivorous.</b> <b>Insect</b> burrows are common in Yerrapalli Formation, {{suggesting}} that insects would have been an abundant food source.|$|R

50|$|Many insects have {{developed}} ways {{to defend against}} these plant defenses (in an evolutionary arms race). One method of adapting to allomones {{is to develop a}} positive reaction to them; the allomone then becomes a kairomone. Others alter the allomones to form pheromones or other hormones, and yet others adopt them into their own defensive strategies, for example by regurgitating them when attacked by an <b>insectivorous</b> <b>insect.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Ceylon {{paradise flycatcher}} is <b>insectivorous.</b> It catches <b>insects</b> while in flight in the understory.|$|R
50|$|The common {{chameleon}} is <b>insectivorous,</b> capturing <b>insects</b> by stealth and {{the rapid}} extension of its long tongue {{which has a}} terminal pad which grasps and adheres to the prey. Adults are known to eat young chameleons and have been observed to eat fruit.|$|R
50|$|This species roosts {{primarily}} in caves, {{but also in}} mines and buildings. The species is <b>insectivorous,</b> primarily consuming <b>insects</b> of the order Lepidoptera and Orthoptera.|$|R
50|$|The sociable weaver is <b>insectivorous</b> with <b>insects</b> {{comprising}} 80% {{of their}} diet. As an adaptation {{to living in}} the dry Kalahari Desert, where standing water is scarce, the sociable weaver obtains all of its water from a diet of insects. They also feed on seed and other plant products. Foraging is predominantly on the ground, but also on bark and leaves of trees.|$|R
50|$|Tarsiers are {{the only}} extant entirely {{carnivorous}} primates: they are primarily <b>insectivorous,</b> and catch <b>insects</b> by jumping at them. They are also known to prey on birds, snakes, lizards, and bats.|$|R
50|$|They are <b>insectivorous,</b> picking <b>insects</b> off leaves, branches, or leaf litter. While insects {{make up the}} {{majority}} of the diet they will also feed on spiders, worms, centipedes, snails, and small crabs; larger species will also tackle small vertebrates such as frogs, geckos and baby birds. They are generally sedate foragers and do not engage in hawking to obtain prey, instead being gleaners and probers. Only a few species migrate, most remaining resident in their tropical environment.|$|R
50|$|Most wrens {{are small}} and rather inconspicuous, except for their loud and often complex songs. Notable {{exceptions}} are the relatively large members of the genus Campylorhynchus, which can be quite bold in their behavior. Wrens have short wings that are barred in most species, and they often hold their tails upright. As far as known, wrens are primarily <b>insectivorous,</b> eating <b>insects,</b> spiders, and other small arthropods, but many species also eat vegetable matter and some take small frogs and lizards.|$|R
50|$|Old-growth forests provide {{ecosystem}} services {{that may be}} far more important to society than their use {{as a source of}} raw materials. These services include making breathable air, making pure water, carbon storage, regeneration of nutrients, maintenance of soils, pest control by <b>insectivorous</b> bats and <b>insects,</b> micro- and macro-climate control, and the storage {{of a wide variety of}} genes.|$|R
50|$|Rhinolophids inhabit {{temperate}} {{and tropical}} regions of southern Europe, Africa, and Asia south to northern and eastern Australia. All species are <b>insectivorous,</b> capturing <b>insects</b> in flight. Their roost habits are diverse; some species {{are found in}} large colonies in caves, some prefer hollow trees, and others sleep in the open, among the branches of trees. Members of northern populations may hibernate during the winter, while a few are known to aestivate; at least one species is migratory. Like many Vespertilionidae bats, females of some rhinolophid species mate during the fall and store the sperm over the winter, conceiving and gestating young beginning in the spring.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tangerine}} darter or river slick (Percina aurantiaca) {{is a small}} freshwater ray-finned fish in the perch family {{found in}} the eastern United States. It grows to a length of 4.3 to 7.1 in, males being bright orange-red while females are yellow. It is <b>insectivorous,</b> picking <b>insect</b> larvae off aquatic plants and the riverbed, and sometimes rolling small stones over to expose prey. It breeds in late spring and early summer, typically in shallow sandy or gravelly riffles. Pollution and habitat degradation may {{be a problem in}} parts of its range, however it is a fairly common fish with a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
40|$|Despite {{their close}} taxonomic affinities, nectar-feeding {{passerine}} birds from Australia had smaller kidneys, on average, than sympatric passerines of equivalent weight that fed entirely upon <b>insects.</b> <b>Insectivorous</b> passerines from North America had larger kidneys, on average, than comparable insect-feeding passerines from the separate endemic radiation in Australia. Dietary {{and other environmental}} differences, rather than phylogenetic origins, may account for these differences. The left kidney of Australian passerines was significantly longer, on average, than the right. Kidney widths showed no lateral asymmetry...|$|R
50|$|In the wild, croaking gouramis {{are mostly}} <b>insectivorous,</b> feeding on <b>insects</b> and insect larvae, however other food types, such as zooplankton, crustaceans,shrimp meat and {{occasionally}} plant matter, are eaten as well. In aquaria, a varied diet {{is important to}} their long-term health; standard flake foods along with regular supplements of freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex worms, brine shrimp, and some algae-based flakes will provide these fish with proper nutrition. Occasional feedings of live brine shrimp offer the aquarist an opportunity to observe the natural hunting behaviour of croaking gouramis.|$|R
5000|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{southern}} marsupial mole's diet, and all information is based on the gut content of preserved animals and on observations made on captive specimens. All evidence seems to suggest that the mole is mainly <b>insectivorous,</b> preferring <b>insect</b> eggs, larvae and pupae to the adults. Based on observations made on captive animals, it seems that one of the favorite food choices was beetle larvae, especially Scarabaeidae. Because burrowing requires high energy expenditure it seems unlikely that the mole searches for its food in this prey impoverished environment, and suggests that it probably feeds within nests. It has been also recorded to eat adult insects, seeds and lizards. Below the desert sands of Australia, the marsupial mole searches for burrowing insects and small reptiles. Instead of building a tunnel, it [...] "swims" [...] through the ground, allowing the sand to collapse behind it.|$|R
50|$|Though {{little is}} known about the feeding habits of many of the Neotropical species, wrens are {{considered}} primarily <b>insectivorous,</b> eating <b>insects,</b> spiders, and other small arthropods. Many species also take vegetable matter such as seeds and berries, some (primarily the larger species) take small frogs and lizards; the Eurasian wren has been recorded wading into shallow water to catch small fish and tadpoles; Sumichrast's wren and the Zapata wren take snails; and the giant wren and marsh wren have been recorded attacking and eating bird eggs (in the latter species, even eggs of conspecifics). A local Spanish name for the giant wren and bicolored wren is chupahuevo ("egg-sucker"), but whether the latter actually eats eggs is unclear. The plain wren and northern house wren sometimes destroy bird eggs, and the rufous-and-white wren has been recorded killing nestlings, but this is apparently to eliminate potential food competitors rather than feed on the eggs or nestlings. Several species of Neotropical wrens sometimes participate in mixed-species flocks or follow army ants, and the Eurasian wren may follow badgers to catch prey items disturbed by them.|$|R
40|$|Insectivory as a {{specialized}} feeding condition in mammals {{has not been}} explored as has been carnivory or herbivory. Insect-feeding, non-edentate mammals have dilambdodont teeth and modifications in the craniomandibular joint which distinguish them from other mammals such as carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores. Variation {{in a family of}} insectivorous bats, Molossidae, can be likened functionally t o the kinetic-inertial and static-pressure jaw systems noted in rhipidistians, amphibians, and reptiles. Food data show that the bats with the kinetic-inertial system eat moths and ones with the static-pressure system eat beetles. Not only do these <b>insectivorous</b> mammals eat <b>insects,</b> they also are modified to eat only certain types of insects...|$|R
40|$|Many microchiropteran bats use {{echolocation}} or biosonar {{signals to}} orient and locate prey. They emit short ultrasonic signals and {{listen for the}} echoes reflected from surroundings and prey. During a pursuit the signals change in a typical way: signal duration decreases, while repetition rate increases {{over the course of}} the three phases of the pursuit: search, approach and terminal buzz phase. Bandwidth often increases in the approach, but may decrease again in the terminal phase (Griffin, 1958). Aerial hunting bats capture prey either with the wing or the tail membrane. After the buzz, there is a pause in which the bat retracts the prey from the tail pouch before it emits the first post-buzz signals and returns to a new search phase (Kalko, 1995). Despite great variations in search signals between bat families, the pattern of changes during a pursuit sequence by <b>insectivorous</b> bats hunting <b>insects</b> on the win...|$|R
40|$|Abstract An {{experimental}} {{tree swallow}} population {{was established in}} the headwaters of the Shenandoah River, Virginia, USA to assess the accumulation and effects of mercury contamination on birds that eat emergent aquatic insects. One tributary, the South River, was contaminated with mercury before 1950. Reproductive success of swal-lows nesting within 50 m of this river was compared to that of three uncontaminated reference tributaries in 2005 and 2006. Female swallows on the contaminated stretch of river had significantly elevated blood and feather total mercury (blood: 3. 56 ± 2. 41 ppm ww vs. 0. 17 ± 0. 15 ppm refer-ence; feather: 13. 55 ± 6. 94 ppm vs. 2. 34 ± 0. 87 ppm reference), possibly the highest ever reported for an <b>insectivorous</b> songbird. <b>Insects</b> collected by the swallows to be fed to nestlings averaged 0. 97 ± 1. 11 ppm dw total mercury, significantly higher than on reference sites. Swallows in the contaminated area produced fewer fledg-lings than those in reference areas. The effect of mercury contamination on productivity was detectable only for young females in the contaminated area that were breeding {{for the first time in}} 2006, a segment of the population that may already have been stressed by inexperience. Tree swallows served as practical and effective biomonitors for mercury levels and effects and have great potential as proxy biomonitors for more logistically challenging birds such as loons or eagles...|$|R
25|$|For {{the most}} part {{swallows}} are <b>insectivorous,</b> taking flying <b>insects</b> on the wing. Across the whole family {{a wide range of}} insects are taken from most insect groups, but the composition of any one prey type in the diet varies by species and with the time of year. Individual species may be selective, they do not scoop up every insect around them, but instead select larger prey items than would be expected by random sampling. In addition the ease of capture of different insect types affects their rate of predation by swallows. They also avoid certain prey types; in particular stinging insects such as bees and wasps are generally avoided. In addition to insect prey a number of species will occasionally consume fruits and other plant matter. Species in Africa have been recorded eating the seeds of Acacia trees, and these are even fed to the young of the greater striped swallow.|$|R
