5|$|Humans <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{vicinity}} of Roxy Ann Peak {{for the past}} 8,000 to 10,000 years. The first inhabitants were semi-nomadic, most likely living off edible bulbs and large mammals such as mastodons and giant bison. Within the last millennium, the region became home to the Latgawa Native American tribe, who called the peak Al-wiya. They probably used the mountain for gathering acorns and hunting black-tailed deer and small birds, animals which are still abundant there.|$|E

5|$|Native Americans <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chetco River's {{watershed}} for {{the last}} one to three thousand years. Several explorers, including Sir Francis Drake, George Vancouver, and Jedediah Smith, visited the region between the 16th and 19thcenturies, and found the Chetco people inhabiting the area. Non-indigenous settlers arrived soon after gold and other precious metals were discovered in the 1840s and 1850s. The town of Brookings was founded in the early 20th century, and incorporated in 1951. Fourteen thousand residents of Brookings and Harbor rely on the Chetco for drinking water.|$|E
5|$|On March 4, {{the autopsy}} {{indicated}} Barker had nothing in her system since some chocolate milk {{the morning of}} her disappearance, and had not eaten since she vanished.

5|$|People <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{area since}} around 1350 AD. Prior to European settlement, {{the region was}} sparsely {{inhabited}} by nomadic groups of Māori, most of whom lived close to river mouths. In {{the early days of}} European settlement the area was frequented by whalers and sealers, and saw milling became a major local industry from the mid-19th century until the 1930s. Ecotourism has become of growing importance in the Catlins economy, which otherwise relies heavily on dairy farming and fishing.|$|E
5|$|The Martinique macaw {{is one of}} {{thirteen}} extinct macaw species that have been proposed to <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean islands. Many of these species are now considered dubious because only three are known from physical remains, {{and there are no}} extant endemic macaws on the islands today. Macaws were frequently transported between the Caribbean islands and the South American mainland in both prehistoric and historic times, so {{it is impossible to know}} whether contemporaneous reports refer to imported or native species.|$|E

5|$|The most {{commonly}} suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire. He {{is known to}} <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dialect region of the Pearl Poet and {{is thought to have}} written the poem St. Erkenwald, which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to Gawain. St. Erkenwald, however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus {{was one of}} many dinosaurs to <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lourinhã Formation {{during the}} Late Jurassic. Many theropods, sauropods, and {{especially}} ornithischians are also from the Lourinhã Formation, which contains a similar fauna to the North American Morrison Formation. Many theropods are known including an unnamed genus of abelisaurid; the allosaurid Allosaurus europaeus; the ceratosaurid Ceratosaurus dentisculatus; the coelurosaurians Aviatyrannis jurassica, and cf. Richardoestesia; an intermediate theropod; and the megalosaurid Torvosaurus gurneyi. Sauropods are less common, with only an intermediate diplodocid as well as Dinheirosaurus; the camarasaurid Lourinhasaurus alenquerensis; the turiasaur Zby atlanticus; and the brachiosaurid Lusotitan known. Ornithischians are well represented, with identified remains persisting to Trimucrodon cuneatus; Alocodon kuehnei; the stegosaurians Dacentrurus armatus, Miragaia longicollum, and Stegosaurus ungulatus; the ankylosaurid Dracopelta zbyszewskii; the ornithopods Draconyx loureiroi, Camptosaurus sp., Phyllodon henkelli, and cf. Dryosaurus sp.|$|E
5|$|Four Native American {{cultures}} {{are known to}} <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area during the last 10,000years. The first known group, the Nevares Spring People, were hunters and gatherers who arrived in the area perhaps 9,000years ago (7000BC) when there were still small lakes in Death Valley and neighboring Panamint Valley. A much milder climate persisted at that time, and large game animals were still plentiful. By 5,000years ago (3000BC) the Mesquite Flat People displaced the Nevares Spring People. Around 2,000years ago the Saratoga Spring People moved into the area, which by then was probably already a hot, dry desert. This culture was more advanced at hunting and gathering and was skillful at handcrafts. They also left mysterious stone patterns in the valley.|$|E

5|$|Humans <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Big Butte Creek {{area for}} at least 8,000 years. The Klamath, Upper Umpqua, Takelma, and Latgawa tribes of Native Americans {{inhabited}} the watershed until they were driven out in the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s. On Christmas Eve, December 24, 1855, Captain E. A. Rice along with 34 other men attacked a Native American encampment near the creek's mouth. Eighteen Native American men were killed, all {{the women and children}} were captured, and the camp was burned to the ground. Most were relocated to Indian reservations. Non-indigenous settlers first arrived in the early 1860s, and agriculture, ranching, and logging industries quickly developed. Big Butte Creek was named by early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy Butte), as was nearby Little Butte Creek.|$|E
5|$|Humans <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Little Applegate River {{watershed}} {{for approximately}} 11,000 years, based on Clovis points {{discovered in the}} area. The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia. They fished for salmon, trout, and lamprey, and hunted for deer and elk. They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The fires were limited by the Native Americans, creating a patchwork of burned and unburned land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Humans <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Table Rock {{area for}} at least 15,000years, based on the age of Clovis points that were {{discovered}} nearby. The region surrounding the Table Rocks was home to the Takelma people. They gathered food such as acorns and tarweed seeds, and caught salmon in the nearby Rogue River. The Takelma also used deer hides for clothing. They had several names for the rocks, including Di'tani ("rock above"), Titanakh ("little Indian plums"), and possibly Kwenphunkh. The first use of the names Upper Table Rock and Lower Table Rock is unknown, however the first recorded use was by mountain man James Clyman in 1845.|$|E
