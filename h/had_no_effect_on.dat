5|$|In 2009, 18 {{years after}} Lefebvre's death, Pope Benedict XVI lifted the excommunication {{of the four}} {{surviving}} bishops at their request. However, it was not done retroactively, meaning that it <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Lefebvre.|$|E
5|$|Other storms were {{individually}} unusual. Hurricanes Elida and Hernan also reached Category5 intensity, {{but neither}} caused any damage. Hurricane Fausto <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> land, but it regenerated into a weak tropical storm at an abnormally high latitude.|$|E
5|$|According to Peter Woolley, {{director}} of Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll, {{the situation of}} the election was similar to the 1990 election, when underdog Senate candidate Christie Whitman, a Republican, nearly defeated well-known Senator Bill Bradley due to Democratic Governor Jim Florio's sales- and income-tax increases. By August, Woolley concluded that the tax increase had <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Menendez's re-election chances.|$|E

5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect may involve {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress. While {{there is some evidence}} to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> aging.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top 15 in a stage. Unlike in the better known points classification in the Tour de France, the type of stage <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> what points were on offer – each stage had the same points available on the same scale. The win earned 25points, second place earned 20points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.|$|E

5|$|Having {{recovered}} the ball, and with Virginia Tech having no remaining timeouts {{and no way}} to stop the clock, Florida State was able to run out the remaining time in the game and secure a 2722 victory. Towards the end of the game, players on each team acted with hostility towards each other, and several received personal foul penalties. The penalties <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the final outcome of the game, and Florida State won the ACC Championship Game and an automatic bid to the 2006 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The Smithsonian {{hoped to}} salvage Langley's {{aeronautical}} reputation by proving the Aerodrome could fly; Curtiss {{wanted to prove}} {{the same thing to}} defeat the Wrights' patent lawsuits against him. The tests <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the patent battle, but the Smithsonian made the most of them, honoring the Aerodrome in its museum and publications. The Institution did not reveal the extensive Curtiss modifications, but Orville Wright learned of them from his brother Lorin and a close friend of his and Wilbur's, Griffith Brewer, who both witnessed and photographed some of the tests.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} transit circle was a 3-inch Combined Transit and Zenith telescope {{designed by}} Warner & Swasey especially for Illinois. The objective, by John Brashear, {{was held in}} place by a special cell that compensated for the different temperature conductivities of the brass and glass so that temperature <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the location or separation of the lenses. Designated as model M-505, the transit included a handing level, micrometer and a built in reversing mechanism. This transit was located in the east-central transit room allowing direct access to the clock room through a small window. The instrument cost $1200 in 1896.|$|E

5|$|These {{provisions}} covered both Cartledge-like {{situations and}} {{cases where the}} injured party, while aware of his injuries, does not connect them to the true cause until {{more than three years}} after the injuries were sustained. The act had a limited retrospective effect - it covered injuries that had happened before the Act came into force if an action had not been brought. If a judgment had already been made in a case, the Act could not apply to it, meaning the Act actually <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the Cartledge case itself.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top 20 in a stage.

The win earned 25points, second place earned 22points, third 20, fourth 18, fifth 16, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 20th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints; three points for crossing the sprint line first, two points for second place, and one for third.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Space Travel was fully ported to the PDP-7, Thompson had {{expanded}} his software suite to a full, basic operating system, {{in a way}} he had been unable to with the Multics project and the GE 635. The operating system he designed spread to other users in the company, and formed the core of what would be named in 1970 the Unix operating system. Space Travel was one of the early mainframe games developed before the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early history of video games, and was never distributed beyond its initial locations. As a result, it <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> future video games, and its primary legacy is that of sparking the creation of Unix.|$|E

5|$|Events {{such as the}} Pentridge Rising, the March of the Blanketeers and the Spa Fields meeting, all {{serve to}} {{indicate}} the breadth, diversity and widespread geographical scale of the demand for economic and political reform at the time. Peterloo <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the speed of reform, but in due course {{all but one of}} the reformers' demands, annual parliaments, were met. Following the Great Reform Act of 1832, the newly created Manchester parliamentary borough elected its first two MPs. Five candidates including William Cobbett stood, and the Whigs, Charles Poulett Thomson and Mark Philips, were elected. Manchester became a Municipal Borough in 1837, and what remained of the manorial rights were purchased by the borough council.|$|E
5|$|Like NY33 before it, NY441 officially {{ended at}} NY21 in Marion {{when it was}} first assigned. By 1970, the east end of the route was moved to NY350 in Walworth. The change in NY441's {{alignment}} <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the maintenance of the Walworth–Marion highway, however, as the Wayne County portion of NY441 was entirely county-maintained. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY441 from the Monroe County line to NY350 was transferred from Wayne County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the county received a part of NY21 in Williamson that connected to a state highway at only one end.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{models of}} {{economic}} defence in a group-foraging context {{predict that the}} frequency of aggressive interactions should decline as resource density increases. Studies with scaly-breasted munia show that the intensity of aggressive encounters was highest when patch location was signaled, {{and the effect of}} changing resource density depended on whether patch location was signaled or not. Signaling patch location was equivalent to making the resources more spatially predictable. Changing patch density <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the number of aggressive encounters when the location of food was not signaled. When food location was signaled, increasing patch density resulted in the predicted {{decrease in the number of}} aggressive encounters.|$|E

5|$|The 1975 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was near average, with 17 tropical storms forming. Of these, 9 became hurricanes, and 4 became major hurricanes by reaching Category3 or {{higher on the}} Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The only notable storms are Hurricane Olivia, which killed 30 people, caused $30 million (1975 USD) in damage, and left thousands homeless when it made landfall in October; and an unnamed hurricane that developed at very high latitude, but <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> land. Hurricane Denise was the strongest storm of the year. Hurricanes Lily and Katrina passed close to Socorro Island and Tropical Storm Eleanor made landfall in Mexico. Hurricane Agatha sank a ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{complaints}} from the SS-FHA {{about the quality}} of Volksdeutsche recruits <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Berger's approach. He concluded further agreements with Hungary and Romania, and imposed on the puppet regimes of the Independent State of Croatia and the Slovak State, to effectively authorise the unrestricted conscription of ethnic Germans in those territories. In the German-occupied territory of Serbia, the General Government (annexed Poland) and parts of the Soviet Union, ethnic Germans were conscripted into the Waffen-SS in the same arbitrary manner Reich Germans were conscripted by the Wehrmacht. By the end of 1943, a quarter of the strength of the Waffen-SS was made up of Volksdeutsche.|$|E
5|$|Bessie's {{increasingly}} centrist stance troubled {{party members}} in Liverpool Exchange, where the Bevanite faction was generally popular. In 1954 the local party passed a motion requesting that she step down {{before the next}} general election. This {{was rejected by the}} NEC, who believed that Bessie was a national electoral asset. Shortly before the May 1955 general election the Exchange party tried again, and voted by 40 to 39 to deselect her. Bessie, convinced that this vote had been rigged, appealed to the NEC, who set the decision aside and imposed her on the constituency. These party machinations <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Bessie's popularity with the voters; in the election on 26May, despite the intervention of a left-wing Independent Socialist candidate, she increased her majority to 7,186. Nevertheless, nationally the Conservatives retained power with an increased parliamentary majority. In the municipal elections held that same month, Labour won control of Liverpool's council for the first time; Jack Braddock became council leader. Bessie gave up her St Anne's ward seat, after 25 years, but remained on the council as a co-opted alderman.|$|E
