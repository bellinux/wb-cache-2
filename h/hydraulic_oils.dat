40|$|This is {{the final}} {{documentation}} of the basis that can be the foundation of how {{to solve the problem}} with leaking <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> in a shoe press at the company Albany International AB in Halmstad, Sweden. The project has been performed at Halmstad University as a degree project commissioned by Albany International AB. The purpose of the degree project was to find a way of detecting the hydraulic leak of a shoe press. The reason is that the shoe press runs unattended during nights and weekends, this can cause an extensive decontamination work and production stop if leak. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> could be leaking in large amounts or slowly as a fine mist. The development of a working system that can detect a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> leak and stop the machine before a large amount of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> leaks out would considerably reduce the cost of the decontamination work. It would also reduce the interruption time of the production. When the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> is leaking as a fine mist and spreading in the facility, the risk of fire is much higher and will be reduced if detected in time. The outcome of the degree project is this document containing results of investigations and a suggestion on how to make a prototype. In benefit of investigations, inquiry and tests the project group has been able to choose a suitable method of how to detect a hydraulic leak.
