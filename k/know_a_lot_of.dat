In the resulting positions Black has found it difficult to generate any winning chances, and even finding equality has not been a simple task. The fact that one must <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> theory just to secure a draw has rendered the entire variation beginning with 9...b5 rather unattractive from Black's point of view, even though it appears to be objectively the best move.|$|E

500|$|Biden {{declared}} his candidacy for president on January 31, 2007, {{although he had}} discussed running for months prior. It had been speculated that Biden would be offered and accept the position of Secretary of State because of his foreign policy experience and credentials. Biden rejected the notion outright, saying [...] "Under no administration will I accept the job of Secretary of State". He stated that he was focused only on the presidency. At a campaign event, Biden commented, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> my opponents out there say I'd be a great secretary of state. Seriously, every one of them.

500|$|Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly said he {{believed}} although the show initially needed improvement, that it had arrived at a [...] "settled and focused" [...] series with [...] "The Banquet". He praised the episode as a whole, {{as well as individual}} small moments, like Leslie's haircut, April calling her [...] "sir", Ron's affinity for bacon-wrapped shrimp, Tom's coining of the phrase [...] "peacockin" [...] to mean standing out in bars. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "The Banquet" [...] was funnier than other recent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the Leslie character continues to too closely resemble a female Michael Scott, the protagonist of The Office. Sepinwall said of the show, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people have already given up, but I really feel like the show is a summer's worth of tweaking away from being good. It's not there yet, but I see glimmers." ...|$|E

Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), {{but it was more than}} a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character. You <b>know,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> girls would have gone through with , and she stuck to her guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough enough to do it. That scene [...] is reflective of the two of them.

500|$|On January 15, 1996, Yankovic began {{recording}} the lead single for the album, [...] "Amish Paradise". Yankovic felt that parodying Coolio would pay off, because Coolio had [...] "such an identifiable image {{that a lot}} of things could be done [...] ". He noted, [...] "I like to play around with people that have some- you <b>know,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> style as opposed to somebody who's kind of homogonized [...] and bland and has no personality, and Coolio certainly kind of sticks out in a crowd." [...] Yankovic felt that juxtaposing the original song's [...] "gangsta" [...] themes with the Amish lifestyle would produce a humorous end result. After Yankovic revealed to his label that he would be doing a Coolio parody, they requested that the album artwork for the release also parody Coolio. Yankovic had been toying with the name Bad Hair Day for a time and felt that he could adequately use the name and lampoon Coolio – who was known for his distinct hair style – at the same time. The final parody recorded for the album, [...] "Syndicated Inc.", is a parody of [...] "Misery" [...] by Soul Asylum, a loving ode to syndicated television.|$|E
500|$|During his campaign, Biden {{focused on}} the war in Iraq and his support for the {{implementation}} of the Biden-Gelb plan to achieve political success. He touted his record in the Senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy.

At a 2007 campaign event, Biden said, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> my opponents out there say I'd be a great Secretary of State. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'" [...] Other candidates' comments that [...] "Joe is right" [...] in the Democratic debates were converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad. In mid-2007, Biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to Obama's, saying of the latter, [...] "I think he can be ready, but right now I don't believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training." [...] Biden also said that Obama was copying some of his foreign policy ideas. Biden was noted for his one-liners on the campaign trail, saying of Republican then-frontrunner Rudy Giuliani at the debate on October 30, 2007, in Philadelphia, [...] "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11."

She has commented that her father was aware of her experimentation with hallucinogens and marijuana, and even told her that it was okay, but that she had [...] "to stop if she had bad trips". Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times that [...] "I had a great family life [...] I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens... but I often feel it's because I experimented when I was younger that I have no interest as an adult. I <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult." [...] She often described herself as a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "depressed teenager".
