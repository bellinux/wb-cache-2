40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>high-temperature,</b> <b>short</b> holding <b>time</b> (HTST) pasteurization and homogenization {{with respect to}} inactivation of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis was evaluated quantitatively. This allowed a detailed determination of inactivation kinetics. High concentrations of feces from cows with clinical symptoms of Johne's disease were used to contaminate raw milk in order to realistically mimic possible incidents most closely. Final M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis concentrations varying from 102 to 3. 5 × 105 cells per ml raw milk were used. Heat treatments including industrial HTST were simulated on a pilot scale with 22 different time-temperature combinations, including 60 to 90 °C at holding (mean residence) times of 6 to 15 s. Following 72 °C and a holding time of 6 s, 70 °C for 10 and 15 s, or under more stringent conditions, no viable M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells were recovered, resulting in > 4. 2 - to > 7. 1 -fold reductions, depending on the original inoculum concentrations. Inactivation kinetic modeling of 69 quantitative data points yielded an Ea of 305, 635 J/mol and an lnk 0 of 107. 2, corresponding to a D value of 1. 2 s at 72 °C and a Z value of 7. 7 °C. Homogenization did not significantly affect the inactivation. The conclusion can be drawn that HTST pasteurization conditions equal to 15 s at ≥ 72 °C result in a more-than-sevenfold reduction of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|Sulfur removal {{by direct}} {{injection}} of calcium-based sorbents {{is an attractive}} option for emerging coal utilization technologies. Recent experimental results indicate the feasibility of capture by direct injection into hot combustion products at temperatures that do not thermodynamically favor the absorption of sulfur by the limestone. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analytically investigate possible explanations of observed capture with the goal of evaluating the feasibility of direct limestone injection sulfur capture in emerging coal utilization systems. The method was to use current available data on the physical properties of limestone and the rates of the pertinent reactions, and to develop a mathematical model of the process experienced by the injected particles. The models were then used to predict extent of capture at the high-pressure, <b>high-temperature,</b> <b>short</b> residence <b>time</b> condition of interest. The goal was to first investigate capture in a single-pulse reactor (combustion bomb) and then to extrapolate these results to advanced coal-fired heat engine combustion environments. Model predictions were in good agreement with observed sulfur capture in cold wall combustion bomb studies and suggest that efficient sulfur capture (in excess of 80 percent calcium utilization) may be possible when limestone sorbents are injected into high-temperature combustion products, even when the gas temperatures exceed the thermodynamically favored temperature window by several hundred kelvins. This behavior is possible because particle temperatures are moderated and held at a level that thermodynamically favors sulfur capture due to the strongly endothermic calcinations reaction...|$|R

The time domain features are <b>short</b> <b>time</b> energy, <b>short</b> <b>time</b> zero crossing rate. The frequency domain features are spectral centroid and spectral flux. After features are extracted, a simple thresholding method is used to detect the word boundaries. The segmentation is used to divide the entire speech sequence into a sequence of words or sub words. Among these methods, spectral centroid has high segmentation accuracy. Index Terms – Features Extraction, Speech segmentation, <b>Short</b> <b>time</b> zero crossing rate, Spectral flux...|$|R
