For these properties, chemical inertness and high atomic or molecular weight is desirable. The presence of gas molecules knocks the liberated tungsten atoms back to the filament, reducing its evaporation and allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life (or, for operating at the same temperature, prolongs the filament life). It however introduces heat losses (and therefore <b>efficiency</b> <b>loss)</b> from the filament, by heat conduction and heat convection.|$|E

It uses data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). The determinants of {{the magnitude of}} <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> across household investors are investigated in detail. The findings of this study lend empirical support to the belief that the magnitude of <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> for household investors differs with the different demographic characteristics and investment propensities. In particular, household investors with long-investment horizons, with more autonomy of choices in their SDAs, or with the tendency to select high levels of portfolio risk in SDAs are more vulnerable to <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses.</b> Factors to predict the levels of portfolio risk maintained by household investors in their SDAs are also explored.

The <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> of small deviations from long-run marginal disposal costs are not large.

Additionally, using PV solar power to charge DC batteries, as used in Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles and Electric Vehicles, leads to greater efficiencies.

An additional <b>efficiency</b> <b>loss</b> occurs in the transition back to DC for battery driven devices and vehicles, and using various interest rates and energy price changes were calculated to find present values that range from $2,057 to $8,213 (analysis from 2009).|$|E

40|$|Important {{assumptions}} that underlie cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) are that production technologies are convex and that production processes always perform at constant returns to scale. However, {{in the short}} run these assumptions are likely to be violated. Therefore, CEAs might overestimate cost-effectiveness {{in the short run}}. To come up with a more precise cost-effectiveness outcome, we present a model that is able to correct the long-run incremental net benefit (INB) for short-run inefficiencies. This provides decision makers with a more realistic view of the expected efficiency gains. This model starts by determining the initial <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> inflicted by inflexible resources. Then the model is made dynamic in order to adjust the <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> by allowing for refilling and writing off freed capacity. Finally, the model calculates the length of the short-run time frame in which such <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> exist, and a correction term with which the usual long-run INB should be adjusted to account for short-run inefficiencies. The model is applied to two cases: dialysis and digitizing a radiography department. The dialysis case shows moderate short-run <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> while in the radiography case short-run <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> are sufficiently large to cause a switch in cost-effectiveness from favorable to inefficient in the short run...|$|R
40|$|Given {{that both}} the costs and the {{benefits}} of biodiversity-enhancing land-use measures are subject to spatial variation, considerations of allocational efficiency call for spatially differentiated compensation payments for such measures. However, when deciding whether to implement uniform or spatially differentiated compensation payments, the regulator has to balance the allocational <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> of uniform payments with the disadvantages of spatially differentiated payments. To help resolve this issue, this paper provides a conceptual framework that allows the extent of allocational <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> associated with uniform payments for biodiversity-enhancing land-use measures to be assessed. A simple ecologicaleconomic model is presented which calculates the <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> associated with uniform payments for different types of benefit and cost functions. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Some {{important}} real-time {{tasks of}} the independent system operator (ISO) are the monitoring and control of power system events (load deviations and contingencies). These events are usually managed by the ISO using operating reserve ancillary services. These services represent an additional capacity (MW) available in generators and some interruptible loads. Generators must change their operating points in order that this capacity can remain available. These changes might lead to <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> in energy production. In systems with {{a high percentage of}} hydroelectric production, hydroelectric plants need to know the impact of ancillary services on their profits. This work therefore analyzes the cost of <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> due to operating reserve availability in hydroelectric generators. A method to calculate this cost component is proposed using a unit commitment dispatch for a single hydroelectric plant. This dispatch is performed without considering the operating reserve availability and is compared with the traditional dispatch, which takes into account the availability of operating reserve. The proposal is used to calculate the cost of <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> on a Brazilian hydroelectric generator. We found that the cost of <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> can be considerable when compared to the incomes of a hydroelectric plant in the short-term market...|$|R

40|$|The welfare {{costs of}} dynamic factor taxes are {{analyzed}} in a dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} with heterogeneous endowments, abilities, and tastes. Conventional functional form restrictions yield formulas for the transition effects and marginal welfare costs of factor taxes. Heterogeneity implies that taxes have feedback or distribution effects, beyond standard efficiency effects, {{that may lead to}} nonstandard aggregate dynamics. Also, marginal welfare costs vary systematically with initial distortions and agents' characteristics. Because factor taxes lower wealth inequality, equity gains offset <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> with the offset weakening as initial distortions rise. However, distribution effects reinforce <b>efficiency</b> <b>losses</b> unless preexisting distortions are sufficiently high, in which case some types of heterogeneity yield offsetting distribution effects.
