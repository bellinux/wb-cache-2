5000|$|<b>Interchange</b> <b>fee</b> is a {{term used}} in the payment card {{industry}} to describe a fee paid between banks for the acceptance of card based transactions. Usually for sales/services transactions it is a fee that a merchant's bank (the [...] "acquiring bank") pays a customer's bank (the [...] "issuing bank"); and for cash transactions the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> is paid from the issuer to acquirer, often called reverse interchange.|$|E

50|$|In {{a credit}} card or debit card {{transaction}}, the card-issuing bank in a payment transaction deducts the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> from the amount it pays the acquiring bank that handles a credit or debit card transaction for a merchant.

For cash withdrawal transactions at ATMs, however, the fees are paid by the card-issuing bank to the acquiring bank (for the maintenance of the machine).|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} public {{debate over the}} effect of <b>interchange</b> <b>fees</b> on credit card transactions. Regulators in Australia and Europe have argued that these fees can be set by banks to have an anticompetitive effect. In the US, {{it has been argued}} that these fees, together with a rule that prevents a surcharge for credit purchases, might create a cross subsidy between cash and credit customers. Academics have noted that, in particular circumstances, <b>interchange</b> <b>fees</b> have no real effects in the absence of such a no-surcharge rule. This paper demonstrates that the potential neutrality of <b>interchange</b> <b>fees</b> is a general result. We show that in the absence of a no surcharge rule or, alternatively, if there is perfect competition at the merchant level, <b>interchange</b> <b>fees</b> can be changed without leading to any real effects. This result does not depend on the degree or nature of competition at either the bank or the merchant level.

5000|$|The Durbin {{amendment}} {{also gave}} the Federal Reserve {{the power to}} regulate debit card interchange fees, and on December 16, 2010, the Fed proposed a maximum <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> of 12 cents per debit card transaction, which CardHub.com estimated would cost large banks $14 billion annually. On June 29, 2011, the Fed issued its final rule, which holds that the maximum <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> an issuer can receive from a single debit card transaction is 21 cents plus 5 basis points multiplied {{by the amount of}} the transaction. This rule also allows issuers to raise their interchange fees by as much as one cent if they implement certain fraud-prevention measures. [...] An issuer eligible for this adjustment, could therefore receive an <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> of as much as 24 cents for the average debit card transaction (valued at $38), according to the Federal Reserve. This cap—which took effect on October 1, 2011, rather than July 21, 2011, as was previously announced—will reduce fees roughly $9.4 billion annually, according to CardHub.com. As a result of the government limiting their revenue from interchange fees, banks made plans to raise account maintenance fees to compensate.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins of}} the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> are {{a matter of some}} controversy. Often they are assumed to have been {{developed}} to maintain and attract a proper mix of issuers and acquirers to bank networks. Research by Professor Adam Levitin of Georgetown University Law Center, however, indicates that interchange fees were originally designed as a method for banks to avoid usury and Truth-in-Lending laws. [...] Typically, the bulk of the fee goes to the issuing bank. Issuing banks’ interchange fees are extracted from the amount collected by the merchants when they submit credit or debit transactions for payment through their acquiring banks. Banks do not expect to make a significant amount of money from late fees and interest charges from creditworthy customers (who pay in full every month), and instead make their profits on the <b>interchange</b> <b>fee</b> charged to merchants.|$|E

40|$|Cards {{and cash}} are {{competing}} payment instruments at point-of-sale. The twosided market platform theory, based on general benefit assumptions, supports {{the use of}} multilateral <b>interchange</b> <b>fees</b> for card payments {{as a means of}} promoting the use of cards. However, analysis of the issue from the concrete processing cost viewpoint leads to the opposite conclusion: collection of debit card <b>interchange</b> <b>fees</b> by issuers results in subsidisation of cash and so actually promotes the use of cash instead of cards. Banks use card interchange revenues to cover cash distribution costs. For merchants, <b>interchange</b> <b>fees</b> increase payment costs and thus reduce the possibilities to pass through to customers the cost savings flowing from card efficiency. Moreover, because of high merchant fees due to high <b>interchange</b> <b>fees,</b> merchants are also more reluctant to accept payment cards. An MIF based on the tourist level approach will result in all parties being indifferent between cash and cards and thereby delay the realisation of the cost benefits of increased debit card usage.
