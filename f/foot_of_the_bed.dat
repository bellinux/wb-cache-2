5|$|Bowman {{finds himself}} in a bedroom {{appointed}} in the neoclassical style. He sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself, first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in the bed. A monolith appears at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and as Bowman reaches for it, he {{is transformed into a}} fetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light. The new being floats in space beside the Earth, gazing at it.|$|E
25|$|A shear is a {{separation}} of the skin from underlying tissues. When a patient is partially sitting up in bed, their skin may stick to the sheet, making them susceptible to shearing in case underlying tissues move downward with the body toward the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> This may also be possible on a patient who slides down while sitting in a chair.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Bryson's escape, Berdella was arrested on charges pertaining to the sexual assault of Christopher Bryson. He declined to allow officers inside his home, and the search warrant earlier requested was drafted to search his property. Corroborating Bryson's claims to have been restrained and tortured in a second floor bedroom, investigators discovered the bedroom {{on the second floor}} was found to have burnt ropes attached to the posts at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Also in the room was an electrical transformer, plugged into a wall, and with wires leading to the bed. A metal tray containing syringes, small bottles apparently containing prescription drugs, swabs, and eye drops was also close to the bed. Also found in the room were a long iron pipe, various lengths of rope, and leather belts. Investigators also noted that although Bryson's restraints had been tied to posts at each corner of the bed, other posts on the bed had been extensively worn, suggesting that restraints had earlier been tied to these posts, and that the individual or individuals had struggled to free themselves.|$|E
50|$|In {{some large}} state {{hospitals}} during <b>the</b> early days <b>of</b> ECT, patients {{were lined up}} in beds in a large dormitory with their heads at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds.</b> <b>The</b> ECT apparatus was wheeled from patient to patient and administered procedurally. This allowed for a higher throughput in treatments. However, this en masse treatment of patients gave rise to questions <b>of</b> ethics regarding <b>the</b> ECT treatment process.|$|R
5000|$|The smiling {{faces with}} their {{almond-shaped}} eyes and long braided hair, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> reveal Greek influence. However, the marked contrast between the high relief busts and the very flattened legs is typically Etruscan. [...] "The Etruscan artist's interest focused on <b>the</b> upper half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> figures, especially on the vibrant faces and gesticulating arms." ...|$|R
60|$|He divests {{himself of}} his shoes, loosens his cravat, and lies across <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> squalid <b>bed,</b> {{with his head}} resting on his left hand.|$|R
500|$|Other {{examples}} of the more comical nature of the story at this point include suggestions for a [...] "fat, batty, cartoon type, self-satisfied" [...] Queen. The Prince was also more of a clown, and was to serenade Snow White in a more comical fashion. Walt Disney encouraged all staff at the studio {{to contribute to the}} story, offering five dollars for every 'gag'; such gags included the dwarfs' noses popping over the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> when they first meet Snow White.|$|E
2500|$|British {{railways}} had a {{head start}} on American railroads, with the first [...] "bed-carriage" [...] (an early sleeping car) being built there as early as 1838 for use on the London and Birmingham Railway and the Grand Junction Railway. [...] Britain's early sleepers, when made up for sleeping, extended the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> into a boot section {{at the end of the}} carriage. [...] The cars were still too short to allow more than two or three beds to be positioned end to end.|$|E
2500|$|Despite initial {{misgivings about}} Carisa's design with a desk {{built into the}} <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> (one judge remarked that an active boy could easily hurt himself on the rough edges), her design was {{named one of the}} best that night. Goil's design, with a bed {{equipped}} to roll away inside the wall when not in use, and a crawl space for the child to hide if he so chose, was also liked by the judges. Erik's design, revolved around a wooden [...] "pirate ship" [...] (the client he had expressed an interest in pirates), won top prize.|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{go through}} so many <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> Bagshot sand; and so many <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> London clay; and so many <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thanet <b>beds</b> {{between them and the}} chalk: and then you will win water, at about 412 feet; but not, I think, till then." ...|$|R

50|$|Returning to the miller's house, John and Aleyn {{offer to}} pay him for a night's {{sleeping}} there. He challenges them to make his single bedroom into a grand house. After much rearranging, Symkyn and his wife sleep in one bed, John and Aleyn in another, and Malyne in the third. The baby boy's cradle sits at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> miller's <b>bed.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Olympia's body {{as well as}} {{her gaze}} is unabashedly confrontational. She defiantly looks out as her servant offers flowers from one of her male suitors. Although her hand rests on her leg, hiding her pubic area, the {{reference}} to traditional female virtue is ironic; a notion of modesty is notoriously absent in this work. A contemporary critic denounced Olympia's [...] "shamelessly flexed" [...] left hand, which seemed to him a mockery of the relaxed, shielding hand of Titian's Venus. Likewise, the alert black cat at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> strikes a sexually rebellious note in contrast to that of the sleeping dog in Titian's portrayal of the goddess in his Venus of Urbino.|$|E
60|$|Forester {{turned back}} and {{advanced}} to the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> There was a high foot-board at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and Forester leaned upon it with the lamp in his hand.|$|E
60|$|At the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> {{something}} stood very still, {{wrapped in}} shadow.|$|E
50|$|No {{definitive}} {{motive for}} the king's decision has been established by historians. It may merely have been <b>the</b> impulsive act <b>of</b> a man losing touch with reality. On 28 December that year, the king ordered <b>the</b> murder <b>of</b> Henry, Duke of Guise, who was stabbed by the royal bodyguard and died at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king's <b>bed.</b> Eight months later, Henry III was assassinated himself, by a friar called Jacques Cl√©ment.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was <b>the</b> Duke <b>of</b> Anjou {{who told}} me,' said Gaspard. 'He {{was sitting at}} <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's <b>bed</b> when she settled it all with M. le Cardinal. They will send to have coup de main made of all those rogues {{as soon as the}} Te Deum is over {{tomorrow}} at Notre Dame, and then {{there will be no more}} refusing of money for M. le Prince to beat the Spaniards with.' ...|$|R
25|$|The dead {{bell was}} {{therefore}} originally rung for two reasons: firstly to seek <b>the</b> prayers <b>of</b> Christians for a dead person's soul, and secondly {{to drive away}} the evil spirits who stood at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead person's <b>bed</b> and around <b>the</b> house.|$|R
60|$|So {{she went}} to the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and pulled off the boots very gently.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> office <b>of</b> head valet dated {{back to a}} {{historically}} unwise complaint some generations back by <b>the</b> Gentlemen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bedchamber, always great nobles, against the more menial aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role. Once established, the valets expanded in number and importance, somewhat at the Gentlemen's expense. One of their number was always {{a few steps from}} the King wherever he went, and the four Premiers, rotating quarterly, were alone able to, and presumably did, sleep at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal <b>bed.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Early that February, {{the coldest}} for many years, Adams had {{sat with her}} in her room for forty minutes. A nurse entered, unnoticed, and saw Clara's [...] "bed clothes all off... and over <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> rail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> her night gown up around her chest and {{the window in the}} room open top and bottom", while Adams read to her from the Bible. When later confronted by Hannam {{regarding}} this, Adams said [...] "The person who told you that doesn't know why I did it".|$|R

6000|$|Besides blind Raerik, Olaf {{had in his}} {{household}} one Thorarin, an Icelander; {{a remarkably}} ugly man, says Snorro, but a far-travelled, shrewdly observant, loyal-minded, and good-humored person, whom Olaf liked to talk with. [...] "Remarkably ugly," [...] says Snorro, [...] "especially {{in his hands and}} feet, which were large and ill-shaped to a degree." [...] One morning Thorarin, who, with other trusted ones, slept in Olaf's apartment, was lazily dozing and yawning, and had stretched one <b>of</b> his <b>feet</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> before <b>the</b> king awoke. The foot was still there when Olaf did open his bright eyes, which instantly lighted on this foot.|$|R
60|$|It is {{needless to}} point out <b>the</b> frank {{association}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two events,--the Nativity, and appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Angel to the Shepherds. They are constantly thus joined; but I do not remember any other example {{in which they are}} joined so boldly. Usually the shepherds are seen in the distance, or are introduced in some ornamental border, or other inferior place. <b>The</b> view <b>of</b> painting as a mode of suggesting relative or consecutive thoughts, rather than a realisation of any one scene, is seldom so fearlessly asserted, even by Giotto, as here, in placing <b>the</b> flocks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shepherds at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin's <b>bed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Harper's half-brother, Thomas Culpeper, was a {{prominent}} courtier and a favourite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King's, {{so much so that}} he was trusted to sleep in, or at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of,</b> <b>the</b> King's <b>bed.</b> In 1541, accusations were made that Thomas Culpeper {{was having an affair with}} the Queen. Both Queen Catherine and Culpeper were executed in February 1542. Culpeper was attainted and his lands given to the crown, but Harper had remained in favour, and was given some of his half-brother's lands, including <b>the</b> manor <b>of</b> Penshurst, Kent. From his brother-in-law, Nicholas Clifford, he inherited <b>the</b> manor <b>of</b> Sutton Valence, which became his chief residence in Kent.|$|R
60|$|At the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> stood Mother Anastasia clad in her severest gray, {{her brows}} knit {{and her lips}} close pressed.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Wickam, {{standing}} at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> like a disconsolate spectre, most decidedly and forcibly shook her head to negative this position.|$|E
60|$|But he delayed {{to clear}} the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
60|$|Making no {{revelation to}} Mr. Harker, but {{inviting}} {{him to take}} a walk with me to <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room, I watched what the figure did. It stood for a few moments by <b>the</b> bedside <b>of</b> each of my eleven brother jurymen, close to the pillow. It always went to <b>the</b> right-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and always passed out crossing <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next <b>bed.</b> It seemed, from <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head, merely to look down pensively at each recumbent figure. It took no notice of me, or of my bed, which was that nearest to Mr. Harker's. It seemed to go out where the moonlight came in, through a high window, as by an aerial flight of stairs.|$|R
6000|$|A short, solemn pause succeeded this benediction, {{when it was}} {{interrupted}} by a fearful groan, that struggled out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broad chest <b>of</b> Thousandacres. All eyes were turned on <b>the</b> other <b>bed,</b> which presented a most impressive contrast to the calm scene that surrounded <b>the</b> parting soul <b>of</b> him about whom we had been gathered. I alone advanced to <b>the</b> assistance <b>of</b> Prudence, who, woman-like, clung to her husband to the last; [...] "bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh." [...] I must own, however, that horror paralyzed my limbs; and that when I got as far as <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> squatter's <b>bed,</b> I stood riveted to the place like a rooted tree.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This paper will {{describe}} {{the results from}} two exploratory studies on un-witnessed elderly in-patient falls in acute facilities. The first study analyzed incident reports from England and Wales between 1 September 2006 and 31 August 2007 (n= 215, 784). We found a difference in <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> falls for patients described as frail and those described as confused. This was further explored in a pilot study to collect detailed information about contributory factors and <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> falls through staff interviews. We found that <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> bedrails seemed to alter <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fall, with falls from beds with raised rails clustered around <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed...</b>|$|R
