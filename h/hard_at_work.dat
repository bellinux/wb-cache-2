60|$|For {{some weeks}} past, the master had again begun {{to spend the}} whole {{of his time in}} the mysterious laboratory. On the rare {{occasions}} {{when he returned to the}} house, he was always out of temper. If the servants knew nothing else, they knew what these signs meant--the great man was <b>harder</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> than ever; and in spite of his industry, he was not getting on so well as usual.|$|R
25|$|Rousseau portrays Geneva in a {{very romantic}} and {{positive}} light, where people are productive, happy and <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> but he also recognizes the extreme wealth and poverty in the city. He first tries to sway Geneva away {{from the idea of}} theatre by suggesting that it is not economically feasible, and that the population is too low to support a theatre.|$|E
25|$|When {{the machine}} first shipped, {{flipping}} {{switches on the}} front panel {{was the only way}} to get programs or data into the machine, and the only output from the programs was the patterns of lights on the panel. Nevertheless, many were sold in this form. Roberts was already <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on additional cards, including a paper tape reader for storage, additional RAM cards, and a RS-232 interface to connect to a proper Teletype terminal.|$|E
25|$|In 1833 the childless Dyers had a {{boy named}} Samuel. About this same time some in the Chinese {{community}} requested a school. During this period Samuel was <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on a revision of the translation of Matthew's Gospel in Chinese. The amount of work that still was left to be done prompted him to write to England in the following year, appealing for more workers to be sent out. Robert Morrison died at Guangzhou in 1834.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Pernkopf was <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on the fourth volume. Two of his former colleagues, Alexander Pickler and Werner Platzer, {{completed}} it for its 1960 publication. A few years later, the publisher brought out a condensed two-volume set with all the color plates, removing most of Pernkopf's explanatory text (and, later, airbrushing out the Nazi symbols Lepier and the others added to their signatures). Since little translation was necessary, this was the version of the atlas which medical students and physicians elsewhere in the world came to know and revere.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for Goram, he {{overheated}} while <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> drank a giant {{quantity of}} ale, {{and fell asleep}} in his favourite (stone) chair, whilst Vincent paced himself better and completed his channel. (One version depicts Goram as lazy and Vincent as keen and industrious.) The geographical point is to explain the narrow gorge of the Hazel Brook (a tributary of the river Trym) in Henbury and the dramatic Avon Gorge through which the Avon now flows. The onomastic point is {{to account for the}} name of the Avon Gorge, but this is a bit feeble since the river has had this name from time immemorial.|$|E
25|$|The Davis {{campaign}} {{tried to}} run against the recall Yes/No vote instead of against the candidates that were trying to replace him. Davis tried to depict the recall as a $66 million waste of money that could allow a candidate with {{a very small percentage}} of the vote to become Governor—potentially someone who was very liberal or conservative. There are no primaries in a recall election. Davis {{tried to run}} “outside the recall circus” and to make himself appear gubernatorial and <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> for California, and who had made improvements to education and healthcare. Early August polls showed that over 50% supported the recall.|$|E

25|$|By Saturday, March 30, Sheriff Presley and Chief of Police Jack Runnels {{posted a}} $500 reward {{in an effort}} to gain any new {{information}} on the Griffin and Moore case that would lead to the arrest and conviction of the slayer or slayers. Officers stated that all clues found thus far had been fruitless. The results from the blood-stained sand were expected to arrive the day before, but due to delays at the laboratory, the results had not come in. By April 11, the officers were still <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on the case. Presley said that his department and other authorities had not relaxed for one minute since the discovery of the crime. He also stated that the $500 reward was still being offered and that no tip, no matter how small, was left without a thorough investigation.|$|E
25|$|In 1883, a {{group of}} {{railroad}} surveyors headed by S. L. Dolson and David Loring arrived in Rock Point, near present-day Gold Hill. They were charged with finding the best route through the Rogue Valley for the Oregon and California Railroad. Citizens of neighboring Jacksonville hoped that it would pass between their town and Hanley Butte, near the present day Claire Hanley Arboretum. Such a move would have all but guaranteed prosperous growth for Jacksonville, but Dolson decided instead to stake the railroad closer to Bear Creek. The response from Jacksonville was mixed, but the decision was final. By November 1883, a depot site had been chosen and a surveying team led by Charles J. Howard was <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> platting the new town. They completed their work in early December 1883, laying out 82 blocks for development.|$|E
25|$|While Presley {{was serving}} in Germany, Parker was <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> keeping his name {{known to the}} public. He {{realized}} that by keeping RCA, and more importantly the public, hungry for more Presley material, {{he would be able}} to negotiate a better contract for him when he returned from active service. He had arranged for Presley to record five singles before his induction, guaranteeing RCA enough material to release over a two-year period. RCA was eager for Presley to record in Germany, but Parker insisted that it would ruin his reputation as a regular soldier if he was able to go into a recording studio and sing. Stories appeared in the press regularly about Presley, including that he would do a live CCTV broadcast when he returned and that he had signed a deal for a series of annual television spectaculars to be broadcast across the country. All of these stories were fabrications, but it kept his name in view of the public.|$|E

25|$|In Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot?, Naomi {{is still}} rocking her party-planning {{internship}} under Rachel’s guidance. Her relationship with Austin has ended after Austin allegedly cheated on her with Holly. Austin says Holly snuck in and attacked him {{right after he}} came out of the shower but Naomi refuses to listen to him. Naomi has been so <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> that her boss, Holly’s mother, gives Naomi the responsibility of hosting her very own event, which is the debutant ball. During the ball, Naomi has rebound sex with a stranger in order to get over Austin. After Naomi has been caught in front of the entire party, Rachel fires her. However, Naomi tells her that Rachel's daughter cheated with her boyfriend. Rachel has sympathy and lets it slide but advises Naomi that she has to be a strong woman and deal with her problems. In Mama Can You Hear Me?, Naomi decides to become a ‘New Naomi’ and try to patch things between Holly and her mother. Rachel briefs Naomi about the impending award season. She entrusts Naomi with a very important assignment. Naomi suggests to her boss that maybe Holly can help too. Although Rachel is reluctant, she agrees to go with Naomi’s suggestion, and appoints Holly as Naomi’s new assistant; shocking both Naomi and Holly. Naomi tries to make amends with Holly, by entrusting her with the very important assignment of getting Mitchell Nash from the hotel to the event. At the event, Rachel is really happy with the way Naomi has organized things, while she is waiting intently for Holly to arrive with Mitchell Nash. Holly arrives at the scene and tells them that Mitchell Nash wasn’t staying at the hotel she had gone to. The boss blasts Naomi for entrusting such an important responsibility to Holly, who according to her has always been irresponsible. Holly and Naomi, haul in a completely drunk Nash to the event. He pukes on the red carpet, with the reporters having a field day. Later Holly and her mother are at it, with Holly trying to defend her position in all that transpired. Naomi again tries defending Holly in front of her mother. The whole thing proves counterproductive, with Naomi getting fired. Later, Holly thanks Naomi for all that she did for her and they both decide to become friends.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} was bitter and characterized by malicious personal attacks. Federalists spread {{rumors that the}} Democratic–Republicans were radicals who would ruin the country through revolution. They in turn accused Federalists of subverting republican principles through punitive federal laws, and of favoring Britain and the other coalition countries in their war with France {{in order to promote}} aristocratic, anti-republican values. Additionally, Hamilton was <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> attempting to sabotage the president's reelection. In October, he published a pamphlet in which he charged that Adams was [...] "emotionally unstable, given to impulsive and irrational decisions, unable to coexist with his closest advisers, and generally unfit to be president." [...] He also worked at persuading Federalist presidential electors in New England to withhold their vote from Adams, hoping to boosting Pinckney's chances of winning the presidency.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Gordon {{became the}} center of media {{attention}} due to a series of scandals in her private life. The serial's home network Channel Seven decided to support Gordon through the ordeals. The scandals cast doubt over whether Gordon would be staying with the serial and it was reported that she wanted to leave Australia for other roles. However, it was later confirmed she would be staying with the show and a spokesperson said, [...] "Jodi is looking forward, not backward, and is <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on the set of Home and Away". Gordon was backed by her fellow cast members and fans of her character, who voiced their support for her.

[...] He orders the pupils to believe the teacher but complains to Anna about her lessons about [...] "home". [...] Anna stands her ground and insists on the letter of her contract, threatening to leave Siam, much to the dismay of wives and children. [...] The King orders her to obey as [...] "my servant"; she repudiates the term and hurries away. [...] The King dismisses school, then leaves, uncertain of his next action.

500|$|In {{the wake}} of Athens' surrender, the long walls were torn down and the troops besieging the city {{returned}} to their various homes; a Spartan garrison probably remained in Athens to supervise {{the dismantling of the}} walls; Lysander sailed off to Samos to complete the siege of that city. Another clause of the treaty that had ended the war had allowed all exiles to return to Athens, and these men, many of them oligarchic agitators who had been cast out by the democracy, were <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in the months after the treaty. Five [...] "overseers" [...] were appointed by the members of the oligarchic social clubs to plan the transition to an oligarchy. In July 404 BC, they summoned Lysander back to Athens, where he supervised the change of government; an oligarchic politician, Dracontides, proposed in the council to place the government in the hands of thirty chosen men; Theramenes supported this motion, and, with Lysander threatening to punish the Athenians for failing to dismantle the walls quickly enough unless they assented, it passed the assembly. Thirty men were selected: ten appointed by the [...] "overseers", ten chosen by Theramenes (including himself), and ten picked by Lysander.|$|E
500|$|Lord {{had been}} the main writer {{on the first two}} albums and his {{classical}} music upbringing and interest in fusing classical and rock had profoundly influenced the direction taken by the band. Blackmore compared the organ-heavy mix of those releases to the works of the British progressive rock band The Nice, featuring Keith Emerson on keyboards. On Deep Purple Lord still had a great influence, which found maximum expression in the harpsicord-flavoured [...] "Blind" [...] and in the orchestral section of [...] "April", an original piece for choir and string quartet that he composed despite being <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in writing and arranging his Concerto for Group and Orchestra. Lord's dominance was balanced in this release by the space as writer and performer achieved by Blackmore, who delivered his longest and, for some critics, best guitar solos to date. Critics also remark Paice's progress as performer especially on the [...] "tribal" [...] opening track [...] "Chasing Shadows", where he had his first chance at songwriting. Bass player Nick Simper later stated that [...] "there was a lot of pressure from Jon Lord {{to do this kind of}} semi-classical stuff [...] we didn't actually rebel against it until the third album." ...|$|E
