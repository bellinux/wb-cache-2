Foam production was performed with controlled expansion using the "one-shot" technique. Water was adopted as the only blowing agent, and the isocyanate index (NCO/OH) was kept to less than 100, which reduced the cross-linking degree of the desired foam and increased its flexibility.

30|$|The {{difference}} in the decomposition of rigid and <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> was investigated by Chun et al. (2007).

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the mechanism of}} the transition from smoldering to flaming combustion of a <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam,</b> experiments were conducted with horizontally oriented foam layers under natural convection; {{this is a common}} scenario for a real fire. Temperature measurement, gas sampling, and thermal analysis were used to explore the transition's mechanism. It is seen that the exothermicity of the oxidation of the residual char left by the passage of the smolder wave front is much larger than that of the oxidation of the original foam material. The transition is determined mainly by the exothermic oxidation of the residual char and the availability of oxygen inside the foam. Furthermore, from the aspect of fire safety during the use of <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> in upholstered furniture, a series of experiments was done on how the foam length, ignition power, moisture content in the foam and flame retardant influence the transition in the <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam.</b> The results show that these factors can affect the occurrence of transition from smoldering to flaming and also the transition time because of the oxidation of the residual char left by the smoldering.

40|$|The present work {{is focused}} on the {{optimization}} of a green process based on the employment of by-products obtained from wood treatments as raw materials for producing <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams.</b> More specifically, lignin was employed in <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> in order to partially replace the usual fossil polyols; therefore glycerol (GLY) and glycerin polyglycidyl ether (EJ 300) were used as the polyol fraction for lignin liquefaction. Polypropylene glycol triol was used as a chain extender in different ratios with liquefaction solvents, and polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate as an isocyanate fraction. Liquefaction of lignin was performed by microwave irradiation, thus reducing the processing time and energy required compared to present industrial production processes. All the foams were produced in controlled expansion through the adoption of a one-shot' approach, using water as a blowing agent and with an isocyanate index (NCO/OH) of less than 100 to improve the flexibility of the foam. This approach allowed for the substitution of up to 12 % of common petro derived polyol with commercial soda lignin. Finally, the foams were characterized, presenting properties that could be modulated as a function of lignin content, GLY/EJ 300 ratio and isocyanate index. The qualities of the foams were compatible with existing materials used for furniture and for the interiors of car seats and couches...|$|R

30|$|Since then, Blais and Carpenter (2015) {{investigated}} a <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> {{with and}} without a chloro phosphate (tris-dichloro-propyl phosphate TDCPP) fire retardant using a smoke box (ISO 5659 – 2 2012) to assess the toxicity. The authors asserted that fire retarding <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> did not increase its acute or chronic toxicity when compared to non-fire retarded flexible foam. They also asserted that the toxicity of the fire retarded foam was {{less than or equal}} to wood on a mass/mass basis and that wood contributes significantly more to residential fires in terms of fire smoke toxicity. However, due to the poor reproducibility of smoke chamber experiments, the tendency for it to give very low HCN yields, and the fact that the experiment is well-ventilated, the reported toxicity is likely much lower than in a real fire situation. In a letter to the editor of the journal, Barbrauskas et al.

30|$|Paabo and Levin (1987) {{reviewed}} {{the literature of}} the toxic product generated by the combustion of rigid polyurethane foams. The review suggested that the addition of fire retardants did not appear increase the overall combustion toxicity of polyurethane foams. However, this did not take into consideration the incapacitating effects of the release of irritant gases. A more recent review, by Levchik and Weil (2004), assessed the decomposition, combustion and fire-retardancy of polyurethanes. The author acknowledged that there is a range of contradictory results available in the literature regarding their fire toxicity. It is likely that the fire toxicity of fire retarded polyurethane materials is largely dependent on the specific fire retardant present. For example, Levin and coworkers reported that melamine-treated <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> generated 6 times more HCN than an equal amount of non-melamine treated foam. However, the presence of Cu 2 O reduced the HCN generated by the <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> by 70 - 90  % at low temperatures. The authors associated this with the effects of the Cu 2 O catalytically oxidising the HCN into N 2, CO 2, H 2 O and a small amount of nitrogen oxides.|$|E

30|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> {{are used}} in many {{applications}} because of their ease of handling, excellent cushioning, and tunable physical properties [1]. They {{are used in}} a variety of commercially established applications like mattresses, automotive and furniture cushions, and carpet backing, to name a few. The main reaction in <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> processing is the polycondensation of poly-hydroxy compounds (polyols) with diisocyanates. Foaming phenomenon occurs when a small amount of blowing agent and water is added during polymerization process. Water reacts with isocyanate groups giving carbamic acids, which spontaneously lose CO 2, thus generating the foam bubbles [2]. Nevertheless, <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> like other plastic foams have low mechanical strength and low dimensional stability that could inhibit their use in some important applications such as shoe soles. The mechanical properties could be partly improved by modification of cellular morphology as microstructural studies on rigid <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams,</b> which have indicated that the compressive strength and modulus of the foams increase by decreasing cell size and narrowing cell size distribution through changing blowing agent. On the other hand, in recent years, polymer nanocomposites have attracted much attention because of their high potential to achieve great improvement in properties including dimensional stability, gas permeability, flame retardancy, and mechanical properties by adding a small amount of nanoparticles in the polymer matrices [3, 4, 5]. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} incorporation of nanoparticles with their large surface area and fine dimensions as well as very close contact between particles and the polymer matrix could alter foam morphology and properties.|$|R
40|$|<b>Polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> have a {{wide variety}} of {{commercial}} applications in daily life due to their unique advantages. Traditionally, <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> are made from petroleum-based polyols and isocyanates. Due to the shortage of fossil resources, renewable biobased materials are studied as alternatives to petroleum. In this project, castor oil was chosen as a renewable biobased polyol in order to replace the nonrenewable petroleum-based polyols. Water-blown rigid foams were made from polyols with different levels of castor oil replacement. For foams without castor oil and with 25 % castor oil replacement, the effects of water added content were studied. Another group of foams made from a castor oil/ glycerol mixture were also prepared to investigate the effects of hydroxyl number. With the help of glycerol, rigid <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> with 80 %- 95 % castor oil replacement were successfully prepared and showed competitive physical properties. Water-blown flexible foams were made from polyols using different levels of castor oil replacement. At the same time, the influence of cross-linker contents and isocyanate index on flexible foam was studied. Considering the low reaction rate of castor oil during the synthesis of polyurethane, a specific "heated mold" method was applied. Density, compression force deflection (CFD), 50 % constant deflection compression (CDC), tear resistance (TR) and resilience were tested to identify the physical properties of <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams.</b> Results show that castor oil replacement often leads to a high cross-linking density.
