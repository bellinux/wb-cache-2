5000|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>pumps</b> (with {{external}} teeth) (fixed displacement) {{are simple}} and economical pumps. The swept volume or displacement of <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> for hydraulics will be between about 1 and 200 millilitres. They {{have the lowest}} volumetric efficiency ( [...] ) of all three basic pump types (gear, vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. For lubrication, the gear pump uses {{a small amount of}} oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the pump housing. Some <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the gear pump, is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|E

In this design, the floating plate of typical <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> is ceramiclized to improve its wear-resisting property; the balance chamber was used to brace and lubricate the axle. Furthermore, the radial unbalanced force induced by the pressure difference of input and output is balanced by the structure of balance chamber. The dynamic characteristic of <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> is improved and the axel wear is reduced. By using tip relief of tooth flank profile modification, the leakage rate of gear flank is effectively reduced, and the volume efficiency is improved. Water hydraulic transmission will be potentially applied in multi field with the advantage of its safe, non-pollution, clean, cheap and energy resource saving.

This volumetric unit type is the most commonly used in hydraulic medium power actuation because it shows a reduced complexity, a high reliability and easy maintenance in use.

50|$|In a {{hydraulic}} installation, one pump can serve several cylinders and motors. However, {{in that case}} a constant pressure system is required and the system always needs full power. It is more economic to give each cylinder and motor its own pump. In that case, multi-pump assemblies can be used. <b>Gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are often supplied as multi-pumps. The different chambers (sometimes of different sizes) are mounted in one body or built together. Vane pumps and gerotor pumps too are often available as multi-pumps. Screw pumps can be combined with gear or vane pumps. Axial piston swashplate pumps can be combined with a second pump, or {{with one or more}} <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> or vane pumps (the gear or vane pumps often serving as flush pumps for cooling larger units).
