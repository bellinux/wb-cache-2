5|$|More than 60 Catsuits were {{designed}} in the six-month shoot at $1,000 each. The Batsuit was updated, which was made out of a thinner, slightly more flexible foam rubber material than the suit from Batman. DeVito was uncomfortable with his costume, but this made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to get into character. J. P. Morgan's wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck's costume design.|$|E
5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with the San Francisco Chronicle, Damon revealed that he was asked to appear on the show by Sean Hayes, a friend of Damon's and the actor that plays Jack on Will & Grace. Damon enjoyed the idea for the episode and agreed to appear on the show. He commented that it was <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to get into character because he had previously played a gay character in the film The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999). Following his appearance, Damon told the Chicago Sun-Times in June 2002 {{that he would like to}} come back and guest star.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Stafford {{said there}} were good and bad points to working closely with Weston. His {{knowledge}} of her made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because {{he knew she was}} capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she thought her voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was in the bath {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E
5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, {{it would not have been}} <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. After the first race, Giovinazzi {{said he had been}} amazed at his first victory in the GP2 Series and thanked his team and his primary sponsor. He stated that he did not think that he would able to secure his first victory before the season was over, and was happy to score the points he earned for himself and his team. Sirotkin said the race was not <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> because {{he did not have the}} start he intended. He said that he was happy with his second-place result but would not to be content finishing in either second or third in every event. Marciello stated that he expected some safety cars to affect the race but was unhappy with how many there were as they had prevented him building a large enough gap to his rivals. He said that his third-place finish was good for his team and revealed that he was not surprised when Sirotkin passed him on the start/finish straight on the first race's final lap as he saw him close up to him under the safety car.|$|E

25|$|For Whittle, {{this was}} {{the chance of a}} lifetime, not only to enter the {{commissioned}} ranks but also because the training included flying lessons on the Avro 504. While at Cranwell he lodged in a bungalow at Dorrington. Being an ex-apprentice amongst a majority of ex-public schoolboys, life as an officer cadet was not <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> but he nevertheless excelled in the courses and went solo in 1927 after only 13.5 hours instruction, quickly progressing to the Bristol Fighter and gaining a reputation for daredevil low flying and aerobatics.|$|E
25|$|King Amadeus {{made him}} prince of Vergara. The Restoration caused a statue {{to him to}} be built near {{the gate of the}} Retiro Park in Madrid. A {{magnificent}} statue and fountain was raised in his memory at Logrono. Spaniards of all political factions, except Carlists and Ultramontanes, paid homage to his memory when he died at his La Rioja on 8 January 1879. His preferences were modest, his manners rather reserved but always kind and considerate of humble folk. He was a typical Spanish soldier-politician but had more of the better traits of the soldier born and bred than of the arts of the statesman. His military traits did not always make it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to accommodate himself to courtiers and professional politicians.|$|E

25|$|Wei Yan's {{reasoning}} for his Ziwu Valley Plan {{was recorded}} in the historical text Weilüe, which was then added as annotations to his biography in the Sanguozhi. It stated: Wei Yan received intelligence that the defender of the strategic city Chang'an, Xiahou Mao, was cowardly and incompetent. Thus, he reasoned, it would be <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to take 5,000 troops (and another 5,000 to carry supplies) across the Qin Mountains via the Ziwu Valley (子午谷) and into Chang'an. Wei Yan estimated that he would reach Chang'an in ten days and scare Xiahou Mao into flight, leaving the grain in Chang'an's storehouses for Shu's taking. There, Wei Yan's force can wait for Zhuge Liang's main army to take the safer road out of Xie Valley (斜谷) and rendezvous in Chang'an. In this way, the region west of Xianyang could be conquered in one movement.|$|E
25|$|In 1822 {{he went to}} {{a school}} at Southwell, then to one at Risley, and in 1825 to Winchester as a commoner. In Lowe's {{fragment}} of autobiography he shows an unpleasing picture of the under-feeding and other conditions of the school life of the time. The languages of Latin and Greek were the main subjects of study and Lowe records that both were <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Lowe then attended University College, Oxford and enjoyed the change; there as a pupil of Benjamin Jowett he gained a first class degree in classics and a second class in mathematics, besides taking a leading part in the Union debates. In 1835 he won a fellowship at Magdalen, but vacated it on marrying, on 26 March 1836, Georgiana Orred (d. 1884). Lowe was for a few years a successful tutor at Oxford, but in 1838 was disappointed at not being elected to the professorship of Greek at the University of Glasgow.|$|E
500|$|Barney Gumble is {{voiced by}} Dan Castellaneta. Early on the show, Castellaneta {{discovered}} {{that it was not}} <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to do Barney's trademark belch every time a script called for it, so he identified his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard. Castellaneta has voiced Barney every time he has appeared in the series, {{with the exception of the}} episode [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet", in which some of Barney's singing is provided by a member of The Dapper Dans, who recorded lines for all four members of the Be Sharps. Their recordings were intermixed with the cast's, often with a cast member singing the melody and the Dapper Dans providing backup.|$|E

500|$|For the episode, Gillian Anderson's {{character}} Dana Scully {{was written}} off {{as a member of}} The X-Files office, since the next season would mark the creation of the [...] "new" [...] X-Files with Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish taking over for Duchovny and Anderson. Because of this change, Spotnitz called [...] "Alone" [...] the last of the [...] "old" [...] X-Files stand-alone episodes. As with many other episodes, Duchovny did not want his character to have all the answers, giving the reason that it looked too <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Duchovny and Spotnitz later had a long discussion on how to remove the scenes or tweak them. Unfortunately, because the episode was the last stand-alone episode to feature the character of Fox Mulder, Duchovny did not care as much as [...] "usual" [...] about creating a [...] "mystery" [...] for the episode.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{confessed that}} it was not <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{to come up with the}} lyrics to [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in that length of time. But two hours later, he had written the verses, and the hook, in spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made {{provision}} for a backing track; he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyoncé, who was inspired by looking at herself in the mirror; as she was not wearing matching clothes and her hair was untidy, she kept saying, [...] "I'm looking so crazy right now." [...] Harrison sang back to her and said, [...] "That's the hook." [...] It also inspired the title of the song. After that Beyoncé had filled up the middle eight, she came up with the catchphrase – [...] "Uh-oh, uh-oh, you know" [...] – alongside Harrison.|$|E
500|$|A reclusive gifted {{musician}} and writer, Daniel changed his surname from Pinter to Brand, the maiden {{name of his}} maternal grandmother, before Pinter and Fraser became romantically involved; while according to Fraser, his father couldn't understand it, {{she says that she}} could: [...] "Pinter is such a distinctive name that he must have got tired of being asked, 'Any relation? [...] Michael Billington wrote that Pinter saw Daniel's name change as [...] "a largely pragmatic move on Daniel's part designed to keep the press... at bay." [...] Fraser told Billington that Daniel [...] "was very nice to me {{at a time when it}} would have been only too <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to have turned on me... simply because he had been the sole focus of his father's love and now manifestly wasn't." [...] Still unreconciled at the time of his father's death, Daniel Brand did not attend Pinter's funeral.|$|E

500|$|Gaiman {{suggested}} they make an episode which centres on the TARDIS itself, {{which was not}} done before for the entire series since it began in 1963. The original plan focused {{on the idea of}} the Doctor being pursued by an enemy inside the TARDIS, but went through several subsequent changes; Gaiman changed the plan to focus on the companion due to the Doctor's knowledge of his ship making it too <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to escape his enemy, made the TARDIS the threat rather than just a specific alien to avoid making it a simple 'cat-and-mouse' game, and then included the idea of Idris to account for what happened to the TARDIS's mind during this attack. The central idea was a [...] "what if" [...] scenario {{to see what would happen}} if the Doctor and the TARDIS got to talk together. Head writer Steven Moffat liked the idea of featuring the TARDIS as a woman, believing this to be the [...] "ultimate love story" [...] for the Doctor.|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{revealed}} that captain Roy Keane {{would return to}} his midfield role after playing in central defence in their win over Juventus: [...] "It took Roy about 15 minutes to settle into Tuesday's game but once he started {{to make sure he}} could see his opponent, he grasped the role very quickly, in the end, he could have played with a bowler hat and white gloves on it was so <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He is a marvellous player and choosing him in defence is certainly an option but Mikaël Silvestre and John O'Shea should be fit and I have a back four in my mind." [...] The final was United's first since the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final and Ferguson was determined to win: That is too long for us, and we are delighted. We have always looked at the League Cup as an extra to blood young players, but the format now has encouraged teams to have a go. We've played Liverpool once in Cardiff – in the Charity Shield – and lost so I hope this time it will be a different result." ...|$|E
500|$|Morley took a {{break from}} Neighbours in mid-2012, which led the writers to improvise an {{on-screen}} break up for Aidan and Chris. The break up occurs after Aidan learns Chris has not told his parents {{that they are in}} a relationship. Mason said that Chris is fine with his friends knowing about his relationship, but it is different story {{when it comes to his}} parents. His father has not always made things <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in the past, so he does not give him and his mother a chance to get to know Aidan. When Chris' parents throw him a birthday party at Lassiter's Lake, he decides not to invite Aidan. However, Aidan learns about the party from Andrew and he feels [...] "hurt and humiliated" [...] by Chris' actions. Aidan makes it clear to Chris that their relationship is over and Mason added [...] "That's when the gravity of the situation hits Chris, and he's left in shock. He thinks, 'How did it come to this?'. Things really seemed to be falling into place with Aidan." [...] Chris then learns that his parents would have accepted the relationship and he realises that he has lost Aidan due to an assumption.|$|E
