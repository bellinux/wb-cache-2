2500|$|... "Through-holed and wedged" [...] {{is one of}} {{the primary}} means of joining Windsor chair parts. A {{cylindrical}} or slightly tapered hole is bored in the first piece, the matching cylindrical or tapered end of the second piece is inserted in the hole as a round tenon, and a wedge is driven into the end of this tenon, flaring it tight in the hole. The excess portion of the wedge is then cut <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> This supplies a mechanical hold that will prevail when the glue fails. In general, early Windsor chair joints are held together mechanically, making glue a redundant detail in their assembly.|$|E
50|$|To ensure stealth capabilities, {{anechoic}} coatings of radar absorbent materials (RAM) {{have been}} used in the load-bearing structures over large areas of the ship. This strategy leads to significant weight saving compared to the conventional construction technique of applying RAM cladding to <b>the</b> external <b>surfaces.</b> <b>The</b> ship's profile has a faceted appearance with no right angle structures and few orientations of reflective panels. Doors and hatches are <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> and <b>the</b> windows are flush without visible coaming (edge of window aperture) and are fitted with radar reflective screens.

2500|$|Timbers {{were set}} into the upper courses of most walls to stiffen them. Massive {{exterior}} buttresses were also employed to fortify wall sections (see the photo at right), but this method of reinforcement required the inclusion of pilasters {{on the inside of}} the building to resist the [...] thrust of the buttresses and prevent the collapse of the wall. Pilasters and buttresses were often composed of more durable baked brick, even when the walls they supported were adobe. When the walls got too high for workers on the ground to reach the top, simple wood scaffolding was erected from whatever lumber was available. Many times posts were temporarily cemented into the walls to support catwalks. When the wall was completed, the posts were removed and the voids filled with adobe, or were sometimes sawed off <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the wall.|$|E
2500|$|A new {{approach}} to avoiding overhead wires is taken by the [...] "second generation" [...] tram/streetcar system in Bordeaux, France (entry into service of the first line in December 2003; original system discontinued in 1958) with its APS (alimentation par sol – ground current feed). This involves a third rail which is <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> like {{the tops of the}} running rails. The circuit is divided into segments with each segment energized in turn by sensors from the car as it passes over it, the remainder of the third rail remaining [...] "dead". Since each energized segment is completely covered by the lengthy articulated cars, and goes dead before being [...] "uncovered" [...] by the passage of the vehicle, there is no danger to pedestrians. This system has also been adopted in some sections of the new tram systems in Reims, France (opened 2011) and Angers, France (also opened 2011). Proposals are in place for a number of other new services including Dubai, UAE; Barcelona, Spain; Florence, Italy; Marseille, France; Gold Coast, Australia; Washington, D.C., U.S.A.; Brasília, Brazil and Tours, France.|$|E

50|$|Streetcars began {{operation}} in New York City along the Bowery in 1832, but the technology {{did not really}} become popular until 1852, when Alphonse Loubat invented a side-bearing rail that could be laid <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> street <b>surface,</b> allowing <b>the</b> first horse-drawn streetcar lines.

40|$|Wet gas {{metering}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important problem to {{the oil and gas}} industry. The Venturi meter is a favoured device for the metering of the unprocessed wet natural gas production flows. Various combinations of techniques have been employed in annular gas-liquid two phase flows to measure the flow parameters (e. g. liquid film thickness, gas volume fraction and the phase flow rates). One of the most useful techniques which has proven attractive for many multiphase flow applications is the electrical conductance technique. This paper presents an advanced Conductance Venturi Meter which is capable of measuring the gas volume fractions at the inlet and the throat of the Venturi. This model is based on the measurement of the gas volume fractions at the inlet and the throat of the Venturi meter using a conductance technique. We measure conductance using two ring electrodes <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> Venturi throat and two ring electrodes <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> Venturi inlet. The basic operation of the electrical conductance technique in a multiphase flow is that the conductance of the mixture depends on the gas volume fraction in the water. An electronic circuit was built and calibrated to give a dc voltage output which is proportional to the conductance of the mixture which can then be related to the water film thickness in annular flow...|$|R

40|$|Separated flow in a Venturi meter {{is highly}} complex and the {{application}} of a homogenous flow model could not reasonably be expected to lead to highly accurate results. If this is the case, a gas volume fraction measurement technique at the throat must also be introduced instead of just relying on the gas volume fraction measurement at the inlet of the Venturi. This paper presents an advanced Conductance Multiphase Venturi Meter (CMVM) which is capable of measuring the gas volume fractions at the inlet and the throat of the Venturi. A new model was investigated to measure the gas flow rate. This model is based on the measurement of the gas volume fractions at the inlet and the throat of the Venturi meter using a conductance technique rather than relying on the prior knowledge of the mass flow quality x. We measure conductance using two ring electrodes <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> Venturi throat and two ring electrodes <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> Venturi inlet. The basic operation of the electrical conductance technique in a multiphase flow is that the conductance of the mixture depends on the gas volume fraction in the water. An electronic circuit was built and calibrated to give a dc voltage output which is proportional to the conductance of the mixture which can then be related to the water film thickness in annular flow (and hence to the gas volume fraction). It was inferred from the experimental results that the error of the measured gas flow rates was within ± 1. 9...|$|R
