5|$|Major-General Hunter's flying column set {{out from}} Kassinger, a small town {{a few miles north}} of Merowe, at five-thirty the evening of July 29, marching only at night so as to avoid both the heat of the sun and the eyes of any Mahdist lookouts. There was no road or path to follow, and the terrain upon which Hunter's flying column marched was nearly nontraversable; the route alternated between broken, rocky ground and ankle-high sand, {{ultimately}} proving extremely difficult to navigate in the <b>dark</b> <b>of</b> <b>night.</b> Added to these difficulties was the measure of speed imposed upon the column, as the mounted Major-General Hunter and Lieutenant MacDonald drove their units to their breaking points in order to preempt Mahdist reinforcements. The column advanced until midnight, completing a march of over sixteen miles. Sleeping during the day was made impossible by the sweltering heat; only when adequate shade was found in the barren desert could the exhausted men of Hunter's flying column rest.|$|E

Jim remembers Mr. Tur Tur and his ability to appear as a giant when seen from afar, and Jim and Luke decide to invite him to Morrowland to use his unique ability as a living lighthouse.|$|E

25|$|In June 1944, he {{returned}} to the Pacific theater. That September, he landed with the Marine force on Peleliu as Regimental Executive Officer, 5th Marines. On {{the first day of the}} battle, he was again ordered to take command of 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines after the battalion's commanding officer and executive officer became casualties. After nightfall on the first day of the battle, three of the battalion's companies had failed to make contact with the command post and their exact whereabouts were unknown. At great risk to himself, Lieutenant Colonel Walt ventured out into enemy-infested territory in the <b>dark</b> <b>of</b> <b>night,</b> accompanied by one Marine, and proceeded to locate the missing companies and direct them to their correct position along the divisional line. For these actions, Lieutenant Colonel Walt was awarded his second Navy Cross for gallantry in action.|$|E
500|$|Burnham's wife of 55 years, Blanche (February 25, 1862 – December 22, 1939) of Nevada, Iowa, {{accompanied}} him in very primitive conditions through many travels {{in both the}} Southwest United States and southern Africa. Together they had three children, all of whom spent their early youth in Africa. In the early years, she watched over {{the children and the}} pack animals, and she always kept a rifle nearby. In the <b>dark</b> <b>of</b> <b>night,</b> she used her rifle many times against lions and hyena and, during the Siege of Bulawayo, against Matabele warriors. Several members of the Blick family joined the Burnhams in Rhodesia, moved with them to England, and returned to the United States with the Burnhams to live near Three Rivers, California. When Burnham Exploration Company struck it rich in 1923, the Burnhams moved to a mansion built by Pasadena architect Joseph Blick, his brother-in-law, in a new housing development then known as Hollywoodland (a name later shortened to [...] "Hollywood") and took many trips around the world in high style. In 1939, Blanche suffered a stroke. She died a month later and was buried in the Three Rivers Cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a special}} mass at St Peters {{for the victims}} of the war, held in November 1940, soon after the {{commencement}} of the London Blitz bombing by the Luftwaffe, Pius preached in his homily: [...] "may the whirlwinds, that in the light of day or the <b>dark</b> <b>of</b> <b>night,</b> scatter terror, fire, destruction, and slaughter on helpless folk cease.

[...] Later he appealed to the Allies to spare Rome from aerial bombing, and visited wounded victims of the Allied bombing of 19 July 1943.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{memories}} begin, Jacob is a 23-year-old Polish American preparing for his final exams as a Cornell University veterinary student when he receives the devastating news {{that his parents}} {{died in a car}} accident. Jacob’s father was a veterinarian and Jacob had planned to join his practice. When Jacob learns that his parents {{have been killed in the}} car crash and their home has been mortgaged to pay for his tuition and is not to become his, he has a breakdown and leaves his Ivy League school just short of graduation. In the <b>dark</b> <b>of</b> <b>night,</b> he jumps on a train, a circus train belonging to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. On the train he is befriended by Camel, an old man and circus veteran, who persuades his companions not to throw Jacob off the train and takes him under his wing, finding him odd menial jobs. When the owner of the circus, Uncle Al, learns of his training as a vet, he is hired to care for the circus animals. This leads Jacob to share quarters with a dwarf named Walter (who is known as Kinko to the circus) and his dog Queenie. A few weeks later Jacob is summoned to take a look at Camel, who, after drinking [...] "Jake" [...] (adulterated Jamaican ginger extract) for many years, can't move his arms or legs. Fearing Camel will be [...] "red-lighted" [...] (thrown off a moving train as punishment or as severance from the circus to avoid paying wages), Jacob hides him in his room.|$|E

60|$|Through {{long hours}} in the <b>dark</b> <b>of</b> <b>night,</b> when Lane's pain kept him sleepless, he had pondered over the mystery of Mel Iden until it cleared. She typified {{the mother of the}} race. In all periods of the {{progress}} of the race, war had brought out this instinct in women--to give themselves for the future. It was a provision of nature, inscrutable and terrible. How immeasurable the distance between Mel Iden and those women who practised birth control! As the war had brought out hideous greed and baseness, so had it propelled forward and upward the noblest attributes of life. Mel Iden was a builder, not a destroyer. She had been sexless and selfless. Unconsciously during the fever and emotion of the training of American men for service abroad, and the poignancy of their departure, to fight, and perhaps never return, Mel Iden had answered to this mysterious instinct of nature. Then, with the emotion past, and face to face with staggering consequences, she had reacted to conscious instincts. She had proved the purity of her surrender. She was all mother. And Lane began to see her moving in a crystal, beautiful light.|$|E
