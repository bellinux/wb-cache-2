25|$|One type of non-homologous based {{mechanism}} is the non-homologous end joining or micro-homology end joining mechanism. These mechanisms are {{also involved in}} repairing double stranded breaks but require no homology or limited micro-homology. When these strands are repaired, oftentimes there are small deletions or insertions added into the repaired strand. It is possible that retrotransposons are inserted into the genome through this repair system. If retrotransposons are inserted into a non-allelic position on the chromosome, meiotic recombination can drive the insertion to be recombined into the same strand as an already existing copy of the same region. Another {{mechanism is}} the break-fusion-bridge cycle which involves sister chromatids that have both lost its telomeric region due to double stranded breaks. It is proposed that these sister chromatids will fuse together to form one <b>dicentric</b> <b>chromosome,</b> and then segregate into two different nuclei. Because pulling the <b>dicentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> apart causes a double stranded break, the end regions can fuse to other double stranded breaks and repeat the cycle. The fusion of two sister chromatids can cause inverted duplication and when these events are repeated throughout the cycle, the inverted region will be repeated leading {{to an increase in}} copy number. The last mechanism that can lead to copy number variations is polymerase slippage, which is also known as template switching. During normal DNA replication, the polymerase on the lagging strand is required to unclamp and re-clamp the replication region continuously. When small scale repeats in the DNA sequence exist already, the polymerase can be ‘confused’ when it re-clamps to continue replication and instead of clamping to the correct base pairs, it may shift a few base pairs and replicate a portion of the repeated region again. Note that although this has been experimentally observed and is a widely accepted mechanism, the molecular interactions that led to this error remains unknown. In addition, because this type of mechanism requires the polymerase to jump around the DNA strand and {{it is unlikely that the}} polymerase can re-clamp at another locus some kilobases apart, therefore this is more applicable to short repeats such as bi-nucleotide or tri-nucleotide repeats.|$|E

The formation of a neocentromere must be coupled with the inactivation of the previous centromere, since chromosomes with two functional centromeres (<b>Dicentric</b> <b>chromosome)</b> will result in chromosome breakage during mitosis. In some unusual cases human neocentromeres have been observed to form spontaneously on fragmented chromosomes.

However, errors during this process may cause one daughter cell to receive two short arms of chromosome 9, while the other cell receives two long arms. The identical arms are subsequently connected via a centromere. In most cases, isochromosomes of 9p contain two centromeres, called a <b>dicentric</b> <b>chromosome.</b>|$|E

The formation of dicentric chromosomes has been attributed to genetic processes, such as Robertsonian translocation and paracentric inversion. Dicentric chromosomes have important roles in the mitotic stability of chromosomes and the formation of pseudodicentric chromosomes. Their existence has been linked to certain natural phenomena such as irradiation and have been documented to underlie certain clinical syndromes, notably Kabuki syndrome. The formation of dicentric chromosomes and their implications on centromere function are studied in certain clinical cytogenetics laboratories.|$|E

The two centromeres of <b>dicentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are represented by the two dips in the trimodal fluorescence profile. A trimodal profile can, however, also be generated by aggregates of chromosomes. We tested the effectiveness of slit-scan profile criteria that were applied to discriminate between trimodal profiles generated by dicentrics and trimodal profiles generated by artefacts. A Profile-Dip Counter (PDC) module was designed that can assess, in real time, the number of dips in slit-scan profiles. The PDC module was used in combination with a Cytofluorograph System 50 cell sorter for slit-scan sorting of chromosomes prepared from irradiated V 79 cells. Chromosomes corresponding to trimodal profiles were sorted individually onto slides for subsequent visual inspection by fluorescence microscopy. The isolated chromosomes were stretched by treatment with trypsin {{to increase the efficiency}} for centromere detection. When fixed with glutaraldehyde, chromosomes could be sorted intact on slides. We found that trimodal profiles are generated by <b>dicentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> as well as by monocentric and aggregated chromosomes.
