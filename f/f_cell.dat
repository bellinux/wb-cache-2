40|$|Individual {{variation}} in fetal hemoglobin (HbF, alpha(2) gamma(2)) response underlies the remarkable diversity in phenotypic severity of {{sickle cell disease}} and beta thalassemia. HbF levels and HbF-associated quantitative traits (e. g., <b>F</b> <b>cell</b> levels) are highly heritable. We have previously mapped a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling <b>F</b> <b>cell</b> levels in an extended Asian-Indian kindred with beta thalassemia to a 1. 5 -Mb interval on chromosome 6 q 23, but the causative gene(s) are not known. The QTL encompasses several genes including HBS 1 L, {{a member of the}} GTP-binding protein family that is expressed in erythroid progenitor cells. In this high-resolution association study, we have identified multiple genetic variants within and 5 ' to HBS 1 L at 6 q 23 that are strongly associated with <b>F</b> <b>cell</b> levels in families of Northern European ancestry (P = 10 (- 75)). The region accounts for 17. 6 % of the <b>F</b> <b>cell</b> variance in northern Europeans. Although mRNA levels of HBS 1 L and MYB in erythroid precursors grown in vitro are positively correlated, only HBS 1 L expression correlates with high <b>F</b> <b>cell</b> alleles. The results support a key role for the HBS 1 L-related genetic variants in HbF control and illustrate the biological complexity of the mechanism of 6 q QTL as a modifier of fetal hemoglobin levels in the beta hemoglobinopathies...|$|E

40|$|Background: Fibroblast {{activation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important mechanisms for Angiotensin II (Ang II) in promoting renal fibrosis. Transcription factor Ets- 1 is recognized to play a key role in kidney diseases. However, the role and mechanisms of Ets- 1 in Ang-II induced fibroblast activation and kidney fibrosis are not fully understood. Methods: Mice were treated with Ang II via osmotic mini-pumps or Ang II expression plasmid (pAng II). Cultured normal rat kidney interstitial fibroblast (NRK- 49 <b>F)</b> <b>cells</b> were incubated with Ang II. Role of Ets- 1 in renal fibrosis and fibroblast activation were assessed by Western blot, Immunohistochemical staining‚MTT, Boyden chamber and Immunofluorescence staining. Effects of miR- 221 on Ets- 1 and fibroblast activation were investigated by MTT, Boyden chamber, Western blot and Q-PCR. Results: We found that Ets- 1 was up-regulated in fibrotic kidneys. Similarly, Ang II could activate NRK- 49 <b>F</b> <b>cells</b> as demonstrated by up-regulated α-SMA and fibronectin(FN) expression and enhanced cell proliferation and migration. Ang II also induced Ets- 1 expression in NRK- 49 <b>F</b> <b>cells</b> in a dose and time dependent manner. Knock-down of Ets- 1 by RNA interference attenuated Ang II-induced activation of NRK- 49 <b>F</b> <b>cells.</b> Ets- 1 was previously reported as a target of microRNA- 221 (miR- 221). In Ang II-induced fibrotic kidney, miR- 221 was down-regulated. Similar results were observed in Ang II treated NRK- 49 <b>F</b> <b>cells.</b> Ectopic expression of miR- 221 mimic attenuated the up-regulation of Ets- 1 by Ang II in NRK- 49 <b>F</b> <b>cells,</b> which further prevented the activation of NRK- 49 <b>F</b> <b>cells.</b> However, the inhibitor of miR- 221 aggravated Ang II induced Ets- 1 expression and NRK- 49 <b>F</b> <b>cells</b> activation.

40|$|Background: Measurements of {{relative}} blood volume changes (ARBV) during hemodialysis (HD) {{are based on}} hemoconcentration and assume uniform mixing of erythrocytes and plasma throughout the circulation. However, whole-body hematocrit (Ht) is lower than systemic Ht. During HD, {{a change in the}} ratio between whole-body to systemic Ht (<b>F</b> <b>cell</b> ratio) is likely to occur {{as a result of a}} net shift of low Ht blood from the microcirculation to the macrocirculation. Hence, Delta RBV may differ significantly from total blood volume changes (Delta TBV). Therefore, this study compared Delta RBV and Delta TBV during HD. Design, setting, participants, and measurements: Plasma and erythrocyte volumes were measured using I- 125 - and I- 123 -radioiodinated albumin and Cr- 51 -labeled erythrocytes, respectively. After validation of the standardized method in two patients on a nondialysis day, seven patients completed the protocol during HD. I- 125 -albumin and Cr- 51 -labeled erythrocytes were administered 20 min before the start of HD. I- 123 -albumin was administered at 160 min into the HD session to quantify and correct for I- 125 -albumin leakage. ARBV was measured continuously throughout HD. The <b>F</b> <b>cell</b> ratio was derived from whole-body and systemic Ht. Results: Total ultrafiltration volume was 2450 +/- 770 ml. TBV declined from 5905 +/- 824 to 4877 +/- 722 ml during HD. Thus, TBV declined 17. 3 +/- 4. 4 %, whereas the RBV decline was only 8. 2 +/- 3. 7 % (P = 0. 001). The <b>F</b> <b>cell</b> ratio increased from 0. 896 +/- 0. 036 to 0. 993 +/- 0. 049 during HD (P = 0. 002). Conclusions: ARBV significantly underestimates ATBV during HD. The rise in <b>F</b> <b>cell</b> ratio strongly suggests that during HD, blood translocates from the microcirculation to the macrocirculation, probably as a cardiovascular compensatory mechanism in response to hypovolemia...|$|E

40|$|Sodium {{fluoride}} causes apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells {{and this}} response {{is enhanced by}} pre-treatment with pertussis toxin. In the present study, tyrosine kinase inhibitors were used to investigate the mechanisms of action of NaF and pertussis toxin in the β-cell line, RINm 5 F. Exposure of RINm 5 F cells to low concentrations of genistein or tyrphostin A 25 resulted in significant inhibition of cell death induced by 5 [*]mM NaF. Higher concentrations (> 25 [*]μM) were cytotoxic {{in the absence of}} NaF but, paradoxically, the combination of genistein and NaF induced less cell death than when each agent was used alone. The increase in cell death induced by 100 [*]μM genistein was markedly inhibited by ciprofloxacin, a drug which binds to topoisomerase II. Etoposide (which inhibits topoisomerase II but has no effect on tyrosine kinase activity) also caused an increase in RINm 5 <b>F</b> <b>cell</b> death. Neither etoposide nor ciprofloxacin altered the response to 5 [*]mM NaF. Pertussis toxin markedly enhanced the extent of RINm 5 <b>F</b> <b>cell</b> death induced by NaF and this effect was completely prevented by 25 [*]μM genistein. The inhibition caused by genistein was not affected by ciprofloxacin but was reproduced by a structurally dissimilar tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A. The results demonstrate that RINm 5 F β-cells express a pertussis toxin sensitive pathway that is anti-apoptotic. The activity of this pathway is most evident in cells exposed to pro-apoptotic stimuli where the effects of pertussis toxin can be blocked by inhibitors of tyrosine kinase enzymes.

40|$|Cytokines, such as IL- 1 beta and TNF-alpha, {{contribute}} to pancreatic beta-cell death in {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus. The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) mediates cytokine-induced beta-cell apoptosis. Paradoxically, NF-kappaB has mostly antiapoptotic effects in other cell types. The cellular actions of NF-kappaB depend on the cell type, the nature and duration of the stimulus, the periodicity, {{and the degree of}} activity of the particular dimers involved. To clarify the reasons behind the proapoptotic effects of NF-kappaB in pancreatic beta-cells, we compared the pattern of cytokine-induced NF-kappaB activation between rat insulin-producing cells (INS- 1 E cells) and fibroblasts (208 <b>F</b> <b>cells).</b> NF-kappaB activation was induced in INS- 1 E cells and in 208 <b>F</b> <b>cells</b> after exposure to cytokines, but apoptosis was induced only in INS- 1 E cells, with a more pronounced proapoptotic effect of IL- 1 beta than of TNF-alpha. NF-kappaB activation in IL- 1 beta-exposed INS- 1 E cells was earlier and more marked as compared with TNF-alpha-exposed INS- 1 E cells or IL- 1 beta-exposed 208 <b>F</b> <b>cells.</b> Both cytokines induced a prolonged (up to 48 h) and stable NF-kappaB activation in INS- 1 E cells, whereas IL- 1 beta induced an oscillatory NF-kappaB activation in 208 <b>F</b> <b>cells.</b> p 65 /p 65 and p 65 /p 50 were the predominant NF-kappaB dimers in IL- 1 beta-exposed INS- 1 E <b>cells</b> and 208 <b>F</b> <b>cells,</b> respectively. IL- 1 beta induced a differential usage of cis-elements in the inducible nitric oxide synthase promoter region in the two cell-lines and an increase in ERK 1 / 2 activity in INS- 1 E cells but not in 208 <b>F</b> <b>cells.</b> Cytokine-induced expression of IkappaB isoforms and other NF-kappaB target genes (Fas, MCP- 1, and inducible nitric oxide synthase) was severalfold higher in INS- 1 E cells than in 208 <b>F</b> <b>cells.</b> These results suggest that cytokine-induced NF-kappaB activation in insulin-producing cells is more rapid, marked, and sustained than in fibroblasts, which correlates with a more pronounced activation of downstream genes and a proapoptotic outcome.

40|$|Background/Aims: In {{order to}} further {{characterize}} the biological traits of Dp 71, HBE over expressing two most abundantly expressed Dp 71 spliced isoforms, Dp 71 d and Dp 71 f, were established and their biological traits were explored. Methods: The proliferation, migration and invasion capabilities of HBE-Dp 71 d and HBE-Dp 71 <b>f</b> <b>cells</b> {{were evaluated by}} MTT, colony formation, transwell and scratch assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis induced by H 2 O 2 were measured by flow cytometer. Co-IP was performed to prove the interaction between lamin B 1, FAK and Dp 71. Western blot was performed to detect lamin B 1, FAK, ERK and Cyclin D expression in HBE-Dp 71 d and HBE-Dp 71 <b>f</b> <b>cells.</b> Results: HBE-Dp 71 d and HBE-Dp 71 <b>f</b> <b>cells</b> proliferated faster than their mock and blank controls; shortened their G 0 /G 1 phase; enhanced their invasion and migration capabilities; reduced their apoptosis induced by H 2 O 2. Co-IP proved Dp 71 directly interacting with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and lamin B 1 in HBE cells. Increased lamin B 1, FAK mRNA and protein expression, over activation of integrin/focal adhesion kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) /cyclin D pathway were observed in HBE-Dp 71 d and HBE-Dp 71 <b>f</b> <b>cells.</b> Conclusions: Via increasing FAK in the cytoplasmic FAK-Dp 71, lamin B 1 of nucleus laminB 1 -Dp 71 complex, HBE-Dp 71 d and HBE-Dp 71 <b>f</b> <b>cells</b> alter their proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle and apoptosis rate induced by H 2 O 2...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Induced {{pluripotent}} stem (iPS) cells efficiently {{generated from}} accessible tissues {{have the potential}} for clinical applications. Oral gingiva, which is often resected during general dental treatments and treated as biomedical waste, is an easily obtainable tissue, and cells can be isolated from patients with minimal discomfort. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We herein demonstrate iPS cell generation from adult wild-type mouse gingival fibroblasts (GFs) via introduction of four factors (Oct 3 / 4, Sox 2, Klf 4 and c-Myc; GF-iPS- 4 <b>F</b> <b>cells)</b> or three factors (the same as GF-iPS- 4 <b>F</b> <b>cells,</b> but without the c-Myc oncogene; GF-iPS- 3 <b>F</b> <b>cells)</b> without drug selection. iPS cells were also generated from primary human gingival fibroblasts via four-factor transduction. These cells exhibited the morphology and growth properties of embryonic stem (ES) cells and expressed ES cell marker genes, with a decreased CpG methylation ratio in promoter regions of Nanog and Oct 3 / 4. Additionally, teratoma formation assays showed ES cell-like derivation of cells and tissues representative of all three germ layers. In comparison to mouse GF-iPS- 4 <b>F</b> <b>cells,</b> GF-iPS- 3 <b>F</b> <b>cells</b> showed consistently more ES cell-like characteristics in terms of DNA methylation status and gene expression, although the reprogramming process was substantially delayed and the overall efficiency was also reduced. When transplanted into blastocysts, GF-iPS- 3 <b>F</b> <b>cells</b> gave rise to chimeras and contributed {{to the development of the}} germline. Notably, the four-factor reprogramming efficiency of mouse GFs was more than 7 -fold higher than that of fibroblasts from tail-tips, possibly because of their high proliferative capacity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that GFs from the easily obtainable gingival tissues can be readily reprogrammed into iPS cells, thus making them a promising cell source for investigating the basis of cellular reprogramming and pluripotency for future clinical applications. In addition, high-quality iPS cells were generated from mouse GFs without Myc transduction or a specific system for reprogrammed cell selection...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNoradrenaline {{effects on}} voltage-operated calcium {{channels}} and exocytosis were studied, {{for the first}} time, in single patch-clamped RINm 5 F insulin-secreting cells. Noradrenaline, despite small and variable inhibition of calcium currents, strongly inhibited the increase in membrane capacitance (a measure of exocytosis) stimulated by both step depolarizations and the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. Noradrenaline similarly inhibited KCl- and ionomycin-induced [3 H]serotonin release from RINm 5 <b>F</b> <b>cell</b> populations. Noradrenaline effects were mediated by PTX-sensitive G proteins. Noradrenaline inhibitory effects on secretion are, therefore, mainly exerted downstream from Ca 2 + influx...|$|E

This study evaluated the in vivo hypoglycemic {{properties of the}} water extract of G. procumbens following 14 days of treatment and in vitro in RIN- 5 F cells. Glucose absorption from the intestines and its glucose uptake in abdominal skeletal muscle were assessed. The antidiabetic effect of water extract of G. procumbens leaves was investigated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed in diabetic rats treated with G. procumbens water extract for 14 days. In the IPGTT, blood was collected for insulin and blood glucose measurement. After the IPGTT, the pancreases were collected for immunohistochemical study of β-cells of the islets of Langerhans. The possible antidiabetic mechanisms of G. procumbens were assessed through in vitro RIN- 5 <b>F</b> <b>cell</b> study, intestinal glucose absorption and glucose uptake by muscle. The results showed that G. procumbens significantly decreased blood glucose levels after 14 days of treatment and improved outcome of the IPGTT. However, G. procumbens did not show {{a significant effect on}} insulin level either in the in vivo test or the in vitro RIN- 5 <b>F</b> <b>cell</b> culture study. G. procumbens also showed minimal effects on β-cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. However, G. procumbens only significantly increased glucose uptake by muscle tissues. From the findings we can conclude that G. procumbens water extract exerted its hypoglycemic effect by promoting glucose uptake by muscles...|$|E
