5|$|The M9 {{used the}} same chassis and {{mechanical}} components as the M5. It was laid out to provide similar stowage, access to the radios from the inside, rear doors, and a pedestal machine <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> as with the M2. The M9A1 variant of the M9 matched the improvements made to the M2, M3, and M5, changing to ring mount machine <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> and three pintle machine gun mounts.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} contained {{two major}} bulkheads, with the cockpit {{at the front}} of the first bulkhead. The nose was fitted with a rotating machine <b>gun</b> <b>mount,</b> offset to allow the pilot a better field of forward vision. The cockpit was fully glazed, with the exception of the lower right section, which acted as a platform for the bombardier-gunner. The commonly-used Lotfernrohr-series bombsight penetrated through the cockpit floor into a protective housing on the external side of the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the H-11 and H-16 the H-20, equipped with two Jumo 211F-2s, had more powerful armament and radio communications. The defensive armament consisted of one MG 131 in an A-Stand gun pod for the forward mounted machine gun position. One rotatable Drehlafette DL 131/1C (or E) <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> in the B-stand was standard and later MG 131 machine guns were added. Navigational direction-finding gear was also installed. The Peil G6 was added to locate targets and the FuBI 2H blind landing equipment was built in to help with night operations. The radio was a standard FuG 10, TZG 10 and FuG 16Z for navigating to the target. The H-20 also was equipped with barrage balloon cable-cutters. The bomb load of the H-20 could be mounted on external ETC 1000 racks, or four ESAC 250 racks. The sub variant H-20/R4 could carry 20 50kg (110lb) bombs as external loads.|$|E
25|$|Model 340-14 {{production}} for United Kingdom. Powered <b>gun</b> <b>mounting</b> replaced by flexible <b>gun</b> <b>mounting.</b> Only 468 of 750 ordered were delivered.|$|R
5000|$|The vehicle has a {{front-mounted}} machine <b>gun,</b> <b>mounted</b> {{within a}} <b>gun</b> shield {{that can be}} swiveled. A mounting slot on both sides exist for a [...]50 cal machine <b>gun</b> to be <b>mounted.</b> Some examples have a gun shield, with a machine <b>gun</b> <b>mounted</b> in the back as well; {{this meant that the}} vehicle could have machine <b>guns</b> <b>mounted</b> and facing all four sides.|$|R
5000|$|... {{protected}} cruiser of 3,200 tons. Single 8-inch <b>guns</b> <b>mounted</b> in barbettes {{fore and}} aft with 6-inch axial firing <b>guns</b> <b>mounted</b> beside each. Four additional 6-inch guns. Top speed 13 knots.|$|R
5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E
5|$|Because of Saratogas age and {{the number}} of modern {{carriers}} in service, the Navy decided to modify her into a training carrier. The aft elevator and its machinery were removed, the opening was plated over and the forward elevator was replaced with a larger model. Part of the hangar deck was converted into classrooms. While the ship was still under repair Captain Frank Akers assumed command on 27 April. The post-refit machinery trials on 12 May revealed some problems with one turbine, and an explosion in one 5-inch gun wounded eleven men and wrecked the mount. The full-power trials were completed on 20 May and a new mount was loaded aboard to be installed at Pearl. The ship sailed for NAS Alameda a few days later where she picked up 60 aircraft, 1,200 passengers and some trucks for delivery in Pearl. Saratoga arrived on 1 June and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Ralph F. Jennings, commander of Carrier Division 11. She resumed carrier qualification training on 3 June until she returned to the dockyard on 10 June for the installation of her replacement five-inch <b>gun</b> <b>mount.</b> Jennings transferred his flag to another carrier from 11 to 30 June. She continued training carrier pilots after the Japanese surrender until 6 September. Over the span of the ship's 17-year career, Saratogas aviators landed on her deck 98,549 times, then the record for the most carrier landings. Saratoga received eight battle stars for her World War II service. After the war, the ship took part in Operation Magic Carpet, the repatriation of American servicemen from the European, Pacific, and Asian theaters. She left Hawaii on 9 September with 3,712 Navy officers and enlisted men bound for the United States. In the course of the operation, she returned 29,204 veterans, the highest total for any individual vessel.|$|E
25|$|An {{anti-aircraft}} <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> {{is located}} above the main magazine, and comprises a vertically mounted length of steel pipe with flanges at each end. This {{is thought to}} be the only anti- aircraft <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> remaining at a Second World War coastal battery in Queensland.|$|E

5|$|The 5-inch/38 gun {{would remain}} on the battleships for the ships' entire service life; however, {{the total number of}} <b>guns</b> and <b>gun</b> <b>mounts</b> was reduced from 20 <b>guns</b> in ten <b>mounts</b> to 12 <b>guns</b> in six <b>mounts</b> during the 1980s' {{modernization}} of the four Iowas. The removal of four of the <b>gun</b> <b>mounts</b> was required for the battleships to be outfitted with the armored box launchers needed to carry and fire Tomahawk missiles. At the time of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, these guns had been largely relegated to littoral defense for the battleships. Since each battleship carried a small detachment of Marines aboard, the Marines would man one of the 5-inch <b>gun</b> <b>mounts.</b>|$|R

25|$|The most {{noticeable}} {{change for the}} Mackenzies was {{the replacement of the}} forward /50 calibre Mk 22 guns of the St. Laurent design with a dual Vickers 3-inch/70 calibre Mk 6 <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> and the presence of a fire-control director atop the bridge superstructure. The bridge was raised one full deck higher than on previous classes in order to see over the new <b>gun</b> <b>mount.</b> The class did retain the rear dual 3-inch/50 calibre <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> and for anti-submarine warfare, the class was provided with two Mk 10 Limbo mortars. The ships were initially fitted with Mark 43 torpedoes to supplement their anti-submarine capability, but were quickly upgraded to the Mark 44 launched from a modified depth charge thrower. This was to give the destroyers the ability to combat submarines from a distance.|$|E
25|$|M5A1 – M5 with a M49 machine <b>gun</b> <b>mount.</b> It {{could fit}} one 0.5 inch (12.7mm) M2 Browning heavy machine gun, and two 0.3 inch M1919 Browning machine guns, and 2,859 were produced.|$|E
25|$|M9 – Same as the M5, stowage {{arranged}} as the M2 Half-track, {{with access}} to radios from inside (as opposed to outside) and rear doors, plus pedestal machine <b>gun</b> <b>mount,</b> with 2,026 being produced.|$|E
500|$|Glory {{had four}} [...] 35-calibre <b>guns</b> <b>mounted</b> in twin <b>gun</b> turrets fore and aft; these <b>guns</b> were <b>mounted</b> in {{circular}} barbettes that allowed all-around loading, although {{at a fixed}} elevation. The ships also mounted twelve [...] 40-calibre <b>guns</b> <b>mounted</b> in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four [...] torpedo tubes submerged in the hull.|$|R
500|$|The seven [...] 35-calibre <b>guns</b> were <b>mounted</b> on {{broadside}} pivot mounts in hull embrasures, {{except for}} one <b>gun</b> <b>mounted</b> in the stern in the hull. The eight [...] single-barrelled Hotchkiss <b>guns</b> were <b>mounted</b> on the battery deck to defend the ship against torpedo boats. Ten [...] Hotchkiss <b>guns</b> were <b>mounted</b> in the fighting top. She carried seven above-water [...] torpedo tubes, three tubes on each broadside and a tube in the stern.|$|R
500|$|Ocean {{had four}} [...] 35-calibre <b>guns</b> <b>mounted</b> in twin <b>gun</b> turrets fore and aft; these <b>guns</b> were <b>mounted</b> in {{circular}} barbettes that allowed all-around loading, although {{at a fixed}} elevation.

25|$|T54/E1 – Tested in 1942, the <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> quickly {{proved to}} be {{unstable}} when fired, and the improved T54E1, which also added a circular armored shield and rear armor to the vehicle, could not fix the inherent problem. Prototype only.|$|E
25|$|The type 23 is uncommon; 87 are {{recorded}} as being extant. A further variant exists in Lincolnshire {{consisting of a}} double-chambered type 23 with an access door with anti-aircraft <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> and a chamber on either side, known as the Lincolnshire three bay.|$|E
25|$|Williamson, an antiaircraft gunner {{fired at}} an {{approaching}} torpedo plane, remaining at his station with cool determination {{as the enemy}} aircraft crashed directly at his <b>gun</b> <b>mount.</b> For his great courage {{in the face of}} this attack, Seaman First Class Williamson was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously.|$|E

25|$|During the Korean War, {{the limited}} {{elevation}} of the howitzer became noticeably problematic. 127 M7B1 were modified to permit an elevation of 65° to increase the effective range of the howitzer. The machine <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> also had to be raised to give a 360° firing arc.|$|E
25|$|The GAU-8/A {{utilizes}} recoil adapters. They are {{the interface}} between the gun housing and the <b>gun</b> <b>mount.</b> By absorbing (in compression) the recoil forces, they spread {{the time of the}} recoil impulse and counter recoil energy transmitted to the supporting structure when the gun is fired.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{started in}} September 1941 with {{a requirement for}} a close-support vehicle based upon the M3 Stuart's chassis, but {{it was made of}} a mild steel superstructure. A 75mm Pack Howitzer was mounted on the right of the glacis plate of the vehicle. The <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> was modeled from the M3 Lee's 75mm gun's mount.|$|E

500|$|The ship's {{main battery}} {{consisted}} of four 12-inch <b>guns</b> <b>mounted</b> in two twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The secondary armament consisted of four 10-inch <b>guns</b> <b>mounted</b> in four single-gun turrets positioned {{on each side}} of the superstructure. Katori also carried twelve QF 6-inch <b>guns,</b> <b>mounted</b> in casemates on the sides of the hull and in the superstructure. A number of smaller guns were carried for defence against torpedo boats. These included a dozen 12-pounder guns and three [...] 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns. She was also armed with five submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes, two on each broadside and one in the stern.|$|R
25|$|The light cruiser fitted out at Norfolk until 17 September {{when she}} began {{shakedown}} training in Chesapeake Bay. This included aircraft launch and recovery drills, structural test gun firing, day spotting practice and anti-aircraft drills. The crew also conducted an unplanned but successful man overboard drill when S2c Scott was knocked overboard by a training <b>gun</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|E
25|$|M3E2/M5 Half-track – International Harvester Half-Track, {{externally}} largely {{identical to}} the M3, but with , IHC RED-450-B engine, different drive train and fuel and electrical system. In fact, only the chassis, bogies, track, idler and drive sprockets, wheels, winches, transfer case, rollers, and machine <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> were interchangeable. The M5 is heavier than the M3, {{due in part to}} heavier armor. Its body was welded, rather than bolted. The M5 was primarily for Lend-Lease, to Britain, Canada, France, and the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|On 10 February, Biloxi joined TG 58.4 {{and sailed}} for {{operations}} against Iwo Jima. Following carrier-launched fighter sweeps against Japanese airfields in the Tokyo area, the task group closed Iwo Jima to support landing operations. During {{the morning of}} 19 February, Biloxi provided naval gunfire support for the troops ashore. She then shifted to harassing fire that evening. This pattern of operations continued until the 21st when 5inch mount #6 fired into the barrels of <b>gun</b> <b>mount</b> #5, slightly injuring several sailors and destroying the latter mount.|$|E
