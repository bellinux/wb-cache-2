Up till now, the natural, temporal variability of the macrobenthos was detected without any apparent effects from the foundations (Coates & Vincx, 2010; Reubens et al., 2009). In 2011, the soft-sediment macrobenthos in close vicinity to one <b>gravity</b> <b>based</b> <b>foundation</b> on the Thorntonbank was analysed. Bottom samples taken at 15, 25, 50, 100 and 200 meters from the scour protection system of the foundation and in four gradients around the turbine (Southwest, Southeast, Northwest and Northeast), showed a clear distinction in densities. The median grain size showed a declining trend at stations closer to the turbine. An accumulation of juvenile starfish (Asteriidae juv.) together with the polychaetes Spio sp. and Spiophanes bombyx was obvious at stations < 50 meters and mostly on the Southwest gradient. Lower current speeds and changing granulometric characteristics appear to be creating a substantial change in the macrobenthic community on the Southwest gradient. The soft sediment macrobenthic community around the foundation is highly dynamic and far from reaching an equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Offshore wind {{turbines}} have been installed in increasing water depths {{over the last}} years. Support structures with monopile or <b>gravity</b> <b>based</b> <b>foundation</b> could successfully be used for all realized offshore-projects, but the trend of increasing water depths reached a level that makes application of those relatively simple types of support structures inappropriate. New concepts like tripods or lattice types are developed covering {{all parts of the}} support structure. A number of sophisticated codes exists that can simulate offshore {{wind turbines}} in an integrated and/or superimposed manner, but most of them are currently limited to tubular towers with monopile or gravity based foundations. Therefore those codes are extended to meet the requirements of modelling more complex support structures such as tripods, jackets and even floating structures. This paper gives an overview on certain aspects related to offshore wind turbine modelling focusing on the support structure and the offshore environment. In this context the current status of a number of simulation codes is presented. Needs and current development related to support structure concepts, system and sub-system models will be discussed taking into account the requirements within the design process as well as limitations of some models. Furthermore, some recent and future verification activities are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Reinertsen has {{developed}} a new installation concept for the transportation and installation of a fully assembled <b>gravity</b> <b>based</b> <b>foundation</b> offshore wind turbine (GBS-OWT) {{by means of a}} support double barge (DB) and standard tug boats. A numerical model of this design is built, based on experimental decay tests and irregular wave tests conducted in the scale 1 : 30. The generated numerical model includes hydrodynamic coupling, stiff wire and contact couplings, viscous elements and mean drift forces. Due to the complexity of this model and its strong coupling effects, a very challenging numerical problem in the field of marine operations is considered. Mooring line dynamics and viscous damping of the numerical model are determined by evaluating experimental decay tests. Numerical decay tests and irregular wave tests are conducted and the model responses are compared with those recorded in the experiments. Good accordance with the experimental responses is seen in the numerical decay tests. Numerical pitch and roll responses in irregular waves show good agreement as well. In addition, the mooring responses are significantly improved when mooring line dynamics are accounted for. However, further investigation into the mooring responses and the friction damping of relative DB-GBS heave responses is required to improve the numerical model. </p...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{entitled}} "Modelling of cyclic degradation - Development of a cyclic accumulation {{model and}} the application to a gravity based foundation" presents a new soil model to analyse the behaviour of undrained soils subjected to cyclic loading. Cyclic loading on offshore support structures for wind-turbines results in complex design challenges, and current codes and standards offer limited guidance on the assessment of undrained cyclic soil behaviour. To assess the undrained cyclic behaviour, a new procedure is being developed within the finite element software Plaxis, the UDCAM-S procedure. This new procedure is designed to asses the undrained cyclic behaviour of clays {{in the design of}} offshore support structures. This study focuses on the development of this procedure and the application to a <b>gravity</b> <b>based</b> <b>foundation</b> for a large wind-turbine placed on clay. Large cyclic wind and water loads acting on the turbine are transferred through the structure to the foundation, resulting in cyclic shear stresses in the clay. These shear stresses lead to an increase in pore pressure due to the restriction of pore pressure dissipation, and thereby a decrease in effective stress. With each cycle, shear strains are developed due to the decrease in effective stress: the average, cyclic and permanent shear strains. Permanent shear strains accumulate {{as a result of a}}ccumulated pore pressures due to cyclic shearing of the soil, the irreversible deformations of the soil. With the accumulation of pore pressures and plastic shear strains the soil degrades in terms of the undrained shear strength and the stiffness of the soil. The degradation of the soil as a result of a design storm is determined with the UDCAM-S procedure. The design storm is simplified by analysing the cyclic loads in terms of load parcels, to use the load data in the strain accumulation procedure (Andersen, 1976). With the result of the strain accumulation procedure, the degraded behaviour of the soil can be determined by means of scaled contour diagrams for the behaviour in direct simple shear, triaxial compression, and triaxial extension. Parameters of the NGI-ADP soil model in Plaxis are fitted onto the degraded stress-strain curves, resulting in a parameter set accounting for the degradation of the soil by the given design storm. The results of the UDCAM-S procedure have been used to model the influence of cyclic degradation on the stability of gravity based foundations. The investigated cases gave insight in the influence of the different steps in the UDCAM-S procedure on the outcome of a finite element analysis. It has been found that VHM capacity of gravity based foundations can be reduced significantly by large equivalent number of cycles for a design storm. As the soil strength decreases with increasing equivalent number of cycles, the maximum moment resistance is mobilized at lower vertical loads. This results in a large reduction of the HM capacity at higher vertical loads. The same effect has been found on the stability of the foundation for different widths of the foundation. The equivalent number of cycles is the dominant factor influencing the stability of the foundation. This is due to the accumulation of large strains due to a design storm, resulting in a softer clay.

40|$|In recent years, the {{international}} demand to produce green energy {{has been growing}} to address the issues of energy security and climate change. To date, the wind sector has probably advanced the most due to high availability of wind resources. Erecting wind turbines offshore, however, presents significant new engineering challenges. Offshore foundations for these energy converters {{must be able to}} resist large overturning moments as well as numerous cycles of lateral loading caused by wave and wind. Thus, the need for an efficient cost-effective foundation to support the turbines is becoming more important. In this paper, a specific design of a <b>gravity</b> <b>base</b> <b>foundation</b> system developed for offshore wind turbines is considered. The foundation is a conical hollow concrete gravity type structure which rests on the seabed and utilises its self-weight to support the turbine.

A numerical tool was developed that is able to calculate the hydrodynamic loads on multiple configurations of this foundation. This tool uses Stokes 5 th order wave theory and Morison’s equation. It was extended with analytical geotechnical stability calculations, to compare the stability of different foundations. Furthermore, a literature study was conducted {{to determine whether or not}} scour protection should be applied at the foundation concepts. It was concluded that no accurate scour depth could be predicted with the currently available methods. Therefore a computational fluid dynamics model, FinLab, was employed to determine the relative scour potential at the foundation.

40|$|Skirted <b>gravity</b> <b>base</b> <b>{{foundations}}</b> and suction caisson foundations {{are considered}} as viable alternatives to monopile foundations for offshore wind turbines. While recent work {{has focused on}} the monotonic moment-rotation response for shallow foundations, the cyclic response and the accumulation of rotation {{over the life of the}} turbine must also be addressed. This paper presents cyclic loading tests where approximately 10, 000 cycles, with different loading characteristics, were applied to a model shallow foundation (a caisson) in loose sand. On the basis of these tests, a framework for assessing the accumulated angular rotation because of cycling was developed. The settlement and cyclic stiffness response of the caisson were also assessed. It was found, not unexpectedly, that the accumulated settlement of the caisson increased with the number of cycles and cyclic amplitude. It was also found that a cyclic loading regime intermediate between one-way and full two-way cycling produced the largest rotations. The cyclic stiffness was relatively unaffected by the number of cycles. Using an appropriate scaling technique, the proposed framework was used to predict the long-term accumulated angular rotation, for an example, the field-scale monocaisson structure. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|R
40|$|Large {{capacity}} {{wind turbines}} require sizeable foundations. Onshore turbines are commonly supported by massive spread foundations involving hundreds of cubic metres {{of concrete and}} tonnes of steel reinforcement. Concrete <b>gravity</b> <b>base</b> <b>foundations</b> for offshore wind turbines also employ significant quantities of concrete and reinforcement. The CO 2 emissions associated with concrete foundations has been analysed to examine means of reducing the materials-related impact on the carbon footprint of wind power. The effects of strength class, cement content, partial replacement of cement and use of recycled concrete aggregate were investigated. It was determined that use of 32 MPa class concrete rather than 40 MPa can reduce the concrete generated emissions by at least 11 %. The greatest decrease in emissions for the studied mixes was found for concrete with 65 % replacement of cement with blast furnace slag and the reductions were 42. 7 - 44. 8 %, depending on strength class. The use of recycled concrete aggregate resulted in moderate reductions in emissions and would have other environmental benefits. The study has shown that selection of concrete constituents and appropriate mix design {{can be used to}} minimise CO 2 emissions associated with large wind turbine foundations without compromising strength and performance requirements...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{experimental work}} and numerical analysis {{that has been}} undertaken to assess the bearing capacity of perforated offshore foundations. Perforated foundations {{may be used to}} support subsea infrastructure, including as mudmats into which a number of perforations have been made, or as grillages which consist of a series of structurally connected strip footings. Larger <b>gravity</b> <b>base</b> <b>foundations,</b> such as for offshore wind turbines or oil and gas platforms, may adopt a single central perforation. The advantages of using perforated foundations can include reduced material requirements and easier offshore handling as a result of smaller weight and lower hydrodynamic forces during deployment. Limited guidance currently exists for assessing the bearing capacity of these foundation types. Bearing capacity of perforated foundations has been examined in this thesis under conditions of combined vertical, horizontal and moment loading which is typical in offshore settings. Undrained soil conditions have been considered, except for the case of grillages in which drained conditions are often most relevant. Experimental work has included centrifuge testing of ring and square annular foundations on clay, and 1 g testing of grillage foundations on sand. Finite element modelling has also been undertaken to assess perforated foundation capacity. A Tresca material subroutine (UMAT) and an adaptive meshing scheme have been developed to improve the accuracy of the finite element analysis carried out. The results showed that perforated foundations can be an efficient foundation solution for accommodating combined loading. As a ratio of their vertical load capacity, perforated foundations may be able to withstand higher moment and horizontal loads compared with unperforated foundations. The experimental and numerical results have been used to develop design expressions that could be employed by practitioners to estimate the vertical and combined load bearing capacity of these foundation types.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to develop a innovative <b>Gravity</b> <b>Base</b> <b>Foundation</b> (GBF) concepts, including fabrication yards, launching systems and installation equipment, for a 500 MW utility scale project in the Great Lakes (Lake Erie). The goal was to lower the LCOE by 25 %. The project was the first to investigate an offshore wind project in the Great Lakes and it has furthered the body of knowledge for foundations and installation methods within Lake Erie. The project collected historical geotechnical information for Lake Erie and also used recently obtained data from the LEEDCo Icebreaker Project (FOA DE-EE 0005989) geotechnical program to develop the conceptual designs. Using these data-sets, the project developed design wind and wave conditions from actual buoy data in order to develop a concept that would de-risk a project using a GBF. These wind and wave conditions were then utilized to create reference designs for various foundations specific to installation in Lake Erie. A project partner on the project (Weeks Marine) provided input for construction and costing the GBF fabrication and installation. By having a marine contractor with experience with large marine projects as part of the team provides credibility to the LCOE developed by NREL. NREL then utilized the design and construction costing information as part of the LCOE model. The report summarizes the findings of the project. • Developed a cost model and “baseline” LCOE • Documented Site Conditions within Lake Erie • Developed Fabrication, Installation and Foundations Innovative Concept Designs • Evaluated LCOE Impact of Innovations • Developed Assembly line “Rail System” for GBF Construction and Staging • Developed Transit-Inspired Foundation Designs which incorporated: Semi-Floating Transit with Supplemental Pontoons Barge mounted Winch System • Developed GBF with “Penetration Skirt” • Developed Integrated GBF with Turbine Tower • Developed Turbine, Plant Layout and O&M Strategies The report details lowering LCOE by 22. 3 % and identified additional strategies that could further lower LCOE when building an utility scale wind farm in the Great Lakes...|$|R
40|$|In this contribution, {{the species}} {{composition}} and ecological succession of the biofouling on the subtidal zone (circa littoral) of selected foundations of two offshore wind {{farms in the}} Belgian part of the North Sea, the C-Power farm on the Thorntonbank and the Belwind farm on the Bligh Bank, are studied through time. As observed in many other studies, the colonization of the bare substratum has been very fast in the two studied wind farms. No less than 50 % of the total species pool (41 taxa out of 78 taxa) was shared between both wind farms and both wind farms were dominated by the amphipod Jassa herdmani with up to 90000 ind. /m 2 (i. e. about 70 % of the enumerable fauna). Other dominant species in both wind farms comprised the starfish Asterias rubens and the amphipod Stenothoe valida. The {{first year of the}} succession also showed a highly similar trajectory, with particularly mobile species, e. g. J. herdmani and Corophium acherusicum displaying a typical summer – winter oscillation pattern in both wind farms. This similarity was however less obvious for the sessile species such as Pomatoceros triqueter and Clytia hemisphaerica, and seemed to strongly diverge after the first year. The concrete <b>gravity</b> <b>based</b> <b>foundations</b> (GBFs) at the Thorntonbank hosted more species than the steel monopiles at the Bligh Bank (70 taxa versus 49 species). The presence of some coastal, soft sediment species such as the bivalves Abra alba and Mysella (Kurtiella) bidentata, only in the C-Power farm, further contributed to the dissimilarity between both wind farms. The biofouling on both wind farms exhibits direct influence by the same pool of species originating from the surrounding artificial and natural hard substrata. As for shipwrecks, specific features of the studied structures such as verticality, substratum composition or lower depths may explain specific patterns of taxonomic composition such as an impoverished sessile epifauna compared to the surrounding natural hard substrata. Predatory activities are an important factor controlling the succession of sessile species on the substratum. The high degree of patchiness suggests that the colonization process is still ongoing and the mature state, the Metridium senile biotope, characteristic for this type of substrata in the North Sea is not fully reached yet. Apart from the slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata, no introduced species have been observed thus far in the permanently submerged part of the wind turbine foundations. This observation contrasts with the intertidal and splash zone, where many introduced species were present in the biofouling community...|$|R
