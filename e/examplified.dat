40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{termination}} proof techniques based on reduction orderings to a higher-order setting, by adapting the recursive path ordering definition to higher-order simplytyped -terms. The main {{result is that}} this ordering is well-founded, compatible with fi-reductions, and with polymorphic typing. We also restrict the ordering so as to obtain a new ordering operating on higher-order terms in j-long fi-normal form. Both orderings are powerful enough to allow for complex examples, including the polymorphic version of Godel's recursor for simple inductive types. Key words: higher-order rewriting; typed lambda calculus; Godel's polymorphic recursor; termination orderings. 1 Introduction Rewrite rules are increasingly used in programming languages and logical systems, with two main goals: defining functions by pattern matching; describing rule-based decision procedures.

5000|$|Although {{it seems}} like a debate today in Islamic world against the favor of the topic, one of the most {{important}} building blocks of Islam, the Quran, has some parts mentioning and recognizing the cultural pluralism which might be <b>examplified</b> in the verse: [...] "Another of His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth, and the diversity of your languages and colors(30:22)." [...] This is a clear sign of diversity acknowledgment in the Quran. Adding to that, it is stated in the verse “And We did not send any messenger except speaking in the language of his people to state clearly for them, and Allah sends astray thereby whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise(14:4).”that all Prophets and Messengers were sent to their people to tell them about the Islam in their own language which is also a clear indication of diversity both stated in the book and applied in real world. Giving a really effective emphasis on diversity in the eyes of the creator, the Allah in Islam, the verse [...] "If God had so willed, He would have made you one community...(5:48)." [...] clearly shows the existence of pluralism in Islam with the aspects of culture, economy, politics, etc. are the core of human civilization in all times.|$|E
