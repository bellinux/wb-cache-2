500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with a B+, {{explaining}} {{that after the}} previous week's episode, [...] "Olivia. In The Lab. With The Revolver." [...] was a [...] "return to normalcy". Murray appreciated the episode's use of a secret that [...] "eats at people when they can’t bring themselves to air it out", particularly spotlighting the [...] "look of panic" [...] on Walter's face when Olivia and Peter leave his lab. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly also appreciated the balance between mythology and single-episode elements. [...] "This week’s episode stood up as a perfectly comprehensible hour <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> new to the series, thanks to its medical mystery and fun side-moments such as Walter making brightly colored taffy. But is also wove in characters and names from previous episodes — Nick Lane, Nancy Lewis — and raised the tantalizing suggestion that the illness James Heath suffered from might be a malady that’s also afflicting parts of the alternate universe." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} derided Friedman's {{idiosyncratic}} prose style, with its tendency to use mixed metaphors and analogies. [...] Walter Russell Mead described his prose as being [...] "an occasionally flat Midwestern demotic punctuated by gee-whiz exclamations {{about just how}} doggone irresistible globalization is – lacks the steely elegance of a Lippmann, the unobtrusive serviceability of a Scotty Reston or the restless fireworks of a Maureen Dowd and is best taken in small doses." [...] Similarly, journalist Matt Taibbi has said of Friedman's writing that, [...] "Friedman came up with lines so hilarious you couldn't make them up <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> trying – and when you tried to actually picture the 'illustrative' figures of speech he offered to explain himself, what you often ended up with was pure physical comedy of the Buster Keaton/Three Stooges school, with whole nations and peoples slipping and falling on the misplaced banana peels of his literary endeavors." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some time later, Bree and Rex visit Andrew at the camp. Andrew asks to see {{his father}} alone; Bree thinks this is because he blames her for sending him to the camp and storms into the meeting room to tell him she did the right thing. There, Rex reveals that Andrew {{wanted to see him}} alone because he fears he is gay. Bree is horrified, and despite Rex's misgivings, insists Andrew come home with them immediately, saying [...] "Our son just told us that he might be gay. There are two hundred other boys in this camp. Now, I could explain to you what might happen if we left him here, but I'm a lady and I don't use that kind of language." [...] Rex reminds her that he is still her son and Bree tries to comfort Andrew by telling him [...] "I would love you <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a murderer".|$|E

6000|$|Lillian felt this, and asked, with {{a sudden}} shyness coming over her, [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a gentleman, and so no one will mind <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not rich." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Far beyond range," [...] he said, {{lowering}} the gun again; [...] "but <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> only four {{yards from the}} muzzle, I would not fire, poor bird! Did not Milly say you were noble, {{and that it would}} be worse than murder to kill you? No, you are safe from me, at all events, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not so wary as to keep yourself safe from everybody.
