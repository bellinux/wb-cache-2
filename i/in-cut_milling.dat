40|$|Gamma {{titanium}} aluminides are {{an interesting}} alternative for nickel, iron or cobalt matrix superalloys. Due to the advantageous strength properties at high temperatures they can successfully replace superalloys in applications such as high pressure compressor blades, low pressure turbine blades, high pressure compressor case, low pressure turbine case. Milling {{is one of the}} processes that can be applied in the forming elements made from this type of alloys for the aviation industry. Research included the selection of tool, the process kinematics and the range of milling gamma titanium aluminide (Ti- 45 Al- 5 Nb- 0. 2 B- 0. 2 C) process parameters were carried out. Milling can be an effective method of forming of elements made of gamma TiAL in the range of processing parameters: vc = 20 - 70 m/min, ap = 0. 3 - 0. 7 mm, fz = 0. 1 - 0. 45 mm/tooth. In the tests carried out the best results were obtained using a R 300 - 016 A 20 L- 08 L milling cutter, S 30 T tool coating and <b>in-cut</b> <b>milling...</b>|$|E
50|$|With {{the aid of}} linebacker Levon Kirkland's 8-yard sack of Aikman, the Cowboys {{were forced}} to punt on their next drive, and Pittsburgh regained {{possession}} of the ball at their own 32-yard line with 4:15 remaining. However, on second down, Brown intercepted another O'Donnell pass and returned it 33 yards to the Steelers' 6-yard line. The play was {{a mirror image of}} O'Donnell's first interception to Brown; a throw in the right flat thrown under a heavy Cowboys blitz into the arms of Brown with no Steelers receiver in sight. After the game, O'Donnell said that he was throwing in the spot he expected receiver Corey Holliday to be on the second interception, stating that he expected Holliday to make an out-cut instead of an <b>in-cut.</b> <b>Mills</b> responded by questioning why O'Donnell would throw to a spot and not a man in a Super Bowl. Brown said he was all alone on both picks because he expected O'Donnell to throw to the outside to seemingly get rid of the ball amidst the Cowboys' blitz.|$|R
