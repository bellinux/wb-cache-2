5|$|From the outset, the cyclone's {{motion was}} altered by Hurricane Flossie off the Pacific coast of Mexico. Initially, deep {{convection}} <b>fired</b> <b>up</b> gradually as the depression slowly tracked westward in the Gulf of Mexico. At 1200UTC on August10, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle, {{as the storm}} curved southward. Gabrielle then strengthened slowly over the warm sea surface temperatures in a low wind shear environment, although land interaction slowed the intensification somewhat. The storm shifted once again onto a west-northwest course on August11, moving very slowly towards the coast.|$|E

5|$|On February 21, 2013, the Heat traded Dexter Pittman {{to create}} {{space on the}} roster to pursue a more {{experienced}} big man. On March 2, 2013, Howard signed a 10-day contract with the 2012–13 Miami Heat. On March 12, 2013, he signed a second 10-day contract with the Heat, and on March 22, 2013, he was signed {{for the remainder of}} the season. He made his first appearance of the season for the Heat on March 24 against the Charlotte Bobcats tallying two points, a rebound and two assists in three minutes of play as the Heat made their way to their 26th consecutive victory. On April 15, he made his first start since April 14, 2010 as the Heat defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers without James, Wade, Bosh, Battier, Chalmers and Udonis Haslem in the penultimate game of the regular season. Howard's April 17 start in the season finale against the Orlando Magic marked Howard's 900th career start. On May 30, during halftime of game 5 of the Eastern Conference championship against the Indiana Pacers, Howard delivered a passionate speech that <b>fired</b> <b>up</b> the team in its clinching game. With the retirement of Grant Hill on June 1, 2013, Howard became the oldest active player in the NBA at age 40. During the playoffs, Howard did not play, but he served as a quasi-assistant coach.|$|E

25|$|The {{popularity}} of the series was also indirectly responsible {{for the creation of}} the reality series NYC Prep, which ran for one season on Bravo. The series has been referenced in films such as <b>Fired</b> <b>Up!,</b> Get Him To The Greek, Vampires Suck, Easy A, Just Go With It and Horrible Bosses, and TV series such as Royal Pains, Entourage, Parks and Recreation, 30 Rock, and Skins, among others.|$|E

On the second {{play of the}} game, Brian Griese's pass was tipped and intercepted by Lance Briggs. The Bears capitalized on the turnover with a field goal. A field position battle saw the Bears kick another field goal, and hold a 6–0 lead early. After the early turnover, Brian Griese led the Buccaneers on an 8-play, 81-yard scoring drive.

There, {{during the middle of the}} first wave’s attack, he <b>fired</b> <b>up</b> the only flyable Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter on the island. A ground crew member crawled up on the wing telling him, “You can’t take this airplane!” “The heck I can’t, get off my wing!” Arnold replied. “But it doesn’t have any ammunition!” came the response.|$|E

25|$|Washington {{narrowed the}} score to 19–13 {{in the fourth}} quarter. With about 11 minutes to go, Jeff Garcia {{returned}} to the game, hoping to spark Tampa Bay's offense, and hold on for the win. He was unable to do much against the Redskins' well-rested and <b>fired</b> <b>up</b> defense, however, and Tampa Bay ended up having to punt. Josh Bidwell pinned the Redskins at their own 9-yard line, and Campbell drove them to the Tampa Bay 32-yard line. Ronde Barber stopped the threat when he intercepted the ball at the 28-yard line. With {{less than a minute}} to go, Campbell drove the Redskins to the Tampa Bay 16-yard line, but Brian Kelly intercepted the pass in the end zone with 17 seconds remaining, to clinch the victory for the Buccaneers.|$|E
25|$|Empire Fawley {{was sold}} in 1946 to Clan Line Ltd and was renamed Clan Mackinlay. She was {{operated}} under the management of Cayzer, Irvine & Co Ltd. Her port of registry was Newcastle upon Tyne. In January 1959, Cayzer, Irvine & Co Ltd were prosecued at Grays Thurrock, Essex over alleged emissions of smoke from Clan Mackinlay at Tilbury, Essex on 2 October 1958, in breach of the Clean Air Act 1956. The company was fined £25, with 10 guineas costs. The cause was stated to be a fault developing in a boiler necessitating another to be <b>fired</b> <b>up</b> at short notice, the fuel not burning efficiently as the oil was cold. She arrived at Hong Kong on 2 November 1962 for scrapping, which {{was done by the}} Peninsular Shipbreaking Co.|$|E
25|$|The replay {{was played}} {{in front of}} a small but very vocal Boro crowd who were <b>fired</b> <b>up</b> by an {{unfortunately}} worded letter from the club seemingly asking them to sit down and be quiet in their last home game. The fans didn't have to wait long for a goal as in the fifth minute Stewart Downing curled an unstoppable free-kick over the wall and into the top-right hand corner of the net. Tuncay doubled the lead with a volley as West Ham's defense failed to clear the ball. The visitors dominated the possession but could not convert it to goals, and with Middlesbrough threatening on the counterattack, they couldn't afford to neglect their defensive duties. In the end, the 2–0 was enough to see Middlesbrough through to the last eight for the fourth consecutive season.|$|E

25|$|The Cougars {{opened the}} season at home, hosting the Northern Illinois Huskies, who played a very {{physical}} game, with the visitors from the Mid-American Conference racking up 14 fouls and 3 yellow cards. In the 17th minute, the normally stingy SIUE defense turned over the ball on a straight giveaway that NIU's Molina took and passed to Voss, who fired a booming shot from 25 yards out that left Dal Santo no chance for a save, and the Huskies took a 1–0 lead that held through halftime. The Cougars returned from the break <b>fired</b> <b>up</b> and working hard for a shot. When the Huskies were called for a handball inside the 18 yard box in the 57th minute, Ledbetter stepped up and fired in the penalty shot to tie the score. For the remainder of regulation time and through two extra time periods, the two offenses jockeyed {{to find a good}} shot, and the defenses turned away attack after attack. After 110 minutes, the game ended in a 1–1 draw.|$|E
25|$|On March 24, 2009, it was {{announced}} that 4449 would attend Trainfestival 2009 in Owosso, Michigan from July 23–26 with an all-day excursion planned on the 23rd and 24th and a photo run-by planned for each trip. The engine was then placed on display {{for the rest of the}} event. The historic 2,500-mile move from Portland to Owosso was arranged by the Friends of the 4449, Amtrak, Steam Railroading Institute of Owosso, and the Friends of the 261. The Milwaukee Road 261 organization lent some of their first-class passenger cars, including former Milwaukee Road Super Dome #53 and Cedar Rapids Skytop Lounge for the 4449 and for the other excursion trains at the festival. The train left its home at Brooklyn Roundhouse on July 2 and left the city of Portland the following day on July 3. It returned to the city Portland and Brooklyn Roundhouse on October 20. Future excursions are being planned to follow the locomotive's mandatory 15-year inspection and overhaul, expected to be complete by the fall of 2015. On November 25, 2015, SP 4449 was <b>fired</b> <b>up</b> for the first time in 2 years and returned to service.|$|E
25|$|Drake, {{winner of}} the 2015 MVC tourney at The Ralph {{returned}} for SIUE Homecoming. Though the Bulldogs took more shots, the Cougars fairly well dominated possession in the first half. In the 27th minute, Solawa scored his first goal as a Cougar, returning a blocked Jambga shot over the Drake keeper's head. Holding the 1–0 lead through halftime, SIUE came back out <b>fired</b> <b>up,</b> narrowly missing additional goals in the early second half. In the 74th minute, Drake got a breakaway, and Kendall-Moullin was sent off after making a potentially goal-saving hard tackle. The Bulldogs stepped up their attack after gaining the man-advantage. Flooding the box with bodies on a corner kick, Drake evened the score at 1–1 in the 77th minute. The Cougar defense held firm into the last minute of regulation time, when a Bulldog forward piled atop Dal Santo as he covered a save, and both sides went a man down for extra time. In the 94th minute, Ebbesen and Solawa traded passes before Ebbesen hit Lachlan McLean five yards out, with the Australian sophomore turning and firing {{into the top of}} the net to complete the ninth consecutive Homecoming victory since SIUE returned to Division I.|$|E
