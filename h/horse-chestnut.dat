5|$|The larvae of {{a number}} of species of moth use the leaves as a food source. These include the {{sycamore}} moth (Acronicta aceris), the maple prominent (Ptilodon cucullina) and the plumed prominent (Ptilophora plumigera). The <b>horse-chestnut</b> leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar. The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds. As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, but it does have a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple.|$|E
25|$|Gracillariidae is an {{important}} family of insects in the order Lepidoptera and the principal family of leaf miners that includes several economic, horticultural or recently invasive pest species such as the <b>horse-chestnut</b> leaf miner, Cameraria ohridella.|$|E

Several {{very large}} beeches and sycamores are also present.

25|$|The {{isolated}} {{figures are}} given statuesque but largely unmodeled treatment, and their skin and their clothes are clean, with a waxy finish. They appear unselfconscious, {{at ease in}} their environment, and—with {{the possible exception of}} the boy to the bottom right—are locked in a pensive and solitary reverie. Horizontal and vertical lines at the middle and far distance contrast with arched backs and the relaxed postures of the figures toward the front. These postures, angles of heads, directions of gaze, and positions of limbs are repeated among the figures, giving the group a rhythmic unity. Distinctively coloured forms in close proximity, such as the grouping of <b>horse-chestnut</b> colours of the clothes on the bank, and the grouping of oranges of the boys in the water, add to the stability of the work—an effect reinforced in the cluster of shadows to the left on the bank, and the un-verisimilar play of light around the bathing figures.|$|E
500|$|The {{forests are}} {{composed}} of diverse species of deciduous and coniferous trees and {{a great variety of}} wildflowers. An important element of the region's flora, apart from the rich variety of plant species, is the high degree of endemism in Balkan (23%) and Greek species (5.8%). Recent studies on the flora of the National Park counted 873 vascular plants, including more than 250 medicinal, aromatic, and poisonous taxa. The park's forests are abundant in species associated with the cool local climate, such as Wych Elm, Nettle-leaved Bellflower, <b>Horse-chestnut</b> and Large-leaved Linden. In the valley of the Vikos Gorge, Platanus orientalis form an azonal gallery forest {{along the banks of the}} Voidomatis. The woodland in the mountain area around the village of Papingo is characterized by the predominance of different juniper species, such as Juniperus communis, foetidissima, oxycedrus and excelsa. In the upper hills Juniperus foetidissima dominates, with exceptionally high (more than [...] ) trees. At higher altitudes, pure conifer forests of either pine or fir are found.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, the BBC apologised unreservedly {{and paid}} £250 in {{compensation}} to a Somerset parish council, after Clarkson damaged a 30-year-old <b>horse-chestnut</b> tree by driving into it {{to test the}} strength of a Toyota Hilux.

They stated the scene [...] "was not editorially justified" [...] despite occurring outside the jurisdiction of any drink-driving laws.|$|E

50|$|In Germany, <b>horse-chestnuts</b> {{are often}} found in beer gardens, {{particularly}} in Bavaria. Prior to the advent of mechanical refrigeration, brewers would dig cellars for lagering.

The practice of serving beer at these sites evolved into the modern beer garden.|$|R
