40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} for a classic problem in computational geometry, Klee’s measure problem: given {{a set of}} n axis-parallel boxes in d-dimensional space, compute {{the volume of the}} union of the boxes. The algorithm runs in O(n d/ 2) time for any constant d ≥ 3. Although it improves the previous best algorithm by “just ” an iterated logarithmic factor, the real surprise lies in the simplicity of the new algorithm. We also show that it is theoretically possible to beat the O(n d/ 2) time bound by logarithmic factors for integer input in the word RAM model, and for other variants of the problem. With additional work, we obtain an O(n d/ 3 polylog n) -time algorithm for the important special case of orthants or unit hypercubes (which include the so-called “hypervolume indicator problem”), and an O(n (d+ 1) / 3 polylog n) -time algorithm for the case of arbitrary hypercubes or <b>fat</b> <b>boxes,</b> improving a previous O(n (d+ 2) / 3) -time algorithm by Bringmann. ...|$|R
30|$|Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) organs such as duodenum, gizzard, liver, large {{intestine}} and small intestine were purchased freshly {{from the local}} market and stored in an ice <b>box.</b> <b>Fat</b> attached to the organs was also extracted for this analysis. The chicken organs were then processed {{in a similar manner}} as that of the mouse organs described above.|$|R
50|$|Keach {{played a}} rookie {{policeman}} in The New Centurions (1972), opposite George C. Scott. That year he also starred in <b>Fat</b> City, a <b>boxing</b> film directed by John Huston. He {{was the first}} choice {{for the role of}} Damien Karras in the 1973 movie The Exorcist, but he did not accept the role. He went on to play Kane in the 1980 movie The Ninth Configuration, written and directed by Blatty; this role was itself intended for Nicol Williamson.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{periods of}} feeding and fasting, plasmaglucose {{remains in a}} narrow range between 4 and 7 mM in normal individuals. This tightcontrol is governed by the balance betweenglucose {{absorption}} from the intestine, production by the liver and uptake and metabolism by peripheral tissues. Insulin increases glucose uptake in muscle and <b>fat</b> (see <b>Box</b> 1), and inhibits hepatic glucose production, thus serving as the primary regulator of blood glucose concentration. Insulin also stimulates cell growth and differentiation, and promotes the storage of substrates in fat, liver and muscle by stimulating lipogenesis, glycogen and protein synthesis, and inhibiting lipolysis, glycogenolysis and protein breakdown (Fig. 1). Insulin resistance or deficiency results in profound dysregulation of these processes, and produces elevations in fasting and postprandial glucose and lipid levels. Insulin increases glucose uptake in cells by stimulating the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT 4 fro...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess weights of food staffs of the boxed meals soled in the convenience stores, and to analyze the relationships between amount of vegetables and energy, percentage energy from fat, and sodium chloride equivalent in the boxed meals. We bought 31 boxed meals “Makunouchi ” with rice and main dish from 11 : 30 to 12 : 30 at 4 convenience stores with different company in North ward, Niigata city, Japan, and weighed each food staffs and analyzed 30 of them. Mean （±SD） amount of vegetables in boxed meals was 17. 5 ± 11. 9 g. Amount of vegetables was negatively correlated with amount of energy （r＝－ 0. 432, p＝ 0. 017 ）, and percentage energy from fat （r＝－ 0. 380, p＝ 0. 038 ）. Although, no significant correlation was found between amount of vegetables and sodium chloride equivalent（ r＝－ 00. 97, p＝ 06. 09 ）. One of the reasons of these negative correlations between amount of vegetables and energy or percentage energy from <b>fat</b> in <b>boxed</b> meals will be less energy and fat contents of vegetables. コンビニ弁当の食材重量の実態を把握し、野菜量とエネルギー、脂肪エネルギー比率および食塩相当量との関連を検討することを目的とした。新潟市北区内の会社の異なるコンビニ４社において、１１時半～１２時半に「めし」とおかず形態の幕の内スタイル弁当３１個を購入し、そのうちの３０個を食材別に秤量し、解析を行った。弁当の野菜量は平均±標準偏差１７. ５±１１. ９ gであった。また、野菜量とエネルギー量との間には負の相関が認められ（r＝－０. ４３２、p＝０. ０１７）、脂肪エネルギー比率も同様であった（r＝－０３. ８０、p＝００. ３８）。野菜量と食塩相当量の間には相関は見られなかった（r＝－００. ９７、p＝０６. ０９）。弁当の野菜量とエネルギー量および脂肪エネルギー比率に負の相関が見られた理由として、概して野菜にはエネルギーが少なく、脂質も少ないことが一つの要因と考えられた...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{combination}} of our soft supernumerary robotic finger i. e. Soft-SixthFinger with a commercially available zero gravity arm support, the SaeboMAS. The overall proposed system can provide the needed assistance during paretic upper limb rehabilitation involving both grasping and arm mobility to solve task-oriented activities. The Soft-SixthFinger is a wearable robotic supernumerary finger designed {{to be used as}} an active assistive device by post stroke patients to compensate the paretic hand grasp. The device works jointly with the paretic hand/arm to grasp an object similarly to the two parts of a robotic gripper. The SaeboMAS is a commercially available mobile arm support to neutralize gravity effects on the paretic arm specifically designed to facilitate and challenge the weakened shoulder muscles during functional tasks. The proposed system has been designed to be used during the rehabilitation phase when the arm is potentially able to recover its functionality, but the hand is still not able to perform a grasp {{due to the lack of}} an efficient thumb opposition. The overall system also act as a motivation tool for the patients to perform task-oriented rehabilitation activities. With the aid of proposed system, the patient can closely simulate the desired motion with the non-functional arm for rehabilitation purposes, while performing a grasp with the help of the Soft-SixthFinger. As a pilot study we tested the proposed system with a chronic stroke patient to evaluate how the mobile arm support in conjunction with a robotic supernumerary finger can help in performing the tasks requiring the manipulation of grasped object through the paretic arm. In particular, we performed the Frenchay Arm Test (<b>FAT)</b> and <b>Box</b> and Block Test (BBT). The proposed system successfully enabled the patient to complete tasks which were previously impossible to perform...|$|R
500|$|Although it did {{not enter}} any charts, Thom Jurek from AllMusic praised Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, {{rewarding}} the box set with {{four out of five}} stars. Jurek said it had [...] "a whopping four CDs and one DVD." [...] Jurek noted that discs one and two [...] "feature tracks from Reign in Blood, and all the albums that proceed from it, and includes bonus cuts previously only released in Japan, and cuts from soundtracks." [...] He also said that the third disc [...] "is, appropriately, titled 'Shit You Never Heard' because that's what it is— sixteen tracks that have been unissued anywhere— from rehearsals, to in-concert recordings, demos, and one 'No Remorse,' a collaboration with Atari Teenage Riot, from the Spawn soundtrack," [...] and that the fourth disc are [...] "an electronic press kit video for Diabolus in Musica, and an appearance at the Kerrang magazine awards." [...] Adrien Begrand from PopMatters favoured the album, lauding the packaging but stating that [...] "like any other CD box set that has come out in recent years, the band seems torn about whom to appeal to, longtime fans, or newcomers." [...] Begrand noted that the first disc [...] "is especially great, as it captures Slayer at the peak of their career, starting with the classic 1986 album Reign in Blood." [...] PR Newswire said it was [...] "a Slayer fan's ultimate experience," [...] and The Dallas Morning News called it [...] "a <b>fat</b> new audiovisual <b>box</b> set." ...|$|R
40|$|Strong {{statements}} about the inappropriateness of the continued widespread use of faecal <b>fat</b> measurements (see <b>Box</b> 1) appear to have had little impact on laboratory practice or on the clinical investigation of patients who may have malabsorption. The evaluation of fat absorption or malab-sorption is required in {{a small minority of}} patients being investigated for gastrointestinal disorders. The British Society of Gastroenterol-ogy (BSG) guidelines (Tests for Malabsorption 4) state that gastroenterologists should have access to such tests to ` [...] . assess patients with malabsorption who are proving dif®cult to diagnose’. Unfortunately, by giving this test for fat malabsorption pride of place, the guidelines appear to over-emphasize the role of faecal fat assessment in the investigation of gastrointest-inal disease. In the 1997 survey of 231 hospitals in the UK, 5 faecal fat was the most widely available of all tests, with the estimated number of faecal fat measurements performed annually in the UK being 6100. The survey also showed that 67 % of the physicians who responded (all members of the BSG) used faecal fat in the diagnosis and management of patients, so {{it could be argued that}} our continued analytical service was merely a response to clinical demand. Faecal fat measurement has many limitations, some of which were highlighted in the 1997 survey and must be brought to the attention of our clinical colleagues to dissuade them from placing reliance on an inherently unreliable test. In addition, local dialogue with gastroenterolo-gists is necessary to get them to agree that the quantitative demonstration of fat malabsorption is only of value in the diagnosis or management of very few patients...|$|R
