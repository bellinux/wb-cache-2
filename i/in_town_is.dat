5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours, marine {{biologist}} Doc is already at work in his one-man Western Biological Laboratory, getting an order of starfish ready to be shipped to a university. His unintelligent friend Hazel (a man) comes in to chat with him ("All Kinds of People"). Millicent, a wealthy young lady, enters from the next room, where she has been spending (part of) the night with Doc. Mac, another friend of Doc, brings in Suzy, who has injured her hand breaking a window to steal some donuts. Doc, whose lack of a medical degree does not stop the denizens of Cannery Row from seeking him out for treatment, bandages her hand, as the irritated Millicent leaves. Suzy, new <b>in</b> <b>town,</b> <b>is</b> curious about Doc's work ("The Tide Pool") and tells about her journey from San Francisco ("Everybody's Got a Home but Me"). Fauna, who runs the nearby Bear Flag Café—an establishment open even at this hour—had heard that a new girl in town had injured herself, and has come to talk to Suzy. Fauna is initially reluctant to invite Suzy into the Bear Flag, but when Jim, the local plainclothes cop gives Suzy a hard time, Fauna takes Suzy in.

25|$|After 1910 steady {{population}} decline {{was driven}} {{by the lack of}} significant population in outlying areas, migration to larger urban centers, and the absence of dynamic economic factors to generate wealth. The hardware store closed in 1928 and the bank, like thousands of other undercapitalized small-town banks in the United States, went out of business in 1929 or 1930 {{in the aftermath of the}} stock market crash of 1929. U.S. Census bureau data indicates that the population fell to 102 in 1920, 80 in 1930, rose slightly to 89 in 1940, and fell to 62 in 1950, 35 in 1960 and 24 in 1970. As local establishments burned down or went out of business they were not replaced, and finally the post office was discontinued in 1980 when the census bureau pegged Tenney's population at 19. Today the only remaining business <b>in</b> <b>town</b> <b>is</b> the elevator. The only commercial building remaining on the main drag is the former James Bigsby general store, later the G.A.

SpongeBob accidentally drops a piece of fruitcake in Sandy's Christmas Magic Analyzer, which shows that it is filled with Jerktonium. He and Sandy discover the antidote for Jerktonium to cure the residents in Bikini Bottom is a song called [...] "Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas!)." [...] SpongeBob sings it, bringing back the residents' Christmas spirit. Unfortunately, it was too late when Santa arrives and states that everyone is on his naughty list, except for Plankton, who is the only nice person there is, which has earned him the Krabby Patty formula, much to Mr. Krabs shock. SpongeBob tries to convince Santa that this is all a mistake, but Santa refuses to believe him, saying he's the worst of all, being blamed for his robot doppelganger's deeds. The wind-up robot shows up to eliminate Santa, but SpongeBob fights the robot with the fruitcake dispenser and finally destroys it, clearing his name. Santa thanks SpongeBob for saving him, which shows that SpongeBob is good, but then he finds the robot's wind-up key by reading [...] "If found, please return to the Chum Bucket," [...] revealing that Plankton was behind all the chaos, and punishes Plankton by giving him, once again, a stocking of coal. Santa lets the residents of Bikini Bottom celebrate the holiday, and he leaves Bikini Bottom, only for Patrick Star to capture him in a jellyfish/butterfly net and throw him off-course.|$|E

During a hallucination, Homer imagines himself singing the song [...] "Sugar, Sugar" [...] by The Archies while dancing with lollipops and ice cream cones. While on the raft, Homer misquotes lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner when he says [...] "Water, water everywhere/So let's all have a drink.

Not wanting a relationship with him, Emma agrees to drive {{him back to his}} home in Storybrooke, Maine. Along the way, Henry shows her a large book of fairy tales he has, insisting that all of the stories in it are real. When they arrive in Storybrooke, Henry informs her that everyone <b>in</b> <b>town</b> <b>is</b> in reality a fairy tale character, exiled by the curse and with no memory of their real identities. This includes his therapist Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge), who is really Jiminy Cricket, and his teacher Mary Margaret Blanchard (Goodwin), who is really Snow White. Henry claims that time is frozen in Storybrooke and the people are unable to leave, but that the curse will be broken by Emma. A skeptical Emma returns Henry to his adopted mother, the town Mayor, Regina (Parrilla), who is really the Evil Queen. Emma attempts to leave but after having drunk apple cider given to her by the Mayor and nearly hitting a wolf she has a car accident where she is knocked out. She is arrested and taken to Storybrooke Jail. When Henry runs away again, Emma makes a deal with the Mayor and Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan): if they release her, she will find him.

[...] After finding Henry at a wooden jungle gym (which bears a resemblance to Prince Charming's castle), they talk and Emma decides to stay in Storybrooke temporarily, especially after Regina warns her to leave town.
