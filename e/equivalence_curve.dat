40|$|When {{selecting}} habitats, herbivores must weigh multiple risks, such as predation, starvation, toxicity, {{and thermal}} stress, {{forcing them to}} make fitness trade-offs. Here, we applied the method of paired comparisons (PC) to investigate how herbivores make trade-offs between habitat features that influence selection of food patches. The method of PC measures utility and the inverse of utility, relative risk, and makes trade-offs and indifferences explicit by forcing animals to make choices between two patches with different types of risks. Using a series of paired-choice experiments to titrate the <b>equivalence</b> <b>curve</b> and find the marginal rate of substitution for one risk over the other, we evaluated how toxin-tolerant (pygmy rabbit Brachylagus idahoensis) and fiber-tolerant (mountain cottontail rabbit Sylviagus nuttallii) herbivores differed in their hypothesized perceived risk of fiber and toxins in food. Pygmy rabbits were willing to consume nearly five times more of the toxin 1, 8 -cineole in their diets to avoid consuming higher levels of fiber than were mountain cottontails. Fiber posed a greater relative risk for pygmy rabbits than cottontails and cineole a greater risk for cottontails than pygmy rabbits. Our flexible modeling approach {{can be used to}} (1) quantify how animals evaluate and trade off multiple habitat attributes when the benefits and risks are difficult to quantify, and (2) integrate diverse risks that influence fitness and habitat selection into a single index of habitat value. This index potentially could be applied to landscapes to predict habitat selection across several scales...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of the behaviour of the concanavalin A—polysaccharide and antibody—antigen systems with regard to various parameters of turbidity was conducted.

In addition it was demonstrated that the degree of inhibition of the maximum constant turbidity caused by hapten inhibitors was identical to the degree of inhibition as determined by the amount of convanavalin A which precipitated. It was also shown that the quantitative estimation of inhibition (as determined turbidimetrically) {{at any time during the}} formation of turbidity yielded results which were directly proportional to those obtained by the quantitative precipitin method...|$|R

40|$|A random {{scanning}} algorithm {{for tracking}} curves in image sequences is proposed. First it verifies {{the presence of}} a curve by votes, whose values indicate the number of the points on the curve, thus being able to robustly detect curves against outlier and occlusion. Furthermore, a procedure for preventing redundant verification is introduced by determining <b>equivalence</b> <b>curves</b> in the digital space to reduce the time complexity. Second it propagates the distribution which represents the presence of the curve to the successive image of a given sequence. This temporal propagation enables to focus on the potential region where the curves detected at time t- 1 are likely to appear at time t. As a result, the time complexity does not depend on the dimension of the curve to be detected. To evaluate the performance, we use three noisy image sequences, consisting of 90 frames with 320 × 240 pixels. The results show that the algorithm successfully tracks the target even in noisy or cluttered binary images...|$|R

Muzereau et al. [11] showed that such auxiliary elliptic curves are highly likely to exist for almost all elliptic curve groups. It is however remarked that it gets extremely hard to construct them as the order of G increases.

Dense Space In all scenarios curved space and dense space are mathematically and geometrically equivalent. In the example of light being curved around the sun, if we consider the light as travelling in a channel of space with height equal to the amplitude of the light, the bottom of the channel appears to have denser space (the wave troughs are closer together) that the top of the channel, and is an exact equivalent of a band of varying density space.
