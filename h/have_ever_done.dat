5|$|Kyle {{agrees to}} take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into Bane's trap. Bane reveals {{that he intends}} to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's mission to destroy Gotham, and then steals Batman's {{technology}} from Wayne Enterprises armorer Lucius Fox. Bane fights Batman and delivers a crippling blow to his back, before taking him abroad to an underground prison. There, the inmates tell Wayne the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, who {{was born and raised in}} the prison before finally escaping — the only prisoner to <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> so.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the guests}} at the party are Totsky, General Yepanchin, Ganya, his friend Ptitsyn (Varya's husband), and Ferdyshchenko, who, with Nastassya Filippovna's approval, {{plays the role of}} cynical buffoon. With the {{acquiescence}} of Kolya, Prince Myshkin arrives, uninvited. To enliven the party, Ferdyshchenko suggests a game where everyone must recount the story of the worst thing they <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done.</b> Others are shocked at the proposal, but Nastassya Filippovna is enthusiastic. When it comes to Totsky's turn he tells a long but completely innocuous anecdote from the distant past. Disgusted and angry, Nastassya Filippovna turns to Myshkin and demands his advice on whether or not to marry Ganya. Myshkin advises her not to, and Nastassya Filippovna, to the dismay of Totsky, General Yepanchin and Ganya, firmly announces that she is following this advice. At this point, Rogozhin and his followers arrive with the promised 100,000 rubles. Nastassya Filippovna is preparing to leave with him, exploiting the scandalous scene to humiliate Totsky, when Myshkin himself offers to marry her. He speaks gently and sincerely, and in response to incredulous queries about what they will live on, produces a document indicating that he will soon be receiving a large inheritance. Though surprised and deeply touched, Nastassya Filippovna, after throwing the 100,000 rubles in the fire and telling Ganya they are his if he wants to get them out, chooses to leave with Rogozhin. Myshkin follows them.|$|E

[...] He then went on to say, in a later part of the interview, that [...] "it was the hardest shoot that I <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> that Zach <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> that Ed <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> and that Todd <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> done." ...|$|R

In Admiral Beatty's words, {{the results were}} [...] "distinctly poor and disappointing", and {{led him to the}} initial conclusion that he could not consider the American division the equivalent of a British one. The Americans worked to catch up, however, and with every target practice registered improved results. By the end of June 1918, Admiral Rodman was able to report that [...] "the firing was exceptionally fine, most encouraging and much better than we <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> previously".|$|E

500|$|Love Always has {{received}} favorable reviews from music critics. Alex Henderson of Allmusic gave the album three stars {{out of five}} and called [...] "Love Ballad" [...] the [...] "best thing the Hailey brothers <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> – inside or outside of Jodeci". [...] Henderson called the album's ballads and slow jams [...] "above average" [...] and noted a lack of new jack swing and R-rated lyrics of the sort he had observed in Jodeci's music. He liked the songs [...] "Now and Forever", [...] "Still Waiting", and [...] "Baby Come Back" [...] and appreciated the 1970s soul music feel.|$|E
500|$|Promising Television Mail that AP Films' latest venture {{would be}} [...] "bigger {{and better than}} {{anything}} we <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> before", Gerry Anderson realised that design defects {{would not be as}} quickly forgiven in a film adaptation as on the smaller screen. Puppets from the Thunderbirds television series were therefore expertly revamped, with new paint, wigs and costumes, while models and sets such as the Thunderbird machines were re-built from scratch with greater attention to detail. During production, the AP Films puppet wardrobe had a stock of over 700 costumes, with 150 extra costumes made mainly as spares in case of damage or loss.|$|E
500|$|On July 7, 1976 at La Casa Pacifica, Nixon {{suffered}} a stroke, {{which resulted in}} the paralysis of her entire left side. Physical therapy enabled her to eventually regain all movement. She said that her recovery was [...] "the hardest thing I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> physically". In 1979, she and her husband moved to a townhouse on East 65th Street in Manhattan, New York. They lived there only briefly and in 1981 moved to a [...] house in Saddle River, New Jersey. This gave the couple additional space, and enabled them to be near their children and grandchildren. Pat, however, sustained another stroke in 1983 and two lung infections the following year.|$|E

500|$|Hoppus wrote lyrics {{dealing with}} {{breakdowns}} in communication and trust and tackled with themes {{of isolation and}} confusion, but these lyrics were not specific {{to any of the}} band's history. Hoppus struggled with writing upbeat, happy songs for the album and attributed to dark lyricism to the heavy events occurring shortly before the reunion. MTV News called Neighborhoods the [...] "bleakest thing Blink <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> haunted by specters both real — depression, addiction, loss — and imagined," [...] noting the constant lyrical mention of death in many tracks. The album mixes the electronic flourishes of +44 and the [...] "laser-light grandeur" [...] of Angels & Airwaves into what MTV News called [...] "a sound that recalls nothing so much as dark streets and black expanses, mostly of the suburban variety." ...|$|E
500|$|For his {{portrayal}} of Charles Lane in Shattered Glass, Sarsgaard won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actor and was nominated for the 2004 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sarsgaard has appeared in an eclectic range of films, including the 2004 comedy-drama Garden State, the biographical film Kinsey (2004), the drama The Dying Gaul (2005) and big-budget films such as Flightplan (2005), Jarhead (2005), Orphan (2009), An Education (2009), Knight and Day (2010), and the superhero film [...] Green Lantern (2011), Lovelace (2013), Kelly Reichardt's Night Moves (2013), Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine (2013), and Black Mass (2015). Sarsgaard also appeared in the U.S. TV series The Killing (2013) as a man on death row perhaps wrongfully convicted for the brutal murder of his wife—a performance which he says included [...] "some of the best acting I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> in my life." [...] His latest films include Experimenter, in which he stars alongside Winona Ryder, and The Magnificent Seven, in which he appears as the villain Bartholomew Bogue against Denzel Washington and the Magnificent Seven.|$|E
500|$|Hoppus {{considered}} {{the music on}} the album wide-ranging, commenting, [...] "We tried to capture the energy and not worry so much about all the knobs." [...] This includes songs he felt sounded like the group circa 1999, [...] "super-fast late-Nineties-punk-rock-sounding songs," [...] {{as well as more}} progressive songs [...] "that are like nothing we <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> before." [...] Overall, he {{considered the}} record [...] "really rich with sing-along melodies and sing-along choruses," [...] which was what he preferred most when listening to bands. Feldmann considered the music not a [...] "huge departure" [...] from the band's usual sound, as hoped to make a [...] "classic Blink record." [...] To familiarize himself, he listened to all of the band's catalogue prior to recording. Lisa Worden, music director at Los Angeles radio station KROQ, compared its sound to the second Blink-182 album, Dude Ranch, and commented, [...] "It sounds like Blink but it's not anything that we've heard before. For fans of the band, they're going to be super happy with it." ...|$|E

500|$|On 15 October 2004, New Line Cinema {{announced}} that it had bought a three-year option on the film rights to Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell. Clarke received an undisclosed [...] "seven-figure sum", making the deal [...] "one of the biggest acquisitions of film rights for a book in recent years". New Line chose Christopher Hampton, whose adaptation of Dangerous Liaisons won an Academy Award, to write it; New Line executives Mark Ordesky and Ileen Maisel were overseeing the production. On 7 November 2005, The Daily Telegraph reported that Hampton had finished the first draft: [...] "As you can imagine, it took {{a fair amount of}} time to work out some way to encapsulate that enormous book in a film of sensible length...ut it was lots of fun– and very unlike anything I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> before." [...] At that time, no director or cast had yet been chosen. As of June 2006, Hampton was still working on the screenplay. Julian Fellowes then took over writing duties before the collapse of New Line Cinema.|$|E
500|$|In April 2009, Sugababes {{travelled}} to the United States to work {{on their}} seventh studio album, Sweet 7. They signed a contract with Jay Z's record label, Roc Nation, resulting in working with high-profile produceers. [...] "Get Sexy", which was selected as the album's lead single, was written by Fred Fairbrass, Richard Fairbrass, Rob Manzoli, Philip Lawrence, Ari Levine, Bruno Mars and produced by the latter three under their stage name The Smeezingtons. Working with The Smeezingtons was described by group member Amelle Berrabah as an [...] "amazing" [...] and [...] "great opportunity". Berrabah also stated in an interview with Bang Showbiz that the song [...] "doesn't sound like anything we <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> before". On 6 July 2009, Sugababes announced the release date of [...] "Get Sexy" [...] as 31 August 2009. The song premiered on BBC Radio 1 on 7 July 2009 in a show presented by Scott Mills. In an interview for Digital Spy, Buchanan said that the response to the song was great, saying: [...] "From the beginning there's been a real buzz about the track. It's had a great response from so many people, even if they say, 'Forget about the rest of them, this one I love'." [...] Later, on 27 September 2013, Keisha Buchanan said of the Bruno Mars penned song that, [...] "I just didn't feel like that was a representation of who we were as a band but we didn't, at that point, have a lot of say." [...] However, [...] "It was amazing working with Bruno, and we'd love to work with him in this line-up" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Adrift" [...] first {{surfaced}} on February 2007, {{before the}} airing of [...] "First Strike". By March it was confirmed {{to be the}} first of a two-part opening for the fourth season along with [...] "Lifeline" [...] and would be similar in style to [...] "Progeny" [...] and [...] "The Real World". The producers kept trying {{to find new ways to}} [...] "out-do" [...] the efforts of the previous seasons, which they described was [...] "different" [...] to them, since they introduced more of a balance between team-based and character-based episodes. After the completion of [...] "First Strike", the producers thought it was the biggest episode they <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> and wondered how the fourth season would top that. During the writing stages, Martin Gero wanted the episode to [...] "tee up" [...] with the last episode of the season, and hence wanted the episode to become part of a story-arc for the entire season. Gero also wanted the episode to have [...] "no down time" [...] for the characters like the previous season premieres. After Zelenka gets injured, a scene where a Puddle Jumper was originally meant to pick them both up. However, having a Jumper set nearby in an Atlantis set would not be practical enough, and was cut. He also wrote to have Sheppard in an uneased state while forced to take command of Atlantis. The scene where McKay and Zelenka converse and finish each other's sentences were parallel to the arguing between Gero and Wood while working together on set. He considered the scene between Teyla and Weir to be the cliffhanger, but was changed to the following scene, as Gero felt that would be the better cliffhanger, similar to the one for [...] "The Return, Part 1".|$|E

500|$|McCann {{notes that}} Grant {{typically}} played [...] "wealthy privileged characters who {{never seemed to}} have any need to work {{in order to maintain}} their glamorous and hedonistic lifestyle. He became a star whose characters were good looking, quick witted, funny and athletic, a star whose characters seemed to win the hearts of women without even trying". Martin Stirling, commenting in the biography Cary Grant: In Name Only, thought that Grant had an acting range which was [...] "greater than any of his contemporaries, but understood why a number of critics underrated him as an actor. He believes that Grant was always at his [...] "physical and verbal best in situations that bordered on farce". Charles Champlin, commenting in Donald Deschner's The Complete Films of Cary Grant (1973) similarly identifies a paradox in Grant's screen persona, in his unusual ability to [...] "mix polish and pratfalls in successive scenes". He remarks that Grant was [...] "refreshingly able to play the near-fool, the fey idiot, without compromising his masculinity or surrendering to camp for its own sake. His ability to play off against his own image as the strong and handsome romantic hero-figure is, as a matter of fact, probably unique among superstars. Nobody else comes even close to mind who could similarly toy with his own dignity without losing it". Wansell further notes that Grant could, [...] "with the arch of an eyebrow or the merest hint of a smile, question his own image", managing to [...] "blend irony and romance in a way that few other stars <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> by slyly never appearing to take himself too seriously, and mixing his own unique mixture of naïveté and worldliness". Stanley Donen, a director who had worked with Grant, stated that his real [...] "magic" [...] came from his attention to minute details and always seeming real, which came from [...] "enormous amounts of work" [...] rather than being God-given. Grant remarked of his career: [...] "I guess to a certain extent I did eventually become the characters I was playing. I played at being someone I wanted to be until I became that person, Or he became me". He would later profess that the real Cary Grant was more like his scruffy, unshaven fisherman in Father Goose than the [...] "well-tailored charmer" [...] of Charade.|$|E
