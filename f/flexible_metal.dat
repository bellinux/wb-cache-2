25|$|Electrical wiring {{distributes}} {{electric power}} inside residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, mobile homes, recreational vehicles, boats, and substations at voltages up to 600 V. The {{thickness of the}} wire is based on amperage requirements in conjunction with safe operating temperatures. Solid wire is used for smaller diameters; thicker diameters are stranded to provide flexibility. Conductor types include non-metallic/non-metallic corrosion-resistant cable (two or more insulated conductors with a nonmetallic outer sheath), armored or BX cable (cables are surrounded by a <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> enclosure), metal clad cable, service entrance cable, underground feeder cable, TC cable, fire resistant cable, and mineral insulated cable, including mineral-insulated copper-clad cable. Copper is commonly used for building wire because of its conductivity, strength, and reliability. Over {{the life of a}} building wire system, copper can also be the most economical conductor.|$|E
25|$|The most {{promising}} method developed to utilize this material involves deposition of YBCO on <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> tapes coated with buffering metal oxides. This {{is known as}} coated conductor. Texture (crystal plane alignment) can be introduced into the metal tape itself (the RABiTS process) or a textured ceramic buffer layer can be deposited, {{with the aid of}} an ion beam, on an untextured alloy substrate (the IBAD process). Subsequent oxide layers prevent diffusion of the metal from the tape into the superconductor while transferring the template for texturing the superconducting layer. Novel variants on CVD, PVD, and solution deposition techniques are used to produce long lengths of the final YBCO layer at high rates. Companies pursuing these processes include American Superconductor, Superpower (a division of Furukawa Electric), Sumitomo, Fujikura, Nexans Superconductors, and European Advanced Superconductors. A much larger number of research institutes have also produced YBCO tape by these methods.|$|E

2500|$|In typesetting, it is {{sometimes}} necessary to use characters that are uncommon or obscure enough {{that it does not}} make sense to assign them to a magazine channel. These characters are referred to as pi characters or sorts ("pi" [...] in this case refers to an obscure printer's term relating to loose or spilled type). Footnote marks, rarely used fractions, and mathematical symbols are examples of pi characters. In the linotype machine, a pi matrix has all teeth present (code127, no teeth cut away) so it will not drop from the distributor bar and will not be released into either the main or the auxiliary magazine. Instead, it travels {{all the way to the}} end and into the <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> tube called the pi chute and is then lined up in the sorts stacker.

2500|$|An aneroid {{barometer}} is {{an instrument for}} measuring pressure as a method that does not involve liquid. Invented in 1844 by French scientist Lucien Vidi, the {{aneroid barometer}} uses a small, <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> box called an aneroid cell (capsule), which is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper. The evacuated capsule (or usually several capsules, stacked to add up their movements) is prevented from collapsing by a strong spring. Small changes in external air pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. [...] This expansion and contraction drives mechanical levers such that the tiny movements of the capsule are amplified and displayed {{on the face of}} the aneroid barometer. [...] Many models include a manually set needle which is used to mark the current measurement so a change can be seen. [...] In addition, the mechanism is made deliberately [...] "stiff" [...] so that tapping the barometer reveals whether the pressure is rising or falling as the pointer moves. This type of barometer is common in homes and in recreational boats, as well as small aircraft. It is also used in meteorology, mostly in barographs and as a pressure instrument in radiosondes.|$|E
2500|$|Pendulums {{in clocks}} (see example at right) are usually {{made of a}} weight or bob (b) [...] {{suspended}} by a rod of wood or metal (a). [...] To reduce air resistance (which accounts {{for most of the}} energy loss in precision clocks) [...] the bob is traditionally a smooth disk with a lens-shaped cross section, although in antique clocks it often had carvings or decorations specific to the type of clock. In quality clocks the bob is made as heavy as the suspension can support and the movement can drive, since this improves the regulation of the clock (see Accuracy below). A common weight for seconds pendulum bobs is [...] [...] Instead of hanging from a , clock pendulums are usually supported by a short straight spring (d) of <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> ribbon. This avoids the friction and 'play' caused by a pivot, and the slight bending force of the spring merely adds to the pendulum's restoring force. A few precision clocks have pivots of 'knife' blades resting on agate plates. The impulses to keep the pendulum swinging are provided by an arm hanging behind the pendulum called the crutch, (e), which ends in a fork, (f) whose prongs embrace the pendulum rod. The crutch is pushed back and forth by the clock's escapement, (g,h).|$|E

As part of an on-going effort {{to learn how to}} tune the properties of these systems with ion implantation, we present a study of the electrical properties of these systems prior to metal mixing. We show that the electrical properties of tin-antimony thin films are remarkably robust to variations in the substrate morphology. We demonstrate that the optical absorbance of the films at a fixed wavelength provides a reliable and reproducible characterization of the relative film thickness. We find that as the film thickness is reduced, the superconducting transition in the unimplanted thin films is broadened, but the onset of the transition remains at ~ 3. 7 K, the transition temperature of bulk Sn. This is in marked contrast to the behavior of metal mixed films, which suggests that the metal mixing process has a significant effect on the physics of the superconducting state beyond that achieved by reducing the film thickness alone...|$|R
