40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} our {{design and}} implementation of an augmented table interface for small group meetings. The system {{was designed to be}} used by multiple users in the ubiquitous environment, where people do not need to bring their laptop PCs. With effective use of the advantage of computer vision, we implemented the concept of ubiquitous desktop as personal workspace and virtual Chinese table as shared workspace. User can share/personalize files by <b>drag-and-dropping</b> icons to/from the shared workspace. The system also provides capabilities for interactive image capturing and finger position sharing, both of which would be useful for the group meetings. ...|$|R
25|$|The website {{received}} a visual overhaul in 2014 that {{gave it a}} completely new look and improved performance. It also simplified {{some of the most}} common tasks, such as clicking only once on a file to see recent activity or share the file, and added <b>drag-and-drop</b> functionality, where users can simply drag selected files to folders, for improved organization.|$|E
25|$|OLE 2.0 was {{the next}} {{evolution}} of OLE, sharing {{many of the same}} goals as version 1.0, but was re-implemented on top of the Component Object Model (COM) instead of using VTBLs directly. New features were OLE automation, <b>drag-and-drop,</b> in-place activation and structured storage. Monikers evolved from OLE 1 object names, and provided a hierarchical object and resource naming system similar to URLs or URIs, which were independently invented. Windows now has merged the two technologies supporting a URL Moniker type, and a Moniker URL scheme.|$|E
25|$|Users of Windows Photo Gallery, Apple's iPhoto (version 8), Adobe's Lightroom 3.2, Apple's Aperture (version 3.0), and darktable {{have the}} ability to upload their photos {{directly}} to Flickr. They can also automatically update their status on other Social networking service when they upload their images to Flickr. Flickr provides a desktop client for Mac OS X and Windows that allows users to upload photos without using the web interface. Uploadr allows <b>drag-and-drop</b> batch uploading of photos, the setting of tags and descriptions for each batch, and the editing of privacy settings.|$|E
40|$|Data mining is a {{technique}} used to uncover previously unknown and potentially useful knowledge from large datasets. It turns data into actionable information for better decision making. Delphi incorporates a collection of high-performance data-analysis components known as the Decision Cube. The Decision Cube offers an easy path to powerful data analysis in an application. This paper describes a simple approach for data mining using the Decision Cube components of Delphi. It requires only some <b>drag-and-dropping</b> and property-setting, with no need for manual coding. It does not require special knowledge of data mining. At the end, an example is offered...|$|R
40|$|Current {{programming}} environments use textual or symbolic representations. While these representations {{are appropriate}} for describing logical processes, they are not appropriate for representing raw values such as human and robot posture data, which are necessary for handling gesture input and controlling robots. To address this issue, we propose Picode, a text-based development environment augmented with inline visual representations: photos of human and robots. With Picode, the user first takes a photo to bind it to posture data. She then <b>drag-and-drops</b> the photo into the code editor, where it is displayed as an inline image. A preliminary user study revealed positive effects of taking photos on the programming experience...|$|R
30|$|Another {{branch of}} {{research}} has focused on the development and evaluation of ebooks. Substantial part of research on ebooks focuses on analyzing how students and instructors use the standard ebook features, like table of contents, navigation options, bookmarks, etc. (Chong et al. 2009), as well as comparing students’ experiences with ebooks versus traditional printed books. This research falls out of scope of our work, because it does not consider interactive elements in the book contents. However, within the domain of computer science education, an increasing volume of research focuses on ebooks enriched by various kinds of smart content (Alvarado et al. 2012; Ericson et al. 2015 a,, 2016; Fouh et al. 2014; Sirkiä and Sorva 2015). Among the types of smart content used in these ebooks are CodeLens program visualizations, ActiveCode widgets for editing and executing code, and Parson’s problems, i.e., constructing code by <b>drag-and-dropping</b> code lines into the correct order. These types of smart content are based on the technologies developed by Ihantola and Karavirta (2011); Guo (2013); Miller and Ranum (2012).|$|R
25|$|The WIMP {{interface}} {{is based}} around a stacking window manager and incorporates three mouse buttons (named Select, Menu and Adjust), context-sensitive menus, window order control (i.e. send to back) and dynamic window focus (a window can have input focus at any {{position on the}} stack). The icon bar (Dock) holds icons which represent mounted disc drives, RAM discs, running applications, system utilities and docked: Files, Directories or inactive Applications. These icons have context-sensitive menus and support <b>drag-and-drop</b> behaviour. They represent the running application as a whole, irrespective of whether it has open windows.|$|E
25|$|The GUI is centred {{around the}} concept of files. The Filer, a spatial file manager, {{displays}} {{the contents of a}} disc. Applications are run from the Filer view and files can be dragged to the Filer view from applications to perform saves. Application directories are used to store applications. The OS differentiates them from normal directories {{through the use of a}} pling (exclamation mark, also called shriek) prefix. Double-clicking on such a directory launches the application rather than opening the directory. The application's executable files and resources are contained within the directory, but normally they remain hidden from the user. Because applications are self-contained, this allows <b>drag-and-drop</b> installation and removal.|$|E
25|$|The website {{supports}} <b>drag-and-drop</b> capabilities, one-click editing, plain-language event adding, as well {{as unique}} features aimed towards social networkers. Calendars can contain feeds from Twitter, Blogger, MySpace, Facebook, WordPress, Vox, and Upcoming.org, which generates a social timeline listing all of a user's recent online activity. Users can also import and export data as ics or csv files, or as an RSS feed. The website includes a plain-language event adding feature, which allows users to type phrases such as “Drinks with Richard, tomorrow, 7-9pm, Flute and Whistle”. The website then translates the phrase into an event, determining the location, time, date, and description. Users can add buddies and share calendars with them. 30 Boxes features a simple webtop, which summarizes daily appointments and to-do items. Users can also add applets to the page, such as Google search, Yahoo! Mail, and Google Calendar, a competing online calendar service. 30 Boxes also offers a mobile version of their calendar.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} web-based visual graph {{analytics}} platform for interactive graph mining, visualization, and real-time exploration of networks. GraphVis is fast, intuitive, and flexible, combining interactive visualizations with analytic techniques to reveal important patterns and insights for sense making, reasoning, and decision making. Networks can be visualized and explored within seconds by simply <b>drag-and-dropping</b> a graph file into the web browser. The structure, properties, {{and patterns of}} the network are computed automatically and can be instantly explored in real-time. At the heart of GraphVis lies a multi-level interactive network visualization and analytics engine that allows for real-time graph mining and exploration across multiple levels of granularity simultaneously. Both the graph analytic and visualization techniques (at each level of granularity) are dynamic and interactive, with immediate and continuous visual feedback upon every user interaction (e. g., change of a slider for filtering). Furthermore, nodes, edges, and subgraphs are easily inserted, deleted or exported via a number of novel techniques and tools that make it extremely easy and flexible for exploring, testing hypothesis, and understanding networks in real-time over the web. A number of interactive visual graph analytic techniques are also proposed including interactive role discovery methods, community detection, {{as well as a}} number of novel block models for generating graphs with community structure. Finally, we also highlight other key aspects including filtering, querying, ranking, manipulating, exporting, partitioning, as well as tools for dynamic network analysis and visualization, interactive graph generators, and a variety of multi-level network analysis, summarization, and statistical techniques...|$|R
40|$|A tritium {{permeation}} analyses code (TPAC) {{has been developed}} by Idaho National Laboratory {{for the purpose of}} analyzing tritium distributions in the VHTR systems including integrated hydrogen production systems. A MATLAB SIMULINK software package was used for development of the code. The TPAC is based on the mass balance equations of tritium-containing species and a various form of hydrogen (i. e., HT, H 2, HTO, HTSO 4, and TI) coupled with a variety of tritium source, sink, and permeation models. In the TPAC, ternary fission and neutron reactions with 6 Li, 7 Li 10 B, 3 He were taken into considerations as tritium sources. Purification and leakage models were implemented as main tritium sinks. Permeation of HT and H 2 through pipes, vessels, and heat exchangers were importantly considered as main tritium transport paths. In addition, electroyzer and isotope exchange models were developed for analyzing hydrogen production systems including both high-temperature electrolysis and sulfur-iodine process. The TPAC has unlimited flexibility for the system configurations, and provides easy <b>drag-and-drops</b> for making models by adopting a graphical user interface. Verification of the code has been performed by comparisons with the analytical solutions and the experimental data based on the Peach Bottom reactor design. The preliminary results calculated with a former tritium analyses code, THYTAN which was developed in Japan and adopted by Japan Atomic Energy Agency were also compared with the TPAC solutions. This report contains descriptions of the basic tritium pathways, theory, simple user guide, verifications, sensitivity studies, sample cases, and code tutorials. Tritium behaviors in a very high temperature reactor/high temperature steam electrolysis system have been analyzed by the TPAC based on the reference indirect parallel configuration proposed by Oh et al. (2007). This analysis showed that only 0. 4 % of tritium released from the core is transferred to the product hydrogen. The amount of tritium in the product hydrogen was estimated to be approximately an order less than the gaseous effluent limit for tritium...|$|R
