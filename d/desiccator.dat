2500|$|The {{restoration}} of the vase began in June 1988, and was filmed by the BBC History and Archaeology Unit. Deconstruction of the vase was achieved by wrapping it inside and out with blotting paper and letting it sit in a glass <b>desiccator</b> injected with solvents for three days, {{at the end of}} which it was separated into 189 pieces. After removing the remnants of the old adhesive and cleaning the fragments, an epoxy adhesive, Hxtal NYL, was used in conjunction with an acrylic resin to join the pieces. Although efforts were made to avoid [...] "trap-outs", where the placing of a fragment prevents the next from fitting in, Williams and Smith left for Christmas in 1988 [...] "not knowing whether they would be able to fit the last few shards without having to dismantle six months' work." [...] These fears proved unfounded; [...] "fter several weeks of assembling and reassembling the top half of the Vase, the final fragment of rim dropped in and fitted perfectly." [...] At the end of nine months' work, only 17 minuscule fragments remained unplaced, rather than the 34 that were omitted from the previous restoration. After filling in the cracks with coloured resin, Williams gave his verdict: [...] "It's OK... ruined my Christmas." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{method for}} the successful ex vivo propagation of P. falciparum described culture of the parasite under static conditions (Trager-Jensen method). James B. Jensen joined Trager’s laboratory as a post-doctoral fellow in 1976. [...] He decided to employ a candlejar instead of the [...] incubator. In the summer of 1976 Milton Friedman, {{a graduate student in}} the Trager lab who was working in the MRC laboratories in The Gambia, arranged for a sample of human blood infected with P. falciparum to be sent to New York City. This was diluted with RPMI 1640 (which {{turned out to be the}} best of the commercial media) in Petri dishes, placed in a candlejar and incubated. The line grew very well and became FCR-3/Gambia, one of the most widely used strains. Later, other lines would be established using similar methods and the impact of continuous cultivation of P. falciparum was phenomenal especially for the testing of putative antimalarials and for deciphering its genes. A number of subsequent reports (from as far back as the early 1980s), showed that cell suspension (using a shaking-incubator) significantly increased culture growth. Continuous agitation has also been shown to improve other parameters of culture growth relevant to researchers, such as the prolongation of culture synchrony after synchronization procedures, and a reduction of the rate of multiple infections. [...] Despite this, the practice of culturing the parasite under static conditions remains widespread. The greatest value of the candlejar method is that it can be used in laboratories almost anywhere in the world where there is an incubator, a candle and a <b>desiccator.</b> Around 60% parasitized cells can be obtained using optimized culturing conditions. Recent studies of P. falciparum isolated directly from infected patients indicate that alternative parasite biological states occur in the natural host that are not observed with ex vivo cultivated parasites.|$|E
50|$|<b>Desiccators</b> are {{sealable}} enclosures containing desiccants {{used for}} preserving moisture-sensitive {{items such as}} cobalt chloride paper for another use.

30|$|Dry {{seeds of}} rice genotypes were {{subjected}} to a standardized accelerated ageing treatment of 45 °C with 100 % relative humidity for 6  days.

30|$|Different salt {{solutions}} and distilled water {{were used to}} control the relative humidity to which eggs and adult beetles were exposed. As indicated by Winston and Bates (1960), Roca and Lazzari (1994) andDambach and Goehlen (1999), acid or inorganic (non-volatile) salt solutions were adequate for this purpose, as their water vapour pressure remained constant for long periods. The liquids used to establish the relative humidities were distilled water, saturated solutions of Potassium acetae (CH 3 CO 2 K), Sodium iodide (NaI), Sodium bromide (NaBr), Sodium chloride (NaCl) and Potassium chloride (KCl). The relative humidity was obtained by filling solutions {{at the bottom of}} <b>desiccators</b> and monitored using a digital thermohygrometer. Throughout the study, investigation on reproductive parameters and egg hatchability were carried out in Petri dishes kept in <b>desiccators</b> corresponding to each relative humidity and hermetically closed.

50|$|Materials:Obtain {{a sample}} of mixed liquor. Transfer the sample into a {{laboratory}} in order to analyze it. Measure the volume weight of the sample. Remove two filter papers from a <b>desiccator</b> and record the weight of each. Place the filter holder on a vacuum flask and then place another filter {{on top of the}} filter holder by using a pair of tweezers. Stir the sample of mixed liquor {{in order to get a}} good mixture for the experiment. After sample is mixed, pour 5 mL into a graduated cylinder. Turn on the vacuum pump and pour the sample into the filter holder. After all the mixed liquor has gone through, run three portions of 10 mL distilled water through the filter holder to rinse any particles that may have stuck to the glass. Allow the vacuum pump to run an additional three minutes. This will help remove any extra water from the filter before drying. Switch the vacuum pump off and remove the filter from the filter holder and place in the corresponding weighing dish. Repeat above process for as many trials as needed. Place the filter(s) into a drying oven, which is set to 103°-105° C, for one hour. Upon drying, replace filters into a <b>desiccator</b> for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes in the <b>desiccator,</b> the filters are to be weighed.|$|E

50|$|Often {{some sort}} of {{humidity}} indicator {{is included in the}} <b>desiccator</b> to show, by color changes, the level of humidity.
