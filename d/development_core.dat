R is named partly after the first names {{of the first two}} R authors and partly as a play on the name of S. The project was conceived in 1992, with an initial version released in 1995 and a stable beta version in 2000.|$|E
50|$|The main R {{implementation}} {{is written}} in R, C, and Fortran, {{and there are several}} other implementations aimed at improving speed or increasing extensibility. A closely related implementation is pqR (pretty quick R) by Radford M. Neal with improved memory management and support for automatic multithreading. Renjin and FastR are Java implementations of R for use in a Java Virtual Machine. CXXR, rho, and Riposte are implementations of R in C++. Renjin, Riposte, and pqR attempt to improve performance by using multiple processor cores and some form of deferred evaluation. Most of these alternative implementations are experimental and incomplete, with relatively few users, compared to the main implementation maintained by the R <b>Development</b> <b>Core</b> Team.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{procedures}} designed to determine the optimal number of factors to retain in EFA. These include Kaiser's (1960) eigenvalue-greater-than-one rule (or K1 rule), Cattell's (1966) scree plot, Revelle and Rocklin's (1979) very simple structure criterion, model comparison techniques, Raiche, Roipel, and Blais's (2006) acceleration factor and optimal coordinates, Velicer's (1976) minimum average partial, Horn's (1965) parallel analysis, and Ruscio and Roche's (2012) comparison data. However, more recent simulation studies concerning the robustness of such techniques suggests that the latter five can assist practitioners to more judiciously model data. These five modern techniques are now easily accessible through integrated use of IBM SPSS Statistics software (SPSS) and R (R <b>Development</b> <b>Core</b> Team, 2011). See Courtney (2013) for guidance on how to carry out these procedures for continuous, ordinal, and heterogenous (continuous and ordinal) data.|$|E
50|$|Transport, and {{the railway}} in particular, {{had a huge}} impact on the {{development}} of Thornton Heath. The junction at the Pond was always going to command attention as a <b>development</b> <b>core,</b> due to the level of traffic that passed along the Sussex road. But it was the railway in the eastern district that became the more important catalyst to growth. An act was made in 1837 to drain the Croydon canal and convert the basin into the first proper suburban line from the City. As most of the cutting work was already done, it opened within two years. In 1851, the newly formed London and Brighton railway company planned to link London's West End to this line as part of a new service to the south coast. The most obvious place for a junction with the City's line was about 1 mi respectively to the north of Croydon and to the east of Thornton Heath, where the existing track split into the Brighton line and the Epsom line. The added advantage here was that a connection would form a commuter arc around south London between the West End and City. As a fairly level landscape is required for traction, and to avoid time-consuming and expensive cuttings, viaducts and tunnels, the most direct route was along the valleys of the Wandle and Graveney, via Wandsworth and Streatham, and straight through the eastern district of Thornton Heath.|$|E
