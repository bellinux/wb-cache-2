Chance finds, primarily marble funerary sculpture, are displayed in the Archaeological Collection in Chora (open Tues.-Sun.). The most impressive ancient monument is the (Άσπρος Πύργος), a Hellenistic marble watchtower (c. 300 BC) with walls preserved to 2 m. and an interior staircase, standing on a hilltop just east of the road from Chora to Mega Livadi, near Mega Chorio. Work began in 2011 to study the fallen blocks for an eventual reconstruction.|$|E
40|$|The Xerces Society hereby {{formally}} petitions the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to {{list the}} <b>island</b> <b>marble</b> butterfly, Euchloe ausonides insulanus, as endangered pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 16 U. S. C. § 1531 et seq. This petition is filed under 5 U. S. C. § 553 (e), 16 U. S. C. § 1533 (b) (3), and 50 C. F. R. § 424. 14 (1990), which grants interested parties the right to petition for issuance of a rule from the Secretary of the Interior. Petitioners also request that critical habitat be designated concurrent with the listing, as required by 16 U. S. C. § 1533 (b) (6) (C) and 50 C. F. R. § 424. 12, and pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U. S. C. § 553). Due {{to the threat of}} extinction and because of its small population size, restricted distribution, and the numerous factors threatening the species and its remaining habitat, we request an emergency listing and emergency critical habitat designation pursuant to 16 U. S. C. § 1533 (b) (7) and 50 C. F. R. § 424. 20. While the species is emergency listed, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service should finalize a standard listing rule for the <b>island</b> <b>marble</b> butterfly. <b>Island</b> <b>marble</b> is among the most imperiled North American butterflies, already extirpated from Canada and known in the United States from just two small islands (San Juan and Lopez) in northwest Washington.

5000|$|<b>Marble</b> <b>Island</b> is bare rock, located {{above the}} treeline, {{and with only}} a small amount of plant life, {{primarily}} lichens and mosses. Thus, there is only a limited amount of territorial wildlife, primary the polar bear, the Arctic fox, the Arctic hare, and lemmings. A large variety of birds visit the island, including ducks, raptors, and unidentified [...] "small brown birds". A great number of sea mammals can be found nearby, including several kinds of cetaceans (e.g. bowhead whales, orcas, narwhals, and belugas) and seals. Due to the large amount of oceanic life, <b>Marble</b> <b>Island</b> is a traditional summer hunting ground for the Inuit.|$|R

50|$|Alva Vanderbilt married Oliver Belmont on January 11, 1896, {{following}} her divorce from William Kissam Vanderbilt in March 1895. Alva {{had received a}} large settlement from the divorce, but the Long Island estate that she had helped design with Richard Morris Hunt, Idle Hour, was retained by William. Although the Belmonts already had two summerhouses in Newport, Rhode <b>Island,</b> Alva's <b>Marble</b> House and Oliver's Belcourt Castle, they desired a new estate on Long Island. Brookholt was the result.|$|R
5000|$|In 1721, Captain Knight and {{his crew}} were on <b>Marble</b> <b>Island,</b> located 32 km from today's Rankin Inlet. [...] It is {{possible}} the ships encountered the shallows of the local waters and were wrecked, although {{they were able to}} successfully offload large quantities of coal, several cannons and provisions. There is evidence of interaction with the local Inuit, but by 1722 Knight {{and his crew}} were reported to have perished from sickness and famine. Apparently, the Hudson's Bay Company post at Churchill, Manitoba was completely unaware of the shipwreck, as no search or rescue expedition was ever sent. The ruins of Knight's settlement on <b>Marble</b> <b>Island</b> was discovered in 1768 by company explorer Samuel Hearne.|$|R
50|$|<b>Marble</b> <b>Island</b> is one {{of several}} {{uninhabited}} Canadian arctic islands in Nunavut, Canada, located within western Hudson Bay. The closest community is Rankin Inlet. During the age of sail, this island was valued as a harbour for overwintering in the Arctic Ocean.|$|R

The western shore of the lake sees the Academic ridge rise again above the water in the form of Olkhon Island, which is part of Pribaykalsky National Park. The Ushkany are an archipelago four islands totaling 10 km2 in area. They are famous as the central home of the Baikal Seal. The <b>islands</b> are <b>marble</b> and limestone, and contain caves with evidence of human habitation from the Neolithic age.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} ship Discovery, captained by David Vaughan, the {{expedition}} set off from England in 1719. They were shipwrecked near <b>Marble</b> <b>Island</b> and took refuge there in either 1719 or 1720. Everyone who came ashore there died. The remains of the settlement were not discovered until 1768 when Samuel Hearne, a HBC explorer located them on the island.|$|R
50|$|Grey Court (aka Tenney Castle) {{designed}} by Carrère and Hastings, prominent New York architects, was {{the centerpiece of}} Charles Tenney's 75 acre rolling estate Fair View Park. Begun in 1890 and completed two years later, the mansion was modeled after Château d'Yquem, the ancestral seat of Montaigne, and served as the Tenney family's summer home. Ernest W. Bowditch designed the grounds. He had laid out several estates in Newport, Rhode <b>Island,</b> including <b>Marble</b> House, W. K. Vanderbilt's estate; designed Tuxedo Park in New York; and landscaped Colgate University. His designs for Greycourt's surrounds won a prestigious horticultural prize in 1902. The remains are now a Massachusetts state park.|$|R
5|$|Humpback whales {{have been}} sighted {{in the lower}} region of Glacier Bay; also in Sitakaday Narrows, Whidbey Passage and the waters around South <b>Marble</b> <b>Island.</b> For kayakers, Hugh Miller Inlet and the Beardslee Islands are good {{locations}} to see humpback whales {{from a safe distance}} of about a quarter mile. Other marine whales sighted are grey, minke, fin, and killer whales (orcas).|$|R
50|$|Between 1870 and 1887, <b>Marble</b> <b>Island</b> was a {{very popular}} site for {{northern}} whalers, but by 1890 was completely abandoned: few whales could be found nearby, and ice conditions grew treacherous. Before it was abandoned, the whaling ship Orray Taft sank nearby: her sailors occupy several graves on the island. This was {{a major factor in}} the creation of the island's nickname, Deadman's Island.|$|R
50|$|Seh Amongrogo and Nyi Tembangraras, {{within their}} incorporeal world, made {{a journey to}} Banten, West Java. They arrived at a dreadful beach {{therefore}} he changed it into a tranquil one. He then built an island made of black marble, filled it with precious stones, built a house and stayed there with his wife. It wasn't long before the news of an <b>island</b> of black <b>marble</b> reached a powerful man from Sumatra Island, Ki Datuk. He confronted Seh Amongrogo by put him into test. If indeed Amongrogo is a generous figure, he won't say no to whatever Ki Datuk is asking, even asking for his wife. To Ki Datuk's surprise, Amongrogo gave away his wife. Tembangraras and Ki Datuk's ship was ready on sail returning to Sumatra {{but in the middle}} of the ocean, the weather became fierce and the ship sank. Ki Datuk and his sailors was being rescued and they arrived back home empty handed.

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, mining {{companies}} exploited the island's Zinc-lead rich calamine ores, with a yield of around 2 million tonnes, and a processing plant at Limenaria produced zinc oxide. Iron ore was mined on a significant scale from 1954 to 1964, with a yield of around 3 million tonnes. Since 1964, surveys have established {{the existence of}} a deep-level zinc-lead deposit, but the only mining activity on the <b>island</b> has been <b>marble</b> quarrying.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} {{channeling}} through {{what had been}} West 222nd and 223rd streets was to physically isolate Marble Hill on the Bronx side of the new strait. In 1914 the original creekbed was filled in with rock from the excavation for the foundation of Grand Central Terminal; and the temporary <b>island,</b> comprising present-day <b>Marble</b> Hill, became physically attached to the Bronx, though it remained politically part of the borough of Manhattan, as it is today.|$|R
6000|$|Marble, himself, was {{not much}} among us all this time. He rather complained that I should leave him nothing to do, though I {{could see he was}} touched by the {{interest}} we manifested in his welfare. The French launch had been used as the means of conveyance between the wreck and the beach, and we found it where it had been left by its original owners, anchored to-leeward of the island, and abreast of the ship. It was the last thing I meddled with and it was my care to put it in such a state that, at need, it might be navigated across that tranquil sea, to some other <b>island,</b> should <b>Marble</b> feel a desire to abandon his solitude.
