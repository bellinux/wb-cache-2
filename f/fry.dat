5|$|A French <b>fry</b> {{vending machine}} is a vending machine that {{dispenses}} hot French fries, {{also known as}} chips. The first known french <b>fry</b> vending machine was developed circa 1982 by the defunct Precision <b>Fry</b> Foods Pty Ltd. in Australia. A few companies have developed and manufactured French <b>fry</b> vending machines and prototypes. Furthermore, a prototype machine was also developed at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June 1874 the Victoria Rooms {{hosted a}} meeting to promote what was {{described}} as a College of Science and Literature for the West of England and South Wales, which became University College, Bristol, an educational institution which existed from 1876 to 1909. It was the predecessor institution to the University of Bristol, which gained a Royal Charter in 1909. The meeting was attended by the then President of the British Association and Sir William Thompson (later Lord Kelvin). This meeting {{has been described as a}} partial success, as it gained the support of Albert <b>Fry</b> and Lewis <b>Fry,</b> members of the influential <b>Fry</b> family (the <b>Fry</b> name being known for the chocolate business set up by their grandfather and developed by their father Joseph Storrs <b>Fry).</b> Lewis <b>Fry</b> was a Quaker, lawyer and later a Liberal and Unionist Member of Parliament from 1885–1892 and 1895-1890 for the constituency Bristol North. In 1898 the third congress of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was held at the rooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{now defunct}} Australian company Precision <b>Fry</b> Foods Pty Ltd. {{designed}} {{the first known}} French <b>fry</b> vending machine, named Mr. French <b>Fry.</b> The company registered the design with the Australian government in January 1982. The machine cooked hot chips within 60 seconds, and operated using three AUD $0.20 coins. A salt packet was included underneath the cup that the chips were served in.|$|E

5|$|After hatching, {{the larvae}} spend another 72 hours absorb their yolk sacs and {{developing}} their fins {{before they become}} free-swimming <b>fry.</b> The <b>fry</b> forage during daylight in a dense school {{and return to the}} cave or crevice for the night. Like other cichlids, the parents retrieve their young just before dark, sucking up three or four at a time and delivering them into the nest. The parents anticipate night, using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as night approached {{even in the absence of}} any signal, such as dimming light. During the night, the <b>fry</b> bunch up at the bottom of the cave or nest, where the parents fan them.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1896 tour, the English {{authorities}} realised action {{had to be}} taken. Jim Phillips, an Australian-born umpire who journeyed {{each year}} between his native country and England, travelled to Australia with an English touring team in 1897–98. During two of the matches he umpired, Phillips no-balled Ernie Jones for throwing. Upon returning to England for the 1898 season, Phillips also called C. B. <b>Fry,</b> a prominent amateur cricketer and all-round sportsman, for throwing. This was the second of three occasions in 1898 that <b>Fry</b> was no-balled. Other umpires, following Phillips' lead, no-balled <b>Fry</b> and Frank Hopkins. Two further bowlers, albeit not famous cricketers, were called for throwing in 1899.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{industrial}} <b>frying</b> {{systems are}} not optimised towards homogeneous product quality, which is partly related to poor oil distribution across the packed bed of <b>fries.</b> In this study we investigate an alternative <b>frying</b> system with an oil cross-flow from bottom to top through a packed bed of <b>fries.</b> Fluidization of rectangular <b>fries</b> during <b>frying</b> was characterised with a modified Ergun equation. Mixing was visualized by using two coloured layers of <b>fries</b> and quantified in terms of mixing entropy. Smaller <b>fries</b> mixed quickly during <b>frying,</b> while longer <b>fries</b> exhibited much less mixing, which was attributed to the higher minimum fluidization velocity and slower dehydration for longer <b>fries.</b> The cross-flow velocity was found an important parameter for the homogeneity of the moisture content of <b>fries.</b> Increased oil velocities positively affected moisture distribution due to a higher oil refresh rate. However, inducing fluidization caused the moisture distribution to become unpredictable due to bed instabilities. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{repeated}} deep <b>frying</b> of potatoes versus repeated heating/quenching on the chemical profile of palm oil was investigated. The novelty {{of the work}} is that the <b>frying</b> and heating/quenching experiments were conducted under similar time-temperature profiles. The effects of the <b>frying</b> load (potato-to-oil ratio: 1 / 7 and 1 / 35 kgpotatoes/loil) and of the time-temperature profile were examined. Whole palm oil and its polar fraction were analyzed using high pressure size exclusion chromatography. Both repeated <b>frying</b> and repeated heating/quenching generated polar and polymerization products in palm oil. Interestingly, no hydrolysis or other decomposition products were generated under any of the examined conditions. The presence of potatoes during <b>frying</b> in palm oil increased the concentration of polymerization products and polar compounds compared to oils without potatoes significantly. The effects of <b>frying</b> load on oil quality depended on <b>frying</b> time. No significant effect of <b>frying</b> load was observed up to <b>frying</b> times of 13 h (or 10 <b>frying</b> batches). However, <b>frying</b> oil quality was affected by <b>frying</b> load once <b>frying</b> times exceeded 24 h (or 20 batches) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} {{was performed to}} assess the alterations in fatty acid profiles for hammour fish fillets lipid and refined sunflower (RSF) oil, <b>frying</b> oil medium and to evaluate the formation extent of some harmful compounds including malonaldehyde, polar compounds, oxidized and trans fatty acids in the former lipids throughout intermittent deep-fat <b>frying</b> process. The obtained results revealed that intermittent <b>frying</b> process caused a significant alteration in the fatty acid profiles of hammour fish lipid and <b>frying</b> oil medium due to the exchange of lipid occurs throughout <b>frying</b> process between <b>frying</b> oil medium and <b>fried</b> fish lipid and to the oxidative degradation of unsaturated and some saturated long chain fatty acids resulting {{in the formation of}} saturated short and medium chain fatty acids. In addition, the intermittent <b>frying</b> conditions encouraged the formation of tested harmful compounds in hammour fish fillets and RSF oil at exceptional high levels, especially with extending the repeating use period of <b>frying</b> oil medium. Therefore, the present results are recommended that the repeating use period of <b>frying</b> oil medium throughout intermittent <b>frying</b> process should not exceed 16 hours to avoid the formation of harmful compounds in <b>fried</b> foods and <b>frying</b> oil medium at hazardous and toxic levels.
