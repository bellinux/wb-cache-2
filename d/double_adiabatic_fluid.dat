40|$|Hydrodynamics is the {{low-energy}} {{effective field}} theory of any interacting quantum theory, capturing the long-wavelength fluctuations of an equilibrium Gibbs density matrix.

However, not all currents allowed by symmetry are physically acceptable; one has to ensure that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied on all physical configurations.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new theoretical and numerical {{framework of the}} magnetohydrodynamic simulation incorporated with an anisotropic pressure tensor, which {{can play an important}} role in a collisionless plasma. A classical approach to handle the anisotropy is based on the <b>double</b> <b>adiabatic</b> approximation assuming that a pressure tensor is well described only by the components parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field. This gyrotropic assumption, however, fails around a magnetically neutral region, where the cyclotron period may get comparable to or even longer than a dynamical time in a system, and causes a singularity in the mathematical expression. In this paper, we demonstrate that this singularity can be completely removed away by the combination of direct use of the 2 nd-moment of the Vlasov equation and an ingenious gyrotropization model. Numerical tests also verify that the present model properly reduces to the standard MHD or the <b>double</b> <b>adiabatic</b> formulation in an asymptotic manner under an appropriate limit.

40|$|Kinetic {{mechanisms}} {{for the growth}} and saturation of the mirror instability are described using one-dimensional hybrid simulations. Two parameter regimes are considered. In the first regime, a relatively small ion anisotropy excites a slowly growing instability that produces small-amplitude waves; most ions respond to the waves as an <b>adiabatic</b> <b>fluid.</b> In the second regime a large anisotropy excites a rapidly growing instability that generates large-amplitude waves; the response of many ions {{in this case is}} nonadiabatic. The difference in ion response is due to the relative importance of two ion populations, resonant and nonresonant. Resonant ions, those ions with low velocities parallel to the background magnetic field, contribute to the growth of the instability {{as a result of their}} gyrointeractions with the noncoplanar component of the waves electric field and respond to the mirror waves nonadiabatically. Nonreasonant ions, those with large parallel velocities, respond as an <b>adiabatic</b> <b>fluid.</b> In both regimes, ion anisotropy is reduced by means of the magnetic mirror force; in the second regime, the anisotropy reduction reduces the free energy available for wave growth and leads to the saturation of the mirror instability...|$|R
