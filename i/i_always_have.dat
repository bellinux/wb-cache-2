500|$|Azaria has voiced Frink {{ever since}} the first {{appearance}} of the professor. Out of the many characters for which Azaria provides the voice, Frink is his favorite to do {{because he was a}} fan of Lewis in his younger years and he enjoys imitating the voice of the nutty professor. He has said that [...] "once you start talking like [...] it’s very hard to stop. On each take, I’ll make it sillier, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have.</b> I’ll add more and more stupid noises and sounds to it. If they let me keep going, it gets ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|The mixed fanbase {{reaction}} did {{not surprise}} Lucas, who {{was familiar with}} mixed response to the Star Wars prequels, and predicted that [...] "we're all going to get people throwing tomatoes at us." [...] David Koepp said: [...] "I knew I {{was going to get}} hammered from a number of quarters [...] what I liked about the way the movie ended up playing was it was popular with families. I like that families really embraced it." [...] Although Spielberg said [...] "I'm very happy with the movie. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> been", he also said [...] "I sympathise with people who didn't like the MacGuffin [...] because I never liked the MacGuffin." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the scene}} where the boys are talking to Chef, he leaves without {{answering}} the boys' sexual question, angrily saying, [...] "Dammit, children, why do <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> {{to be the one}} to explain all this stuff to you. Ask your parents for once!". This is in reference to Chef's tendency to give advice to the boys. While the children are trying to think of what is the most important thing for a man, Cartman says [...] "Ham?", to which Stan angrily replies, [...] "No, not ham, you fat fuck!". This exchange was used verbatim between the same characters in The Spirit of Christmas, the 1995 short film that was the precursor to South Park.|$|E
50|$|Beyoncé, {{she lives}} her passion. She's so sensual, and she's so powerful. And {{she puts it}} out there, she's not afraid of it. She's very {{involved}} in the fragrance.

500|$|Well, I {{actually}} had the idea, I wrote {{the story about}} what it is actually like to be in the Service, and it does take a lot of physical strength, but now that I've been through it – and even just for the three days I was there, [...] a lot of mental strength. We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were so lovely to us, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> fun even though it's a lot of work. Even though I was sore and exhausted, I was so educated on people in the service, who I've always respected but the stuff they go through, and the kind of loyalty they possess, it's very communal, and community. Not to sound weird, but it seems like the heart of America. Seriously, the heart.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} before the {{official}} music video's release in November 2003, Madonna's manager Caresse Henry confirmed video plans for [...] "Love Profusion". It was directed by Luc Besson and shot on September 2003, at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. Besson later directed Madonna in the 2007 animated film Arthur and the Invisibles. [...] "There are a lot of special effects. I talked to things that weren't there – which is what you do when you're doing green-screen or blue-screen stuff. There's {{going to be a lot}} of fairies dancing around me. Isn't that exciting? <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a lot of fairies dancing around me", Madonna commented about the music video. The video premiered in the US on February 11, 2004 on AOL's First View. After the premiere, it was streamed on Yahoo!, MSN, Windows Media, Apple, MTV, VH1, iFilm and Madonna.com.|$|E
500|$|... "I wrote a song a {{while back}} even before [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] {{and it was not}} my {{favorite}} song in the world, but I wrote it. Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and you know {{it was kind of a}} moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 1844, Verdi took on Emanuele Muzio, {{eight years}} his junior, as a pupil and amanuensis. He {{had known him}} since about 1828 as another of Barezzi's protégés. Muzio, who in fact was Verdi's only pupil, became {{indispensable}} to the composer. He reported to Barezzi that Verdi [...] "has a breadth of spirit, of generosity, a wisdom." [...] In November 1846, Muzio wrote of Verdi: [...] "If you could see us, I seem more like a friend, rather than his pupil. We are always together at dinner, in the cafes, when we play cards...; all in all, he doesn't go anywhere without me at his side; in the house {{we have a big}} table and we both write there together, and so <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> his advice." [...] Muzio was to remain associated with Verdi, assisting in the preparation of scores and transcriptions, and later conducting many of his works in their premiere performances in the US and elsewhere outside Italy. He was chosen by Verdi as one of the executors of his will, but predeceased the composer in 1890.|$|E
500|$|In the off-season, it was speculated {{by many in}} {{the media}} whether Luongo should remain Vancouver's captain, citing the added {{pressure}} of the goaltending position. After the Canucks' 3–1 series deficit in the second round, Luongo ceased to make himself available for pre-game interviews – a customary practice for goaltenders, but not for captains. When asked after the Canucks' elimination whether he thought he should remain team captain, he told reporters he did not think it was an issue. However, Gillis, who appointed him captain two seasons prior, asserted it was a topic to be addressed in the off-season. On September 13, 2010, Luongo confirmed he was stepping down, stating that [...] "Serv as captain...in a Canadian city for a team with such passionate fans is a privilege and an experience I will always take pride in. I {{will continue to be a}} leader on this team and support my teammates the same way <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> while focusing on our ultimate goal." [...] Centre Henrik Sedin, who won the Hart Trophy for the 2009–10 season, was named Luongo's successor in a pre-game ceremony to the Canucks' season-opener.|$|E
500|$|In May 2012, Love debuted an art {{collection}} at Fred Torres Collaborations in New York titled [...] "And She's Not Even Pretty", which contained over forty drawings and paintings by Love composed in ink, colored pencil, pastels, and watercolors. Later in the year, she collaborated with Michael Stipe {{on the track}} [...] "Rio Grande" [...] for Johnny Depp's sea shanty album , and in 2013, co-wrote and contributed vocals on [...] "Rat A Tat" [...] from Fall Out Boy's album Save Rock and Roll; she also appeared in the music video for the track. After solo performances in December 2012 and January 2013, Love appeared in advertisements for Yves Saint Laurent alongside Kim Gordon and Ariel Pink. Love completed a solo tour of North America in mid-2013, which was purported to be in promotion of an upcoming solo album; however, it was ultimately dubbed a [...] "greatest hits" [...] tour, and featured songs from Love's and Hole's back catalogue. Love told Billboard {{at the time that}} she had recorded eight songs in the studio. [...] " [...] are not my usual (style)", Love said. [...] "I don't have any Fleetwood Mac references on it. Usually <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a Fleetwood Mac reference as well as having, like, Big Black references. These are very unique songs that sort of magically happened." ...|$|E

500|$|Vlasic {{spent the}} 1989 {{off-season}} recovering form his injury, while the Chargers added another quarterback to the roster upon drafting Billy Joe Tolliver. After {{working out with}} the team during the preseason, he started the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list. With the Chargers having a reliable starter in Jim McMahon, who had been signed to the team, Vlasic was kept on the list for the season. In 1990, McMahon was released and John Friesz was drafted out of the University of Idaho, leaving Vlasic to compete with Friesz and David Archer for the backup quarterback job. As the preseason began for the 1990 San Diego Chargers season, the team released Archer, and the plan was for Friesz to split backup quarterback duties during the preseason. After an impressive preseason by Vlasic and only a pedestrian one by Tolliver, Chargers coach Dan Henning named Vlasic as the starting quarterback against the Dallas Cowboys in the season opener, citing that he was [...] "steadier" [...] than Tolliver. After losing the game 1714, the switch was made back to Tolliver as the starting quarterback, and was eventually named starter {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite this, Vlasic remained optimistic, saying, [...] "I feel confident in my ability, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have.</b> I know I can get the job done whatever the situation. I have to believe that." [...] Over the course of the 1990 season, Vlasic played in six games, completing 19 of 40 passes for 168 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 46.7.|$|E
2500|$|A decade later, she again {{spoke out}} against discrimination, stating, [...] "The American {{president}} may be black, but as a black woman, I am still an exception in this business. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> {{to work harder to}} be treated equally." [...] In 2013, Campbell joined fellow black models Iman and Bethann Hardison in an advocacy group called [...] "Diversity Coalition". In an open letter to the governing bodies of global fashion weeks, they named high-profile designers who used just one or no models of color in their fall 2013 shows, calling it a [...] "racist act".|$|E
2500|$|Zvyagintsev said [...] "The entire {{success of}} the film depends on the cast. So I spend a long time finding exactly the right people. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> {{an image of a}} {{particular}} character in mind, and then audition many actors and keep comparing the essence of the character with the essence of the people I meet. When the virtual and the real characters almost coincide, I know I've found my actor." [...] Zvyagintsev tried to avoid casting Konstantin Lavronenko who played a lead role in his previous film, The Return, but said [...] "In the end I couldn't find anyone else who could be his equal." [...] Zvyagintsev postponed filming and waited twelve months for actress Maria Bonnevie who had a year-long contract with the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm.|$|E

2500|$|For Dark Before Dawn Burnley was {{the primary}} songwriter, the singer stating that [...] "I don't want to reinvent the wheel. [...] I think fans are noticing that the band hasn't changed, because I'm the main songwriter, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> been, and my process — it's not gonna change." [...] The album has {{primarily}} been described as hard rock, alternative metal, and post-grunge. M.K. Sealy from MusicSnake said of the music, [...] "For those who have enjoyed Breaking Benjamin's previous albums, the sound of Dark Before Dawn will be unsettlingly familiar. As a whole, Dark Before Dawn feels and sounds as if the band has fine-tuned Phobia, some of the instrumentation making the listener pause and consider if they've heard the song on a previous album. Regardless of its familiarity, Dark Before Dawn offers [...] an incredible, lyrical journey, and the album is thoroughly enjoyable." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2006, Bennett {{started a}} private {{prosecution}} against the entertainer Michael Barrymore over alleged offences involving drink and the possession {{and use of}} Class A and Class B drugs by Barrymore during the night when 31-year-old Stuart Lubbock was found dead at Barrymore's house in March 2001. The prosecution was blocked by a District Judge (Magistrates' Court) at Southend-on-Sea Magistrates' Court {{on the grounds of}} insufficient evidence. After the decision was made, Bennett announced that he had been acting independently but that he had the support of the Lubbock family. Barrymore released a statement in which he said, [...] "Mr Bennett's motivation to seek the truth as to how Mr Stuart Lubbock received the injuries to his body is absolutely right. I remain totally committed, as <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> been, to continue to pursue the truth. Allegations about drugs on that night have always been a complete irrelevance as to how Stuart Lubbock suffered those injuries. The court held Mr Bennett's misguided application to prosecute me for drugs offences was an abuse of process." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of Fitzpatrick's {{desire for}} the {{photograph}} to reflect something of himself, he raised Che's eyes more and added his initial, a reversed [...] "F" [...] on the shoulder. It {{was not until the}} 40th anniversary of Che's death that Fitzpatrick admitted to this fact stating [...] "I’m a bit mischievous, so I never told anyone." [...] At this time Fitzpatrick said that [...] "I love the picture and wherever I am in the world, if I see it, I take a photo of it. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a chuckle when I see that little 'F'. I know that it's mine." [...] In November 2008, Fitzpatrick announced that he would be signing over the copyright of his Che image to the William Soler Pediatric Cardiology Hospital in Havana, Cuba. In announcing his reason for ensuring all future proceeds would go to the children's hospital, Fitzpatrick stated that [...] "Cuba trains doctors and then sends them around the world … I want their medical system to benefit." [...] Additionally, Fitzpatrick publicized his desire to gift the original artwork to the archive run by Guevara's widow, Aleida March.|$|E

She got my vision for it. She [...] got where I was trying to go and what she brings to the table is so incredible and she's so creative and outstanding. And <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a great time working with her. There was no ego involved, you know, me - that was the first video that I'd ever {{stepped up to the plate}} to literally co-direct. I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas and whatnot in my videos, but this was the first one I actually took credit for in co-directing. And she was just so great and generous in teaching me some of the ropes and learning about the different camera angles and you know, all the facets and details that go into making a video. So, she was really great and we had such fun with that. [...] And she's amazing. I can't you know, she came to the set dressed in different outfits that related to the circus everyday, so she's such an imaginative, creative spirit that I just have such fun working with energy like that.|$|E
