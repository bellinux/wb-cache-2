Sub-slab suction and sump (drain tile) suction have reduced radon levels in five basement houses below 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) -or 148 Becquerels {{per cubic meter}} (B~/I$) [...] based upon short-term radon measurements. In one of these houses, soil gas flow in the system was only 4 ft^/min (2 L/sec). In two houses which had a basement plus an adjoining slab on grade, sub-slab suction in the basement alone adequately reduced radon levels in the entire house. Radon was reduced by over 90 percent in each of four slab-ongrade houses using sub-slab suction from outdoors, even though forced-air <b>heating</b> <b>supply</b> <b>ducts</b> under the slabs appeared to prevent effective extension of. ke suction field under the slab.

40|$|In {{ventilation}} systems, disturbing whistlings {{can occur}} at outlets. This whistling phenomenon {{belongs to the}} self-sustained tones class which can be produced when a low velocity flow impinges on a downstream obstacle. The coupling of the tones with acoustic resonances (so-called indirect feedback path) can promote high-level harmonic noises. This experimental study deals with the coupling of a jet-slot oscillator, modelling a ventilation outlet, with the flow <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> resonances. The flow <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> is damped by using various amounts of acoustic damping foam, {{and the effect of}} this damping on the sound production is studied. It is shown that for a jet exit/obstacle distance higher than 2. 5 jet height (L/H> 2. 5), the tone’s frequency matches satisfactorily with frequencies predicted by a model describing favourable phase relationships for the occurrence of tones along the feedback loop. When the flow <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> is resonant, it is noticeable that the tone’s frequency occurs at a duct resonance frequency which is close to the frequency described by this model. For lower values of L/H (slot closer to the jet exit), a better knowledge of the convection velocity behaviour along the vortices path could improve the tone’s frequency prediction. The use of damping foam within the flow <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> prevents the occurrence of the tones’ coupling with a duct resonance, especially with high amounts of damping material, and dramatically reduces the emitted acoustic levels. For moderate amounts of damping material, the suppression of coupling occurs only for higher flow speeds, as the tone’s frequencies are higher and the damping material is then more efficient...|$|R

This state is caused by customers having practically no opportunities to change the supplier or the way of heating. The reason for this is mainly the investment intensity of obtaining the technology of heating systems. The specific problem concerning the <b>heating</b> <b>supply</b> companies {{lies in the fact that}} the majority of customers are households which, as a result of increasing prices of consumed thermal energy, are interested in savings. The volume of heat sales to households depends particularly on outside temperature. The customers cannot be motivated to make higher purchases because they take only as much thermal energy as they need to balance heat losses of a heated object.

It outlines the basic relationships that individual subjects in the <b>heat</b> <b>supply</b> industry establish among themselves and it analyses these relationships.

The aspect ratio of the jet height H to the slot stand-off distance L is varied in the range 0 Rep 2. 10 ^ 4. The acoustical pressure measured {{at the back of the}} slot-plate at a distance of 75 mm from the slot edge reaches whistling values to the order 10 2 of the stagnation pressure (or 115 dB SPL). Two types of oscillation behavior have been observed depending mainly on Re. For lower Re values, a hydrodynamic oscillator (edge-tone like) is generated, while for Re> 104, the oscillator is coupled to the resonances of the flow <b>supply</b> <b>duct.</b> This resonant duct creates an indirect feedback path (organ-pipe like) that controls the tone frequency and reinforces their amplitude. An important result is that this lock-in phenomenon involves very high-order nonplanar acoustical modes (up to the 32 nd). The introduction of damping foam in the flow <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> induces a decrease of the emitted levels reaching 25 dB for the emitted levels, but the oscillation behavior remains dependent on the duct resonance.
