5|$|Upon Carey's {{death in}} March 1889, Avondale was {{inherited}} by his 16-year-old grand nephew William Herbert deLisle. deLisle arrived {{and took up}} residence there in 1893, and assumed the land title in 1894. Avondale had been a pastoral property until deLisle's arrival, {{over the next ten}} years sections of the estate were sold off to fund its development. During this period, the house was expanded and the stable built, which included 20 horse stalls with <b>hollow</b> <b>walls</b> and an overhead loft. The <b>hollow</b> <b>walls</b> enable feed from the loft to gravitate directly to the feed bins in each stall.|$|R

It was a snug little home, {{pleasant}} and quiet, and as dark as any mouse could desire. Mamma Mouse liked it because, as she said, the draught that came through the rafters made it cool in summer, and they were near enough to the chimney to keep warm in wintertime.|$|E

6000|$|... “Cristoval was not popular,” said Mildred, “for {{he loved}} money {{so well that}} he was reputed to be a miser. It was this love of money, I think, that induced him to go into {{partnership}} with my father in his illegal smuggling enterprises. Cristoval furnished the money and when my father had slipped across the border with his bales of rare laces, they were hidden in the <b>hollow</b> <b>wall</b> until they could be forwarded to San Francisco and sold.|$|E
60|$|In {{propagating}} these superstitions, the ring-leaders {{were the}} Monks, and Antony {{was at the}} head of them: for in the end of the life of Antony, Athanasius relates that these were his dying words to his disciples who then attended him. Do you take care, said Antony, to adhere to Christ in the first place, and then to the Saints, that after death they may receive you as friends and acquaintance into the everlasting tabernacles, Think upon these things, perceive these things; and if you have any regard to me, remember me as a father. This being delivered in charge to the Monks by Antony at his death, A.C. 356, could not but inflame their whole body with devotion towards the Saints, as the ready way to be received, by them into the eternal Tabernacles after death. Hence came that noise about the miracles, done by the reliques of the Saints in the time of Constantius: hence came the dispersion of the miracle-working reliques into all the Empire; Alexandria setting the example, and being renowned, for it above all other cities. Hence it came to pass in the days of Julian, A.C. 362, that Athanasius by a prophetic spirit, as Ruffinus tells us, hid the bones of John the Baptist from the Heathens, not in the ground to be forgotten, but in the <b>hollow</b> <b>wall</b> of a Church before proper witnesses, that they might be profitable to future generations. Hence also came the invocation of the Saints for doing such miracles, and for assisting men in their devotions, and mediating with God. For Athanasius, even from his youth, looked upon the dead Saints and Martyrs as mediators of our prayers: in his Epistle to Marcellinus, written in the days of Constantine the great, he saith that the words of the Psalms are not to be transposed or any wise changed, but to be recited and sung without any artifice, as they are written, that the holy men who delivered them, knowing them to be their own words, may pray with us; or rather, that the Holy Ghost who spake in the holy men, seeing his own words with which he inspired them, may join with them in assisting us.|$|E

5000|$|Another notable {{building}} is Camp Hammond (1889-90), at 275 Main Street, whose construction method is significant {{in that the}} building consists of a single exterior wall of heavy planks over timbers, with no hidden spaces of <b>hollow</b> <b>walls.</b> This so-called mill-built construction was used largely for fire prevention.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of placing a {{reflecting}} sheet in an air gap on the thermal performance of single hollow, double hollow and insulated <b>hollow</b> <b>walls</b> and roofs is studied. One face of the wall or roof is exposed to solar radiation and ambient air {{and the other is}} in contact with room air at constant temperature. These results are also compared with the predictions made in the case when a water film is maintained on the roof or wall. Numerical calculations are for a typical hot day (the 26 th of May, 1979) in New Delhi. It is seen that the use of a reflecting sheet in single hollow and double <b>hollow</b> <b>walls</b> and roofs is more economical [...] and gives a better performance [...] than the water film system. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} walled gardens in Britain have one <b>hollow</b> <b>wall</b> with {{openings}} in the stonework on the side facing towards the garden, so that fires could be lit inside the wall to provide additional heat to protect the fruit growing against the wall. Heat would escape into the garden through these openings, and {{the smoke from the}} fires would be directed upwards through chimneys or flues. This kind of <b>hollow</b> <b>wall</b> is found at Croxteth Hall in Liverpool (England), and Eglinton Country Park and Dunmore House, both in Scotland. In the 1800s, such walls were lined with pipes and connected to a boiler, as at Bank Hall in Bretherton.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{fact that}} Indonesia {{is located in}} the Pacific Ring of Fire in which some big {{earthquakes}} frequently occur has increased concern on the needs for temporary shelter and building safety. Hence, the use of lightweight pre-cast wall becomes one of the ideal choices to fulfill the need of rapid temporary shelter and to increase building safety. This paper reported the investigation of the properties of pre-cast <b>hollow</b> concrete <b>wall</b> panel with different thickness of partition using self compacting concrete technology. The test of concrete properties consists of compressive strength of mortar, flexural strength of <b>hollow</b> concrete <b>wall,</b> the density of the wall. In addition, the flexural strength is tested on the <b>hollow</b> concrete panel <b>wall</b> with the dimension of 1, 000 x 300 x 120 mm. The result shows that the <b>hollow</b> concrete panel <b>wall</b> satisfies the properties requirement for concrete wall. Moreover, the pre-cast <b>hollow</b> concrete panel <b>wall</b> with the partition thickness of 15 mm is the most optimum dimension of the panel wall and becomes one of appropriate technologies to provide rapid shelter for post disaster area...|$|R
