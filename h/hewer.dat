25|$|While the spin-off's {{format is}} very similar to that of The Apprentice, it adopts a more gentle tone with the young candidates, in {{contrast}} to the approach given to older candidates on the main show. As with the main show, applicants go through a series of open auditions and interviews, before being whittled down to the final number that will be involved in the competition, which consists of a balanced number of boys and girls. Throughout the process, the candidates, divided into two teams that they {{at the beginning of the}} competition, take part in a series of business-related tasks, appointing one member of their team as the project manager (PM), with Lord Sugar having Brady and <b>Hewer</b> overseeing the team's performance on each task, while providing the candidates with an upmarket house/apartment to live in during the competition; unlike the main show, the young candidates do not partake in a series of Interviews in the penultimate stage of the contest.|$|E
25|$|Occupational names {{include such}} simple {{examples}} as Smith (for a smith), Miller (for a miller), Farmer (for farm tax collectors or sometimes farmers), Thatcher (for a thatcher), Shepherd (for a shepherd), Potter (for a potter), and so on, {{as well as}} non-English ones, such as the German Eisenhauer (iron <b>hewer,</b> later Anglicized in America as Eisenhower) or Schneider (tailor) - or indeed, as in English, Schmidt (smith). There are also more complicated names based on occupational titles. In England it was common for servants to take {{a modified version of}} their employer's occupation or first name as their last name, adding the letter s to the word, although this formation could also be a patronymic. For instance, the surname Vickers is thought to have arisen as an occupational name adopted by the servant of a vicar, while Roberts could have been adopted by either the son or the servant of a man named Robert. A subset of occupational names in English are names thought to be derived from the medieval mystery plays. The participants would often play the same roles for life, passing the part down to their oldest sons. Names derived from this may include King, Lord and Virgin. The original meaning of names based on medieval occupations may no longer be obvious in modern English (so the surnames Cooper, Chandler, and Cutler come from the occupations of making barrels, candles, and cutlery, respectively).|$|E
