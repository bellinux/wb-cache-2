Gradual growth of the shunt conductance {{is a consequence of}} degradation of the dielectric properties of the insulator. The proposed estimation method is based on voltage and current measurements at a single end of the cable. After the linearization of the bilinear term of the telegrapher's equations through a perturbation approach, the Kalman filter is applied to transform the problem of <b>dynamic</b> <b>system</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation to a simple linear regression problem. Results of numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. In particular, it is shown that the weak sensitivity of the available measurements to the shunt conductance can be compensated by long time data samples...|$|E

This paper presents a mutual-information-based observability metric for the online dynamic parameter identification of a multibody system. The metric is used in an algorithm to optimally select the external excitation required by the <b>dynamic</b> <b>system</b> <b>parameter</b> identification process. The excitation is controlled so that the identification favors parameters that have the greatest uncertainty at any given time. This algorithm is applied to identify the vehicle and suspension parameters of a mobile-field manipulator, and {{is found to be}} computationally more efficient and robust to noise than conventional methods. Issues addressed include the development of appropriate vehicle models, compatible with the onboard sensors. Simulations and experimental results show the effectiveness of this algorithm.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{least square}} {{estimation}} (LSE) -based dynamic generator model parameter identification is investigated. Electromechanical dynamics related parameters such as inertia constant and primary frequency control droop for a synchronous generator are estimated using Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data obtained at the generator terminal bus. The key idea of applying LSE for dynamic parameter estimation {{is to have}} a discrete autoregression with exogenous input (ARX) model. With an ARX model, a linear estimation problem can be formulated and the parameters of the ARX model can be found. This paper gives the detailed derivation of converting a generator model with primary frequency control into an ARX model. The generator parameters will be recovered from the estimated ARX model parameters afterwards. Two types of conversion methods are presented: zero-order hold (ZOH) method and Tustin method.

40|$|Practical {{realization}} of model-based dynamic legged behaviors is substantially more challenging than statically stable behaviors {{due to their}} heavy dependence on second-order system dynamics. This problem is further aggravated by the difficulty of accurately measuring or estimating dynamic parameters such as spring and damping constants for associated models {{and the fact that}} such parameters are prone to change in time due to heavy use and associated material fatigue. In this paper, we present an on-line, model-based adaptive control method for running with a planar spring-mass hopper based on a once-per-step parameter correction scheme.

To establish the method simply supported and continuous beams containing damaged parts at different locations are tested using simulated data. Some important conclusions concerning the computation of the modal curvatures are drawn.

40|$|For {{real-time}} systems, most of {{the analysis}} involves efficient or exact schedulability checking. While this is important, analysis is often {{based on the assumption}} that the task parameters such as execution requirements and inter-arrival times between jobs are known exactly. In most cases, however, only a worst-case estimate of these quantities is available at the time of analysis. It is therefore imperative that schedulability analysis hold for better parameter values (Sustainable Analysis). On the other hand, if the task or <b>system</b> <b>parameters</b> turn out to be worse off, then the analysis should tolerate some deterioration (Robust Analysis). Robust analysis is especially important, because the implication of task schedulability is often weakened in the presence of optimizations that are performed on its code, or <b>dynamic</b> <b>system</b> <b>parameters.</b> In this work, we define and address sustainability and robustness questions for analysis of embedded real-time software that is modeled by conditional real-time tasks.
