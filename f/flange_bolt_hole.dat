30|$|The {{modelling}} {{of contacts}} between various components {{plays a major}} role in the performance of the connection. The bolt pre-tension and friction are the most critical parameters. The forces are transmitted by friction between members as a result of bolt pre-tensioning. The contact pairs are web angles to beam web/column <b>flange,</b> <b>bolt</b> shank to <b>bolt</b> <b>hole,</b> and <b>bolt</b> head to respective components. Out of these, the contact between bolt shank and <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> is frictionless, whereas the others are friction contact. The interaction consists of two components, one normal to the surface and the other tangential to the surface. The tangential component consists of relative motion between the surfaces and frictional shear stress, if connection is made up of HSFG bolts. Hard contact is given between the surfaces, i.e., the surfaces separate, when the contact pressure between them becomes zero or negative. While in contact the normal and shear forces are transmitted from one surface to another. Thus, a suitable value of friction coefficient should be given such that the frictional forces resist relative sliding of the surface. To simulate the exact connection behaviour, finite sliding contact pair definition is given between the two surfaces, one of which is the master and other is slave surface. The master surface should be a discontinuous surface and the surface intersecting the master is called slave surface.|$|R

To preclude fatigue cracks from growing to critical size in the NASA disk <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> due to cyclic loading at severe test conditions, a retirement-for-cause methodology was adopted to detect and monitor cracks within the <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> using eddy-current inspection. For the NASA disk material that was tested, the fatigue strain-life to crack initiation at a total strain of 0. 5 percent, a minimum to maximum strain ratio of 0, and a <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> temperature of 649 C was calculated to be 665 cycles using - 99. 95 percent prediction intervals.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the {{construction}} field, the bolting robot provides convenience and reduces a process time of assembling steel frames. When assembling steel frames, the bolting robot finds a <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> {{with the help}} of camera. If the light conditions are either too bright or too dark, however, it is hard to find a <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> in the input image because the contrast between <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> and background is vague. In order to improve detection accuracy in such environment, this paper proposes the image processing algorithm using template matching (TM). First, the input image is converted from RGB to YCbCr in order to reduce influence of shadow. Then we separate Y channel of image in darkness or extract edges from Cb and Cr channel of image in brightness. Template image is created with the radius which can be calculated with the distance to a steel frame. We used TM to create the normalized cross correlation (NCC) image which shows correlation between processed image and template. Finally, <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> are extracted from the high-correlation part of NCC image. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust to detect <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> under various illumination conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} measure the {{eccentricity}} of auto-hub’s center <b>hole</b> and <b>bolt</b> <b>holes,</b> a machine vision system is proposed in this article. Instead of normally used telecentric lens, a perspective lens {{is used in the}} vision system because of the large field of view. The eccentricity is calculated by sub-pixel edge extracting and circle-fitting algorithm. A correction method is put forward to compensate the systematic error resulting from the different perspective distortions of the center <b>hole</b> and the <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> because of the height difference between the center <b>hole</b> and the <b>bolt</b> <b>holes,</b> as well as the offset between the hub’s center shaft and the optical axis of the imaging system.
