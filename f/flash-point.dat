The Israeli Chief Rabbinate also declared a religious holiday on the anniversary, called [...] "Yom Yerushalayim" [...] (Jerusalem Day), which became a national holiday to commemorate the reunification of Jerusalem. Many saw the capture of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount as a miraculous liberation of biblical-messianic proportions. A {{few days after the}} war was over 200,000 Jews flocked to the Western Wall in the first mass Jewish pilgrimage near the Mount since the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. Islamic authorities did not disturb Goren when he went to pray on the Mount until, on the Ninth Day of Av, he brought 50 followers and introduced both a shofar, and a portable ark to pray, an innovation which alarmed the Waqf authorities and led to a deterioration of relations between the Muslim authorities and the Israeli government. The then Prime Minister of Israel, Levi Eshkol, gave control of access to the Temple Mount to the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.

40|$|Many African Independent Churches {{emerged during}} the colonial era in central Kenya and western Nigeria. At times they were opposed by {{government}} officials and missionaries. Most scholars have limited the field of enquiry to the <b>flash-points</b> of this encounter, thereby emphasizing the relationship at its most severe. This study questions current assumptions about the encounter which have derived from these studies, arguing that both government and missionary officials in Kenya and Nigeria exhibited {{a broader range of}} perspectives and responses to African Independent Churches. To characterize them as mainly hostile to African Independent Churches is inaccurate. This study also explores the various encounters between African Independent Churches and African politicians, clergymen, and local citizens. While some scholars have discussed the positive role of Africans in encouraging the growth of independent Christianity, this study will discuss the history in greater depth and complexity. The investigation will show the importance of understanding the encounter on both a local and national level, and the relationships between the two. It is taken for granted that European officials had authority over African leaders, but in regard to this topic many Africans possessed a largely unrecognized ability to influence and shape European perceptions of new religious movements. Finally, this thesis will discuss how African Independent Churches sometimes provoked negative responses from others through confrontational missionary methods, caustic rhetoric, intimidation and even violence. These three themes resurface throughout the history of the encounter and illustrate how current assumptions can be reinterpreted. This thesis suggests the necessity of expanding the primary scholarly focuses, as well as altering the language and basic assumptions of the previous histories of the encounter.

50|$|Not {{only was}} this brief indoor season the <b>flash-point</b> {{for one of}} the longest running soccer derbies in North America as {{previously}} mentioned, but it was significant for another reason. When Ed Tepper approached Earl Foreman about starting a fully professional indoor-only league, he used a videotape of the 1977 Rowdies-Zenit Leningrad match to show not only the game's potential, but also the crowd's enthusiastic responses to the end-to-end action. By October 1977 the pair announced the formation of the Major Indoor Soccer League.That league would grow to become the sport's standard bearer for many years, even gaining a regular slot in the ESPN line up, before finally folding in 1992. Today, though most popular in North America, indoor soccer is played throughout the world, with its own FIFA-like governing body.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of aseptic surgery {{there has been a}} constant search for a quick and economical means of sterilizing surgical instruments without dulling effect. Heat sterilization in oil, as introduced by Lyman 5 in 1917, has proved to be the most satisfactory method thus far, and is widely used in hospitals. There is a definite disadvantage to this procedure, {{due to the fact that}} hot oil acts only as dry heat and consequently a high temperature (i. e., 1500 C.) is required for adequate sterilization. This temperature is above the <b>flash-point</b> of most oils, and as a result it is necessary to obtain specially distilled oil with a high <b>flash-point.</b> This is expensive. Recently Gurchot and Mellars 3 recommended diethylene glycol as a medium for heat sterilization of instruments.

40|$|Flash {{point is}} the most {{important}} variable used to characterize the fire and explosion hazard of liquids. This paper presents the first partially miscible aqueousorganic mixtures flash point measurements and modeling for the ternary type-I mixtures, water + ethanol + 1 -butanol, water + ethanol + 2 -butanol, and the type-II mixture, water + 1 -butanol + 2 -butanol. Results reveal that the flash points are constant in each tie line. Handling the non-ideality of the liquid phase through the use of activity coefficient models, the general <b>flash-point</b> model of Liaw et al. extended to partially miscible mixtures predicts the experimental data well when using literature LLE and the VLE activity coefficient model binary parameters to estimate sequentially the span and flash point in each tie line and the flash point in the mutual solubility region, respectively. The constant <b>flash-point</b> behavior in a tie line is also observed and predicted, in agreement with the VLLE tie line property that a single vapor is in equilibrium with all liquid composition on a tie line. For the aqueousorganic mixtures here studied, a deviation between prediction and measurements is observed, arising from the failure of the constant lower flammable limit assumption in the mutual solubility inert-rich region. Potential application for the model concerns the assessment of fire and explosion hazards and the development of inherently safer designs for chemical processes containing partially miscible aqueousorganic mixtures...|$|E

40|$|Experiments of {{interest}} to combustion fundamentals and spacecraft fire safety investigated flame spread of alcohol fuels over shallow, 15 cm diameter pools in a 5. 2 sec free-fall, microgravity facility. Results showed that, independent O 2 concentration, alcohol fuel, and diluent types, microgravity flame spread rates were nearly identical to those corresponding normal-gravity flames for conditions where the normal gravity flames spread uniformly. This similarity indicated buoyancy-related convection in either phase does not affect flame spread, {{at least for the}} physical scale of the experiments. However, microgravity extinction coincided with the onset conditions for pulsating spread in normal gravity, implicating gas phase, buoyant flow as a requirement for pulsating spread. When the atmospheric nitrogen was replaced with argon, the conditions for the onset of normal-gravity pulsating flame spread and microgravity flame extinction were changed, in agreement with the expected lowering of the flash point through the thermal properties of the diluent.

A video cinematography technique was applied to determine the rate of flame spread and combustion behaviour. Results corresponding to the flame spread over the porous bed for quiescent, assisting and opposing airflow configurations show that the flame spread rate decreases as either the particle size or the depth of porous bed increases. However, the rate of deceleration was found to be more distinct for the flame spread under airflow condition compared to quiescent condition. The flame spread rate for 39. 9 mm bed depth in quiescent condition decreased from 1. 2 m/s to 0. 89 m/s with increasing the particle sizes from 0. 5 to 5 mm.
