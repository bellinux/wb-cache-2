40|$|Clinical {{observations}} {{were made on}} the majority of 749 newborn piglets from 75 litters and the blood pH and pCO 2 levels in samples taken from an umbilical artery were determined in 299 of these piglets. A method of individual clinical assessment was developed which reduced the effect of subjective error on the evaluation of viability {{at the time of}} delivery. Blood samples were collected from the umbilical artery prior to the onset of respiratory movements and it was found that increased acidemia and hypercapnia were associated with reduced viability. The pH values in severely depressed piglets were between 6. 50 and 6. 95 and pCO 2 values between 105 and 185 mm Hg, whereas in the fully viable animals, the ranges were 7. 10 - 7. 42 and 46 - 75 mm Hg respectively. It was concluded that {{a large proportion of the}} mortality and reduced viability at the time of delivery could be attributed to <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>asphyxia...</b>|$|E
40|$|CDATA[Piglet death {{during the}} {{perinatal}} and lactation period {{is one of}} the more easily identified causes of reduced production efficiency in swine herds. Pre-weaning mortality rates vary between 12 and 25 %. The present review analyses factors related with non-infectious pre-weaning mortality. Among the maternal factors, farrowing and <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>asphyxia,</b> behaviour and maternal ability are discussed. Piglet factors include newborn vigour, teat seeking ability, acidosis, hypothermia and hypoglucemia. Even though there had been technological changes and improvements in husbandry, housing designs and preventive measures, piglet mortality in lactation remains a major economical and welfare problem. The major causes of pre-weaning mortality are those associated with basic husbandry skills, starvation and crushing by the sow. One potential alternative to reduce neonatal mortality in pigs is the monitoring of foetal stress during birth, it is also important to consider the physiological, behavioural and biochemical changes that take place during early lactation which subsequently affect the vitality, maturity and development of neonatal pigs. A mortality rate of say 8 % of piglets born alive is possible and should be the target, getting more knowledge of factors influencing piglet non-infectious mortality within the first three days may help improve piglet welfare. ]]...|$|E
40|$|Neonatal {{mortality}} rate (NMR) or infant {{mortality rate}} (IMR) are the rate of deaths per 1, 000 live births at which babies of either less than four weeks or of one year of age die, respectively. The NMR and IMR are commonly accepted {{as a measure of}} the general health and wellbeing of a population. Korea’s NMR and IMR fell significantly between 1993 and 2009 from 6. 6 and 9. 9 to 1. 7 and 3. 2, respectively. Common causes of infantile death in 2008 had decreased compared with those in 1996 such as other disorders originating in the perinatal period, congenital malformation of the heart, bacterial sepsis of newborns, disorders related to length of gestation and fetal growth, <b>intra-uterine</b> hypoxia, birth <b>asphyxia.</b> However, some other causes are on the increase, such as respiratory distress of newborn, other respiratory conditions originating in the perinatal period, other congenital malformation, diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism. In this study, we provide basic data about changes of NMR and IMR and the causes of neonatal and infantile death from 1983 to 2009 in Korea...|$|R
40|$|In tro duc ti on Hyperinsulinaemic {{hypoglycaemia}} (HH) {{represents a}} group of clinically, genetically, and morphologically heterogeneous disorders characterized by dysregulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells (1). It is the commonest cause of both transient and persistent states of hypoglycaemia posing significant risk of permanent brain damage (2, 3, 4). Insulin secretion from β-cells is precisely regulated by various mechanisms to maintain blood glucose values within the normal range (fasting blood glucose levels of 3. 5 – 5. 5 mmol/L). HH-unregulated insulin secretion drives glucose into insulin-sensitive tissues (skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue) and prevents the generation of alternative energy substrates (such as lactate and ketone bodies due to inhibition of glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and ketogenesis) thereby depriving the brain of glucose and ketone bodies. It is this metabolic milieu that results in hypoglycaemic brain injury (2). Clinically, HH can result in apneas, seizures, developmental delay, and learning disability (4). Hence, early identification and meticulous management of these patients is fundamental in preventing a neurological insult. HH can either be congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) or secondary to certain risk factors like birth <b>asphyxia,</b> <b>intra-uterine</b> growth retardation (5), Rh isoimmunisation (6) and maternal diabetes mellitus or associated with various developmental syndromes like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or metabolic conditions like congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG syndromes) (7). In adults, an insulinoma accounts for most cases of HH. Other causes include noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycaemi...|$|R
