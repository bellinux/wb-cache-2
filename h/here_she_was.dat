5|$|Born in 1889 in Cannes to Swiss-French parents, Noémi {{moved to}} New York in 1900, and later studied Fine Art and Philosophy at Columbia Teachers College. <b>Here,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{influenced}} by the painter and educator Arthur Wesley Dow. During Raymond's period of training as a painter, Noémi supported them both by doing graphic work for publications like the New York Sun and New York Herald Tribune. When they both moved to Taliesin she became interested in 3D design. She also polished her knowledge of Japanese crafts, becoming a broker for clients such as Rudolph Schindler's wife, Pauline Gibling.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 until 1966 she dwelt {{in a flat}} at 8 Holly Hill, Hampstead, {{which was}} owned by the husband {{of one of her}} OMS students, the Latvian exile and poet Velta Snikere. After leaving Holly Hill, Montalban moved to a flat in the Queen Alexandra Mansions at 3 Grape Street in the St. Giles {{district}} of Holborn. <b>Here,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in close proximity to the two primary bookstores then catering to occult interests, Atlantis Bookshop and Watkins Bookshop, {{as well as to the}} British Museum. She offered one of the rooms in her flat to a young astrologer and musician, Rick Hayward, whom she had met in the summer of 1967; he joined the OMS, and in the last few months of Montalban's life authored her astrological forecasts for Prediction. After her death, he continued publishing astrological prophecies in Prediction and Prediction Annual until summer 2012.|$|E
5|$|Schleswig-Holstein was {{put into}} dock for repairs 10–25 June 1916. The Navy then decided to {{withdraw}} the four remaining Deutschland-class ships, owing to their obsolescence and vulnerability to underwater attacks, {{as demonstrated by the}} loss of Pommern. Thereafter, the ship was used as a target for U-boats, except during 12–23 February 1917 when she was used as a guard ship. In April Schleswig-Holstein was sent to Altenbruch {{at the mouth of the}} Elbe; <b>here</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> decommissioned on 2 May. Schleswig-Holstein was then disarmed and assigned to the 5th U-boat Flotilla to be used as a barracks ship in Bremerhaven. In 1918 the ship was moved to Kiel, where she remained for the rest of the war.|$|E

5|$|Ferdinando beseeched Louis XIV to do {{something}} about his daughter-in-law's behaviour; he sent the Comte de Saint Mêmê. Marguerite Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding a solution to the heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: she insisted on employing French cooks, as she feared the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 Marguerite Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo moved her into Villa Lapeggi. <b>Here,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth to Anna Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between Marguerite Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when Marguerite Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all her problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{battleship}} bombarded Iwo Jima from 19–22 February {{in support}} of the invasion there before escorting carriers which sent aircraft raids against Tokyo and targets on the island of Kyūshū. On 24 March and 19 April, Washington bombarded Okinawa; she then departed for Puget Sound to receive a refit, having been in action {{for the majority of the}} time since its refit in March–April 1944. This lasted through V-J Day and the subsequent formal ceremony aboard , so Washington received orders to voyage to Philadelphia, where she arrived on 17 October. <b>Here</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> modified to have an additional 145 bunks, so that she could participate in Operation Magic Carpet. Sailing to Southampton with a reduced crew of 84officers and 835crew, she brought 185army officers and 1,479enlisted men back to the United States; this was the only voyage she would make {{in support of}} the operation. The battleship was placed into reserve at Bayonne, New Jersey on 27 June 1947, after only a little more than six years of service. Washington was never reactivated. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960—exactly 21 years to the day since its launch—she was sold on 24 May 1961 to be scrapped.|$|E

25|$|Despite Fred's insistence {{his wife}} held no {{knowledge}} {{of any of the}} murders, investigators suspected otherwise. However, Rose would not be arrested until 20 April 1994, initially on offences relating to the rape of an 11-year-old girl, and the physical assault of an eight-year-old boy—both charges dating from the mid-1970s. The following day, she was refused bail, and transferred to Pucklechurch Prison to be held in the maximum security wing. <b>Here,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> questioned more closely about the murders, in particular those of her daughter and Lynda Gough, and on 25 April she was formally charged with Gough's murder.|$|E

Hercule, under Gerome Cavassa (a member of the Legion of Honour), was carrying a cargo of cotton from Aleppo and Cyprus to Marseilles or Genoa. She was armed with 12 guns, {{ranging in size from}} 8-pounders to 18-pounders. Her crew numbered 57 men, of whom one was killed and two were wounded. Kingfisher suffered extensive damage to her rigging but had only one man slightly wounded.|$|E
25|$|Born on 31 March 1360, Philippa was {{the oldest}} child of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and Blanche of Lancaster.

Quarto served briefly in East Asian waters in the early 1930s, and supported Italian forces during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in 1936. The following year she served as the flagship of the Italian forces participating in the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War; <b>here</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> attacked by Republican bombers, although she escaped damage. She was stricken from the naval register in January 1939 and subsequently used in weapons tests with human torpedoes and explosive motorboats.

500|$|Higgins {{started writing}} tracks for her second album {{as soon as}} she had {{finished}} recording The Sound of White, which was released in 2004. She said, [...] "I started quite early because I knew there would a lot of pressure for the second album and I didn't want to write songs under anyone's stopwatch." [...] "100 Round the Bends" [...] was written while she was still recording the first album. During 2006, Higgins spent six months living in Broome, Western Australia, away from the distractions of the entertainment industry. <b>Here</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> able to relax and focus on creating new material for her next album.

500|$|According to Gaga, Bennett {{wanted her}} to sing {{different}} songs and was impressed by her vocals during [...] "Lush Life", referring to the Billy Strayhorn written standard that has been recorded by everyone from Nancy Wilson and Sarah Vaughan to Donna Summer and Linda Ronstadt. Gaga explained that she was nervous about recording with Bennett. [...] "I just wanted him to hear I have an authentic jazz voice and that I studied that... If he can hear that, I'm okay. If he can't hear it, I'm not an authentic jazz voice", she added. Inspiration for singing came from jazz singer Amy Winehouse, who died in July 2011; Gaga added [...] "I thought of her almost {{every day in the}} studio. I wish she was still <b>here.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> jazz to her core". The songs were recorded live with the band, and during the recording process Gaga asked for carpets to be placed on the studio floor, so that it looked like a film set and it could be photographed.|$|E
500|$|On 31 January 1919 she was {{decommissioned}} for {{the final}} time, and two months later she was renamed Coast Battleship Number 1 so that the name Indiana could be assigned to the newly authorized—but never completed—battleship [...] The old battleship was brought to shallow waters in the Chesapeake Bay near {{the wreck of the}} battleship [...] (ex-Texas). <b>Here</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> subjected to aerial bombing tests conducted by the navy. She was hit with dummy bombs from aircraft and explosive charges were set off at the positions where the bombs hit. The tests were a response to claims from Billy Mitchell—at the time assistant to the Chief of Air Service—who stated to Congress that the Air Service could sink any battleship. The conclusions drawn by the navy from the experiments conducted on Indiana were very different, as Captain William D. Leahy stated in his report: [...] "The entire experiment pointed to the improbability of a modern battleship being either destroyed or completely put out of action by aerial bombs." [...] The subject remained a matter of dispute between Mitchell and the Navy and several more bombing tests were conducted with other decommissioned battleships, culminating in the sinking of [...] Indiana sank during the test and settled in the shallow water, where she remained until her wreck was sold for scrap on 19 March 1924.|$|E

500|$|On 20 April, Schwalbe left Germany {{and arrived}} off Zanzibar {{a month and}} a half later, on 7 June. She went to Cape Town for {{periodic}} maintenance from 10 October to mid-November. In January 1899, she towed the disabled German East-Africa Line steamer [...] to Dar es Salaam. For this, the Line donated a sum to the Navy, which the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office) used to improve the sailors' barracks. In October, the Second Boer War broke out between British South Africa and the Boer Orange Free State and the Transvaal. Schwalbe and the cruiser [...] were sent to South Africa to protect German shipping, since the British had begun aggressively searching foreign freighters to prevent contraband from reaching the Boers. Despite the presence of the two cruisers, several German ships, including the Imperial post steamers [...] and , the freighter , and the barque Marie were seized by the Royal Navy. This caused a major diplomatic incident and led to the passage of the Second Naval Law in Germany. During her patrol of South African waters, she stopped in Durban from 19 to 21 January 1900, Port Elizabeth, East London, Cape Town, and Delagoa Bay. Tensions eased as the Boers began to suffer several defeats in early 1900, and on 7 May, Schwalbe was back in Dar es Salaam. From <b>here,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ordered to leave for East Asian waters to reinforce the German East Asia Squadron and assist with suppressing the Boxer Rebellion in China.|$|E
500|$|Enhanced by the {{considerable}} influence of Leicester's Commonwealth, the rumours about Amy Robsart's death {{developed into a}} tradition of embellished folklore. As early as 1608, a domestic tragedy named A Yorkshire Tragedy alluded to her fall {{from a pair of}} stairs as an easy {{way to get rid of}} one's wife: [...] "A politician did it." [...] In the 19th century her story became very popular due to the best-selling novel, Kenilworth, by Walter Scott. The novel's arch-villain is again called Varney. The notion that Amy Robsart was murdered gained new strength with the discovery of the Spanish diplomatic correspondence (and with it of poison rumours) by the Victorian historian James Anthony Froude. Generally convinced of Leicester's wretchedness, he concluded in 1863: [...] "she was murdered by persons who hoped to profit by his elevation to the throne; and Dudley himself … used private means … to prevent the search from being pressed inconveniently far." [...] There followed the Norfolk antiquarian Walter Rye with The Murder of Amy Robsart in 1885: <b>here</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> first poisoned and then, that method failing, killed by violent means. Rye's main sources were Cecil's talk with de Quadra around the time of Amy Dudley's death and, again, Leicester's Commonwealth. Much more scholarly and influential was an 1870 work by George Adlard, Amy Robsart and the Earl of Leycester, which printed relevant letters and covertly suggested suicide as an explanation. By 1910, A.F. Pollard was convinced that the fact that Amy Robsart's death caused suspicion was [...] "as natural as it was incredible … But a meaner intelligence than Elizabeth's or even Dudley's would have perceived that murder would make the marriage impossible." ...|$|E
