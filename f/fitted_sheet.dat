50|$|A <b>fitted</b> <b>sheet</b> {{goes over}} the mattress. Often a draw sheet, also called lift sheet, is used, where it is placed over the <b>fitted</b> <b>sheet</b> {{and in the center}} where it will be under the patient’s midsection. By lifting the draw sheet, it is used to help move the patient. The <b>fitted</b> <b>sheet</b> and draw sheet, which are those that go under the patient, are firmly tucked in to prevent wrinkles, which can promote skin breakdown. A top sheet and blanket are often placed over the bed and the corners are mitered.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} form of {{a mattress}} protector is a lightly quilted <b>fitted</b> <b>sheet.</b> It provides minimal protection against liquids and little or no protection from dust mite allergens.|$|E
50|$|In the US and Canada, {{sheets are}} often sold in a four-piece set {{consisting}} of a <b>fitted</b> <b>sheet,</b> a flat sheet and two pillowcases. In China, a four-piece set consists of a duvet cover, two pillowcases and either a fitted or flat sheet.|$|E

50|$|In some Asian countries, such as China, top {{sheets are}} not used. Flat sheets {{are often used}} in place of <b>fitted</b> <b>sheets</b> or {{together}} with them as bottom sheets. Most families prefer to use duvet covers to cover the quilts.|$|R
5000|$|Fitted sheet: This is {{the bottom}} <b>sheet</b> used to <b>fit</b> tightly over a mattress. <b>Fitted</b> <b>sheets</b> are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} pocket depths, which refers to the thickness of the mattress. Standard North American pocket size is 7 to 9 inches. Deep pocket corners are usually 10 to 13 inches. Extra deep pocket corners are very generous in size, and range from 14” to as much as 22” and used for extraordinarily high/deep mattresses.|$|R
5000|$|Feather bed: {{feathers}} {{contained within}} a fabric shell that lies {{on top of}} a mattress as a mattress topper. The featherbed will normally have elastic straps or even have a <b>fitted</b> <b>sheet</b> on it so that it fits over a mattress and stays in place.|$|E
5000|$|Flat sheet: The top sheet. The {{flat sheet}} is tucked {{in around the}} {{mattress}} over the <b>fitted</b> <b>sheet</b> with the fourth side, {{at the head of}} the bed, undone. Some duvet or comforter sets do not include a top sheet; the duvet/comforter has a cotton bottom that replaces the sheet.|$|E
50|$|When {{making an}} {{occupied}} bed, such as {{for patients who}} are unable or have difficulty getting out of bed, {{one side of the}} bed is made at a time. Usually, the patient rolls to one side and the old linen under the patient from the opposite side, such as the <b>fitted</b> <b>sheet</b> and draw sheet, is untucked and rolled as close to the patient as possible. The new <b>fitted</b> <b>sheet</b> and draw sheet are then tucked in and also rolled close toward the patient. Then the patient rolls back toward the other side. The old linen that was folded under the patient is removed and the new linen that was also folded under the patient is eased out to make {{the other side of the}} bed. For those for whom it is contraindicated to roll to the side, such as those recovering from hip replacement surgery, then the patient sits up in bed while the top half of the bed is made and afterwards the bottom half of the bed is made.|$|E

50|$|In 2008, {{as part of}} {{the move}} towards raising standards, YHA {{replaced}} the traditional sheet sleeping bag with a <b>fitted</b> bottom <b>sheet,</b> duvet cover and pillow cases. From 2015, guests at most youth hostels found their beds already made for them.|$|R
5000|$|All cabins {{included}} {{a very simple}} bed and bathroom, with bare amenities. The bathroom for most cabins consisted of a glass walled area containing both toilet and shower. Most beds consisted of a mattress placed {{on the floor with}} a simple <b>fitted</b> bed <b>sheet</b> and duvet. Most of the cabins in size were around 110 square feet (10 m2). Two- and four-passenger cabins were available, as were a limited number of [...] "luxury" [...] suites.|$|R
5000|$|A bottom sheet is laid {{above the}} {{mattress}} and bed occupants lie on it. It may be either a flat sheet (extra fabric is usually tucked under the mattress), or a <b>fitted</b> <b>sheet,</b> which is sewn in a pocket-like shape to go down over {{the corners of the}} mattress, and has an elastic band {{around the edges of the}} sheet to prevent the sheet from slipping. However, this can make it more difficult to fold when not in use.|$|E
5000|$|Bed sheets come in {{two main}} varieties: flat and fitted. A flat sheet is simply a {{rectangular}} sheet of cloth, while a [...] has its four corners, and sometimes two or four sides, fitted with elastic, to be used only as a bottom sheet. The <b>fitted</b> <b>sheet</b> may also be secured using a drawstring instead of elastic. The purpose of a fitted bottom sheet is {{to keep it from}} slipping off the mattress while the bed is in use. A particular way of folding and tucking while making the bed, known as [...] "hospital corners," [...] is sometimes used when the bottom sheet is flat rather than fitted.|$|E
50|$|The chapter {{room has}} nine spans and four pilaster, {{and is used}} for meetings. The church can be {{accessed}} from the cloister. It has a basilica plan with a nave and two aisles; the façade has a large external portico, while behind the altar is the choir, added in 1954 and made by Vincenzo Domenico De Donatis from Sora (1886-1969) and his sons. The windows of the church are <b>fitted</b> with <b>sheets</b> of alabaster rather than glass panels.|$|R
50|$|Twenty-two {{members of}} the new class were ordered at first. Wagons 1-8 were {{delivered}} as class ALF, but later wagons were fitted with bogie exchange equipment from new. The older wagons were refitted and recoded between 1963-1965. These wagons were all <b>fitted</b> with side <b>sheets.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The J-3 is {{distinguished}} from its successors {{by having a}} cowl that exposes its engine's cylinder heads — the exposed cylinders of any J-3's engine were usually <b>fitted</b> with <b>sheet</b> metal [...] "eyebrow" [...] air scoops to direct air over the cylinder's fins for more effective engine cooling in flight. Very few other examples exist of [...] "flat" [...] aircraft engine installations (as opposed to radial engines) in which the cylinder heads are exposed. From the PA-11 on through the present Super Cub models, the cowling surrounds the cylinder heads.|$|R
50|$|Special film holders and {{accessories}} can fit {{in place of}} standard film holders for specific purposes. A Grafmatic, for example, can <b>fit</b> six <b>sheets</b> of film {{in the space of}} an ordinary two-sheet holder, and some light meters have an attachment that inserts into the film holder slot on the camera back so the photographer can measure light that falls at a specific point on the film plane. The entire film holder/back assembly is often an industry standard Graflex back, removable so accessories like roll-film holders and digital imagers can be used without altering focus.|$|R
5000|$|The J-3 is {{distinguished}} from its successors {{by having a}} cowl that exposes its engine's cylinder heads — the exposed cylinders of any J-3's engine were usually <b>fitted</b> with <b>sheet</b> metal [...] "eyebrow" [...] air scoops to direct air over the cylinder's fins for more effective engine cooling in flight.

5000|$|A daybill is one {{variety of}} Australian film poster issued to cinemas {{at the time}} of a film's release. A daybill {{measures}} approximately 13 by 30 in, however during World War II some daybills measured 10 by 30 in because it allowed an additional daybill to <b>fit</b> onto the <b>sheet</b> of paper.|$|R
50|$|Named for a pun on {{the word}} tropical, TropiCurl is {{generally}} held around the July 4th weekend. As an arena curling club, the summer {{is the only time}} the PCC can rent enough ice in order to do all of the pre-bonspiel ice preparation (i.e. two days of flooding and scraping). Without this preparation, the ice, which is typically used for hockey and figure skating, would not be suitable for bonspiel curling. With the arena being able to <b>fit</b> five <b>sheets,</b> TropiCurl hosts 48 teams for four days of curling, {{making it one of the}} larger curling events in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|In fabricating, {{a profile}} {{consists}} of the more-or-less complex outline of a shape to be cut in a sheet of material such as laminated plastic, aluminium alloy or steel plate. In modern practice, a drawing office determines {{the shape and dimensions}} required to <b>fit</b> the <b>sheet</b> into a larger work and feeds directions to a computer controlling a profile cutter. This then cuts the shape from a standard-sized sheet. The cutting head may use a rotating cutter like that of a spindle router or (in the case of steel plate) a torch which burns oxy-acetylene or other oxy-gas.|$|R
50|$|Designed {{and printed}} by Thomas S. Harrison, the note was made longer and {{narrower}} to improve printing efficiency (six notes could <b>fit</b> onto a <b>sheet</b> instead of four) and further security features were added: a basketweave watermark was used around the borders and the denomination appears in watermarks {{in the center}} of the note. 11,290,400 of these notes were printed.|$|R
5000|$|Mohardt {{was born}} in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in January 1898. His family moved to Gary, Indiana, {{while he was a}} child. [...] At the time of the 1920 U.S. Census, Mohardt was living in Gary with his parents and nine younger siblings. Both of his parents were {{immigrants}} from Austria, and his father worked as a pipe <b>fitter</b> in a <b>sheet</b> mill.|$|R

(1999).|$|R
50|$|A set of bedding usually {{consists}} of a flat or <b>fitted</b> bed <b>sheet</b> that covers the mattress; a flat top sheet; either a blanket, quilt, or duvet, sometimes with a duvet cover which can replace or be used {{in addition to the}} top sheet; and a number of pillows with pillowcases, also referred to as pillow shams. (See #Terminology for more info on all these terms.) Additional blankets, etc. may be added to ensure the necessary insulation in cold sleeping areas. A common practice for children and some adults is to decorate a bed with plush stuffed animals, dolls, and other soft toys. These are not included under the designation of bedding, although they may provide additional warmth to the sleeper.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a plastic}} icon system, the blank {{panel on the}} {{communications}} console or a nearby wall is <b>fitted</b> with a <b>sheet</b> of Velcro. The material has vertical stripes painted on it, making a column for each of several possible status conditions. The simplest system is two columns: available and unavailable. Magnetized icons {{can be used in}} place of Velcro. The icons can be coloured or shaped to identify the type of unit or some other feature of the resource.|$|R
50|$|Custom {{parts are}} what make {{choppers}} art, whether it's {{coming up with}} a new frame design or thinking out of the box and using a car rim for the rear. Many builders build their own gas tanks that are similar to full-size motorcycle gas tanks, but scaled down to <b>fit</b> the bikes. <b>Sheet</b> metal parts such as laser cut gussets are also used as accent pieces on the bike. The desire is to produce an individualized piece of mechanical art.|$|R
50|$|Ship armour {{is to be}} {{distinguished}} from the practice of hull sheathing for preservational reasons, namely the protection against marine wood-boring worms. Greek merchantmen were <b>fitted</b> with lead <b>sheets</b> for that purpose by the 5th century BCE. A notable Roman example were the excavated Nemi Ships with an underwater hull covered by {{a thin layer of}} lead. The practice was resumed by the Spanish and Portuguese in the Age of Exploration, while the British Royal Navy began to copper their war ships in the 1760s.|$|R
40|$|The {{contract}} {{work has}} demonstrated that older data can be assessed and entered into the MR format. Older data has associated problems but is retrievable. The contract successfully imported all datasets as required. MNCR survey <b>sheets</b> <b>fit</b> well into the MR format. The data validation and verification process can be improved. A number of computerised short cuts can be suggested and the process made more intuitive. Such a move is vital if MR is to be adopted as a standard by the recording community both on a voluntary level and potentially by consultancies...|$|R
50|$|Early {{designers}} <b>fitted</b> curved <b>sheets</b> {{below the}} steam collector pipe, {{but these were}} not successful as {{the whole of the}} steam space could contain foam. In districts where the feed water is unsuitable, blowdown valves ("scum valves"), either continuously working while the regulator is open or operated in conjunction with the boiler feed, are fitted. Valves at water level reduce surface scum; those towards the bottom of the boiler help remove precipitated solids. Other forms of prevention include the chemical treatment of water before it enters the boiler. In the event of priming (and also when steam is admitted through cold piping or into a cold cylinder) the operators need to open the cylinder cocks, which are designed to release trapped water. Once occurring, the problem can affect the level indicated in the boiler's gauge glass and for this reason is difficult to put right without reducing the water level {{to the extent that the}} firebox crown becomes dangerously exposed.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} showy {{questions}} about the works of Plato and Aristotle rests on them silence brings over of the history. They read and criticized physicists, philosophers, mathematicians, biologists, poets, rhetorical, political, etc. Nevertheless, their appointments about the historians of that moment would <b>fit</b> in a <b>sheet</b> of paper. In this brief article we try to offer an explanation about such an omission. Likewise, we are useful to offer a reason of the Menexenus and to contribute a confirmation {{of the reasons that}} L. Edelstein led to questioning the genuineness of seventh and eighth letters attributed to Plato...|$|R
2500|$|According to writer Spencer Rothbell, {{the show}} was created with a naturalistic tone, similar to {{cartoons}} of the 1990s, combined with a more modern feeling. Given this naturalism, writers can reference works that have inspired for them or fit the genre of an episode. He ultimately {{felt that it was}} about [...] "empowering kids and having fun". Rothbell also avoids [...] "pigeonholing" [...] into one type of story, and that while some plots are mostly character-driven, others are [...] "based on one idea that we think is really funny". Inspiration also came from the shows Page watched as a child, which invoked more poignant and relatable situations. Despite this, elements of fantasy are allowed, and that conveying both incongruous to one another was one technique he particularly enjoyed. Boles noted that the art direction called for inconsistent character design to avoid having to <b>fit</b> model <b>sheet</b> with the universe perfectly—a result of what he dubs the Simpsons effect. Attention is also paid to background characters in order to expand variety in its plot and universe.|$|R
2500|$|Thermal binding uses a {{one-piece}} {{cover with}} glue down the spine to {{quickly and easily}} bind documents {{without the need for}} punching. Individuals usually purchase [...] "thermal covers" [...] or [...] "therm-a-bind covers", which are usually made to <b>fit</b> a standard-size <b>sheet</b> of paper and come with a glue channel down the spine. The paper is placed in the cover, heated in a machine (basically a griddle), and when the glue cools, it adheres the paper to the spine. Thermal glue strips can also be purchased separately for individuals that wish to use customized/original covers. However, creating documents using thermal binding glue strips can be a tedious process, which requires a scoring device and a large-format printer.|$|R
6000|$|... "How ever we're to {{get through}} this voyage, Miss Rachel, I really can't tell," [...] she began with a shake of her head. [...] "There's only just sheets enough to go round, and the master's has a rotten place you could put your fingers through. And the counterpanes. Did you notice the counterpanes? I thought to myself a poor person would have been ashamed of them. The one I gave Mr. Pepper was hardly fit to cover a dog. [...] . No, Miss Rachel, they could not be mended; they're only <b>fit</b> for dust <b>sheets.</b> Why, if one sewed one's finger to the bone, one would have one's work undone the next time they went to the laundry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can't {{have that}} stovepipe up there, that's certain," [...] he said. [...] "We'll {{have to stick}} it out of the side window. It won't look very elegant, but I reckon we're not keeping house on looks up here." [...] And by their united efforts the stove was swung around in front of the little window, and the upper end of {{what was left of the}} pipe was twisted around and pointed outside, after one of the small window panes had been taken out. Around the pipe Mr. Portney <b>fitted</b> a square <b>sheet</b> of tin, {{obtained}} from an empty tomato can. Then the floor was cleared of snow and the fire started up afresh.|$|R
