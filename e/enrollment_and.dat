5|$|Michigan State University (MSU) is {{a public}} {{research}} university in East Lansing, Michigan, United States. MSU was founded in 1855 {{and served as a}} model for land-grant universities later created under the Morrill Act of 1862.

After the introduction of the Morrill Act, the college became coeducational and expanded its curriculum beyond agriculture. Today, MSU {{is one of the largest}} universities in the United States (in terms of <b>enrollment)</b> <b>and</b> has approximately 552,000 living alumni worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The college had a precipitous {{decline in}} <b>enrollment</b> <b>and</b> {{financial}} stability {{during and after}} the Great Depression, weathering the storm under five successive presidents.

In 1943, Shimer president Albin C. Bro invited the Department of Education at the University of Chicago to evaluate the college community; its 77 recommendations became the basis for Shimer's transformation from a conservative finishing school to a nontraditional, co-educational four-year college.|$|E

By the end of the 1950s, the student population was at 10,000, and the renamed San Diego State College was now the fourth largest California state institution. In the 1960s and 1970s the campus saw increased enrollment, the accreditation of its professional schools, multiple incidents of student activism, and on January 1, 1974, a new name: San Diego State University (SDSU). By 1987, the university's population peaked at nearly 36,000 students and attained the status of the largest university in California and tenth in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{signed with}} the University of North Carolina Tar Heels to play for head coach Anson Dorrance. Due to {{national}} team commitments for the FIFA U-19 Women's World Cup in Thailand {{in the fall of}} 2004, Harris delayed her <b>enrollment</b> <b>and</b> did not start training with the Tar Heels until the spring of 2005. During one spring practice, a ball caught her right hand as she was warming up and shattered her thumb. After a surgery that inserted three pins in her thumb, she was put on the bench until the summer. At her first practice back with the Tar Heels in the summer of 2005, Harris tore her right anterior cruciate ligament, which kept her out for the entire 2005 season. Despite being hurt, Harris still made the 2006 Atlantic Coast Conference Academic Honor Roll team.|$|E
5|$|On the {{national}} level, sanctions and suspension of donor aid amounting to 50 percent of {{the national}} budget and 70 percent of public investments obstructed the Rajoelina administration's management of state affairs and its ability to systematically combat poverty on a wider scale. A United Nations envoy concluded in 2011 that Rajoelina's controversial accession to the presidency had reduced food security, with Madagascar ranking among the worst in the world for child nutrition. The frequent non-payment of civil servant and military salaries resulted in regular school and hospital closures, general strikes and widespread increases in corruption. Crime and insecurity grew dramatically, with a sharp upswing in violent crime and theft in Antananarivo and increasingly frequent and deadly incidences of armed cattle rustling in the central southern region of the island. Key development indicators steeply declined between 2009 and 2013, including maternal and child mortality, education <b>enrollment</b> <b>and</b> completion, per capita income and employment rates. In 2010 the United Nations ranked Madagascar among the ten poorest countries in the world, noting that economic gains made under Ravalomanana had been lost following Rajoelina's unconstitutional rise to power. In 2011, Forbes magazine ranked Madagascar as the worst economy in the world, faulting its political instability and poor governance.|$|E
30|$|These {{findings}} are generally confirmed in Tables  3 B and C, which show the results broken out {{by race and}} FRL status. While differences in academic and labor market outcomes are partly accounted for by differences in high school achievement across these groups, important differences remain within particular levels of achievement. For instance, we find that black BA <b>enrollments</b> <b>and</b> postsecondary credits are often {{higher than those of}} whites within achievement quartiles, but their completion rates at all levels lag behind, as do their labor market earnings and attainment of work experience. In addition, FRL students lag behind non-FRL students in BA <b>enrollments</b> (<b>and</b> in AA <b>enrollments</b> below the top quartile), all intermediate postsecondary outcomes, and in earnings.|$|R
