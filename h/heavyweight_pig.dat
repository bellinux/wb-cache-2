40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of <b>heavyweight</b> <b>pig</b> removal and remixing on performance. The experiment used a total of 450 pigs (31 kg initial BW) that were sorted and remixed at a mean replicate BW of 73 kg. Treatments were 15 pigs/pen from initial BW to slaughter (15 S), 20 pigs/pen from initial BW to time of sort and remix, then reduced to 15 pigs/pen (20 / 15), and 15 pigs/pen from time of sort and remix to slaughter, comprised of the 5 heaviest pigs from each of three 20 / 15 pens per replicate (15 M). Space allocation was 0. 56 m 2 /pig to the day of remixing and 0. 74 m 2 /pig thereafter. There was no effect (P 3 ̆e 0. 1) of treatment on ADG before 73 kg BW when pens were 1 A contribution of the University of Nebraska Agricultural Research Division, Lincoln, NE 68583.

There was no effect (P 3 ̆e 0. 1) of treatment on ADG or feed conversion to slaughter BW following removal and remixing using the contrast 20 / 15 + 15 M vs. 15 S. The average of the replicate for 20 / 15 and 15 M was used as the experimental unit in a second statistical analysis. Daily feed was less (P = 0. 079) from placement to 73 kg BW for the 20 / 15 + 15 M population vs. the 15 S population resulting in a lesser (P = 0. 067) overall ADG (0. 875 vs. 0. 887 kg/d, respectively) with no effect (P 3 ̆e 0. 1) on feed conversion or CV sample population BW.

40|$|The most {{critical}} {{period in the}} life cycle of a pig is from birth to weaning. On the average, about two pigs per litter are lost during this period. Poor management is the major contributing factor, although the actual cause may be crushing, bleeding from the navel, anemia, starvation or disease.

40|$|The {{effects of}} feed-withdrawal time on finishing-pig carcass {{composition}} and net returns were determined in 2 studies. In Exp. 1, {{a total of}} 728 pigs (BW = 286. 4 ± 2. 7 lb, 10 to 19 pigs per pen) were marketed from 48 pens that {{were randomly assigned to}} 1 of 4 treatments: feed withdrawal times of 7, 24, 36, or 48 h before harvest. Pigs were fed a common corn-soybean meal diet containing dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) and bakery co-products. As expected, increased feed withdrawal time decreased (linear; P 0. 32) between treatments as HCW decreased in fasted pigs, but feed intake per pig also decreased (quadratic; P 0. 22) in HCW, percentage lean, or backfat depth across treatments. However, as in Exp. 1, percentage yield (linear; P 0. 31) on the incidence of runny bung, it did increase (linear; P 0. 32) across treatments, withholding feed decreased (quadratic; P 0. 88) across treatments, but withholding feed decreased (linear; P < 0. 001) feed intake, resulting in feed savings of up to $ 0. 46 /pig. Overall, withholding feed can be used to avoid weight discounts in <b>heavyweight</b> <b>pigs</b> without negatively impacting carcass composition and maintaining overall revenue per pig. However, these advantages come with a potential reduction in carcass weight and increased incidence of leaking ingesta, which can result in condemned heads at inspection and losses of $ 3 to 4 per carcass...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJoel DeRoucheyThirteen {{experiments}} using a {{total of}} 7, 589 nursery and finishing pigs were conducted to evaluate the effects of deoxynivalenol (DON), feed additives and processing conditions on nursery pig growth performance. In addition, feed withdrawal and diet blending were evaluated in finishing pigs. Experiment 1 tested 3 feed additives in DON-contaminated diets with only Defusion Plus improving performance. Experiment 2 evaluated Biofix in both low- and high-DON diets and showed no effects on growth. Experiments 3 and 4 further evaluated levels of Defusion {{and the effects of}} pelleting and supplemental nutrients in DON-contaminated diets. Defusion improved growth in low-DON diets, but had variable effects in high DON diets. Pelleting DON-contaminated diets resulted in comparable growth to pigs fed positive control diets in meal form. In Exp. 5 and 6, pilot studies evaluated DON-detoxification using sodium metabisulfite (SMB) with hydrothermal treatment in both an autoclave and a pellet mill. These conditions reduced analyzed DON by as much as 89 and 75 % for the autoclave and pellet mill, respectively. In Exp. 7 and 8, pelleting DON-contaminated diets with SMB improved growth. Experiments 9 and 10 evaluated feed-withdrawal time on carcass composition and economic returns. These experiments showed that pre-slaughter fasting for up to 36 h prior can be used to avoid weight discounts in <b>heavyweight</b> <b>pigs</b> without negatively impacting carcass composition and maintaining overall revenue. However, these advantages come with a potential reduction in carcass weight and increased incidence of leaking ingesta, which can result in condemned heads. Experiments 11, 12, and 13 compared phase-feeding to blending diets using an automated feed delivery system. These studies showed that corn-supplement blending is not economical and feeding diets blended to a Lys curve results in lower feed costs compared to phase-feeding, but due to reductions in growth and carcass weight, these savings do not translate into higher income over feed cost. Finally, Exp. 13 showed that over- and under-budgeting situations do not significantly influence overall returns, but pigs fed under-budgeted diets performed more closely to those fed correctly estimated feed budgets...|$|R

NelssenA {{total of}} 188 sows and their litters {{were used in}} 2 {{experiments}} to evaluate methods to induce estrus and ovulation in lactating sows and effects on pig growth. In Exp. 1, an altered suckling method (ALT) was designed to combine split-weaning and intermittent suckling {{as a means to}} reduce the suckling stimulus in primi- and multiparous sows during the last week of lactation (d 18 to 25). The ALT sows were also removed for daily boar exposure. The ALT treatment produced lactational estrus in 75 % and 95 % of primiparous and multiparous sows, respectively. The ALT sows were in estrus earlier (P < 0. 01) than controls post-farrowing, with no effect on subsequent reproductive performance. From d 18 to 32, the ALT treatment benefited (P < 0. 01) growth of lightweight pigs but decreased (P < 0. 01) BW gain of <b>heavyweight</b> <b>pigs,</b> resulting in overall similar growth. However, variation in BW was reduced (P < 0. 01) by 50 % for ALT litters. In Exp. 2, varying suckling reduction strategies were applied to boar-exposed lactating sows. Overall, 76 % of sows in suckling reduction treatments expressed estrus in lactation. Split-weaned and ALT sows performed reproductively similar to controls, whereas sows with daily litter separation or a single 24 h litter removal tended (P < 0. 10) to have reduced conception rates versus controls or split-weaned sows. Reduced suckling treatments differed in their ability to induce lactational estrus and impact on pig BW gain immediately post-weaning. However, no evidence was found of benefit for pig growth to market weight or litter BW variation. Four additional experiments using 902 nursery pigs were conducted to test the efficacy of potential detoxifying agents against deoxynivalenol (DON) in swine diets. The effects of DON were not offset by adding an algae-modified montmorillonite clay nor by a proprietary blend of preservatives and clays. However, hydrothermally treating DON-contaminated diets with sodium metabisulfite modified the structure of DON to a non-toxic DON-sulfonate adduct and restored nursery pig growth via improved (P < 0. 05) ADG, ADFI and G:F...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 627 pigs (241. 5 lb) {{were used in}} a 21 -d {{finishing}} trial to evaluate the effects of feeding ractopamine HCl (RAC; Paylean, Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN) for different durations on growth performance and carcass characteristics. On d 0, pens of pigs containing both barrows and gilts in approximately equal numbers were blocked by average BW and randomly allotted to 1 of 3 dietary treatments (8 pens per treatment) with average initial weight balanced across treatments. Dietary treatments were feeding a control diet without RAC and feeding a diet containing 4. 5 g/ton RAC for the last 14 or 21 d prior to marketing. Pens of pigs were weighed and feed intake was collected on d 0, 7, and 21 to calculate ADG, ADFI, and F/G. Carcass {{data were collected from}} the 4 heaviest pigs per pen marketed on d 7 and from all pigs marketed on d 21. Pigs fed RAC starting on d 0 gained faster (P = 0. 01) and consumed less feed (P = 0. 01) from d 0 to 7 than control pigs and pigs not yet fed RAC. From d 7 to 21, pigs started on RAC at d 7 had improved (P ≤ 0. 04) ADG and F/G compared with control pigs and pigs that remained on RAC. There was no difference (P = 0. 14) in overall ADG between the treatment groups; however, ADFI was lower (P < 0. 01) and F/G improved (P < 0. 01) for pigs fed RAC, regardless of duration, compared with control pigs. There were no differences (P ≥ 0. 32) in overall live weight or HCW at market in this trial. Compared with control pigs, pigs fed RAC for 21 d had reduced (P < 0. 01) backfat depth, increased (P = 0. 01) loin depth, and improved (P < 0. 01) percentage lean. Pigs fed RAC for 14 d had intermediate responses to these 2 treatments for loin and backfat depth but had a higher percentage lean than control pigs. These data demonstrate that feeding RAC to pigs for 14 d reduced ADFI, improved F/G, and improved percentage lean compared with control pigs. Feeding RAC for an additional 7 d did not influence overall ADFI or F/G compared with feeding RAC for 14 d total but further improved percentage lean compared with feeding RAC for 14 d. Pigs fed RAC for 21 d had decreased backfat and increased loin depth compared with control pigs. This study demonstrates that for <b>heavyweight</b> <b>pigs,</b> F/G and ADFI responses are achieved with either duration of RAC feeding, but the magnitude of the carcass response to feeding RAC appears to be duration dependent...|$|R
