5|$|Some Japanese holdouts, {{especially}} on small Pacific Islands, refused to surrender at all (believing the declaration to be propaganda or considering surrender against their code). Some {{may never have}} <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Teruo Nakamura, the last known holdout, emerged from his hidden retreat in Indonesia in December 1974, while two other Japanese soldiers, who had joined Communist guerrillas {{at the end of}} the war, fought in southern Thailand until 1991.|$|E

5|$|On 10July, {{the same}} day as Jane's proclamation, a letter from Mary Tudor arrived in London, saying that she was now queen and {{demanding}} the obedience of the Council. Mary was assembling her supporters in East Anglia; it was decided to take the field against her after some discussion over who should go, in which Jane made sure that her father should not. The Duke of Northumberland marched to Cambridge with his troops and passed a week that saw no action, until he heard on 20July that the Council in London had declared for Mary. Northumberland now proclaimed Mary Tudor himself at the market-place and was arrested the next morning. On 19July, a few hours before Queen Mary I's proclamation in London, the baptism of one of the Gentlemen Pensioners' children took place. Jane had agreed to be the godmother and wished the child's name to be Guildford. The Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, who had been imprisoned in the Tower for five years, took great offence at this fact as he <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

Its observer was armed with the new Schneider gun ring that was becoming standard on all German two-seaters: the pilot was apparently armed with a fixed synchronized machine gun. The aircraft crashed {{on its way to the}} front and nothing more was <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> or its synchronization gear, although it was presumably based on Schneider's own patent.|$|E
25|$|Today, Pesach Sheni on the 14th of Iyar has {{the status}} of a very minor holiday (so much so that many of the Jewish people have never even <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and it {{essentially}} does not exist outside of Orthodox and traditional Conservative Judaism). There are not really any special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities Tachanun, a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is not said. There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} claimed that Boys had one meeting with Napoleon {{though there is}} no {{documentary}} evidence of it having taken place. When Cipriani, Napoleon's major-domo died, Boys and his junior chaplain buried the man, a Catholic, according to the rites of the Protestant Church. Napoleon was astonished when he <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and said a priest would not have done so much for a Protestant. As a token of appreciation of their conduct Napoleon desired to give the two chaplains a present. A snuffbox was purchased in Jamestown and offered to Boys, but was refused owing to the severe penalties attached to any acceptance of gifts from the exile.|$|E
500|$|Psychoanalytic interpretations {{have proved}} more {{difficult}} to depict on stage. Gerald Freedman's production at the American Shakespeare Theatre in 1979 and Ron Daniels' Royal Shakespeare Company production in 1982 both attempted to depict Ariel and Caliban as opposing aspects of Prospero's psyche. However neither was regarded as wholly successful: Shakespeare Quarterly, reviewing Freedman's production, commented, [...] "Mr. Freedman did nothing on stage {{to make such a}} notion clear to any audience that had not <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> before." ...|$|E

500|$|The map was poorly {{distributed}} to the people at high risk from Ruiz: many survivors had never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> even though several of the country's major newspapers featured versions of the map. Henry Villegas of INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) stated that the hazard maps clearly demonstrated that Armero {{would be affected by}} the lahars, but that the map [...] "met with strong opposition from economic interests." [...] He added that because the map was not prepared long before the eruption, mass production and distribution of it in time was difficult.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, the King suffered several heart attacks, {{but refused}} to go to bed, saying, [...] "No, I shall not give in; I shall go on; I shall work to the end." [...] Between moments of faintness, his son the Prince of Wales (shortly to be King George V) {{told him that his}} horse, Witch of the Air, had won at Kempton Park that afternoon. The King replied, [...] "Yes, I have <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> I am very glad": his final words. At 11:30p.m. he lost consciousness for the last time and was put to bed. He died 15 minutes later.|$|E
500|$|In early November, France's {{ambassador}} to the U.S., Pierre Adet, inserted himself into the political debate on behalf of Jefferson, publishing statements designed to arouse anti-British sentiment and to leave the impression that a Jefferson victory would result in improved relations with France. Then, late in the campaign, Alexander Hamilton, desiring [...] "a more pliant president than Adams," [...] maneuvered to tip the election to Pinckney. He coerced South Carolina Federalist electors, pledged to vote for [...] "favorite son" [...] Pinckney, to scatter their second votes among candidates other than Adams. Hamilton's scheme was undone, however, when several New England state electors <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> conferred, and agreed not to vote for Pinckney.|$|E

500|$|One Mission (poem). A Theme {{under the}} Name [...] "Imperator" [...] (Одна Мысль (поэма) — Тема под названием «Император») (October / November 1867): {{begins as a}} poem until interlineations occur. Appeared in the same {{notebook}} as The Idiot, suggesting {{that it is an}} additional text to that novel. The protagonist has similar traits as Prince Myshkin. The main influence is Mikhail Semevsky's work about the life of Ivan VI from 1740 to 1764, a part of Russkaya Starina. Dostoyevsky may have already <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in Geneva, where he stayed between October and November 1867. One Mission was reworked by Grigory Danilevsky and included in Milovich, which appeared in 1879 in The Russian Messenger alongside The Brothers Karamazov.|$|E
500|$|Drake {{delivered}} the tapes of Pink Moon to Chris Blackwell at Island Records, contrary {{to a popular}} legend which claims he dropped them off at the receptionist's desk without saying a word. An advertisement for the album in Melody Maker in February opened with [...] "Pink Moon—Nick Drake's latest album: the first we <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was when it was finished." [...] Pink Moon sold fewer copies than either of its predecessors, although it received some favourable reviews. In Zigzag magazine, Connor McKnight wrote, [...] "Nick Drake is an artist who never fakes. The album makes no concession to the theory that music should be escapist. It's simply one musician's view of life at the time, and you can't ask for more than that." ...|$|E

I am fully persuaded, that it is unnecessary to caution you against offering insult or indignity to the persons of the Prince or Admiral..."

500|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, fears grew among Hamilton {{and his supporters}} that Adams was too vain, opinionated, unpredictable and stubborn to follow their directions once elected. Desiring [...] "a more pliant president than Adams," [...] Hamilton maneuvered to tip the election to Pinckney. He coerced South Carolina Federalist electors, pledged to vote for [...] "favorite son" [...] Pinckney, to scatter their second votes among candidates other than Adams. Hamilton's scheme was undone, however, when several New England state electors <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> conferred, and agreed not to vote for Pinckney. Adams was nonetheless angered, writing shortly after the election that Hamilton was a [...] "proud Spirited, conceited, aspiring Mortal always pretending to Morality, with as debauched Morals as old Franklin who is more his Model than any one I know." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{setting of}} Gone to Coney Island is Coney Island, a popular {{amusement}} park and picture subject. One review in The Moving Picture World {{went so far}} as to give a review that was devoid of meaning by stating, [...] "Not much further explanation is needed. Those who have been there and those who have <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> know what it means. Perhaps nothing further is required." [...] Bowers notes that the popularity of Coney Island was itself able to make a successful film regardless of the scenario involved. Booming Business is notable because it appears to have contained slapstick comedy if The New York Dramatic Mirror review was accurate. Edwin Thanhouser specifically stated that the company would not produce slapstick comedy in an article in The Moving Picture World.|$|E
500|$|In September 1985, as {{earthquakes}} and phreatic eruptions rocked {{the area around}} the volcano, officials began planning for evacuation. A hazard map was prepared in October; it highlighted the danger from falling ash and rock near Murillo, Santa Isabel, and Líbano, as well as the threat of lahars in Mariquita, Guayabal, Chinchiná, and Armero. The map was poorly distributed to those at highest risk: many survivors had never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> though several major newspapers had featured it. Henry Villegas of the Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology stated that the maps clearly demonstrated Armero would be affected by the lahars, but had [...] "met with strong opposition from economic interests."
