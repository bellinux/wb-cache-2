5|$|A teleporting mutant. This was will.i.am's major live-action film debut. Although he {{initially}} {{did not get}} on with the casting director, he got the role because he wanted to play a mutant with the same power as Nightcrawler. He enrolled in boot camp to get into shape for the part. When filming a fight, he scarred <b>his</b> <b>knuckles</b> after accidentally punching and breaking the camera.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, James Howlett, a boy {{living in}} Canada, {{witnesses}} his father {{being killed by}} groundskeeper Thomas Logan. The anxiety activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from <b>his</b> <b>knuckles,</b> and he impales Thomas, who reveals that he is James's birth father before dying. James flees along with Thomas's other son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother and has a healing factor mutation like James. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James happens upon the fight and defends Victor, resulting in the pair being sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive due to their mutant healing abilities. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but Victor and the group's lack of empathy for human life causes Logan to leave.|$|E

500|$|The last scene, {{in which}} the beggar tries to sell martial arts manuals, refers {{directly}} to the greatest skills in Louis Cha's Condor Trilogy (Nine Yang Manual, [...] "Yiyang Finger", and [...] "Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms"), [...] "Thousand Hand Divine Fist", and The Smiling, Proud Wanderer ("Nine Swords of Dugu"). The scene {{in which the}} landlady confronts Brother Sum {{in the back of}} his car is a homage to Bruce Lee in Way of the Dragon, where he cracks <b>his</b> <b>knuckles</b> and gives a quick upper nod to the mafia boss, telling him to back off.|$|E
500|$|Indie {{rock band}} The Format {{released}} a music video for their song [...] "Dog Problems" [...] in November 2006. The video, which includes Nate Ruess of Fun {{as the lead}} singer alongside Sam Means and Steven Shane McDonald, was inspired by Oobi and features hand puppets {{in the style of}} the show. Ruess is represented in the video by a puppet wearing a bowler hat on <b>his</b> <b>knuckles,</b> in a fashion similar to the Oobi character Kako (who also sports a cap). It begins with Ruess's character creating a shadow puppet, but [...] "the set-ups get increasingly intricate and clever as things progress out into the real world and onto various parodies," [...] one of which features a quartet of Oobi puppets spoofing Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody".|$|E

500|$|On the Broadway beat, Broderick swiftly {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for violence. His fists were once described as [...] "huge lethal pistons that could beat a man senseless in half a heartbeat," [...] and to [...] "broderick" [...] became Broadway slang for being knocked out by a single punch. <b>His</b> <b>knuckles</b> were broken many times. Once he knocked out the gangster Francis [...] "Two Gun" [...] Crowley with a single punch, even though Crowley was pointing a gun at him. He {{was said to have}} demanded that hoodlums tip their hat to him, and once was said to have gone to the funeral of a member of the Hudson Dusters gang and spat in his eye. Broderick would wrap a lead pipe in a newspaper, which allowed him to beat gangsters while it looked like he was giving them a friendly swat with a rolled-up newspaper.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{contains}} elements of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho with Sideshow Bob staying at Bates Motel. Homer surprising Bart {{with his new}} hockey mask recalls the film Friday the 13th Part III and Sideshow Bob's tattoos on <b>his</b> <b>knuckles</b> {{are similar to those}} of Robert Mitchum's character in The Night of the Hunter (Mitchum also played the villain Max Cady in the original 1962 version of Cape Fear). While singing [...] "Three Little Maids From School Are We" [...] from The Mikado during the car trip to Terror Lake, Homer and Bart's hats allude to I Love Lucy. The scene featuring Ned with his [...] "finger razors" [...] references the 1984 film A Nightmare on Elm Street and its villain Freddy Krueger (with Flanders seemingly threatening Bart with the razors) and the 1990 film Edward Scissorhands (with Flanders actually using the razors to cut his hedge in the shape of an angel, just as Edward Scissorhands cuts a hedge in the shape of a dinosaur).|$|E
500|$|Then-president of NBC Entertainment Kevin Reilly played Dwight's first interviewer. Ed Helms {{noted in}} the audio {{commentary}} {{that his mother had}} trouble watching a string of episodes that included [...] "The Return" [...] because she found his character so annoying. Helms recorded the self-recorded cellphone ring on his own personal computer. For the big anger scene, Helms actually bloodied <b>his</b> <b>knuckles</b> while punching the wall, something that took five or six takes. Steve Carell and Rainn Wilson had difficulty with their reuniting scene and had to stage it in several different ways. As part of the episode is set in one of their stores, office supply chain Staples Inc. watched the episode carefully to ensure they were not portrayed negatively; they were particularly afraid that Dwight's manner of quitting was disrespectful to the company. At the time [...] "The Return" [...] aired, no one was certain Helms would be returning. In early February, NBC confirmed Helms had been hired on as a series regular {{for the rest of the}} year, with the actor returning in the season's nineteenth episode, [...] "The Negotiation".|$|E

500|$|Although {{fighting}} was rarer from the 1920s through the 1960s, {{it was often}} brutal in nature; author Ross Bernstein said of the game's early years that it [...] "was probably more like rugby on skates than it was modern hockey." [...] Star players were also known to fight for themselves during the Original Six era, when fewer teams existed than in later years. However, as the NHL's expansion in the late 1960s created more roster spots and spread star players more widely throughout the league, enforcers (who usually possess limited overall skill sets) became more common. Multiple fights during the era received significant media attention. In an NHL preseason game between the Boston Bruins and St. Louis Blues in 1969, Bruins defenceman Ted Green and Blues left wing Wayne Maki, attacking Green, engaged in a bloody stick-swinging fight that resulted in Green sustaining a skull fracture. In 1978, World Hockey Association Birmingham Bulls enforcer Dave Hanson, known for his 11-year professional career, fought Hall of Famer Bobby Hull {{and in the process}} got Hull's wig caught in <b>his</b> <b>knuckles.</b> The incident landed Hanson in the news, and irate Winnipeg fans attempted to assault him on {{his way out of the}} arena. [...] Hanson appeared in the 1977 movie Slap Shot, a comedy about hockey violence.|$|E
500|$|... is {{the leader}} of Team 10 and son of the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi and uncle of Konohamaru Sarutobi. In battle, Asuma wields trench knives that he can infuse with his wind nature chakra to extend the blades' length and sharpness. When he was younger, Asuma had a dispute with his father and briefly left Konohagakure in protest, gaining fame {{as a member of the}} Land of Fire's Twelve Guardian Shinobi. Though Asuma {{eventually}} returned, gaining the resolve to protect Konoha's next generation from his experiences outside his home, he never completely reconciled with his father by the time of Hiruzen's death. Asuma is usually seen smoking a cigarette, but will temporarily drop the habit when something is bothering him, such as when his father died. Among all his students, Asuma shares a particularly close relationship with Shikamaru Nara, often playing go or shogi together. Asuma frequently appears alongside his childhood friend Kurenai Yuhi, denying having a relation before it is revealed that Kurenai is bearing his child. After Asuma is killed by Hidan of the criminal organization Akatsuki, Shikamaru inherited his mentor's ideals as he uses <b>his</b> <b>knuckles</b> to defeat Hidan. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Asuma is brought back with the Reanimation Jutsu to fight for Kabuto before being defeated by his students and sealed until his soul is allowed to return to the afterlife. Asuma's voice actor in the Japanese anime is Jūrōta Kosugi, and he is voiced by Doug Erholtz in the English adaptation.|$|E

2500|$|When Gladstone first joined Palmerston's {{government}} in 1859, he had opposed further electoral reform, but {{he changed his}} position during Palmerston's last premiership, and by 1865 he was firmly in favour of enfranchising the working classes in towns; the policy caused friction with Palmerston, who strongly opposed enfranchisement. [...] At {{the beginning of each}} session, Gladstone would passionately urge the Cabinet to adopt new policies, while Palmerston would fixedly stare at a paper before him.

2500|$|Rahane {{made his}} debut in Test cricket on 22 March 2013 against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, Delhi. According to the media, Rahane got this chance through [...] "sheer luck". Shikhar Dhawan, {{who made a}} {{dazzling}} start to {{his career in the}} third Test at Mohali, scoring 187 on debut, was the obvious choice for the Delhi Test until he suffered an injury to <b>his</b> <b>knuckles</b> on his left hand. Gautam Gambhir, who was picked as a replacement for Dhawan, was sidelined owing to jaundice. Rahane was handed his India Test cap which brought an end to a lean patch for Mumbai, who had not produced a Test player for India since May 2007. Two single-digit scores in the game prompted many to question Rahane's ability to handle pressure and replicate his domestic success at the international level.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{received}} polarizing {{reviews from}} music critics. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine praised {{the composition of}} the song, writing [...] "Harris's electro fingerprints are all over this one — it plays like a straight house track, with some dreamy Rihanna vocals added in over the beat." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator commented on the song's lyrics, with particular emphasis on the line [...] "We found love in a hopeless place", writing that it is possibly the best lyric in pop music so far in 2011. A reviewer for Instinct magazine praised the song, writing that [...] "We Found Love" [...] does not mark a departure from the dance-floor oriented material Rihanna debuted on Loud, but it certainly boasts [...] "a higher-energy, peak-hour vibe". Similarly, Michael Cragg of The Guardian commented that the song takes the dance direction Rihanna hinted at on [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] and continues releasing similar songs, making reference to [...] "We Found Love". Cragg also likened the song to Leona Lewis's recent single, [...] "Collide", but criticized the song's structure, writing [...] " [...] is slightly odd". He ended his review writing, [...] "Either way, she could have recited Nick Clegg's conference speech from Wednesday over the sound of Harris cracking <b>his</b> <b>knuckles</b> {{and it would be a}} hit." ...|$|E
