500|$|Speaking on his collaborations {{with the}} producers, Songz {{said that on}} Ready, [...] "we're {{breaking}} down every song, every hook, every chorus, every bridge, and we're making sure every song is the best song it could be. This album isn't {{just going to be}} a compilation of songs, but a classic body of work." [...] The album only contained three guest features with Drake, Gucci Mane and Soulja Boy Tell 'Em. Songz wanted to keep the amount of features very limited, and stated that [...] "anybody else I add <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> special". American rapper Fabolous was added as a guest feature on the track, titled [...] "Say Aah".|$|E

It's going to be the best one, I hope... Well, I would say that, but I really do feel that, and I feel this <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different. This is Wolverine.

The film was scheduled to begin principal photography in March 2011 in New York City before the production moves to Japan for the bulk of shooting.|$|E

500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite what it looks like or what it can do...The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic in shape, and the critic Tim Dirks mentions its 'open, dripping vaginal mouth.|$|E
500|$|Jack and Helen were {{initiated}} into the Agape Lodge, the renamed Church of Thelema, in February 1941. Parsons adopted the Thelemic motto of Thelema Obtenteum Proedero Amoris Nuptiae, a Latin mistranslation of [...] "The establishment of Thelema through {{the rituals of}} love". The initials of this motto spelled out T.O.P.A.N., also serving as the declaration [...] "To Pan". Commenting on Parsons' errors of translation, in jest Crowley said that [...] "the motto which you mention is couched in a language beyond my powers of understanding". Parsons also adopted the Thelemic title Frater T.O.P.A.N—with T.O.P.A.N represented in Kabbalistic numerology as 210the name with which he frequently signed letters to occult associates—while Helen became known as Soror Grimaud. Smith wrote to Crowley saying that Parsons was [...] "a really excellent man... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself... JP <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> valuable". Wolfe wrote to German O.T.O. representative Karl Germer that Parsons was [...] "an A1 man... Crowleyesque in attainment {{as a matter of}} fact", and mooted Parsons as a potential successor to Crowley as Outer Head of the Order. Crowley concurred with such assessments, informing Smith that Parsons [...] "is the most valued member of the whole Order, with no exception!" ...|$|E
500|$|Waugh {{worked on}} the Pinfold novel {{intermittently}} {{during the next two}} years. After his return from Jamaica he set the book aside, confining his writing to journalism and occasional prefaces—"neat little literary jobs". There is no mention of Pinfold in his diary or in letters. Waugh's biographer Martin Stannard describes Waugh at this time as physically lazy, unable to harness his still considerable mental energies—the diary entry for 12 July 1955 notes the pattern of his days: [...] "the morning post, the newspaper, the crossword, gin". Waugh's longstanding feud with the Beaverbrook press preoccupied him, particularly after an uninvited visit to Piers Court by the Daily Express journalist Nancy Spain in June, that left Waugh [...] "tremulous with rage". In March 1956 Spain attacked Waugh in an Express article, after which he began a libel action against her and her paper. Meanwhile, preparations for his daughter Teresa's coming-out ball provided a further hindrance to progress on the novel. It is not until 11 September 1956 that his diary records: [...] "I have resumed work on Pinfold". Soon after, he was writing 1,000 words a day—on 26 September he told his friend Ann Fleming that [...] "the mad book <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> funny I believe". A week later he asked his friend Daphne Fielding for permission to dedicate the book to her.|$|E

500|$|When {{it became}} clear that Foster would skip Hannibal, the {{production}} team considered several different actresses, including Cate Blanchett, Angelina Jolie, Gillian Anderson, Hilary Swank, Ashley Judd, Helen Hunt and Julianne Moore. Hopkins asked his agent if he had any [...] "power" [...] over casting. He informed De Laurentiis that he knew Moore, with whom he had worked on Surviving Picasso, and thought her a [...] "terrific actress". Although Hopkins' agent told him he had no contractual influence on casting, Scott thought it correct to discuss who would be Hopkins' [...] "leading lady". Scott said he was [...] "really surprised to find that [...] had five of the top actresses in Hollywood wanting it." [...] Moore would eventually secure the part. Scott said his decision was swayed in favor of Moore because: [...] "She is a true chameleon. She can be a lunatic in Magnolia, a vamp in An Ideal Husband, a porn star in Boogie Nights and a romantic in The End of the Affair." [...] "Julianne Moore, once Jodie decided to pass, was always top of my list," [...] said Scott on his female lead. Moore talked about stepping into a role made famous by another actress: [...] "The new Clarice would be very different. Of course people are going to compare my interpretation with that of Jodie Foster's... but this film <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different." ...|$|E
500|$|Activities {{picked up}} again when Kahl, {{who worked as}} a drama teacher, brought three of her {{interested}} students into the group, among them Phyllis Seckler, and other individuals also joined the group, among them Louis T. Culling and Roy Leffingwell. However, the rising number of members caused schisms and arguments, and the Lodge again ceased its private activities from March 1940 to March 1941. They returned to their activities to initiate a couple who had become interested in the O.T.O. through attending the Gnostic Mass, rocket scientist Jack Parsons and his wife Helen. Parsons became enamored with Thelema, although initially expressed both [...] "repulsion and attraction" [...] for Smith. Smith wrote to Crowley, claiming that Parsons was [...] "a really excellent man... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself... JP <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> valuable". The Parsons would help bring new members into the group; Grady McMurtry and his fiancee Claire Palmer, and Helen's sister Sara Northrup. In February 1939 a young college student who had attended the mass, Ayna Sosoyena, was murdered; although police drew no connection to the Lodge, sensationalist local tabloids connected the two, although were unaware that the Lodge was involved with Crowley or Thelema. A sympathetic local radio reporter allowed Smith to explain the purpose of the Mass to allay fears of the group, but the interview was never aired in an agreement with local press that they would drop the story.|$|E
500|$|Ion Storm {{solicited}} {{feedback from}} fans after demonstrating progress on Anachronox at E3 1998, and assured {{inclusion of a}} multiplayer mode. Tom Hall touted, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> cinematic and about as non-linear as you can get. Some levels will be bigger than anything ever seen in a 3-D environment. We are really pushing the engine for this, with loads of textures." [...] Developers made two demonstrations; the second featured lasers, lens flare, and volumetric fog. The gaming press received Anachronox well; one reporter wrote the game was [...] "stunningly beautiful... {{some of the most}} superb effects ever seen in a computer game, including rippling water, stunning laser lights and shadow effects". Another wrote that the game would be [...] "graphically spectacular, with detailed characters". Panelists at E3 nominated Anachronox in the [...] "Most Promising Game" [...] and [...] "Best RPG" [...] categories for the Game Critics Awards. Ion Storm planned for a 1999 release, and unveiled new screenshots at the 1998 European Computer Trade Show. Among the game's maps developed in 1998 were Hephaestus (polished by David Namaksy); Whitendon (Iikka Keränen); Democratus, [...] "Matrix 0", and certain interiors of Anachronox (Larry Herring); and the city of Limbus (Rich Carlson). Lead programmer Joey Liaw left Ion Storm to attend Stanford University in mid-1998. That November, several developers at Ion Storm departed to form their own company; among them was David Namaksy, lead level designer for Anachronox.|$|E
