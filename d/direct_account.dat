5|$|After this point, an African {{location}} {{became increasingly}} popular. This {{may have resulted}} from increasing ties between Europe and Africa as 1428 saw the Kings of Aragon and Ethiopia actively negotiating {{the possibility of a}} strategic marriage between the two kingdoms. On 7 May 1487, two Portuguese envoys, Pêro da Covilhã and Afonso de Paiva, were sent traveling secretly overland to gather information on a possible sea route to India, but also to inquire about Prester John. Covilhã managed to reach Ethiopia. Although well received, he was forbidden to depart. More envoys were sent in 1507, after Socotra was taken by the Portuguese. As a result of this mission, and facing Muslim expansion, regent queen Eleni of Ethiopia sent ambassador Mateus to king Manuel I of Portugal and to the Pope, in search of a coalition. Mateus reached Portugal via Goa, having returned with a Portuguese embassy, along with priest Francisco Álvares in 1520. Francisco Álvares' book, which included the testimony of Covilhã, the Verdadeira Informação das Terras do Preste João das Indias ("A True Relation of the Lands of Prester John of the Indies") was the first <b>direct</b> <b>account</b> of Ethiopia, greatly increasing European knowledge at the time, as it was presented to the pope, published and quoted by Giovanni Battista Ramusio.|$|E

In one of them,[28] I found, in a sort of postscript, by way of an additional remark, (not {{in the body of the}} obligation,) the debt represented at 1,400,000l.: but when I computed the sums to be paid for interest by instalments in another paper, I found they produced an interest of two millions, at twelve per cent; and the assignment supposed, that, if these instalments might exceed, they might also fall short of, the real provision for that interest.[29] Another instalment-bond was afterwards granted: in that bond the interest exactly tallies with a capital of 1,400,000l.:[30] but pursuing this capital through the correspondence, I lost sight of it again, and it was asserted that this instalment-bond was considerably short of the interest that ought to be computed to the time mentioned.[31] ...|$|E
6000|$|Of Stella herself we {{naturally}} have no <b>direct</b> <b>account</b> in the Journal, but {{we hear a}} {{good deal}} of her life in Ireland, and can picture what she was. Among her friends in and about Trim and Laracor were Dr. Raymond, the vicar of Trim, and his wife, the Garret Wesleys, the Percevals, and Mr. Warburton, Swift's curate. At Dublin there were Archdeacon Walls and his family; Alderman Stoyte, his wife and sister-in-law; Dean Sterne and the Irish Postmaster-General, Isaac Manley. For years these friends formed a club which met in Dublin at each other's houses, to sup and play cards ("ombre and claret, and toasted oranges"), and we have frequent allusions to Stella's indifferent play, and the money which she lost, much to Mrs. Dingley's chagrin: [...] "Poor Dingley fretted to see Stella lose that four and elevenpence t'other night." [...] Mrs. Dingley herself could hardly play well enough to hold the cards while Stella went into the next room. If at dinner the mutton was underdone, and [...] "poor Stella cannot eat, poor dear rogue," [...] then [...] "Dingley is so vexed." [...] Swift was for ever urging Stella to walk and ride; she was [...] "naturally a stout walker," [...] and [...] "Dingley would do well enough if her petticoats were pinned up."

40|$|One of the {{essential}} factors of minimalization of social costs of transport in socialist economy {{is the type of}} economic calculation applied in transport enterprises. In the existing system of planning transport there is domination of <b>direct</b> <b>accounts</b> carried out at central level. The basic item in construction of a central plan for goods transport is the balance method, which does not guarantee a correct channel of distribution nor facilitates a choice of the cheapest branches and means of transport for particular group of goods. Hence, it is not a basis for minimalization of social costs of transport. Shortcomings in the balance method promoted the introduction of economic mathematic methods in <b>direct</b> <b>accounts</b> at central level. However, in the present state of technical calculations and accuracy of the flow of planning information, the mathematical method in use does not also quarantee complex, macroeconomic rationalization of transport. Hence, irrespective {{of the degree to which}} this method is utilized in <b>direct</b> <b>accounts</b> at central level conditions do not exist for full rationalization of transport on a macroeconomic scale. Therefore, it would seem imperative to widen the range of utilizing indirect accounts based on market criteria and carried out by those directly concerned with transport processes. This concerns particulary, current decisions taken by transport agents and users.
