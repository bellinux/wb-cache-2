25|$|Apart {{from one}} incline {{in the mines}} at Worsley, these {{were the only ones}} which carried boats until around 1819, and many {{visitors}} came to see them. Each incline required a team of four men to operate it. An <b>engineman</b> and a brakesman worked {{at the top of the}} incline, and a man was needed at each end to attach or detach the boats from the rope. Between the inclines, the boats were operated in trains, and Stephen Ballard, who visited the canal from the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal in 1829, recorded that a single horse could pull 12 loaded boats with 60 tons of cargo, and trains of 18 or 20 boats could also be managed.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 21 January 1969 while on patrol south of Cam Ranh Bay, Point Banks intercepted radio {{transmissions}} from the shore requesting assistance in evacuating several ARVN troops that were surrounded by Viet Cong units. After receiving permission to attempt a rescue, she launched her small boat with two crewmen {{and came to the}} aid of nine stranded ARVN troops with the help of two Navy Swift boats and a United States Air Force AC-47 gunship. Point Banks assisted by lobbing mortar fire along the shoreline. Gunner's Mate Second Class Willis J. Goff and <b>Engineman</b> Second Class Larry D. Villarreal were awarded the Silver Star medal for their heroism under fire.|$|E
25|$|The design {{specifications}} for the 82-foot cutter included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure to save weight. Ease of operation {{with a small}} crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one-man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. Berthing spaces were provided for 13 so that requirements were met for passengers and extra wartime manning needs. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an 18-knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Already part of the design, crews stationed in Vietnam found the air-conditioned interior especially helpful. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer but for Vietnam service the spaces quartered the commanding officer, the executive officer and chief boatswain's mate {{as well as the}} chief <b>engineman.</b> The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck, which also included three bunks for first-class petty officers. A watertight door {{at the front of the}} mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was 10 feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.|$|E

500|$|John Roby Leifchild wrote {{a report}} in 1842 for the Children's Employment Commission {{entitled}} [...] "Employment of Children and Young Persons in the Collieries, Lead Mines, and Iron Works of Northumberland and the North of Durham; and on the Condition, Treatment, and Education of such Children and Young Persons". Leifchild found that Losh, Wilson & Bell paid its workers 30 to 36 shillings per week for a scrap-puddler; £2 5 shillings per week for a pudler; 18 shillings per week for a plate mill-furnace man; and 25 shillings per week for an <b>engineman.</b> [...] The boiler engineer's family of wife and four children spent 18 shillings per week on provisions and 3 shillings per week on rent, leaving only 4 shillings for all other expenditure.|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} day that the sealed {{atmosphere}} experiment was terminated, 24 April 1960, Triton experienced a major equipment failure. [...] In the after torpedo room, a hydraulic line to the stern plane mechanism burst. [...] Through the prompt action by Torpedoman's Mate Third Class Allen W. Steele, aided by <b>Engineman</b> Third Class Arlan F. Martin, this potentially catastrophic event was successfully contained. Eventually, the main hydraulic system was restored with a control valve from the steering system, but the boat's steering controls remained on emergency mode {{for the rest of the}} voyage. It was subsequently determined that the pipe burst was caused by a fractured valve. [...] For his quick and decisive actions in handling this emergency, Steele was presented the Navy Commendation Medal.|$|E

On December 5, 1968 Point Cypress was attacked and Hernandez was killed during small boat operations. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal with a combat [...] "V" [...] for valor and a Purple Heart Medal. Vice Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt wrote: [...] "Fireman Hernandez's heroic actions under enemy fire were instrumental to the success of friendly forces in harassing and destroying the enemy's morale and feeling of security. Fireman Hernandez's professional skill, courage under enemy fire, and devotion to duty reflected great credit upon himself, and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service." [...] The first Hispanic-American Coast Guardsman to receive the Silver Star Medal for combat action in Vietnam was <b>Engineman</b> Second Class Larry D. Villareal on January 21, 1969.|$|E

500|$|Point Welcome was patrolling Area 1A1 {{immediately}} {{south of}} the DMZ {{in the early morning}} hours of 11 August 1966. At 03:40 the cutter was illuminated by an U.S. Air Force forward air controller (FAC) who mistook her for an enemy vessel. The FAC called in one B-57 Canberra tactical bomber and two F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber aircraft which proceeded to strafe the cutter for about one hour, each making from seven to nine passes. Point Welcome turned on all of her running and docking lights when first illuminated by the FAC aircraft and contacted the CSC by radio telling them that they were being illuminated by aircraft. During the first pass all of the crew on the bridge were wounded and the commanding officer, Lieutenant Junior Grade David Brostrom, was killed along with the helmsman, <b>Engineman</b> Second Class Jerry Phillips. All signaling equipment, electronics and radios were knocked out on the first pass. Point Welcome began evasive maneuvers at the direction of Chief Boatswains Mate Richard Patterson, who had assumed command after the executive officer was seriously injured. Patterson attempted to avoid the illumination lights of the attacking aircraft and move out of the way of the strafing aircraft. At 04:15 Patterson decided that the best course of action was to beach the cutter and move the wounded ashore, however when this was attempted, the crew came under fire from unknown sources from the shoreline. At 04:25 Point Orient and [...] arrived on the scene and started rescue proceedings. In addition to the commanding officer, one other crewman was killed, nine other crewmen were injured along with a RVN liaison officer and civilian freelance journalist Tim Page. The bridge of the cutter was severely damaged and despite nine [...] wide holes in the main deck, the hull was undamaged. Point Welcome was escorted back to Da Nang under her own power and required three months to repair the damage. Patterson saved the cutter and the surviving crew at great risk to himself. He was awarded a Bronze Star with the combat [...] "V" [...] device for his actions.|$|E

50|$|The National Amalgamated Union of <b>Enginemen,</b> Firemen, Mechanics, Motormen and Electrical Workers was a {{trade union}} in the United Kingdom. It {{represented}} stationary enginedrivers and cranemen {{in a wide}} variety of industries, as well as less skilled workers in the electrical industry and miscellaneous workers. The union was founded in 1895 as the National Amalgamated Union of <b>Enginemen,</b> Cranemen, Hammer Drivers and Boiler Firemen of Great Britain, before changing its name to the National Amalgamated <b>Enginemen,</b> Cranemen, Hammer, Steam and Electric Tram Drivers and Boiler Firemen in 1901. It was affiliated to the Federation of General Workers. It merged with the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU) in 1926.|$|R
25|$|The Australian Federated Union of Locomotive <b>Enginemen</b> (AFULE) {{represented}} locomotive {{drivers and}} crew in Australia from the 1920s. Locomotive <b>enginemen</b> originally organized alongside firemen as craft unions, {{with the first}} in Australia being the Victorian Locomotive Engine Drivers’ Association formed in 1861. The idea of a federated national body for <b>enginemen</b> was first proposed at a Victorian Conference of locomotive associations in 1886, which eventually occurred {{at the turn of}} the century with the formation of the Federated Locomotive Enginemen’s Association of Australasia. This was renamed the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive <b>Enginemen</b> in 1920. The Victorian Locomotive Engine Drivers’ Association opted not to ballot its members on whether to amalgamate into the industry-wide VRU in 1911. The Association and later Victorian AFULE therefore remained a separate union from the ARU in Victoria for most of the 20th century. In 1993 the AFULE in Victoria and all other states and territories except Queensland voted to amalgamate into the PTU.|$|R
