5|$|Andronikos <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of the Komnenoi to rule Constantinople, {{although}} his grandsons Alexios and David founded the Empire of Trebizond in 1204. Nevertheless, Andronikos's {{role in the}} collapse of the empire is controversial; historians disagree over the extent to which his brief reign influenced events after his death. Andonikos's coup, together with his violent death, had weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely. Furthermore, his so-called 'anti-Latin' policy has been criticised by some historians as a failure, in view of the increasing hostility it caused towards Byzantium in the west. In particular, Andonikos's failure to prevent the massacre of Latins in Constantinople in 1182 has been seen as especially significant, since henceforth Byzantine foreign policy was invariably perceived as sinister and anti-Latin in the west. It has even been argued that Andronikos's attempts to crush the aristocracy were damaging to the empire's military power, since the aristocracy had become indispensable to the defences of the state. On the other hand, his reforms in the provinces were both wise and beneficial to the internal health and prosperity of the empire.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of Henry VIII's descendants, and James {{was seen}} as her most likely heir through his {{great-grandmother}} Margaret Tudor, who was Henry VIII's oldest sister. From 1601, {{in the last years}} of Elizabeth's life, certain English politicians—notably her chief minister Sir Robert Cecil—maintained a secret correspondence with James to prepare in advance for a smooth succession. With the Queen clearly dying, Cecil sent James a draft proclamation of his accession to the English throne in March 1603. Elizabeth died in the early hours of 24 March, and James was proclaimed king in London later the same day.|$|E

After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together." ...|$|E

500|$|Hunger {{and desperation}} {{eventually}} forced Sitting Bull, and 186 {{of his family}} and followers, to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford, Sitting Bull said to Major David H. Brotherton, [...] "I wish it to be remembered that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> man of my tribe to surrender my rifle." [...] To the Oglala Lakotas, Dakotas and Nakota, [...] "to surrender my rifle" [...] in this context meant [...] "We have killed enough white men with your own rifles so I give this rifle back to you, for Tunkasila Wakantanka (Grandfather Great Mystery) will use a different way to help us overcome the white man." [...] In the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day, he told the four soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency. This reservation straddles the present-day boundary between North and South Dakota.|$|E

2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E

500|$|As in Islam, a {{fundamental}} tenet of Judaism is that God is {{not bound by}} any limitations of time, matter, or space, and {{that the idea of}} any person being God, a part of God, or a mediator to God, <b>is</b> heresy. <b>The</b> Book of Ezra, which Judaism accepts as a chronicle of the life of Ezra and which predates Muhammad and the Qur'an by around 1000 years, gives Ezra's human lineage as being the son of Seraiah and a direct descendant of Aaron. Tractate Ta'anit of the Jerusalem Talmud, which predates Muhammad by two to three hundred years, states that “if a man claims to be God, he is a liar.” Exodus Rabba 29 says, [...] "'I <b>am</b> <b>the</b> first and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>last,</b> and beside Me there <b>is</b> no God' <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> first, <b>I</b> have no father; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>last,</b> <b>I</b> have no brother. Beside Me there <b>is</b> no God; <b>I</b> have no son." [...] However the term 'sons of gods' occurs in Genesis. The Encyclopedia of Judaism clarifies that the title of 'son of God' is attributed a person whose piety has placed him in a very near relationship to God and [...] "by no means carries the idea of physical descent from, and essential unity with, God".|$|R
