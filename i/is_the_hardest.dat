Some of the least hard waters in the Nescopeck Creek watershed are those of Little Nescopeck Creek A (3 to 8 milligrams per liter), Conety Run (5 milligrams per liter), and Oley Creek (7 milligrams per liter). However, the largest source of pollution in the Nescopeck Creek watershed is acid mine drainage (AMD).|$|E
5|$|Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen {{generate}} the most feedback from readers. Martin {{has stated that}} Tyrion is his personal favorite, as the grayest of the gray characters, with his cunning and wit making him the most fun to write. Martin has also said that Bran Stark <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran's story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character, and {{has to deal with}} the series' adult themes like grief, loneliness, and anger. Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, but, as it was implausible for a character to take two months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section Bridging the timeline gap).|$|E

5|$|Diamond is the allotrope {{of carbon}} {{in which the}} carbon atoms are {{arranged}} in the specific type of cubic lattice called diamond cubic. Diamond is an optically isotropic crystal that is transparent to opaque. Diamond <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> naturally occurring material known. Yet, due to important structural weaknesses, diamond's toughness is only fair to good. The precise tensile strength of diamond is unknown, however strength up to 60GPa has been observed, {{and it could be}} as high as 90–225GPa depending on the crystal orientation. The anisotropy of diamond hardness is carefully considered during diamond cutting. Diamond has a high refractive index (2.417) and moderate dispersion (0.044) properties which give cut diamonds their brilliance. Scientists classify diamonds into four main types according to the nature of crystallographic defects present. Trace impurities substitutionally replacing carbon atoms in a diamond's crystal structure, and in some cases structural defects, are responsible for the wide range of colors seen in diamond. Most diamonds are electrical insulators but extremely efficient thermal conductors. Unlike many other minerals, the specific gravity of diamond crystals (3.52) has rather small variation from diamond to diamond.|$|E
5|$|Enamel <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> {{and most}} highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E

25|$|Differences {{in crystal}} {{structure}} and chemistry greatly influence other physical {{properties of the}} mineral. The carbon allotropes diamond and graphite have vastly different properties; diamond <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> natural substance, has an adamantine lustre, and belongs to the isometric crystal family, whereas as graphite is very soft, has a greasy lustre, and crystallises in the hexagonal family. This difference is accounted by differences in bonding. In diamond, the carbons are in sp3 hybrid orbitals, which means they form a framework where each carbon is covalently bonded to four neighbours in a tetrahedral fashion; on the other hand, graphite is composed of sheets of carbons in sp2 hybrid orbitals, where each carbon is bonded covalently to only three others. These sheets are held together by much weaker van der Waals forces, and this discrepancy translates to big macroscopic differences.|$|E
25|$|If {{a problem}} X is in C and hard for C, then X {{is said to}} be {{complete}} for C. This means that X <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> problem in C. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that X is one of the hardest problems in C.) Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, {{in the sense that they}} are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P=NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π2, to another problem, Π1, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π1. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π1 would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π2. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P=NP.|$|E

25|$|The down-up {{is played}} by hitting the ball at the latest {{possible}} moment. This causes the ball to bounce sharply off the ground, ideally propelling {{the ball into the}} top corner of the net, preventing any fielders from making contact with the ball. This technique varies from outdoor cricket, where a batsman plays the ball in front of the body, hitting the ball for power and distance, rather than to hit the ball into the ground. The down-up is typically played as a forward attacking shot, in which the batsman steps forward with his front foot to hit the ball. The stroke is most commonly used to play full-pitched balls slightly outside off-stump, on the stumps, or slightly outside leg-stump. The leg-side down-up <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> to play, as it requires the batsman to play in front of his legs. Down-ups can also be played off the back foot for shorter pitched deliveries.|$|E
25|$|The race {{consisted}} of 5 laps of 14.75 kilometres on a circuit around Torricelle and {{was similar to}} course at the 2009 UCI Road World Championships. The start/finish was at the Piazza Brà. The race started in a northerly direction for three kilometres of flat surface {{before the start of}} the 3.1kilometre-long Torricelle climb that begins from the Viale dei Colli. The climb has an average gradient of about 4%. The final part of the Torricelle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> with a gradient of 7%, where the Viale dei Colli turns to the Via Santa Giuliana 700 metres from the top marking the highest point of the race at 6.1km. Then the riders swoop down the twisty street for just over 4.5km before two 90-degree right-handers in close succession, the first coming at 10.7km at the intersection of Vie Caroto and Cipolla. The feed station is at 12.3km, before riders cross the Ponte Aleardi bridge and execute a large 'U' that brings them back along the finishing straight of the Corso Porta Nuova.|$|E

500|$|At {{very high}} pressures, carbon forms the more compact allotrope, diamond, having {{nearly twice the}} density of graphite. Here, each atom is bonded tetrahedrally to four others, forming a 3-dimensional network of {{puckered}} six-membered rings of atoms. Diamond has the same cubic structure as silicon and germanium, {{and because of the}} strength of the carbon-carbon bonds, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> naturally occurring substance measured by resistance to scratching. Contrary to the popular belief that [...] "diamonds are forever", they are thermodynamically unstable under normal conditions and transform into graphite. Due to a high activation energy barrier, the transition into graphite is so slow at normal temperature that it is unnoticeable. Under some conditions, carbon crystallizes as lonsdaleite, a hexagonal crystal lattice with all atoms covalently bonded and properties similar to those of diamond.|$|E
