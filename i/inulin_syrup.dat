40|$|Due to its {{widespread}} global {{consumption and}} economic value, fruit juice {{is a common}} target for adulteration through debasing by unscrupulous producers. Two common methods of fruit juice adulteration are debasing with commercial sweeteners and juice-to-juice adulteration. The overarching goal {{of this research was}} to develop methods to detect the undeclared addition of less expensive commercial sweeteners to pear juice and the undeclared addition of apple to pear and pear to apple juice. Methods to detect the undeclared addition of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), hydrolyzed <b>inulin</b> <b>syrup</b> (HIS) and total invert sugar (TIS) to commercial pear juice were developed through oligosaccharide profiling employing high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAE-PAD) and capillary gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (CGC-FID). Based on the application of these methods to intentional pear juice debasing, these three commercial sweeteners could be detected at levels of 0. 5 - 3. 0 % (v/v). Coupled with the developed authenticity analysis for pear juice, the developed profiling methods were used to examine the carbohydrate/oligosaccharide profile of pear juice as a function of commercial processing. Chromatographic results showed that the majority of carbohydrate/oligosaccharide formation occurred during the mashing stage of juice production where enzymes (i. e. pectinases, hemicellulases and amylases) are employed. The remaining processing stages were found to have a minimal impact on the carbohydrate/oligosaccharide profile of commercial pear juice. Methods for the detection of juice-to-juice debasing between apple and pear juices were developed using phenolic profiling. High performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (HPLC-PDA) was used to determine the phenolic profiles of commercial apple and pear juice concentrates from major world production regions. The phenolic profiles were used to identify fingerprint compounds for use in juice-to-juice adulteration detection. One phenolic marker was identified in apple juice and two in pear juice (excluding arbutin). These compounds were analyzed by UV-vis and NMR spectroscopic methods, and high resolution MS and LC-MS/MS spectrometry. Results from these analyses identified the fingerprint compounds as 4 -O-p-coumarylquinic acid in commercial apple juice, and isorhamnetin- 3 -O¬-rutinoside and abscisic acid in commercial pear juice. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of the 27 apple and 32 pear juices used throughout this research were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu (total phenolic content), HPLC-PDA (total phenolic chromatographic index), Trolox equivalent antioxidant activity (TEAC) and DPPH methods. The total phenolic content of apple and pear juices were found to be 294. 7 ± 128. 2 and 246. 4 ± 45. 1 ppm GAE and the total phenolic chromatographic indices were 128. 8 ± 44. 9 and 211. 7 ± 57. 2 ppm, respectively. The TEAC of apple and pear juices were found to be 130. 8 ± 60. 8 and 150. 8 ± 63. 9 mM Trolox/ 100 mL, while the DPPH radical scavenging abilities were 21. 5 ± 12. 1 and 13. 6 ± 5. 5 mL of DPPH/mL of juice, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} different experimental gnawing blocks as cage enrichment in rabbits. One hundred and five pregnant rabbit does housed in conventional wire cages were distributed according to their parity number in 4 homogenous treatment groups. Throughout one complete reproductive cycle (from day 18 of pregnancy till weaning of the litter), does either received no enrichment (controls) or a gnawing block hung from a wire on the cage wall. The 3 different blocks had the same basal components (wheat, molasses and oligoelements), but additionally wood mash (WM), wood mash+chicory pulp (ChP) or wood mash and <b>inulin</b> <b>syrup</b> (I) were respectively incorporated. After weaning, each litter continued to receive the same blocks as before and block consumption was measured as well as the performance of the fatteners. Weight development during the lactation was comparable except in does that received the wood powder blocks. These females had a significantly lower weight (P< 0. 05) at different time points compared to controls. Litter weight or kit weight was not significantly different at any of the time points measured, but again the treatment with wood powder blocks presented the lowest weight. The consumption of blocks during the whole reproduction cycle (42 d) was 11. 0 ± 1. 1; 6. 8 ± 1. 0 and 4. 4 ± 0. 7 g/d per cage for wood mash, chicory pulp or inulin enriched blocks, respectively. A very high variability in consumption of blocks was observed between females. This varied between 1 and 5 (I or ChP group) or even 1 and 9 blocks (WM group) per reproductive cycle. In fatteners, daily block consumption was significantly different (P< 0. 05) and reached on average 7. 0 ± 0. 5; 3. 9 ± 0. 5 and 2. 2 ± 0. 2 g/d per fattener, respectively for WM, ChP and I. Five females with a block and 5 females without a block were observed for 1 h 3 d before the expected parturition and at 2 time points during lactation. Distinction was made between 15 different behaviours. Although the presence of a block did not significantly increase the total number of behavioural transitions, locomotion and intake behaviour were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased when a gnawing block was available. The observation period influenced the frequency of many behavioural transitions and before parturition was significantly higher than post parturition, respectively 56. 1 ± 11. 1 vs. 13. 7 ± 3. 8 (Week 1, P< 0. 01) and 25. 1 ± 5. 5 (Week 2, P< 0. 01). However, a very large variability was observed between does and, moreover, some does were mostly inactive after parturition during the observation period. Based on the consumption pattern and behaviour, these gnawing blocks could be considered as cage enrichment and those with the chicory pulp best fulfilled the objective of a suitable gnawing material...|$|E
40|$|A GC-MS {{method has}} been {{developed}} {{for the detection of}} honey adulteration with high fructose <b>inulin</b> <b>syrups</b> (HFIS). Carbohydrate composition of HFIS with different degrees of polymerization was studied; fructose, sucrose, dianhydrides of fructose (DFAs), inulobiose, kestoses and inulotriose were detected in all the samples. Honey adulterations with 5 %, 10 % and 20 % of HFIS were performed. Inulotriose proved to be the best marker of honey adulteration with these syrups since it was not detected in any of the honey samples analyzed. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Agave tequilana Weber var. 'Azul' {{is grown}} for the {{production}} of tequila, <b>inulin</b> and <b>syrup.</b> Diverse bacteria inhabit plant tissues and play a crucial role for plant health and growth. In this study culturable endophytic bacteria were extracted from leaf bases of 100 healthy Agave tequilana plants. In plant tissue bacteria occurred at mean population densities of 3 million CFU/g of fresh plant tissue. Three hundred endophytic strains were isolated and 16 s rDNA sequences grouped the bacteria into eight different taxa that shared high homology with other known sequences. Bacterial endophytes were identified as Acinectobacter sp., A. baumanii, A. bereziniae, Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter hormaechei, Bacillus sp. Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas sp., Enterococcus casseliflavus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and Gluconobacter oxydans. Isolates were confirmed to be plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) by their capacities for nitrogen fixation, auxin production, phosphate solubilization, or antagonism against Fusarium oxysporum AC 132. E. casseliflavus JM 47 and K. oxytoca JM 26 secreted the highest concentrations of IAA. The endophyte Acinectobacter sp. JM 58 exhibited the maximum values for nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization index (PSI). Inhibition of fungi was found in Pseudomonas sp. JM 9 p and K. oxytoca JM 26. Bacterial endophytes show promise for use as bio-inoculants for agave cultivation. Use of endophytes to enhance cultivation of agave may be particularly important for plants produced by micropropagation techniques, where native endophytes may have been lost...|$|R

40|$|Inulinase is {{an enzyme}} {{that belongs to}} {{glycoside}} hydrolase family 32. It converts <b>inulin</b> into high-fructose <b>syrups</b> and fructoligosaccharides, {{both of which are}} widely used in pharmaceutical and food industries. In this study, the kcINU 1 gene (GenBank accession number AF 178979) encoding an exoinulinase was cloned from Kluyveromyces cicerisporus CBS 4857 and expressed in Pichia pastoris X- 33, yielding a maximum of 45. 2 +/- 0. 6 U mL(- 1) of inulinase activity of culture supernatant. The expressed inulinase was purified and characterized. The enzyme had an optimum temperature of 55 A degrees C and an optimum pH of 4. 5. It had a K (m) of 0. 322 mM and a V (max) of 4317 mu M min(- 1) mg(- 1) protein when inulin was used as a substrate. It retained nearly 90 % of the maximal activity after pre-incubation at 50 A degrees C for 1 h or at pH ranging from 3. 0 to 6. 0 at 4 A degrees C for 24 h, demonstrating that KcINU 1 was stable at high temperature and low pH. Moreover, we constructed two KcINU 1 mutants, Asp 30 Ala and Glu 215 Ala, by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed via zymogram analysis that Asp- 30 and Glu- 215 of the enzyme were the catalytic active center. The present study has provided important information for understanding the catalytic mechanism of exoinulinase...|$|R
