In {{addition to the}} Me 262, the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet and the Heinkel He 162 Volksjäger both become operational. Few claims were made by pilots of the Me 163 and He 162, and none achieved ace status on <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> types.|$|E

50|$|A Tea pet is {{handmade}} using Zisha (Yixing clay) and unglazed, so it {{is usually}} in the natural color of Yixing clay. There are three kinds of Yixing clay: purple clay, red clay, and green clay. A tea pet can be made <b>of</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> Yixing clays, or a mixture of two clays to produce different colors.|$|R

5|$|Georgy Vernadsky even {{identified}} the Oleg of the Schechter Letter with Igor's otherwise anonymous eldest son, whose widow Predslava is {{mentioned in the}} Russo-Byzantine treaty of 944. Alternatively, V. Ya. Petrukhin speculated that Helgu-Oleg of the 940s {{was one of the}} vernacular princes of Chernigov, whose ruling dynasty maintained especially close contacts with Khazaria, as the findings at the Black Grave, a large royal kurgan excavated near Chernigov, seem to testify. However, the academic mainstream has not endorsed <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> theories.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Rauschning {{claimed to}} have seen in Hitler's First World War {{military}} record an item concerning a court martial that found Hitler guilty of pederastic practices with an officer. Rauschning also claimed that in Munich Hitler {{was found guilty of}} a violation of Paragraph 175, which dealt with pederasty. No evidence of <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two charges has been found.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin {{had been unable to}} explain what happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a shred of evidence for <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> claims.|$|E

50|$|Aspirin {{and other}} non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), {{particularly those that}} inhibit cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1), can worsen rhinitis and asthma symptoms in individuals with a history <b>of</b> <b>either</b> one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> diseases. These exacerbations most often appear due to NSAID hypersensitivity reactions rather than NSAID-induced allergic reactions.|$|R
5|$|Not all {{withdrawal}} {{effects are}} evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of {{symptoms such as}} anxiety may simply indicate that the drug was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, {{in the absence of}} the drug, the symptom has returned to pretreatment levels. If the symptoms are more severe or frequent, the person may be experiencing a rebound effect due to the removal of the drug. <b>Either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> can occur without the person actually being drug-dependent.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than try}} to fit more guns onto a ship, it was {{possible}} to increase the power of each gun. This could be done by increasing either the calibre of the weapon and hence the weight of shell, or by lengthening the barrel to increase muzzle velocity. <b>Either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.|$|E
5|$|Several L half-sections may be {{cascaded}} to form {{a composite}} filter. Like impedance must always face like in these combinations. There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical L half-sections. Where ZiT faces ZiT, the section is called a Π section. Where ZiΠ faces ZiΠ the section formed is a T section. Further additions of half-sections to <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or shunt elements.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of spent etching {{solutions}} from printed circuit board manufacturing operations: an acidic cupric chloride solution (CuCl2/HCl), and an alkaline cuprammine chloride solution (Cu(NH3)4Cl2). Tribasic copper chloride is generated by neutralization <b>of</b> <b>either</b> one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two solutions (acidic or alkaline pathway), or by combination <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two solutions, a self-neutralization reaction.|$|R

50|$|The jumping {{season in}} Australia {{normally}} takes place from March until September. (some minor races are held <b>either</b> side <b>of</b> <b>these</b> months). Horses used for steeplechasing are primarily former flat racing horses, rather than horses specifically bred for jumping.|$|R
5|$|Several L-shape half-sections may be {{cascaded}} to form {{a composite}} filter. Like impedance must always face like in these combinations. There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical L-shaped half-sections. Where a port of image impedance ZiT faces another ZiT, the section is called a Π section. Where ZiΠ faces ZiΠ the section so formed is a T section. Further additions of half-sections to <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or shunt elements.|$|E

She asked me if I was willing to accept <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity, and the red that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.|$|E
5|$|The $500,000 and $1,000,000 prizes were {{initially}} lump-sum payments, but were changed to annuities in September 2002 when the series moved to syndication. Contestants winning <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> prizes receive $250,000 thirty days after their show broadcasts {{and the remainder}} paid in equal annual payments. The $500,000 prize consists of $25,000 per year for 10 years, while the $1,000,000 prize consists of $37,500 per year for 20 years.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the Earth are moving across the surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal did {{not mention}} <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> events—or Kohlrautz's part in them—when testifying to American {{investigators}} in May 1945, or in an affidavit he made in August 1954 about his wartime persecutions, and researcher Guy Walters questions their authenticity. Wiesenthal variously reported that Kohlrautz was killed on the Soviet Front in 1944 or in the Battle of Berlin on 19 April 1945.|$|E
5|$|Although the heme {{proteins}} are {{the most}} important class of iron-containing proteins, the iron-sulfur proteins are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin, which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins, which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> classes.|$|E

5|$|Between 2005 and 2011, Istanbul Park racing circuit {{hosted the}} annual Formula One Turkish Grand Prix. Istanbul Park {{was also a}} venue of the World Touring Car Championship and the European Le Mans Series in 2005 and 2006, but the track has not seen <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> {{competitions}} since then. It also hosted the Turkish Motorcycle Grand Prix between 2005 and 2007. Istanbul was occasionally a venue of the F1 Powerboat World Championship, with the last race on the Bosphorus strait on August 12–13, 2000. The last race of the Powerboat P1 World Championship on the Bosphorus took place on June 19–21, 2009. Istanbul Sailing Club, established in 1952, hosts races and other sailing events on the waterways in and around Istanbul each year. Turkish Offshore Racing Club also hosts major yacht races, such as the annual Naval Forces Trophy.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum triplex may be {{confused}} with G.saccatum or G.fimbriatum, as the rays do not always crack around the perimeter to form a bowl under the spore case. However, it is larger than <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> species. The combination of characteristics which distinguish G.triplex from other earthstars include the lack of debris adhering to the outer surfaces, the saucer-like base in which the spore case is seated, the relatively large size, the fibrillose peristome and the paler area surrounding the peristome separating it {{from the rest of}} the endoperidium. Unlike some other Geastrum species, the rays of G.triplex are not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{was drafted}} seventh {{overall in the}} 2006 MLB draft. He {{worked his way through}} the Dodgers' farm system in just one full season, and reached the majors at 20 years old. When he debuted in 2008, he was the {{youngest}} player in MLB, a title he held for one full year. In 2011, he won the pitching Triple Crown and the National League Cy Young Award, becoming the youngest pitcher to accomplish <b>either</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> feats since Dwight Gooden in 1985. Kershaw pitched a no-hitter on June 18, 2014, becoming the 22nd Dodger to do so. Being a left-handed strikeout pitcher and playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kershaw has often been compared to Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax. He became the first pitcher in history to lead MLB in ERA for four consecutive years when he did so in the 2011 through 2014 seasons.|$|E
