5|$|A common {{language}} {{may have been}} seen {{to serve as the}} basis of a nation, but as contemporary historians of 19th-century Germany noted, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>more</b> than linguistic similarity to unify these several hundred polities. The experience of German-speaking Central Europe during the years of French hegemony contributed to a sense of common cause to remove the French invaders and reassert control over their own lands. The exigencies of Napoleon's campaigns in Poland (1806–07), the Iberian Peninsula, western Germany, and his disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 disillusioned many Germans, princes and peasants alike. Napoleon's Continental System nearly ruined the Central European economy. The invasion of Russia included nearly 125,000 troops from German lands, and the loss of that army encouraged many Germans, both high- and low-born, to envision a Central Europe free of Napoleon's influence. The creation of student militias such as the Lützow Free Corps exemplified this tendency.|$|E
5|$|Although Dean's {{landfall}} in Mexico {{occurred in}} a relatively uninhabited area and the storm's well-predicted track gave ample warning, the storm inflicted extreme damage. In Majahual, the only town to experience {{the full force of}} the hurricane, hundreds of buildings were destroyed. Quintana Roo Governor Félix González Canto reported that although the cleanup in the state capital of Chetumal was completed within three weeks, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>more</b> than six months to fix all of the region's more rural roads. Unable to handle the hurricane's aftermath, the state government appealed to federal authorities for aid. Together, they established a housing-repair fund which contributed to the reconstruction of over 37,000residences.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{high-profile}} start of Henry's cultus, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>more</b> than 100 {{years for the}} veneration of Saint Henry to gain widespread acceptance throughout Sweden.

Henry never received the highest totum duplex veneration in Uppsala nor was he made a patronus of the church there, which status he had both in Turku and Nousiainen.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{financial}} crises, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>more</b> than {{one and a}} half years for Gopalakrishnan to finish the film. Swayamvaram {{was one of the first}} Malayalam films to use synchronised sound and to be filmed in outdoor locales, for which Gopalakrishnan used his Nagra audio recorder. The film was shot in two schedules. It was delayed due to scheduling conflicts of the lead actress, Sharada. She was working in several films at that time, so Gopalakrishnan had to arrange the schedule to suit her convenience. The lead actor, Madhu, mentioned in an interview that Gopalakrishnan was clear about his characters and their behaviour. Gopalakrishnan also used to discuss the shoot with his crew before the shooting.|$|E

A ten-rider group {{broke away from}} the peloton over the climb, with Benoot and Boonen joined by Roelandts, Cancellara, Boom, Vanmarcke, Daniel Oss (BMC) and three other Etixx–Quick-Step riders (Terpstra, Štybar and Trentin). On the next climb, the Boigneberg, Cancellara's rear {{derailleur}} failed and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>more</b> than a minute for his team to bring him a replacement bike, putting him a long way behind the other favourites. Shortly afterwards, the breakaway was caught by the chasing group; the combined group was then caught by another group that contained Sagan and Kwiatkowski to create a 20-man lead group, although Štybar soon suffered a puncture and fell out of the group. Cancellara, meanwhile, was in a group led by his teammates Yaroslav Popovych and Markel Irizar around two minutes behind.|$|E
5|$|Post-storm {{analysis}} showed that, while less deadly, Dean's first {{and more powerful}} landfall caused significantly more infrastructural damage than its second. Where the landfall occurred at the town of Majahual specifically, {{and the state of}} Quintana Roo generally, communities took longer to recover than {{in the rest of the}} country. Quintana Roo Governor Félix González Canto reported that although the cleanup in the state capital of Chetumal was completed within three weeks, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>more</b> than six months to fix all of the region's rural roads. Unable to handle the hurricane's aftermath, the state government appealed to federal authorities and secured Mex$755million (US$74.8million) of aid. Combined with the state's contribution of $270million (US$26.7million), a housing-repair fund of over $1,025million (US$101.5million) was established. In the three months immediately following the storm, over 37,000houses were rebuilt or repaired using monies from this fund.|$|E

5|$|The {{relocation}} to Indianapolis was {{an arduous}} task. At {{the time it}} was an eleven-day journey by horseback from Corydon to the new capital. To complicate matters, no road existed and a path for the wagons had to be cut through the dense forests during the winter transit as the long caravan moved north. The caravan was large because it contained the state treasury, state library, state records, the furniture of the General Assembly, Supreme Court, and ExecutIve Offices, along with a whole host of other implements to aid the caravan on its long journey. Colonel Samuel Merrill, the state treasurer, was authorized by the General Assembly to oversee the move. Ultimately, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>more</b> than a month to relocate the government to Indianapolis. The first session of the General Assembly convened there in January 1825.|$|E
5|$|By mid-September 2015, {{the global}} stock of highway legal plug-in {{electric}} passenger cars and utility vans reached the one million sales milestone. Sales of plug-in electric vehicles achieved the one million milestone {{almost twice as}} fast as hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). While it took four years and 10 months to reach one-million PEV sales, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>more</b> than around nine years and a few months for HEVs to reach its first million sales. The global ratio between all-electrics (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) has consistently been 60:40 between 2014 and the first half of 2016, mainly due to the large all-electric market in China. In the U.S. and Europe, the ratio is approaching a 50:50 split. All-electric cars have oversold plug-in hybrids, with pure electrics representing about 61% of the global stock of over 2million plug-ins on the world's roads by the end of 2016, up from 58.9% at the end of 2015. Cumulative global sales of highway-capable light-duty pure electric vehicles since 2010 achieved the one million unit milestone in September 2016. The global stock of plug-in hybrid cars totaled almost 800,000 units at the end of 2016.|$|E
5|$|Initially, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>more</b> than 24hours {{for word}} {{of the level of}} devastation to reach {{officials}} in Manila as communications across Leyte were largely destroyed. By November7, search and rescue operations were underway across Leyte and Negros Occidental. The first shipment of relief supplies, consisting of food rations, rice, sardines, and used clothing, was to be shipped from Cebu later that day. On November8, Philippine President Corazon Aquino declared all of Leyte a disaster area. A Philippine Navy vessel set out with heavy earth-moving machinery and the Philippine Air Force deployed aircraft to assist in rescue efforts. Relief efforts in Ormoc City were hampered by a lack of clear roads and fuel. Amateur radio reports stated that an AC-130 was able to land at a local airport but materials had to be moved by helicopter from there since roads were blocked. Relief efforts were also hampered by continuing rains and the rough terrain of the affected region. By November11, approximately 8,300families had been rescued and another 7,521were evacuated from affected regions.|$|E

5|$|One {{accident}} at the Mousetrap, a complex interchange, had national ramifications. On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six torpedoes for the U.S. Navy overturned. The situation was made worse {{as no one}} answered at the phone number provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking {{from one of the}} torpedoes. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>more</b> than three hours before any military personnel arrived on the scene, U.S. Army personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by state troopers, who specifically warned the driver to avoid the Mousetrap. The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a hazardous cargo shipment, a violation of federal law, and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway system, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003.|$|E
