The pens were mounted on a traveling bar, whereby the y-axis was represented by motion {{up and down the}} length of the bar and the x-axis was represented by motion of the bar back and forth across the plotting table. Due to the mass of the bar, these plotters operated relatively slowly.|$|R

50|$|The ships {{original}} {{echo sounding}} equipment and Hydrographic Data Acquisition System (HDAS) {{consisted of a}} very early seagoing data processing system made up of two Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-9 computers that shared a central drum disk drive. KSR-35 TTYs were used as the primary system consoles and a Calcomp <b>flatbed</b> <b>plotter</b> kept a real-time track of the ships position. This equipment was all replaced in the mid 1970s by a new narrow beam swath system. The swath array, replacing the single beam system, was the Bottom Topography Survey Subsystem (BOTOSS) and the processing system, replacing HDAS, was the Bathymetric Survey System (BASS). The initial BOTOSS hull mounting was subject to air bubble interference so that a new arrangement on a fairing and foil mounted on the keel was required to house the array elements during a 1974-1975 period in a West Coast yard.|$|E

40|$|The {{acquisition}} of terrain data from aerial photography using digital photogrammetric methods gives the engineer and planner an economical alternative to conventional ground surveys. This paper describes a complete photogrammetric digitizing system {{developed for the}} Portland District Army Corps of Engineers. The hardware of the system consists of a Wild AlO first order stereoplotter interfaced to an Altec AC- 74 coordinate digitizer which is interfaced to both a Hewlett Packard 9810 A programmable calculator and a Digi-Data nine-track magnetic tape recorder. The software of the system consists of photogrammetric routines developed for online computation by the programmable calculator and a sophisticated FORTRAN IV program called PHOTDIG which processes the digitized photogrammetric data from the nine-track magnetic tape at the Corps of Engineers data processing facility which contains an IBM 370 computer and a Calcomp 748 precision <b>flatbed</b> <b>plotter.</b> The processing of the digitized data by PHOTDIG produces terrain information required by engineers and planners such as state plane coordinates, elevations, cross-sections, profiles, etc. in both digital and graphical formats. The system has been in production use {{for over two years}} in the Portland District Photogrammetry Section and has significantly increased the efficiency and economy of photogrammetric data acquisition...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 In this study, {{three main}} issues are discussed: {{possible}} bias arising when inflation effects are neglected in engineering economy studies, capital projects authorization forms {{which are not}} designed to include inflation effects in the calculations,'and {{the introduction of a}} new graphical technique for capital expenditure sensitivity analysis. Approaches are described which include inflation in economic studies by the use of current and constant dollars. The partitioning of cost into individual components is proposed in order to include differential price trends. Numerical examples are presented. A current dollar analysis using partitioned -Factors is recommended. Capital authorization forms were obtained from industries in order to analyze the characteristics of in-:'ormation actually used in these organizations. By extracting the more relevant elements from them and adding improvements, a new s.,. !t of forms is developed. The set included worksheets for the calculation of the cash flow in current and constant dollars that are analyzed to determine the present worth, rate of return, and payback period. Space for a graphical sensitivity analysis display is also provided. A graphical technique, the trilinear chart, is adapted to represent the different elements in economic studies. Its characteristics are discussed with numerical examples which focus on capital projects. A sequence of charts is constructed to analyze the sensitivity of investment proposals with respect to possible deviations from expected values. SENSOR, a computer program, is developed to assist in the plotting of the charts on a <b>flatbed</b> <b>plotter</b> or in a time sharing terminal. It is concluded that the cost partitioning gives a more realistic measurement of the inflation effects for the evaluating of investment proposals. The forms presented can be implemented in most industries with minor changes and will be helpful in minimizing calculation errors. Trilinear charts have considerable potential for use in customized sensitivity analysis in standard situations and for presentation of recommendations...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Algorithms {{capable of}} {{automatically}} drawing Resource Planning and Management (RPM) network models from standard Linear Programming data files are developed. An RPM network {{is a unique}} graphical representation {{that is capable of}} representing both the primal and the dual model of a mathematical programming problem on a same network model. Each primal decision variable and each dual (Lagrange Multiplier) variable is represented by a node in an RPM network. Unlike a CPM-PERT network, an RPM network must be able to include feedback loops, three different types of nodes, and two types of arrows connecting these nodes. The algorithms presented in this thesis can replace the tedious task of manually drawing an RPM network by an automated computer plotting system which includes a node location algorithm and an arrow routing algorithm. Five different types of algorithms were investigated for the node location problem: rectilinear model, directionaly weighted model, acyclic convergence model, squared distance model, and two-phase model. The two-phase model, the final choice of algorithm, is based upon the basic idea of "pairwise interchange" procedure commonly used for optimizing a facility layout location problem. A special cost evaluation function is developed to realize the technological ordering of nodes. The first phase checks the relative locations of nodes in terms of technological order, while the second phase evaluates the optimality of the resulting configuration. The arrow routing algorithm also consists of two phases: a pin-position ordering model and an open space routing model. The former deals with the ordering of all arrow connections at a node, while the latter uses the concept of macro-routing and macro-tracking to funnel the flows through the open space. The two phases are treated independently but are used jointly to provide a visually balanced and easily understood network drawings. The feasibility of these algorithms was verified by constructing a computerized RPM Network Designer (RAMNED) on a Control Data Corporation Computer Cyber- 70 Model 73 and a Gerber <b>flatbed</b> <b>plotter.</b> The program accepts an industry standard input data (IBM's MPS, CDC's APEX, or OSU's REX) for Linear Programming, and automatically produces a finished copy of the network on the flat-bed plotter. The current version of RAMNED is capable of handling up to 70 nodes. Each node may have up to five inflow and five outflow arrows in addition to a flow to an objective function. Computational time requirement varied from 7. 9 to 126. 0 cpu seconds for a number of problems ranging from 9 to 68 nodes...|$|E
