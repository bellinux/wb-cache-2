5|$|The {{first two}} print runs used Thayer and Company lithographers, with one litho stone for {{the color and}} the other for {{printing}} black on the white paper stock. Because the paper of 1840's through 1890's included a lavish amount of fiber, often taken from mummy wrappings, it would not fade or decompose like the wood pulp paper used today. The first print run copied the Laurie and Whittles game. Laurie and Whittles used <b>gold</b> <b>ink.</b> Thayer mixed his ink to look gold but it really was a goldish brown. Like Laurie and Whittles game, Thayer used an octagonal end space.|$|E
25|$|After the {{annexation}} of Mandalay by the British in 1885, the walled city with Mandalay Palace became Fort Dufferin, and troops were billeted all around Mandalay Hill in the monasteries, temples and pagodas. They became off-limits {{to the public}} and Burmese were no longer allowed to visit their religious sites. One revenue surveyor called U Aung Ban then {{came up with the idea}} of appealing direct to Queen Victoria since she had promised to respect all religions practised by her subjects. To their amazement and great joy the British queen promptly ordered the withdrawal of all her troops from religious precincts in 1890. This however turned to great sadness when they found that the pagoda had been looted from the hti, left lying on the ground stripped of its bells, gold, silver, diamonds, rubies and other precious stones, down to the Italian marble tiles from its terraces. The zayats lay in utter ruin and the bricks had been used to build a road for the troops. All the brass bells from all the kyauksa gu stupas were gone, 9 on each making it 6570 in total. The <b>gold</b> <b>ink</b> from the letters as well as the sides and top of each marble slab had also disappeared. All the biloos along the corridors had lost their heads, and the marble eyes and claws from the masonry chinthes gone.|$|E

40|$|The ageing {{characteristics}} of aluminium wire bonds on five different thick film <b>gold</b> <b>inks</b> were investigated. The assessment criteria selected were the pull {{strength and the}} electrical resistance of the bonds. A correlation between these does not exist. Under stress the bond strength first declines sharply, however, afterwards stabilizes {{at a level that}} can just be accepted. The electrical resistance of the bond, in contrast, rises slowly, but then reaches values, at which the contact is no longer guaranteed. Internal oxidation is proposed as a new explanation for this behaviour...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gold</b> {{nanoparticle}} <b>inks</b> {{were investigated}} {{as a potential}} candidate for lead-free packaging applications. Inks consisted of surfactant-passivated nanoparticles dissolved in a solvent. Optimized <b>gold</b> <b>inks</b> are able to sinter at temperatures as low as 120 °C and achieve conductivities of up to 70 % of bulk. Once sintered, the metallic structure reverts to bulk-like properties and approaches bulk reliability and performance. Thus nanoparticle-based solders would operate at much lower homologous temperatures as compared with alloy-based solders. Nanoparticle inks under investigation were sintered at 180 °C. The resulting material exhibited a resistivity of 5  μΩ cm, which is significantly {{lower than those of}} Pb-Sn and Sn-Ag-Cu. Electromigration studies were carried out and time to failure was investigated as a function of temperature. Electromigration activation energy was calculated through Black’s equation to be 0. 52  eV, which is consistent with surface/grain boundary diffusion. These studies suggest that nanoparticle-ink-based films show excellent robustness, due to their irreversible conversion to bulk-like materials. Nanoparticle inks are thus promising candidates for next-generation lead-free solders...|$|R

500|$|The Mansion Of Happiness was {{designed}} by George Fox, a children's author and game designer in England. The first edition, printed in <b>gold</b> <b>ink</b> [...] "containing real gold" [...] using one copper plate engraving and black ink using a second copper plate engraving, produced a few hundred copies. Water coloring was used to complete the game board, making a brilliant, colorful, and expensive product fit for the nobility. Later in 1800, a second edition was printed, probably for rich but common folk. Only one copper plate was used to print black ink and no water coloring was used. The game must have become quite popular in England as a third edition was printed using two copper plates, one for black, and the second for green lines to indicate blank spaces. Water colors were added to make a beautiful product. Laurie and Whittle published all three editions in 1800. On all three editions George Fox was listed as the inventor and the game honored the Duchess of York. In the first edition, gold not only added color and price but homage to royalty. In all three editions, the paper was glued to linen so it could fold up and be inserted into a heavy attractively labeled cardboard case.|$|E
