500|$|It {{was during}} one of Jackson's calls to Presley that he {{proposed}} marriage. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> marry me, would you do it?", the singer queried. Though still married to actor Danny Keough, whom she had wed in 1988 and had two children with, Presley replied that she would. After a pause, Jackson exclaimed {{that he had to}} use the bathroom. Having apparently relieved himself, the singer explained to his new fiancee that his love for her was genuine and she had to believe him. In 2010, Presley acknowledged to Oprah Winfrey that Jackson did formally propose one day in the library, taking out a 10 carat diamond ring and getting down on his knees.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{proposed}} to Presley {{over the telephone}} towards the fall of 1993, saying: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> marry me, would you do it?" [...] They married in the Dominican Republic in secrecy, denying it for nearly two months afterwards. The marriage was, in her words, [...] "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active." [...] The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a ploy to prop up Jackson's public image. The marriage ended {{less than two years}} later with an amicable divorce settlement. In a 2010 interview with Oprah, Presley said they had spent four more years after the divorce [...] "getting back together and breaking up" [...] until she decided to stop.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{first met}} Lisa Marie Presley (and Elvis Presley) in 1974, during a Jackson 5 {{engagement}} at the MGM Grand. In November 1992, Jackson was reconnected with Presley through a mutual friend, staying in contact {{almost every day}} by telephone. As the child sexual abuse accusations became public, he became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and his addiction to drugs. She explained, [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong {{and that he was}} wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it." [...] In one phone call he made to her, she described him as high, incoherent and delusional. He proposed to her over the phone towards the fall of 1993, saying, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> marry me, would you do it?". The marriage was, in her words, [...] "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active". They divorced fewer than two years later, remaining friendly.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ready?" [...] he repeated. [...] "Yes; {{ready at}} last. Listen to me; and let's get it over. <b>I</b> don't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> give Frank up. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> wait." ...|$|R
500|$|At Trenton, Washington faced a dilemma. All but {{a handful}} of his men's enlistments were expiring on December 31, and he knew that the army would {{collapse}} unless he convinced them to stay. So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances." [...] At first no one stepped forward, but then one soldier stepped forward, and he was followed by most of the others, leaving only a few in the original line.|$|E
2500|$|In early October 2014, Kilbey {{explained}} that Willson-Piper was {{not asked to}} leave the band, {{but that he had}} simply not replied to the various attempts made to contact him (Willson-Piper had relocated to Sweden). Realizing that Willson-Piper would not respond, and in agreement with Powles at the time, [...] Kilbey said [...] "Yes, we have to find someone with stature. He has to have his own trip, he can’t be some weedy little guy coming in to play guitar. It has to be somebody with experience and gravitas." [...] As part of the same interview, Haug {{explained that}} he had {{received a phone call from}} Kilbey while he was returning home from a funeral. Without first greeting Haug, Kilbey simply asked, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> join The Church, what would you say?" [...] and ended the call after Haug's affirmative, but bewildered, response. Haug said that joining the Church was the [...] "last thing" [...] that would have entered his mind, but that [...] "it just really seemed to work".|$|E
