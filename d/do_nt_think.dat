40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of growth cone (GC) and neurite retraction {{resulting from a}} rapid incrase in concentration of the trophic molecule NGF was studied. Neurite outgrowth from explants of 8 -d chick embryo dorsal root ganglia was achieved at very low NGF concentrations with heart conditioned medium during overnight culture. Quickly incrasing the NGF concentration in the growth medium dramatically affected GC and neurite morphology: the majority of GCs and neurites collapsed and retracted towards the cell body over a course of approximately 2 - 5 min. Retraction was elicited by increasing NGF levels from 0 to 0. 05 ng/ml to as little as 0. 5 ng/ml but did not occur if the NGF concentration during the initial overnight culture period exceeded 0. 8 ng/ml, regardless of how much the concentration was elevated. Similar concentration changes of cytochrome c or insulin <b>did</b> <b>nt</b> result in retraction. Neurites that had been separated from their cell bodies by cutting close to their exit from the explant still retracted when NGF levels were raised.

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the administration of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus gasseri NT) on lipid metabolism and fat synthesis in a mouse high-fat-diet model, focusing on visceral fat. Balb/c mice were fed a 45 kcal % fat diet for 13 weeks with and without a freeze-dried preparation of L. gasseri NT (109 CFU/g).

Bioenergetic parameters of cellular metabolism, basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (mOCRB) and basal extracellular acidification rate (ECARB), were measured by a Seahorse XFe- 24 analyzer. Cell invasiveness was evaluated by a trans-well migration assay and vimentin expression. Doxorubicin {{was used as a}} chemotherapeutic agent.

The objectives of this study were: (a) simulate the effects of maize production systems under organic and mineral fertilization on soil organic matter dynamics of an Ultisol using the Century model; (b) to compare total carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen stocks (TN) and the carbon pools (C) measured in the laboratory and estimated by the Century model for the surface soil layer (0 - 20 cm). The study area {{had been part of}} the Atlantic Forest (FA) until 1930. After that it had been used for maize/bean production up to 1984, when the field experiment was set up. The treatments included a combination of three levels of mineral fertilizer at doses of 0, 250 and 500 kg ha- 1 of the 4 - 14 - 8 formula and two levels of organic fertilizer (animal manure with soybean and bean straw) at doses of 0 and 40 m³ ha- 1. Laboratory determinations included TOC and TN, microbial biomass C representing the active C pool and carbon of the light fraction representing the slow C pool. The passive C pool was determined by difference. The Century model was parameterized with data from the present experiment and from literature, whereas the simulations of the dynamics of TOC, TN and the active, slow, and passive pool included land use changes between 1930 and 2050. The Century model estimated a decrease in TOC, TN and the different carbon pools between the slash and burn of the Atlantic Forest until the establishment of the field experiment. Only in the treatments with organic fertilization it was observed a recovery of these pools. Biomass carbon and the carbon of the light fraction were more sensitive to changes in management than TOC. This highlights the relevance of these pools in studies of organic matter dynamics, particularly in tropical soils. Measured and simulated values of TOC (in Mg ha- 1 of C) were well correlated (R² = 0. 93; p < 0. 01).

This effect was not altered by activation of DA D 2 -receptors with {{high or low}} concentrations of quinpirole (10 - 6 M and 10 - 8 M) or blockade of DA D 2 -receptors with near maximal concentrations of sulpiride (10 - 6 M and 10 - 5 M). The sulpiride-mediated increase in [3 H]DA release and the release induced by NT were additive. These results suggest that NT functions independently of DA D 2 -receptor activation to modulate DA release in the nucleus accumbens. <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not modulate the simultaneous release of [14 C]acetylcholine.

40|$|Approximately 4 million infants out of 130 million {{worldwide}} annual births {{suffer from}} birth asphyxia. Of these, approximately 25 % die and 25 % develop {{some kind of}} neurological sequelae (UNICEF 2003). In {{the western part of}} the world, 2 - 6 / 1000 of all newborn are diagnosed with HIE, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, during the first days of life, due to reduced gas exchange through placenta or lungs. The overall aim for this thesis in pediatric neurology was to understand more about the mechanisms behind hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, so that treatment for this important condition hopefully can be improved. We focused our research on acidosis, mitochondrial function and inflammation, all important but not fully understood phenomena in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage and all possibly amendable to interventional treatment. Hypoxia studies were <b>done</b> in <b>NT</b> 2 -N neurons, a human cell line consisting of postmitotic, differentiated fenotypic neurons. Analyses were done for cell death, energy level, mitochondrial function and different mediators of inflammation. Acidosis was confirmed to have a protective effect during hypoxia and a detrimental effect early during reoxygenation. Further, an early decline in mitochondrial function was found. Inflammation played a role during hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. Finally, the results showed neuronal damage to occur several hours after the insult. This “delayed” cell death gives the possibility of beneficial intervention during this “therapeutic time window”...|$|R

40|$|The {{possible}} {{involvement of}} endogenous vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), cholecystokinin (CCK) and neurotensin (NT) {{in the control}} of thymocyte proliferation has been investigated in vivo in the immature rat. For this task, we have studied {{the effects of the}} administration of selective antagonists of the receptors of the three neuropeptides on the mitotic index (% of metaphase-arrested cells after vincristin injection) of thymocytes. Both CCK- and TN-receptor antagonists were ineffective. In contrast, two VIP receptor antagonists (VIP-As) enhanced the mitotic index of thymocytes. VIP reversed the effect of VIP-As, but when administered alone it did not alter the mitotic activity of thymocytes. In light of these findings, we conclude that endogenous VIP exerts a maximal tonic inhibitory influence on the basal proliferative activity of rat thymocytes, while endogenous CCK and <b>NT</b> <b>do</b> not play a relevant modulatory role in this process...|$|R
40|$|Background—Reports demonstrating {{sympathetic}} hyperactivity in hypertension {{with the}} use of microneurography have been inconsistent. One possible reason is that previous studies have assessed muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) from integrated voltage waves (“bursts”) recorded from multiunit discharges. We studied single units with defined vasoconstrictor properties (s-MSNA) to further characterize sympathetic output in hypertensive disease. Methods and Results—We examined 74 subjects {{with a wide range of}} arterial blood pressure that were considered to be either normal (NT), high normal (HN), or stages 1 to 3 essential hypertension (EHT- 1, EHT- 2 / 3). All had their peripheral sympathetic activity measured from both multiunit bursts and single-unit vasoconstrictor impulses. There was a significant correlation between s-MSNA and MSNA, and results of variability studies were similar. The EHT- 1 and EHT- 2 / 3 groups had greater s-MSNA and MSNA than <b>did</b> the matched <b>NT</b> group (always P, 0. 01). The HN group als...|$|R

[...] Wiles observes that there has been considerable diversity in what people have considered to be lives patterned on Jesus as the standard; and that even the <b>NT</b> <b>does</b> not provide a comprehensive picture of just precisely how Jesus lived his entire life. He quotes R. H. Lightfoot, who famously declared, [...] "the form of the earthly no less than of the heavenly Christ is for the most part hidden from us." [...] Even given these limitations, Wiles reflects that [...] "on any showing to which the name of Christian could conceivably be given Jesus' life would remain of substantial importance to us." [...] So, Wiles suggests, Jesus' significance as a role-model [...] "is not directly affected by the way in which his relationship to God is understood." ...|$|R
