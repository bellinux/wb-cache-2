At a final briefing, Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim instructs the {{committee}} {{members in the}} use of pencil detonators. Stauffenberg also persuades General Fellgiebel, who controls all communications at Wolf's Lair, to cut off communications after the bomb blast. On July15, 1944, Stauffenberg attends a strategy meeting at Wolf's Lair with the bomb in <b>his</b> <b>briefcase,</b> but with Himmler not present at the meeting, Stauffenberg does not get the go-ahead from the committee leaders, and by the time von Quirnheim defies the others and tells him to do it anyway, the meeting is over. Meanwhile, the Reserve Army is mobilized by Olbricht, unbeknownst to Fromm, to stand by. With no action taken, Stauffenberg safely extracts himself and the bomb from the bunker, and the Reserve Army is ordered to stand down, believing that the mobilization was a drill. Back in Berlin, Olbricht and Stauffenberg are threatened by Fromm that if they try to control the reserve army again he will personally have them arrested; Stauffenberg goes to the committee to protest their indecisiveness and condemns Goerdeler, who has been selected to be chancellor after the coup.

5|$|The main feud {{heading into}} One Night Stand was between John Cena and Rob Van Dam over the WWE Championship. At WrestleMania, Van Dam competed in a six-man Money in the Bank ladder match, in which Van Dam won and {{earned the right}} to face the {{champion}} of his choice anytime he wanted to in 12 months. On the May 22 episode of Raw, Cena defeated Chris Masters. After the match, Van Dam came out to the ring and announced that he was cashing in his opportunity for the WWE Championship at One Night Stand. The two exchanged lefts and rights, with Masters getting involved. The distraction allowed Van Dam to toss <b>his</b> <b>briefcase</b> into Cena's face and then hit him with the Van Daminator. The two had a contract signing for their match on the June 5, 2006 episode of Raw. Before signing the contract, Van Dam told Cena that he would win the WWE Championship at One Night Stand and rename it the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. ECW representative Paul Heyman told Cena that the ECW fans can’t wait to boo him out of the Hammerstein Ballroom. Cena signed the contract and wished Van Dam luck. Heyman, however, told Cena that he had brought some people from ECW and at that point, Balls Mahoney, Terry Funk, Tommy Dreamer and the Sandman came to the ring. Cena attempted to fight them off, but Sandman hit Cena with his Singapore cane. ECW's Sabu then came out and sent Cena through the table with his Atomic Arabian Facebuster move. Several Raw superstars ran out to attempt to fight off the ECW Originals. Because of this, a match was booked for the WWE vs. ECW Head to Head special that aired on the USA Network on June 7, 2006 between Cena and Sabu. The match ended in a no contest after ECW's newest wrestler, The Big Show attacked Cena, sparking a brawl between WWE and ECW superstars.|$|E
25|$|Albert, however, {{was under}} {{investigation}} by the Secret Service because of his propaganda activities. On July 24, 1915, he accidentally left <b>his</b> <b>briefcase</b> on a train; it was recovered by a Secret Service agent who had been following him. The briefcase contained details about the phenol plot and other covert activities to indirectly aid the German war effort. Although it was not incriminating enough to bring charges against Albert or the other conspirators (since the United States was still officially neutral and trade with Germany was legal), the documents were soon leaked to the New York World, an anti-German newspaper. The World published an exposé on August 15, 1915, and the publicity soon forced Albert to stop funding the phenol purchases.|$|E
25|$|On July 17 at Money in the Bank, Bryan won the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match {{which earned}} him a World Heavyweight Championship match at any point within the {{following}} year. On the July 22 episode of SmackDown, Bryan declared he would cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase at WrestleMania XXVIII. After several months of losing matches, Bryan began a feud with then World Heavyweight Champion Mark Henry on the November 4 episode of SmackDown, after Henry challenged Bryan to a non-title match to prove that Bryan could not become champion. During the match, Big Show knocked out Henry, making Bryan lose by disqualification. Big Show, {{as a friend of}} Bryan, then urged a groggy Bryan to cash in his championship match, but Henry recovered and attacked both Bryan and Big Show before the match could start. After losing a rematch, Bryan suffered attacks from Henry the following two weeks. On November 25 at SmackDown, Henry was knocked out again by Big Show, at which point Bryan cashed in <b>his</b> <b>briefcase</b> for a title match and quickly pinned Henry. However, SmackDown authority figure Theodore Long revealed that Henry was not medically cleared to compete and voided the match, so Henry remained champion and the briefcase was returned to Bryan. Bryan later admitted he betrayed his principles by not waiting for WrestleMania, but explained he felt strongly about exacting revenge on Henry and realised he may not make it to WrestleMania due to Henry's continued attacks. Regardless of <b>his</b> <b>briefcase,</b> Bryan won a four-way match on the same episode of SmackDown to become the contender for Henry's championship. On the live November 29 episode of SmackDown, Henry managed to pin Bryan to retain his title in a steel cage match. Also in November, Bryan started being involved in a romantic storyline with AJ.|$|E

25|$|The third {{match of}} the night was a Last Man Standing match between Edge and Chris Benoit. The match started out with Benoit getting the upper hand. Edge then got the upper hand by {{throwing}} Benoit sternum first into the turnbuckles. Benoit then applied the Sharpshooter on Edge. Benoit then performed multiple German suplexes on Edge, which sent Edge outside to the floor. Benoit dived through the ropes, but was met with a trash can lid to the face. Edge hit a superplex on Benoit through a trash can. Edge grabbed a ladder and dragged it into the ring, only to get a German suplex off of the ladder. Benoit missed a diving headbutt {{off the top of}} the ladder, Edge grabbed the Money in the Bank briefcase, but was caught in the Crippler Crossface.

After the number one contender's match between Rollins and Reigns ended in a double countout the next night on Raw, on Ambrose's request Shane McMahon announced a triple threat match for the title, now reverted to being called the WWE Championship, between Ambrose, Reigns and Rollins at Battleground. In July, Ambrose successfully defended the title in two singles match against Rollins on both Raw and SmackDown before Battleground. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Ambrose was drafted to SmackDown, being the brand's first draft pick and bringing the WWE Championship with him. At Battleground on July 24, Ambrose successfully retained his title against Rollins and Reigns by pinning the latter. Ambrose then successfully defended the renamed WWE World Championship, which was now exclusive to SmackDown, against Dolph Ziggler at SummerSlam on August 21. His next title defense was at Backlash on September 11, where he lost the title to AJ Styles after Styles hit Ambrose with a low blow while the referee was down before executing a Styles Clash.|$|E
25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} two weeks later. It is midday, {{and the sun}} is scorching. Too hot to work, the mechanics, wearing {{sleeveless}} tank tops or stripped to their waists, laze around the garage and flirt with their girlfriends. Luca has taken Angelo under his wing and is teaching him how to fight. Unfortunately, Angelo shows little skill and continues to be the subject of the other mechanics' ridicule. Dino arrives, looking rather silly in a straw hat, Hawaiian shirt, Bermudas, and socks and sandals. Taking <b>his</b> <b>briefcase,</b> he leaves for a trip. Luca begins flirting with Lana, who is kneading dough for bread, and mutual seduction ensues. The mechanics and their partners also begin behaving lustily with increasing intensity. Lana leads Luca into her apartment with Dino above Dino's office. They make love, and Luca subsequently emerges dressed only in his underwear and an unbuttoned shirt, smoking a cigarette. He then re-enters the apartment and returns to Lana. Other couples lounge around the garage floor, apparently in post-coital bliss. Dino returns from his trip, and chases his workers and their friends away. He sees Lana through the apartment window and thinks she is waving at him, not realizing she is again making love to Luca with her hand pressed to the window. Dino ascends the metal staircase leading to the apartment, but trips and makes a clattering noise. Lana and Luca realize that Dino has returned. Just as Dino enters the apartment, Luca leaves by throwing his clothes out of another window and climbing down a fire escape. He dresses, but discovers that one of his boots is missing. Fortunately, Lana tosses the boot out of the window. Luca puts it on and walks away quickly. Angelo observes and follows him. Next, we see a car in the garage shaking as two people engage in sexual intercourse within. Luca emerges, buttoning his trousers, followed – unexpectedly – by Angelo. The expression on Angelo's face indicates he has fallen in love with Luca, and in parallel solos, both Lana and Angelo express joyous ecstasy at having encountered Luca that night.|$|E

Awarding Steiner a future TNA X Division Championship match and giving Daniels the pink slip, effectively firing him in storyline. After this segment, Steiner and Williams started a storyline over their briefcases, leading up to Against All Odds where Steiner defeated Williams to gain control over both cases. This led to Steiner and Williams starting a partnership, in which Steiner gave Williams the TNA X Division Championship title shot which he used on the April 17, 2008 episode of Impact! to win the title. Steiner went on to use his title shot at TNA's Sacrifice PPV event on May 11, 2008 in a losing effort against then-champion Samoa Joe and Kaz in a 3-Way Dance.

Producer Christopher McQuarrie later stated that the shift of the first assassination attempt to the Wolf's Lair was in order to show the audience the inside of the concrete command bunker, with the intent being to emphasize that Hitler most certainly would have been killed had the July 20th attempt not been moved to the outdoor conference hut.|$|E
