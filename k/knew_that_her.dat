5|$|Imelda <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> husband Ferdinand Marcos {{had dreamed}} of {{becoming}} {{the president of the}} Philippines ever since he was a congressman. One reason why Marcos married Imelda, aside from her physical charms, was because she was a Romualdez—an aristocrat. Imelda's beauty, as well as her background, was appreciated to a great extent by Marcos and Marcos believed she would not only add light to his daily life but also to his political career.|$|E
5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, {{the child of a}} Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to her, black soldiers treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both of them <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> mother was pregnant, but she did not know he was leaving until after he was already gone. A year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a half-sister was born the following year. Her mother and grandmother loved her and treated her like any other child, despite social disapproval. She was close to her half-sister, but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eve of}} {{the opening}} of the Estates General, the queen {{attended}} the mass celebrating its return. As soon as it opened on 5 May 1789, the fracture between the democratic Third Estate (consisting of bourgeois and radical aristocrats) and the conservative nobility of the Second Estate widened, and Marie Antoinette <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> rival, the duc d'Orléans, who had given money and bread to the people during the winter, would be acclaimed by the crowd, much to her detriment.|$|E

Canadian nurses where the only nurses of the Allied armies who held the rank of officers. Gamble was presented with a Royal Red Cross, 2nd Class medal, for her show of “greatest possible tact and extreme devotion to duty.” This was awarded to her at Buckingham Palace during a special ceremony for Canadian nurses.|$|E
25|$|Margaret {{was working}} toward a union of Sweden with Denmark and Norway by having Olaf elected to the Swedish throne. She {{was on the verge}} of {{achieving}} this goal when Olaf IV suddenly died. However, Denmark made Margaret temporary ruler upon the death of Olaf. On 2 February 1388, Norway followed suit and crowned Margaret. Queen Margaret <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> power would be more secure if she were able to find a king to rule in her place. She settled on Eric of Pomerania, grandson of her sister. Thus at an all-Scandinavian meeting held at Kalmar, Erik of Pomerania was crowned king of all three Scandinavian countries. Thus, royal politics resulted in personal unions between the Nordic countries, eventually bringing the thrones of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden under the control of Queen Margaret when the country entered into the Kalmar Union.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} novel, Chase <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> female protagonist {{had to be}} strong enough to equal Dain's {{forceful}} personality. Chase admits that because the novel is set in the period leading up to the Victorian era, a woman like Jessica could not have dealt with Dain, writing that [...] "if Jessica were like what we assume to be the typical young lady of her time, she could never handle Dain, and he’d think her too boring to live". Chase instead modeled Jessica after the type of women who lived a few generations previously and who had [...] "a more practical, frank attitude toward sex".|$|E

500|$|Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, {{an affair}} that {{became known as}} [...] "Travelgate", began with charges that the White House had used audited {{financial}} irregularities in the Travel Office operation {{as an excuse to}} replace the staff with friends from Arkansas. The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo caused the investigation to focus on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true. The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made [...] "factually false" [...] statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false, or <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} use Peggy Mitchell in the breast cancer storyline, {{conforming}} to a soap opera tradition of reserving strong roles for a firmly established middle-aged matriarch. The audience were familiar with Peggy's history, <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> first husband had died from cancer, consequently making her fear hospitals, and she had: [...] "the right mentality for , which was about 'a woman who discovers a lump and then refuses to accept that anything's wrong'. An added factor was that in choosing Peggy the programme could avoid appearing too issue driven, and [...] storyline {{could be used as}} a device to expand and develop her characterisation." [...] Additionally, as the causes of breast cancer are not attributable to risky behaviour, the disease was deemed [...] "more attractive" [...] in storyline terms.

500|$|Elizabeth {{was happy}} to play the part, but it is {{possible}} that in the last decade of her life she began to believe her own performance. She became fond and indulgent of the charming but petulant young Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, who was Leicester's stepson and took liberties with her for which she forgave him. She repeatedly appointed him to military posts despite his growing record of irresponsibility. After Essex's desertion of his command in Ireland in 1599, Elizabeth had him placed under house arrest and the following year deprived him of his monopolies. In February 1601, the earl tried to raise a rebellion in London. He intended to seize the queen but few rallied to his support, and he was beheaded on 25 February. Elizabeth <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> own misjudgements were partly to blame for this turn of events. An observer reported in 1602 that [...] "Her delight is to sit in the dark, and sometimes with shedding tears to bewail Essex".|$|E

500|$|Although Mimi later {{claimed that}} she had bought Lennon's first guitar, it was {{actually}} his mother, after Lennon had pestered her incessantly for weeks. Julia insisted that the £5 instrument had to be delivered to her house and not to her sister's. The two sisters first saw Lennon perform with the Quarrymen at the Woolton St. Peter's Church fête {{on the afternoon of}} 6 July 1957. Julia (who <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> son would be performing) heard music coming from the field behind the church (now the site of the Bishop Martin School), and pulled Mimi along with her to listen. Lennon saw his aunt coming through the crowd and comically changed the words of a song to feature her name: [...] "Oh-oh, here comes Mimi down the aisle now..." [...] Mimi related two versions of what she thought that day after seeing Lennon on stage: [...] "I was horrified to behold John in front of a microphone", and [...] "as pleased as Punch to see him up there".|$|E
500|$|Because, in Trimmer's opinion, {{there was}} a dearth of good {{educational}} material to use in charity schools, she decided to write her own. The series of books she produced between 1786 and 1798 were used in Britain and its colonies well into the 19th century. Trimmer was an able promoter of her materials; she <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> books would not reach large numbers of poor children in charity schools unless they were funded and publicized by the SPCK. She wrote in her journal [...] "my scheme without its aid, will fall to the ground". Thus, she joined the society in 1787. In 1793, she sent 12 copies of her treatise Reflections upon the Education in Charity Schools with the Outlines of a Plan Appropriate Instruction for the Children of the Poor to the subcommittee that chose the books funded by the organization. In the treatise, she argued that the current charity school curriculum was outdated (it was over 100 years old) {{and needed to be}} replaced.

2500|$|... – President George Bush {{strongly}} {{condemned the}} assassination, urging her killers {{to be brought}} to justice. Bush condemned the assassination as a [...] "cowardly act by murderous extremists," [...] and encouraged Pakistan to [...] "honor Benazir Bhutto's memory by continuing with the democratic process for which she so bravely gave her life." [...] Bush also offered some strong praise of Bhutto, noting that [...] "she <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> return to Pakistan earlier this year put her life at risk. Yet she refused to let assassins to dictate the course of her country." [...] Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said, [...] "The brutal assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is a tragic setback for the restoration of democracy in Pakistan. Her courageous return to Pakistan this year gave hope to all those concerned by efforts to extinguish rule of law there." [...] Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, [...] "It is important, when faced with the violence and loss of innocent life over the last few days, that political leaders show a commitment to resolve but also restraint. Extremists must be brought to justice, but extremism must not undermine commitment to the rule of law, to human rights, and to democracy." [...] At another press briefing at around 13:00 EST on December 27, a State Department spokesman asserted that [...] "some kind of postponement or delay" [...] in Pakistan’s democratic process would be [...] "a victory" [...] for [...] "the extremists" [...] who were responsible for Benazir Bhutto's assassination. He also asserted that [...] "perhaps the best antidote to extremism is the continuation of the democratic process." [...] He called for a [...] "credible and transparent" [...] investigation of the attack, and alluded to the [...] "broad international outrage" [...] about the incident. He also said that Bush spoke with Musharraf at 13:15 EST. Ambassador to the United Nations Zalmay Khalilzad, while describing Bhutto as a “courageous figure”, said that “The world has much at stake in the success of Pakistan's democratic institutions. It's a great tragedy because she stood for moderation, for rule of law, for democracy in her country, and her death is a loss for the cause of moderation, democracy, and rule of law for Pakistan. She was clear-headed about the problems of her country, the challenges that she faced — even the security challenges she faced." [...] Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a statement,"We extend our sincere condolences to the Bhutto family and to the families of others who were killed and wounded in the attack. We condemn in the strongest terms possible this cowardly and murderous attack." ...|$|E
