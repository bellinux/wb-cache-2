5|$|Fender's form {{dipped in}} 1924 {{after a good}} start with bat and ball; thereafter, despite {{occasional}} successes, he lacked consistency. Surrey {{finished third in the}} Championship, and <b>Fender</b> contributed 1,004 runs and 84 wickets in all first-class matches. Once again, <b>Fender</b> was a candidate for the England captaincy—South Africa played a Test series that season, and the MCC were to tour Australia in 1924–25. The eventual appointment of Arthur Gilligan was criticised in the press, which again speculated why <b>Fender</b> was not chosen. Fender's prospects of leading England receded further when he clashed once more with Lord Harris. The MCC had rebuked two county committees for covering their pitches prior to matches against the South Africans during a spell of wet weather. <b>Fender</b> pointed out in a letter published by the press that Lord Harris and the MCC were aware that this was common practice at the Scarborough Festival, despite their claims to the contrary. When <b>Fender</b> next played at Lord's, the furious Lord Harris summoned <b>Fender</b> to admonish him. <b>Fender</b> always regretted his indiscretion and believed it finished any chance he had of the England captaincy. <b>Fender</b> played in the first two Tests, without much success, and was dropped; he played only one more Test in his career. Gilligan was injured during the series, but the selectors recalled Douglas as captain rather than select <b>Fender.</b> When the team to tour Australia that winter was chosen, <b>Fender</b> was not selected, a decision which upset him deeply. <b>Fender</b> was married {{at the end of the}} 1924 cricket season, and in the off-season wrote about the MCC tour of Australia for the Daily Express.|$|E
5|$|The Australian team {{joined the}} MCC cricketers {{on the journey}} to England, to play a further five Tests in 1921. Once again, some {{newspapers}} suggested <b>Fender</b> should captain the England team, but Douglas was initially retained; as the series progressed, several writers lamented the fact that <b>Fender</b> was overlooked. <b>Fender</b> began the season poorly and was not picked {{for the first three}} Tests, all of which were won by Australia. The England selectors tried 30 players {{in the course of the}} summer, many of whom critics did not consider to be of suitable quality. <b>Fender</b> began to take wickets consistently in the middle of the season, and scored a century in the Gentlemen v Players match, so he was chosen for the fourth Test. The game was drawn, affected by rain. <b>Fender</b> scored 44 not out and took two for 30 in the game. The final match was also a rain-ruined draw; <b>Fender</b> retained his place but had little success. He later said that he learned a great deal from Warwick Armstrong's captaincy of the Australians.|$|E
5|$|Chosen for the Gentlemen v Players, <b>Fender</b> had {{his first}} success in the fixture, hitting 50 in 40 minutes, the highest score for the Gentlemen in the match; it may have {{influenced}} his selection for the MCC team to tour Australia. Some sections of the press suggested <b>Fender</b> should captain that team, but Reginald Spooner was initially appointed by the MCC; when he was unavailable, J.W.H.T.Douglas became captain. <b>Fender</b> {{was included in the}} team, and the press regarded his selection as a formality.|$|E
50|$|Marine <b>fenders</b> {{are used}} at ports and docks on quay walls and other {{berthing}} structures. They absorb the kinetic {{energy of a}} berthing vessel and thus prevent damage to the vessel or the berthing structure. There are 2 major categories of <b>fenders</b> for port applications: Fixed and Floating. Fixed <b>fenders</b> are mounted to the berth structure and compose of buckling <b>fenders</b> such as cell <b>fenders,</b> V-type <b>fenders,</b> and non-buckling <b>fenders</b> such as cylindrical <b>fenders.</b> Floating <b>fenders</b> are placed between the berth structure and ship, and include pneumatic <b>fenders</b> and foam-filled <b>fenders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Arch <b>fenders</b> were {{introduced}} to improve upon the performance of Cylindrical <b>fenders.</b> Arch <b>fenders</b> have a better Energy / Reaction force ratio and recommended {{for all types of}} applications. The shape of these <b>fenders</b> helps to dissipate the stresses evenly. These extruded <b>fenders</b> are very easy to install and are maintenance free. Generally preferred for small to medium range vessels.|$|R
50|$|The first Siluros had cycle <b>fenders.</b> Later rules {{stipulated that}} cars must have {{attached}} <b>fenders</b> so owners simply added aluminum to the <b>fenders</b> and connected {{them to the}} body. The Bandini factory then produced them with fully attaching <b>fenders.</b> These <b>fenders</b> could be removed and a tonneau cover placed over the passenger seat which made the cars eligible for the Formula Three open wheeled class.|$|R
5|$|<b>Fender</b> {{was bought}} by CBS in 1965. Rhodes stayed with the company, and {{released}} the first <b>Fender</b> Rhodes piano, a 73 note model. The instrument consisted of two components— the piano and a separate enclosure containing the power amplifier and loudspeaker, which was placed underneath the former. Like the piano bass, it was finished in black tolex, and came with a fiberglass top. During the late 1960s, two models of the <b>Fender</b> Rhodes Celeste also became available, which used the top three or four octaves, respectively, of the <b>Fender</b> Rhodes piano. The Celeste did not sell particularly well and examples are now hard to find.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fender</b> was {{the elder}} son of Percy Robert <b>Fender,</b> the {{director}} of a firm of stationers, and Lily, née Herbert. Born in Balham, Surrey, in 1892, he was encouraged to play cricket by his mother's family who were involved in Brighton club cricket, and from the age of eight he attended cricket matches to watch Sussex when visiting them. First educated at St George's College, Weybridge, then at St Paul's School, London, <b>Fender</b> did not excel academically, but was proficient in many sports.|$|E
5|$|Ranaldo {{used his}} {{signature}} <b>Fender</b> Jazzmaster guitar during the recording sessions of Between the Times and the Times and a custom-built electric guitar by Jarrell Guitars. Several Martin and Gibson acoustic guitars were used, including a Martin D-35, Martin 00018, Gibson J-50and Gibson J-45. Various equipment—such as <b>Fender</b> Prosonic and <b>Fender</b> Super Reverb amplifiers, Ibanez Analog Delay, Voodoo Lab Sparkle Drive, BJF Electronics' Honey Bee and DOD Two Second Digital Delay effects pedals—was {{used during the}} recording sessions {{to contribute to the}} album's sound.|$|E
5000|$|Cylindrical <b>fenders</b> are {{commonly}} used <b>fenders</b> which ensure a safe and linear berthing for different kinds of vessels. Cylindrical (extruded) <b>fenders</b> are an economical solution to protect most berthing structures, and offer ease of installation. In France, professional mariners call them [...] "bougnafles".|$|R
50|$|For {{bunkering}} operations {{between two}} vessels, floating <b>fenders</b> such as pneumatic or foam elastomer <b>fenders</b> are typically used.|$|R
50|$|Historically, <b>fenders</b> were woven from rope in {{a variety}} of patterns. <b>Fenders</b> of woven rope are still used today by {{historic}} boat owners.|$|R
5|$|These are {{the books}} of which <b>Fender</b> was the main author.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fender</b> Telecaster – Gallagher uses several, one of which, a '60s model, {{was given}} to Noel by Johnny Depp as a {{birthday}} present.|$|E
5|$|He 111 H-8: The H-8 was a rebuild of H-3 or H-5 aircraft, {{but with}} balloon cable-cutting <b>fender.</b> The H-8 was powered by Jumo 211D-1s.|$|E
50|$|Square <b>fenders</b> are {{commonly}} used on vessels as well as small jetties. They are compression-moulded <b>fenders</b> generally used on tugs, boats and ships.|$|R
50|$|Yachts, small leisure {{craft and}} support vessels {{typically}} have mobile <b>fenders</b> which are placed between {{the boat and}} the dock as the boat approaches the dock. Docks and other marine structures, such as canal entrances and bases of bridges, have permanent <b>fenders</b> placed to avoid damage from boats. Old tires are often used as <b>fenders</b> in such places.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{automobile}} <b>fenders</b> {{set over}} the wheels to prevent mud, sand and dust being thrown {{on to the}} body and the occupants. [...] <b>Fenders</b> typically became a more integral part of overall auto bodies by the mid-1930s. In contrast to the slab-sided cars, the Volkswagen Beetle had real bolt-on <b>fenders</b> over both its front and rear wheels.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the cancellation of}} county cricket in 1914, <b>Fender</b> enlisted in the army, joining the Inns of Court Regiment. Commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, <b>Fender</b> disliked the routine of army life. With {{the help of the}} cricketer Pelham Warner, who worked in the War Office, he was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1915. <b>Fender</b> was initially stationed in London, where he was involved in work repelling Zeppelin attacks, before being sent to India in 1916. Soon after his arrival, he became ill with dysentery, possibly cholera and several other diseases. He returned to England to recover but was left weak for much of the following two years. Army doctors were unsure what exactly was wrong with <b>Fender</b> and he remained in their care until 1918. He played some charity cricket in 1917 and 1918, but did not return to light duties with the Royal Flying Corps until the latter year. Just as he seemed to have recovered fully, he fractured his left leg in five places playing football at the end of 1918. He remained on crutches throughout the remainder of 1918 and 1919, missing the resumption of county cricket in 1919. While incapacitated, <b>Fender</b> attempted to gain a place at Caius College, Cambridge, but was turned down owing to the restriction his injury placed upon his cricket, and his desire to concentrate on academic interests to further his business career—the interviewing panel only wanted him as a cricketer. Although he recovered in time to play in the 1920 season, his leg troubled him for the remainder of his career; he was left with a minor limp, and long spells of fielding left him in pain.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the 73-note Stage Piano was {{introduced}} as a lighter and more portable {{alternative to the}} existing two-piece style, featuring four detachable legs (used in <b>Fender</b> steel pedal guitars), a sustain pedal and a single output jack. Although the Stage could be used with any amplifier, catalogs suggested {{the use of the}} <b>Fender</b> Twin Reverb. The older style piano continued to be sold alongside the Stage and was renamed the Suitcase Piano, with 88 note models also becoming available.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodes piano (also {{known as}} the <b>Fender</b> Rhodes piano or simply <b>Fender</b> Rhodes or Rhodes) is an {{electric}} piano invented by Harold Rhodes, which became particularly popular throughout the 1970s. Like a piano, it generates sound using keys and hammers, but instead of strings, the hammers strike thin metal tines, which are then amplified via an electromagnetic pickup which is plugged into an external keyboard amplifier and speaker.|$|E
50|$|Keyhole <b>fenders</b> are {{the most}} {{versatile}} bow, stem <b>fenders</b> used on tugboats and small port craft/ferries. They offer maximum protection to tugs/ferries with their typical profile and load-absorbing capabilities.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fenders</b> and Overfenders: All <b>fenders</b> and overfenders (including {{widebody}} style-kits) {{must not}} inhibit the turning of the car's wheels (which {{must be able}} to turn 30 degrees inward and 50 degrees outward).|$|R
5000|$|Ponton or pontoon styling {{refers to}} a 1930s-1960s design genre—ultimately the {{precursor}} of modern automotive styling. The trend emerged as bodywork began to enclose the full width and uninterrupted length of a car, incorporating previously distinct running boards and fully articulated <b>fenders.</b> The <b>fenders</b> of an automobile with ponton styling may also be called Pontoon <b>fenders,</b> and the overall trend may also be known as envelope styling.|$|R
5|$|While at school, <b>Fender</b> {{spent his}} summers with his {{grandparents}} in Brighton, which qualified {{him to play}} County Cricket for Sussex. When he left school in 1910, he attracted {{the interest of the}} club and, after success in both local cricket and second-team matches, he made his first-class debut on 21 July as an amateur in Sussex's County Championship match against Nottinghamshire. He played one other game that season, against Worcestershire, where he was shaken by the pace of two opposing bowlers. In the two games, <b>Fender</b> scored 19 runs and took one wicket.|$|E
5|$|Berry {{continued}} to play 70 to 100 one-nighters {{per year in the}} 1980s, still traveling solo and requiring a local band to back him at each stop. In 1986, Taylor Hackford made a documentary film, Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll, of a celebration concert for Berry's sixtieth birthday, organized by Keith Richards. Eric Clapton, Etta James, Julian Lennon, Robert Cray and Linda Ronstadt, among others, appeared with Berry on stage and in the film. During the concert, Berry played a Gibson ES-355, the luxury version of the ES-335 that he favored on his 1970s tours. Richards played a black <b>Fender</b> Telecaster Custom, Cray a <b>Fender</b> Stratocaster and Clapton a , the same model that Berry used on his early recordings.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, <b>Fender</b> {{joined the}} Royal Air Force. He worked in {{southern}} England with a responsibility for moving men and equipment, and was mentioned in dispatches {{for his role}} in preparations for the Allied invasion of Europe. Later, he was posted to various parts of the world in his role in movements.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fender</b> later {{insisted that}} his role was minor in {{creating}} the strategy, but {{he was close to}} both Jardine and Arthur Carr, who discussed the plans before the tour began; some writers suggested that the original idea was Fender's.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fender</b> {{worked for}} his father, {{including}} periods spent in France and Belgium, {{up until the}} outbreak of war in 1914, but {{when he returned from}} active service found the business frustrating. With his father's approval, he left the firm to start his own wine business with his brother Robert. The business thrived, in part owing to Fender's wide range of connections, and he remained chairman and managing director until 1976. For a time, <b>Fender</b> produced his own whiskey brand, which he tried to sell when touring South Africa with the MCC in 1922–23, but competition from the larger distilling companies meant that it was a short-lived success. After the Second World War, he had to rebuild his wine firm, which had suffered from wartime restrictions and hardships, this time assisted by his son. He and Robert also established a paper merchants called <b>Fender</b> Brothers, although he later relinquished his shares in the company. Meanwhile, he maintained his connections with Crescens Robinson and followed his father as chairman of the company from 1943 to 1968.|$|E
5|$|Gallagher {{has said}} that he used only 100-watt Marshalls early in his career. After Definitely Maybe, he began using smaller amps, {{singling}} out Fenders (Princeton and Bandmaster), and also a combo made by Clark Amplification, which builds amplifiers based on vintage <b>Fender</b> and Marshall amps.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Styling=== The {{style of}} the truck {{involved}} headlamps that were integrated into the <b>fenders.</b> The hood opens alligator style. Heavy duty models (K6 and above) carried over the D-series cab and high crowned <b>fenders.</b>|$|R
