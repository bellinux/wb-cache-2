5|$|In 2003, {{evidence}} of tumors, including hemangiomas, desmoplastic <b>fibroma,</b> metastatic cancer, and osteoblastoma, {{was described in}} Edmontosaurus bones. Rothschild et al. tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, also tested positive. Although more than 10,000fossils were examined in this manner, the tumors were limited to Edmontosaurus and closely related genera. The tumors may {{have been caused by}} environmental factors or genetic propensity.|$|E

25|$|Spondyloarthropathy {{has been}} {{documented}} in the spine of a 78-million year old hadrosaurid. Other examples of pathologies in hadrosaurs include healed wounds from predators, such as those found in Edmontosaurus annectens, and tumors such as hemangiomas, desmoplastic <b>fibroma,</b> metastatic cancer, and osteoblastomas, found in genera such as Brachylophosaurus and Edmontosaurus. Osteochondrosis is also commonly found in hadrosaurs.|$|E
40|$|Multiple beadlike <b>fibromas</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} in the lungs of European elks bearing cutaneous <b>fibromas</b> and fibropapillomas. DNA extracted from the lung <b>fibromas</b> was found to contain multiple copies of unintegrated European elk papillomavirus DNA, indicating an association between pulmonary fibromatosis and papillomavirus. No virus particles were observed in the tumor tissue by electron microscopy. Histological examination revealed that the lung <b>fibromas</b> had a morphology {{similar to that of}} cutaneous <b>fibromas...</b>|$|R
30|$|In most cases, an {{association}} with other primary benign or malignant bone lesions is present. These include giant cell tumours, fibrous dysplasia, non-ossifying <b>fibromas,</b> IH, osteoblastomas, simple bone cysts, chondroblastomas, chondromyxoid <b>fibromas</b> and osteosarcomas [16].|$|R

25|$|Epulis (literally, 'on the gingiva') is {{a general}} term for any gingival or {{alveolar}} tumor (i.e. lump on the gum). This term describes only {{the location of a}} lump and has no implication on the histologic appearance of a lesion. Epulis is also sometimes used synonymously with epulis fissuratum, however other conditions are classified as epulides, e.g. giant cell epulis (peripheral giant cell granuloma), ossifying fibroid epulis (peripheral ossifying <b>fibroma),</b> and congenital epulis.|$|E

5000|$|Cutaneous <b>fibromas</b> are {{frequently}} occurring neoplasms naturally occurring virus of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Deer <b>fibromas</b> {{appear on the}} skin as hard and round tumors that can {{be as big as}} 1 cm in diameter. The tumors are blackish or brown and have a rough textured surface. They do not cause the animal harm unless clumps of <b>fibromas</b> interfere with breathing, eating, or walking. [...] "Fibromas have been reported in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus), fallow deer (Cervus dama), red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Sika deer (Cervus nippon), moose (Alces alces) and caribou (Rangifer caribou)." [...] Other common names for <b>fibromas</b> are deer warts or Shope’s warts/fibroma. They are found across the entirety of the whitetail's range.|$|R
3000|$|Ossifying <b>fibromas</b> of the jaw are {{a type of}} benign fibro-osseous lesion {{detected}} in approximately 50  % of HPT-JT individuals and present in adolescents or young adults [2]. In contrast, sporadic ossifying <b>fibromas</b> of the jaw are rare and typically occur in an older age group [4]. Ossifying <b>fibromas</b> of the jaw arise from the mesenchymal cells of the periodontal ligament, the fibrous connective tissue found within the periodontal space, which secures the tooth [5]. They are composed of fibrous tissue with varying amounts of mature bone, osteoid and cementum [6] [...].|$|R
30|$|The {{majority}} of <b>fibromas</b> {{are found in}} the LV or RV wall, and fewer than 20 % are detected in the IVS [5]. <b>Fibromas</b> can cause lethal arrhythmia, valve regurgitation, and ventricular inflow/outflow tract obstruction depending on their location and size [4, 8]. If left untreated, <b>fibromas</b> can increase the risk of fatality. Therefore, surgical resection is recommended, especially in symptomatic cases. Basically complete resection is recommended first. But, partial resection can be an acceptable option when papillary muscle, valvular, and/or ventricular function might be reduced after complete resection [3, 7].|$|R

40|$|Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome" {{describes}} the complex of multiple nonossifying <b>fibromas</b> {{of the long}} bones, mandibular giant cell lesions, and café-au-lait macules in individuals without neurofibromas. We sought to determine whether Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome is a distinct genetic entity or a variant of neurofibromatosis type 1. We performed germline NF 1, SPRED 1, and GNAS 1 (exon 8) mutation testing on patients with Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome or Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome-related features. We also performed somatic NF 1 mutation testing on nonossifying <b>fibromas</b> and giant cell lesions. Pathogenic germline NF 1 mutations were identified in 13 of 14 patients with multiple café-au-lait macules and multiple nonossifying <b>fibromas</b> or giant cell lesions ("classical" Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome); all 13 also fulfilled the National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 1. Somatic NF 1 mutations were detected in two giant cell lesions but not in two nonossifying <b>fibromas.</b> No SPRED 1 or GNAS 1 (exon 8) mutations were detected in the seven NF 1 -negative patients with Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome, nonossifying <b>fibromas,</b> or giant cell lesions. In this study, the majority of patients with café-au-lait macules and nonossifying <b>fibromas</b> or giant cell lesions harbored a pathogenic germline NF 1 mutation, suggesting that many Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome cases may actually have neurofibromatosis type 1.
