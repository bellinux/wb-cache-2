40|$|Conservation tillage {{techniques}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular worldwide as they {{have the potential to}} generate environmental, agronomic, and economic benefits. In Mediterranean areas, studies performed on the effects of conservation tillage [in comparison with the conventional tillage technique (CT) ] on grain yield of cereal crops have reported contradictory results as well as considerable year-to-year variation, demonstrating how the impact of different soil tillage techniques on crop productivity is strongly site-specific. The present paper summarises the main results from a set of experiments carried out in Sicily during the last 20 years in which we compared no tillage (NT) to CT in terms of their respective effects on the productivity and quality of durum wheat, {{while at the same time}} varying some other crop management practices (e. g. crop sequence, N fertilisation, wheat genotype, sowing time). On average, no differences were observed between the two tillage techniques; yields were 3. 84 and 3. 87 Mg ha – 1 for CT and NT, respectively. However, NT guaranteed superior yield when water stress during the crop cycle was high, whereas CT led to higher yields when water availability was adequate. Moreover, the results suggest that the use of <b>NT</b> <b>needs</b> to be accompanied by a rational crop sequence. In fact, a cumulative detrimental effect of NT over time was found for continuous wheat. Finally, grain quality in terms of protein content was slightly higher for CT (15. 1 %) than NT (14. 4 %).

Neurite outgrowth from explants of 8 -d chick embryo dorsal root ganglia was achieved at very low NGF concentrations with heart conditioned medium during overnight culture. Quickly incrasing the NGF concentration in the growth medium dramatically affected GC and neurite morphology: the majority of GCs and neurites collapsed and retracted towards the cell body over a course of approximately 2 - 5 min. Retraction was elicited by increasing NGF levels from 0 to 0. 05 ng/ml to as little as 0. 5 ng/ml but did not occur if the NGF concentration during the initial overnight culture period exceeded 0. 8 ng/ml, regardless of how much the concentration was elevated. Similar concentration changes of cytochrome c or insulin <b>did</b> <b>nt</b> result in retraction. Neurites that had been separated from their cell bodies by cutting close to their exit from the explant still retracted when NGF levels were raised. Cytochalasin B reversible inhibits retraction, whereas colchicine allows retraction to occur.

The aim {{of the study was}} to describe our experience in the use of the NT for bi-level NIV in infants and its effectiveness. METHODS: Prospective obser-vational study from January 2007 to December 2010, including all patients< 6 months old admitted to the pediatric ICU (PICU) and treated with NIV with two levels of pressure using the NT. Clinical data collected before starting NIV, and at 2, 8, 12 and 24 h, were analyzed following NIV initiation: first-line or initial NIV (i-NIV), elective postextubation NIV (e-NIV), and rescue postextubation NIV (r-NIV). The need for intubation was considered to be NIV failure. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one episodes of NIV were included in the study, with 65 % of patients having bronchiolitis. e-NIV was most frequently used (48 %) (i-NIV 44 %, r-NIV 8 %), and the failure rate, 27 % in total, was highest in the i-NIV group (37 %) (e-NIV 18 %, r-NIV 25 %). Case patients with successful outcomes had shorter PICU stays (8. 5 vs 13 d, P. 001) and hospital stays (17 vs 23 d, P. 03) stays. The <b>NT</b> <b>needed</b> to be changed for another interface in only 5 case patients, few complications (4 of 151 patients) were observed, and mortality (2 of 151 patients) was unrelated to NIV. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the NT showed 73 % effectiveness, with few complications. The effective-ness was higher in e-NIV than i-NIV.

Objective: This paper aims to review evidence-based data {{on the use of}} NTs in TRD. Method: Using keywords and combined-word strategy, multiple computer searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, Quertle(R), and Medline were conducted for retrieving relevant articles published in English-language peer-reviewed journals (2000 &ndash; 2012). Those papers that addressed NTs in TRD were retained for extensive review. Results: Despite methodological challenges, a range of 30 %&ndash; 93 % of TRD patients showed substantial improvement to one of the NTs. One hundred&ndash;percent improvement was reported in two single-case studies on deep brain stimulation. Some studies reported no benefits from transcranial direct current stimulation. NTs were reported to have good clinical efficacy, better safety margin, and benign side-effect profile. Data are limited regarding randomized clinical trials, long-term efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of these approaches. Both modified electroconvulsive therapy and magnetic seizure therapy were associated with reversible but disturbing neurocognitive adverse effects. Besides clinical utility, NTs including approaches on the horizon may unlock the biological basis underlying mood disorders including TRD.

Stimulation of lipolytic activity in adipose tissue or inhibition of fat synthesis is one way to prevent these serious diseases. Lactic acid bacteria have an anti-obesity effect, but the mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the administration of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus gasseri NT) on lipid metabolism and fat synthesis in a mouse high-fat-diet model, focusing on visceral fat. Balb/c mice were fed a 45 kcal % fat diet for 13 weeks with and without a freeze-dried preparation of L. gasseri NT (109 CFU/g). An ex vivo glycerol assay with periovarian fat revealed that L. gasseri <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not stimulate lipolytic activity.

Our experience with such a system, the Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME), is reviewed here and system design suggestions are given for improved attitude determination. SME, launched in October, 1981, is still being operated by students and scientists of the University of Colorado. The mission operations software and has been kept up to date and now can be run on a micro VAX or a SUN work station, providing "mission ops,in a suitcase". The attitude of SME is adjusted only once or twice a day by ground control, allowing several orbits of data in which the attitude varies smoothly, without discontinuities. Averaging horizon sensor pulses over an orbit provides ar accuracy of 0. 03 ° rms, thi rty times better than traditional spinners The three sigma accuracy of 0. 1 ° promised by Ball Aerospace for spinners is thus proven state of the art.

50|$|In {{terms of}} {{concrete}} political positions, the <b>NT</b> milieu <b>did</b> not significantly {{differ from the}} wider Eurocommunist scene. <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not see their role as informing Communist cadre so much as influencing the wider left, in particular the Labourites and Liberals. They advocated broad coalitions of oppressed groups, and ushered {{in an era of}} 'identity politics'. (Indeed, much of Hall's subsequent work was concerned with questions of identity.) NT repudiated the project of abolishing capitalism, ascribing the failure of Bolshevism to 'voluntarism.' NT held instead to a decidedly reformist project: the left should adapt to the world, rather than seeking to change it.|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{information}} stored in the Srcr link table, the link updater maintains its own so called neighbor table (NT), which includes information for its neighbors. Initially, the NT is empty. The updater periodically reads the Srcr link table and updates <b>NT</b> as <b>needed.</b> The <b>NT</b> contents are updated whenever (1) a new neighbor appears, (2) an existing neighbor disappears, or (3) a certain link quality changes. In such cases, the NCRAWL updater broadcasts a packet with the new NT contents and sets a timer. When such a NT packet is received (overheard) by other nodes, their corresponding updater utility replies by broadcasting its NT, provided it has not done so recently. Specifically, {{in order to avoid}} excessive network overheads due to such messaging, we leverage a NT reply suppression threshold; while the value of this threshold is tunable (and can be configured based on network and application dynamics), we set it to be equal to the Srcr broadcasting interval period. The NT packets are used by the NCRAWL updater to maintain the so called received NT table (RNTT), which complements NT by storing information about the link quality, as measured by neighbors.|$|R
