He was an al-Qaeda sympathizer from the town of Zarqa, the hometown of Jordanian militant <b>Islamist</b> Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He was married and had two daughters. <b>Islamist</b> websites, as well as some newspapers, characterized the attacker as a triple agent, someone who is believed to be a double agent by the intelligence organization he infiltrates.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, 58 {{tourists}} and four Egyptians were massacred at nearby Deir el-Bahri by <b>Islamist</b> militants from Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya. This {{led to an}} overall drop in tourism in the area.|$|E

50|$|Syria {{continues}} to hold {{an unknown number of}} members of the Muslim Brotherhood and other <b>Islamists</b> as political detainees and prisoners. Many alleged <b>Islamists</b> not connected to the Muslim Brotherhood have been charged and convicted for membership in a Salafist organization. Arrests of alleged <b>Islamists</b> and, in some cases, convictions, were motivated primarily by the Syrian government's view of militant <b>Islamists</b> as potential threats to government stability.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the start}} of the Arab Spring in 2011, Gaddafi spoke out in favour of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, then {{threatened}} by the Tunisian Revolution. He suggested that Tunisia's people would be satisfied if Ben Ali introduced a Jamahiriyah system there. Fearing domestic protest, Libya's government implemented preventative measures by reducing food prices, purging the army leadership of potential defectors and releasing several <b>Islamist</b> prisoners. They proved ineffective, and on 17 February 2011, major protests broke out against Gaddafi's government. Unlike Tunisia or Egypt, Libya was largely religiously homogeneous and had no strong <b>Islamist</b> movement, but there was widespread dissatisfaction with the corruption and entrenched systems of patronage, while unemployment had reached around 30%.|$|E

Under the Sunni <b>Islamist</b> government of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and Tayyip Erdoğan, an increasing discrimination against and persecution of the Alevi minority has begun.|$|E
50|$|It is 1993 in Algeria and <b>Islamists</b> {{have just}} assassinated Tahar Djaout.

The next day, Somali troops attempted to recapture the town from <b>Islamists</b> militians. After hours of fighting, the <b>Islamists</b> reportedly fled the town on technicals. Al-Shabaab claimed that they killed 70 Somali soldiers and that they captured 10 military vehicles.

50|$|The conference {{eventually}} {{opened for}} real on 19 July 2007; however, moderate <b>Islamists</b> and Hawiye clan elders still boycotted it, {{claiming that the}} venue were not neutral. <b>Islamists</b> have scheduled a conference in Asmara instead.|$|R
5|$|According to {{the retired}} senior U.S. {{intelligence}} official speaking to Hersh, bin Laden was ill at this point, financially supported by some within Saudi Arabia, and {{kept by the}} ISI to better manage their complex relationship with Pakistani and Afghan <b>Islamist</b> groups. According to the official, retired CIA officials {{emphasized the importance of}} bin Laden's courier to the press, because they were nervous over torture scrutiny and possible prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's {{ability to}} adapt to new {{tactical}} and political situations was perhaps tested {{by the rise of}} the Hamas and PIJ organizations, <b>Islamist</b> groups espousing rejectionist policies with Israel. These groups often bombed non-military targets, such as malls and movie theaters, to increase the psychological damage and civilian casualties. In the 1990s, these groups seemed to threaten Arafat's capacity to hold together a unified nationalist organization with a goal of statehood.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, President Bill Clinton {{appointed}} Raphel as {{the first}} Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs within the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, a newly created position within the State Department focused on a growing array of problems in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, including democratic stability, nuclear proliferation, energy access, <b>Islamist</b> and Taliban extremism, poverty and women's rights issues.|$|E

50|$|From the 1940s {{through the}} 1960s, Communists and <b>Islamists</b> {{sometimes}} joined forces in opposing colonialism and seeking national independence. The Tudeh (Iranian Communist party) was {{allied with the}} <b>Islamists</b> in their ultimately successful rebellion against the Shah in 1979, although after the Shah was overthrown, the <b>Islamists</b> turned on their one-time allies. However, the MEK, an exiled communist party which opposes the Islamic Republic still have some power in their headquarters in Camp Ashraf.|$|R

5|$|People {{from the}} North-West and South-West provinces, {{which used to}} be a part of British Cameroons, are largely Protestant. The French-speaking regions of the {{southern}} and western regions are largely Catholic. Southern ethnic groups predominantly follow Christian or traditional African animist beliefs, or a syncretic combination of the two. People widely believe in witchcraft, and the government outlaws such practices. Suspected witches are often subject to mob violence. The <b>Islamist</b> jihadist group Boko Haram has been reported as operating in North Cameroon.|$|E
5|$|Some of Nasser's {{liberal and}} <b>Islamist</b> critics in Egypt, {{including}} the founding {{members of the}} New Wafd Party and writer Jamal Badawi, dismissed Nasser's popular appeal with the Egyptian masses during his presidency as being the product of successful manipulation and demagoguery. Egyptian political scientist Alaa al-Din Desouki blamed the 1952 revolution's shortcomings on Nasser's concentration of power, and Egypt's lack of democracy on Nasser's political style and his government's limitations on freedom of expression and political participation.|$|E
5|$|The film {{compares the}} rise of the {{neoconservative}} movement in the United States and the radical <b>Islamist</b> movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, is a myth, or noble lie, perpetuated by leaders of many countries—and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.—in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas.|$|E
5000|$|During {{and after}} the 1988 October Riots <b>Islamists</b> [...] "set about {{building}} bridges to the young urban poor". The riots [...] "petered out" [...] after meetings between the President Chadli and <b>Islamists</b> Ali Belhadj {{and members of the}} Muslim Brotherhood.|$|R
50|$|Sadat's Corrective Revolution also {{included}} the imprisonment of other political forces in Egypt, including liberals, and <b>Islamists.</b> The imprisonment of <b>Islamists</b> {{had a strong}} effect later on, as these <b>Islamists</b> were often members of the Takfir wal-Hijra movement and the Corrective Revolution {{marked the beginning of}} the crackdown that caused them to spread across the Arab World, and Europe, ultimately resulting in the spread of radical political Islam in these regions, and also the assassination of Anwar Sadat.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{concerns}} that domination of parliament by <b>Islamists</b> {{from two different}} sects arguing contentious issues in the chamber may further encourage sectarianism. Bahrain's leading salafist politician, Sheikh Adel Al Mouwdah, has sought to play down the fears and welcomed the prospect of working with Al Wefaq and other Shia <b>Islamists,</b> seeing opportunities for cooperation, saying [...] "I would rather have <b>Islamists</b> from both Sunni and Shiite sects than liberal deputies who do not uphold Islamic values." ...|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} {{branches}} {{of political parties}} on the council, including Communist, <b>Islamist,</b> and secular. The leftist factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Palestinian People's Party (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. Hamas gained {{the majority of the}} open seats in the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections.|$|E
5|$|There was {{violence}} in the Netherlands and in Norway: the Chinese embassy in the Netherlands was attacked by Uyghur activists who smashed windows with bricks, the Chinese flag was also burnt.

Eleven were detained, and later released without charge. Protesters from a coalition of Indonesian <b>Islamist</b> groups attacked guards at the Chinese embassy in Jakarta {{and called for a}} jihad against China.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other <b>Islamist</b> movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E
50|$|The Kuwaiti {{government}} strongly advocated Islamism {{throughout the}} 1980s. At that time, {{the most serious}} threat to the continuity of Al Sabah came from home-grown secular democrats. The secular Kuwaiti opposition were protesting the 1976 suspension of the parliament. Al Sabah were attracted to <b>Islamists</b> preaching the virtues of a hierarchical order that included loyalty to the Kuwaiti monarchy. In 1981, the Kuwaiti government gerrymandered electoral districts in favor of the <b>Islamists.</b> <b>Islamists</b> were the government's main allies, hence <b>Islamists</b> were able to colonize state agencies, such as the government ministries. In 1983, the parliament banned alcohol consumption. By the mid 1980s, Kuwait was described as an autocracy. In 1986, Emir Jaber suspended the parliament.|$|R
50|$|In February 2014, a {{massacre}} of a Malian general's family who were ethnic Tuareg {{led to an}} ethnic conflict between Fulani <b>Islamists</b> and Tuareg MNLA separatists.

25|$|As {{the country}} entered 1976, the socialist {{alliance}} of Bhutto collapsed, forcing his left-wing allies {{to form an}} alliance with right-wing conservatives and <b>Islamists</b> to challenge {{the power of the}} PPP. The <b>Islamists</b> started a Nizam-e-Mustafa movement which demanded the establishment of an Islamic state in the country and removal of immorality from society. In an effort {{to meet the demands of}} <b>Islamists,</b> Bhutto banned the drinking and selling of wine by Muslims and also banned nightclubs and horse racing.|$|R
