5|$|Most Doctor Who episodes {{were made}} on two-inch {{videotape}} for initial broadcast and then telerecorded onto 16 mm film by BBC Enterprises for further commercial exploitation. Enterprises used 16mm for overseas sales as it was considerably cheaper to buy and easier to transport than videotape. It also circumvented the problem of different countries' incompatible video standards, as film was a universal medium whereas videotape was not. The BBC had no central archive at the time; the Film Library kept programmes {{that had been made}} on film, while the Engineering Department was responsible for storing videotapes. BBC Enterprises only kept copies of programmes they deemed commercially exploitable. They had little <b>dedicated</b> <b>storage</b> space, and tended to place piles of film canisters wherever they could find space for them at their Villiers House property.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{most commonly}} {{available as a}} solution in water. For consumers, it is usually available from pharmacies at 3 and 6 wt% concentrations. The concentrations are sometimes {{described in terms of}} the volume of oxygen gas generated; one milliliter of a 20-volume solution generates twenty milliliters of oxygen gas when completely decomposed. For laboratory use, 30 wt% solutions are most common. Commercial grades from 70% to 98% are also available, but due to the potential of solutions of more than 68% hydrogen peroxide to be converted entirely to steam and oxygen (with the temperature of the steam increasing as the concentration increases above 68%) these grades are potentially far more hazardous and require special care in <b>dedicated</b> <b>storage</b> areas. Buyers must typically allow inspection by commercial manufacturers.|$|E
500|$|A major {{restriction}} hampering {{sales of}} E85 flex vehicles, or fueling with E85, is the limited infrastructure available to sell E85 {{to the public}} with only 2% of the motor fuel stations offering E85 by March 2014. , there were only 3,218 fueling stations selling E85 {{to the public in}} the entire U.S., while about 156,000 retail motor fuel outlets do not offer any ethanol blend. In addition, there has been a great concentration of E85 stations in the Corn Belt states. The main constraint for a more rapid expansion of E85 availability is that it requires <b>dedicated</b> <b>storage</b> tanks at filling stations, at an estimated cost of [...] for each dedicated ethanol tank. The Obama Administration set the goal of installing 10,000 blender pumps nationwide until 2015, and to support this target the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued a rule in May 2011 to include flexible fuel pumps in the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). This ruling will provide financial assistance to fuel station owners to install E85 and blender pumps.|$|E
