5|$|<b>Hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> (HBO) {{has been}} {{evaluated}} as an add on treatment following TBI. The {{findings of a}} 2012 Cochrane systematic review does not justify the routine use of <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> to treat people recovering from a traumatic brain injury. This review also reported {{that only a small}} number of randomized controlled trials had been conducted at the time of the review, many of which had methodological problems and poor reporting. HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine if it has a role.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} {{is caused}} by exposure to oxygen at partial pressures greater than those to which the body is normally exposed. This occurs in three principal settings: underwater diving, <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy,</b> {{and the provision of}} supplemental oxygen, particularly to premature infants. In each case, the risk factors are markedly different.|$|E
5|$|Hyperoxic myopia has {{occurred}} in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures. It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy.</b> This is due {{to an increase in}} the refractive power of the lens, since axial length and keratometry readings do not reveal a corneal or length basis for a myopic shift. It is usually reversible with time.|$|E

50|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) {{is always}} {{presumed to be}} a complication in smoke inhalation. The initial approach to presumed CO poisoning involves administering supplemental oxygen {{at a fraction of}} inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100 percent and then the use of <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> (HBO) <b>therapy</b> is evaluated by physicians.|$|R
5|$|The medical {{aspects of}} diving and {{hyperbaric}} exposure include examination of divers to establish medical fitness to dive, {{diagnosis and treatment}} of diving disorders, treatment by recompression and <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy,</b> toxic effects of gases in a hyperbaric environment, and treatment of injuries incurred while diving which are not directly associated with depth or pressure.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} can cause seizures, brief periods of rigidity followed by convulsions and unconsciousness, and {{is of concern}} to divers who encounter greater than atmospheric pressures. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity results in damage to the lungs, causing pain and difficulty in breathing. Oxidative damage to the eye may lead to myopia or partial detachment of the retina. Pulmonary and ocular damage {{are most likely to}} occur when supplemental oxygen is administered as part of a treatment, particularly to newborn infants, but are also a concern during <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> to improve outcomes.|$|E
50|$|Many {{of these}} lower {{extremity}} amputations {{can be prevented}} through an interdisciplinary approach to treatment involving a variety of advanced therapies and techniques, such as debridement, <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> treatment <b>therapy,</b> dressing selection, special shoes, and patient education. When wounds persist, a specialized approach is required for healing.|$|R

5|$|Diving {{medicine}} is the diagnosis, treatment {{and prevention of}} conditions caused by exposing divers to the underwater environment. It includes the effects {{on the body of}} pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how fitness to dive affects a diver's safety. Hyperbaric {{medicine is}} another field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber with <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> is the definitive treatment for two of the most important diving-related illnesses, DCS and arterial gas embolism.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} {{poisoning}} include carbon monoxide detectors, proper venting of gas appliances, keeping chimneys clean, and keeping exhaust systems of vehicles in good repair. Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving 100% oxygen along with supportive care. This should generally {{be carried out}} until symptoms are no longer present and the HbCO level is less than 10%. While <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear. The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{decompression}} sickness after diving {{can be managed}} through effective decompression procedures and contracting it is now uncommon, though it remains to some degree unpredictable. Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it and divers almost universally use decompression tables or dive computers to limit or monitor their exposure and to control their ascent speed and decompression procedures. If DCS is contracted, it is usually treated by <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> in a recompression chamber. If treated early, there is a significantly higher chance of successful recovery.|$|E

5|$|M.P. Spencer {{showed that}} Doppler {{ultrasonic}} methods can detect venous bubbles in asymptomatic divers, and Dr Andrew Pilmanis showed that safety stops reduced bubble formation. In 1981 D.E. Yount described the Varying Permeability Model, proposing a mechanism of bubble formation. Several other bubble models followed. The pathophysiology of DCS {{is not yet}} fully understood, but decompression practice has reached a stage where the risk is fairly low, and most incidences are successfully treated by therapeutic recompression and <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy.</b> Mixed breathing gases are used to reduce {{the effects of the}} hyperbaric environment on ambient pressure divers.|$|E
5|$|Over 50% {{of people}} with MS may use {{complementary}} and alternative medicine, although percentages vary depending on how alternative medicine is defined. The evidence for the effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Treatments of unproven benefit used by people with MS include dietary supplementation and regimens, vitamin D, relaxation techniques such as yoga, herbal medicine (including medical cannabis), <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy,</b> self-infection with hookworms, reflexology, acupuncture, and mindfulness. Regarding the characteristics of users, they are more frequently women, have had MS for a longer time, {{tend to be more}} disabled and have lower levels of satisfaction with conventional healthcare.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} among patients undergoing <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> is rare, and {{is influenced by}} a number of a factors: individual sensitivity and treatment protocol; and probably therapy indication and equipment used. A study by Welslau in 1996 reported 16 incidents out of a population of 107,264 patients (0.015%), while Hampson and Atik in 2003 found a rate of 0.03%. Yildiz, Ay and Qyrdedi, in a summary of 36,500 patient treatments between 1996 and 2003, reported only 3 oxygen toxicity incidents, giving a rate of 0.008%. A later review of over 80,000 patient treatments revealed an even lower rate: 0.0024%. The reduction in incidence may be partly due to use of a mask (rather than a hood) to deliver oxygen.|$|E

30|$|Patients {{initially}} complained with fistulae, {{followed by}} pain and difficulty in chewing. Four patients had undergone preoperative <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> (HBO) <b>therapy</b> {{which was not}} effective. The margins of the diseased segments were planned by preoperative panoramic radiographs and CT or MR images.

30|$|Another {{possible}} {{treatment for}} ischemic stroke {{that has been}} used in various experimental and clinical settings is <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>oxygen</b> (HBO) <b>therapy.</b> Although its neuroprotective mechanisms are still poorly understood and its effectiveness is still under discussion, proponents suggest that early human research and more recent animal data demonstrate its effectiveness in the early treatment of ischemic stroke (Sunami et al., 2000). Although other molecular mechanisms comprising hypoxia inducible factor 1 Î± (HIF 1 Î±) and its target genes, might play pivotal roles, the most straightforward idea of the neuroprotective effect of HBO might be the improved oxygenation of the tissue at risk (Ostrowski et al., 2005; Calvert et al., 2006; Gu et al., 2008; Matchett et al., 2009).|$|R
40|$|AbstractLiver {{transplantation}} is {{the treatment}} of choice for end stage liver disease and is often used for primary liver malignancies. The main limitation of its wider application is the availability of suitable donor organs. The use of marginal donor organs, split-liver transplantation and living-related liver transplantation techniques contribute to increase the donor pool. However, {{the use of these}} techniques is associated with a higher risk of post transplantation organ dysfunction, predominantly due to ischaemia, preservation and reperfusion injury (IPRI).
