We empirically analyze whether signaling {{works in the}} German market for <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediation</b> services. For this a signal must increase service quality and be easily identifiable by consumers so that it pays for intermediaries to spend the related costs. By using OLS and logit estimations we test whether intermediary type, reputational activities {{and a variety of}} signaling instruments work as credible signals. Our findings confirm the main hypotheses derived from signaling theory as to the poor working of market forces in markets for information services. Accordingly, public policy regulation is necessary to mitigate the resulting problems. signaling, <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediation,</b> information services...|$|E

The product quality hypothesis states that independent agents provide both insurers and customers with higher service quality and therefore, remain on the market. On the contrary, according to the market imperfections hypothesis both intermediary types offer the same quality, and only coexist due to information asymmetries. Having conducted a written survey, we measure service quality differences by multivariate regression analysis. Our analysis shows that the higher level of service quality of independent agents supports the product quality hypothesis. The result is a separating equilibrium on the market. <b>Insurance</b> <b>intermediation,</b> service quality, distribution systems...|$|E

40|$|Recent events {{involving}} major {{insurance companies}} and insurance brokerage firms highlight substantial incentive problems in commercial and reinsurance markets where intermediation takes place. We show that in markets with informed as well as uninformed consumers and heterogeneous risk profiles intermediation {{has the potential to}} improve social welfare. However, since intermediation reduces insurers 2 ̆ 019 market power, incentives for tacit collusion are higher compared to markets without intermediation. A controversial matter in the discussion concerning <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediation</b> is the issue of compensation customs.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the role of}} independent insurance intermediaries in markets where matching is important. A controversial matter in the discussion concerning <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediation</b> {{is the issue of}} compensation customs and how the latter affect prices, rents and advice quality in insurance markets. This work compares a fee-based with a commission-based system. We show that in a situation with a non-strategic intermediary both remuneration systems are payoff-equivalent. In a second step, allowing for strategic behavior, we discuss the impact of remuneration on the quality of advice. The analysis shows that the possibility of mismatching can provide the intermediary with substantial market power which however does not translate into mismatching as long as consumers have rational expectations. We o¤er a rationale for the use of contingent commissions. In addition, this paper addresses whether or not the recent ban of any commission payments as introduced in countries such as Denmark and Finland is an appropriate market intervention...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the emergence of}} financial stability as a key policy objective. It discusses the underlying trends in the financial system, {{as well as the}} role of finance in relation to money, the real economy, and public policy. Financial stability is defined in terms of its ability to help the economic system allocate resources, manage risks, and absorb shocks. Moreover, financial stability is considered a continuum, changeable over time and consistent with multiple combinations of its constituent elements. On the basis of these concepts, a framework is presented that comprises an encompassing analysis and assessment of financial stability, and maps out broad policy implications.

In preparing this analysis, the characteristics of their financial and banking systems and their interactions with the real sector are studied. The paper also {{examines the}} limitations on portfolio diversification confronting banks in these countries, both from the viewpoint of the real sector and of the financial system. The paper finds that banks in LDEs, particularly in low-income countries, appear to face higher risk than their peers in more diversified economies and makes suggestions for policy options and regulatory practices which could be encouraged in such systems.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the great divide {{in the level}} of financial development between the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) 7 countries and the more advanced economies in transition, in particular those of Central and Eastern Europe and Baltic states. It discusses the roots of financial underdevelopment in the CIS- 7 countries by examining the differentials in interest rate spreads between the CIS- 7 countries and the transition economies that have achieved faster financial development. The roots of the divide are traced to weaknesses in the institutional infrastructure for financial intermediation, which lead to a combination of low depositor trust in the banking system and high credit risk. High credit risk stems mainly from the poor creditor-rights protection and weak auditing and accounting standards. Financial sector reform strategies that fail to give priority to the resolution of weaknesses in the basic financial infrastructure are unlikely to be successful in letting the CIS- 7 countries bridge the great divide.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the slowdown of lending by large U. S. banks {{over the period}} 2007 Q 3 - 2009 Q 2, focusing on: (i) whether capital or liquidity was the binding constraint; (ii) factors influencing banks’ decision to hold capital; and (iii) their pricing behavior. Using quarterly data for the largest U. S. banks, the paper finds that capital, rather than liquidity, constrained lending. Banks took actions to increase capital by slowing lending and raising profit margins, not fully passing through the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts. Banks optimally choose capital based on the expected future demand for loans and the marginal cost of capital.

40|$|In {{episodes of}} {{significant}} banking distress or perceived systemic {{risk to the}} financial system, policymakers have often opted for issuing blanket guarantees on bank liabilities to stop or avoid widespread bank runs. In theory, blanket guarantees can prevent bank runs if they are credible. However, guarantee could add substantial fiscal costs to bank restructuring programs and may increase moral hazard going forward. Using a sample of 42 episodes of banking crises, this paper finds that blanket guarantees are successful in reducing liquidity pressures on banks arising from deposit withdrawals. However, banks'' foreign liabilities appear virtually irresponsive to blanket guarantees. Furthermore, guarantees tend to be fiscally costly, though this positive association arises {{in large part because}} guarantees tend to be employed in conjunction with extensive liquidity support and when crises are severe.

40|$|Malaysia {{has been}} {{experiencing}} sustained current account surplus during post-Asian crisis period. Although current account surplus {{is not as}} harmful as deficit, it cannot be sustained forever. Moreover, if the surplus is caused by bad reasons, such as, insufficient social <b>insurance,</b> inefficient financial <b>intermediation,</b> then it is reflected in deteriorating external competitiveness through more depreciated real exchange rate. Therefore, examination of current account sustainability is of crucial importance for the long-run health of the economy. Previous studies on Malaysian current account sustainability produce diverse results and leave it as an unsettled issue open to further research. In this backdrop this paper investigates the sustainability of Malaysia’s current account balance for the period 1970 – 2010. This paper employs inter-temporal budget constraint to understand the behavior of exports and imports of Malaysian economy. Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method is applied to examine the long cointegrating relation between Malaysian exports and imports plus interest on external borrowing. Advantage of employing the ARDL method {{is that it does}} not require the variables to be integrated to the first order. This method can be applied to a set of stationary and nonstationary variables. The paper uses annual data over the periods 1970 – 2010. Export, import and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data are in current US dollars. Interest payment on long-term external borrowing in US dollars is used as a proxy for interest on net foreign debt. Estimation results indicate that these two variables are cointegrated, which implies that Malaysia’s current account is sustainable in the long run. Strong sustainability requires the coefficient of cointegrating vector to be one. In addition to ARDL method, coefficient of cointegrating vector is estimated by two other methods, namely, fully modified OLS (FMOLS) and dynamic OLS (DOLS). All three estimations show that the long-run coefficient is greater than one. This indicates that in the long-run export increases more than import plus interest on external borrowing. Therefore, if the excess export earnings in the long run cannot be utilized productively current account surplus may not sustain. It is, therefore, concluded that Malaysian current account is weakly sustainable. This findings call for policy intervention at macro level to make efficient utilization of excess saving to boost economic growth through promoting social insurance, facilitating efficient financial intermediation and encouraging private investment...|$|R
