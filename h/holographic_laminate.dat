25|$|In 2002, Passport Canada {{began to}} issue an updated version within Canada, which {{includes}} the digitally printed photo of the bearer embedded into the identification page of the booklet, holographic images, bar-coded serial number, and a second hidden photo of the bearer {{that could only be}} viewed under ultraviolet light. Canadian diplomatic missions abroad adopted this version in 2006. In March 2010, the passport was upgraded to include a new design of the identification page and more anti-counterfeit elements, such as the new colours of Optically Variable Ink and addition of laser perforated number. The cover, watermark, personalization technique and <b>holographic</b> <b>laminate</b> are same with the 2002 version. The 2010 version was also the last revision of MRP prior to the release of e-passports.|$|E
