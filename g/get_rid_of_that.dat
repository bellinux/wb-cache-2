5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how I think every woman should feel about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
2500|$|According to Butler, Ward's drum solo [...] "Rat Salad" [...] {{resulted}} from the band having to play eight and three quarter hour spots a night in Europe early in their career. [...] "Bill used {{to fill out a}} whole 45 minutes doing a drum solo just to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> 45 minutes," [...] he revealed to Classic Albums. [...] "I have no idea where the title came from, though." [...] In 2013, Sabbath biographer Mick Wall described the closing track on the album, [...] "Fairies Wear Boots", as a [...] "hard-driving riff sweetened by a beautifully baleful melody" [...] with a lyric written by Osbourne about a nasty encounter with a group of skinheads.|$|E

2500|$|Johnson became {{president}} upon {{the assassination of}} President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, and the goodwill generated by the incident gave him tremendous popularity. He enjoyed strong support against the bitterly divided Republicans; polls in January 1964 showed him leading Republican challengers Barry Goldwater 75% to 20% and Nelson Rockefeller 74% to 17%. However, Wallace had received over 100,000 letters and telegrams of support, nearly half from non-southerners, following his 1963 Stand in the Schoolhouse Door in defiance of {{a court order to}} integrate the University of Alabama, and he subsequently became [...] "Tennyson's Mordred, exposing the dark side of Camelot". He began a national speaking tour with a well-received lecture at Harvard on November 7, 1963, bringing him additional notoriety as he flirted {{with the idea of a}} national campaign. Wallace's charm and candor won over many of his critics; during a question and answer session at Harvard, a black man asserted his intention to run for president, to which Wallace smiled and responded, [...] "Between you and me both, we might <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> crowd in Washington. We might even run on the same ticket." [...] Meanwhile, Johnson forbade discussion of politics in the White House and refused to comment on whether he would run in the 1964 election, instead pursuing the late Kennedy's legislative agenda (most notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964), managing the Vietnam War, and declaring his own [...] "War on Poverty".|$|E
2500|$|Gerda and Henrietta enter. [...] Henrietta asks Gerda {{what she}} has done with the holster of the murder weapon, stating that if they can <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> {{there will be no}} evidence, and no one will be convicted of the murder. [...] Gerda feigns ignorance, but Henrietta is persistent. [...] Gerda tells Henrietta that the cut up scraps are in her leatherworking bag, and confides that she {{witnessed}} John's infidelity with Veronica, and therefore had to kill him. [...] Henrietta goes offstage to get some tea to calm Gerda's frazzled nerves. [...] Gerda, thinking she is unobserved, takes a vial of poison from her purse, and pours some into Henrietta's drink. [...] Henrietta returned more quickly than Gerda expected, and witnesses this silently from just outside the room. [...] She enters, more noisily this time. [...] Vocalizing her decision to have tea with Gerda, rather than the sherry she had poured for herself, she leaves to get another teacup. [...] Gerda picks up a revolver, but Inspector Coulquouhoun enters and takes it from her. [...] Upon hearing that Veronica Craye will not be convicted of the murder (she somehow knows about the gun in Veronica's handbag), Gerda begins to go into a hysterical fit, calling for her deceased husband. [...] Inspector Colqouhoun unknowingly offers the poisoned drink to Gerda, who drinks it before she realises {{what she has}} done. [...] Henrietta returns, and explains the poisoned drink to Colquohoun, who reveals that he had deduced Gerda's guilt from her character. [...] Lucy enters, and the lights go down as the inspector calls the police station.|$|E
