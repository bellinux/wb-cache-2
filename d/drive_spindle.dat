In previous studies to assess whether the Ran network also influences mitosis in mammalian cells, we found that overexpression of Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP 1), a major effector of Ran, induces multipolar spindles.

40|$|SummaryChromosome-dependent spindle {{assembly}} requires the chromosomal recruitment and activation of Aurora B, the kinase subunit of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). It remains unclear how the chromosome-activated kinase spatially transmits signals {{to organize the}} micron-scale spindle. Here we reveal that the CPC must detect two structures, chromosomes and microtubules, to support {{spindle assembly}} in Xenopus egg extracts. While Aurora B is enriched on chromosomes in metaphase, we establish that a fraction of Aurora B is targeted to the metaphase spindle and phosphorylates microtubule-bound substrates. We demonstrate that chromosomally activated Aurora B must be targeted to microtubules to <b>drive</b> <b>spindle</b> assembly. Moreover, although the CPC-microtubule interaction can activate Aurora B, which further promotes microtubule assembly, this positive feedback is not initiated without chromosomes. We propose that the dual detection of chromosomes and microtubules by the CPC is a critical step in assembling spindles around and only around chromosomes...|$|E
40|$|Although the microtubule-depolymerizing KinI motor Kif 2 a is abundantly {{expressed}} in neuronal cells, we now show it localizes to centrosomes and spindle poles during mitosis in cultured cells. RNAi-induced knockdown of Kif 2 a expression inhibited cell cycle progression because cells assembled monopolar spindles. Bipolar spindle assembly was restored in cells lacking Kif 2 a by treatments that altered microtubule assembly (nocodazole), eliminated kinetochore–microtubule attachment (loss of Nuf 2), or stabilized microtubule plus ends at kinetochores (loss of MCAK). Thus, two KinI motors, MCAK and Kif 2 a, play distinct roles in mitosis, and MCAK activity at kinetochores must be balanced by Kif 2 a activity at poles for spindle bipolarity. These treatments failed to restore bipolarity to cells lacking {{the activity of}} the kinesin Eg 5. Thus, two independent pathways contribute to spindle bipolarity, with the Eg 5 -dependent pathway using motor force to <b>drive</b> <b>spindle</b> bipolarity and the Kif 2 a-dependent pathway relying on microtubule polymer dynamics to generate force for spindle bipolarity...|$|E
40|$|Conventional centrosomes {{are absent}} from a female meiotic spindle in many animals. Instead, {{chromosomes}} <b>drive</b> <b>spindle</b> assembly, but the molecular mechanism of this acentrosomal spindle formation {{is not well}} understood. We have screened female sterile mutations for defects in acentrosomal spindle formation in Drosophila female meiosis. One of them, remnants (rem), disrupted bipolar spindle morphology and chromosome alignment in non-activated oocytes. We found that rem encodes a conserved subunit of Cdc 2 (Cks 30 A). As Drosophila oocytes arrest in metaphase I, the defect represents a new Cks function before metaphase–anaphase transition. In addition, {{we found that the}} essential pole components, Msps and D-TACC, were often mislocalized to the equator, which may explain part of the spindle defect. We showed that the second cks gene cks 85 A, in contrast, has an important role in mitosis.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that multiple microtubule-based motors contribute to the formation and function of the mitotic spindle, but how the activities of these motors interrelate remains unclear. Here we visualize spindle formation in living Drosophila embryos to show that spindle pole movements are directed by a temporally coordinated balance of forces generated by three mitotic motors, cytoplasmic dynein, KLP 61 F, and Ncd. Specifically, {{our findings suggest that}} dynein acts to move the poles apart throughout mitosis and that this activity is augmented by KLP 61 F after the fenestration of the nuclear envelope, a process analogous to nuclear envelope breakdown, which occurs at the onset of prometaphase. Conversely, we find that Ncd generates forces that pull the poles together between interphase and metaphase, antagonizing the activity of both dynein and KLP 61 F and serving as a brake for spindle assembly. During anaphase, however, Ncd appears to have no effect on spindle pole movements, suggesting that its activity is down-regulated at this time, allowing dynein and KLP 61 F to <b>drive</b> <b>spindle</b> elongation during anaphase B...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the suppression of poleward flux within interpolar microtubule (ipMT) bundles of Drosophila embryonic spindles couples outward forces generated by a sliding filament mechanism to anaphase spindle elongation. Here, we (i) propose a molecular mechanism in which the bipolar kinesin KLP 61 F persistently slides dynamically unstable ipMTs outward, the MT depolymerase KLP 10 A acts at the poles to convert ipMT sliding to flux, and the chromokinesin KLP 3 A inhibits the depolymerase to suppress flux, thereby coupling ipMT sliding to spindle elongation; (ii) used KLP 3 A inhibitors {{to interfere with the}} coupling process, which revealed an inverse linear relation between the rates of flux and elongation, supporting the proposed mechanism and demonstrating that the suppression of flux controls both the rate and onset of spindle elongation; and (iii) developed a mathematical model using force balance and rate equations to describe how motors sliding the highly dynamic ipMTs apart can <b>drive</b> <b>spindle</b> elongation at a steady rate determined by the extent of suppression of flux...|$|E
40|$|Sleep {{spindles}} are brief cortical oscillations at 10 – 15 [*]Hz {{that occur}} predominantly during non-REM (quiet) sleep in adult mammals and {{are thought to}} contribute to learning and memory. Spindle bursts are phenomenologically similar to sleep spindles, but they occur predominantly in early infancy and are triggered by peripheral sensory activity (e. g., by retinal waves); accordingly, spindle bursts are thought to organize neural networks in the developing brain and establish functional links with the sensory periphery. Whereas the spontaneous retinal waves that trigger spindle bursts in visual cortex are a transient feature of early development, the myoclonic twitches that <b>drive</b> <b>spindle</b> bursts in sensorimotor cortex persist into adulthood. Moreover, twitches—and their associated spindle bursts—occur exclusively during REM (active) sleep. Curiously, despite the persistence of twitching into adulthood, twitch-related spindle bursts have not been reported in adult sensorimotor cortex.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{market forces}} are driving {{companies}} {{to improve their}} targeting of increasingly small market niches. To accomplish this efficiently, products are organized into product families that typically share common platforms. To reorganize the current product offerings or new products into a product family, using a platform approach, requires estimating the savings for such a modification. One of the problems encountered in estimating development and design cost {{is the lack of}} availability of hard information during the initial design phases. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to estimate the design and development cost, when moving towards a platform approach, using simple models. The activity based product family cost models are developed from existing single product design activities, which are modified and extended to reflect activities related to development of product platform and subsequent product family members supported by the platform. Uncertainty related to cost associated with activities are included in the model, which is solved using Monte Carlo simulation. The approach is demonstrated using a hard disk <b>drive</b> <b>spindle</b> motor platform development for a family of hard disks.

40|$|Mitosis {{requires}} the concerted activities of multiple microtubule (MT) -based motor proteins. Here {{we examined the}} contribution of the chromokinesin, KLP 3 A, to mitotic spindle morphogenesis and chromosome movements in Drosophila embryos and cultured S 2 cells. By immunofluorescence, KLP 3 A associates with nonfibrous punctae that concentrate in nuclei and display MT-dependent associations with spindles. These punctae concentrate in indistinct domains associated with chromosomes and central spindles and form distinct bands associated with telophase midbodies. The functional disruption of KLP 3 A by antibodies or dominant negative proteins in embryos, or by RNA interference (RNAi) in S 2 cells, does not block mitosis but produces defects in mitotic spindles. Time-lapse confocal observations of mitosis in living embryos reveal that KLP 3 A inhibition disrupts the organization of interpolar (ip) MTs and produces short spindles. Kinetic analysis suggests that KLP 3 A contributes to spindle pole separation during the prometaphase-to-metaphase transition (when it antagonizes Ncd) and anaphase B, to normal rates of chromatid motility during anaphase A, and to the proper spacing of daughter nuclei during telophase. We propose that KLP 3 A acts on MTs associated with chromosome arms and the central spindle to organize ipMT bundles, to <b>drive</b> <b>spindle</b> pole separation and to facilitate chromatid motility...|$|E
40|$|The Caenorhabditis elegans coiled-coil protein LIN- 5 mediates several {{processes}} in cell division {{that depend on}} spindle forces, including alignment and segregation of chromosomes and positioning of the spindle. Here, we describe two closely related proteins, GPR- 1 and GPR- 2 (Gprotein regulator), which associate with LIN- 5 in vivo and in vitro and depend on LIN- 5 for localization to the spindle and cell cortex. GPR- 1 /GPR- 2 contain a GoLoco/GPR motif that mediates interaction with GDP-bound Gαi/o. Inactivation of lin- 5, gpr- 1 /gpr- 2, or the Gαi/o genes goa- 1 and gpa- 16 all cause highly similar chromosome segregation and spindle positioning defects, indicating a positive role for the LIN- 5 and GPR proteins in G protein signaling. The lin- 5 and gpr- 1 /gpr- 2 genes appear to act downstream of the par polarity genes in the one- and two-cell stages and downstream of the tyrosine kinase-related genes mes- 1 and src- 1 at the four-cell stage. Together, {{these results indicate that}} GPR- 1 /GPR- 2 in association with LIN- 5 activate G protein signaling to affect spindle force.
