5000|$|The player {{controls}} a motorcyclist (default {{names are}} A.Slight and C.Edwards) in races on various international race tracks. Game types are [...] "Practice Session" [...] (solo practice), [...] "Trainer Session" [...] (where the player has {{to follow the}} trainer's bike to learn the optimum racing line), [...] "Single Race" [...] (one race on a chosen track against contestants) and [...] "Championship" [...] (race the whole season). The latter two consist in three parts: [...] "Practice Session", [...] "Qualifying" [...] and [...] "Race". In each race, a field of eight bikers races simultaneously, including the human players. Game options include Difficulty (Rookie, Novice, Amateur, Semi Professional, Professional, Ace), number of laps (3, 5, 10 laps or [...] "full race" [...] which is 100 km). In the bike setup, gearbox (automatic or manual), final drive for each gear and <b>gear</b> <b>sprocket</b> can be modified.|$|E
5000|$|The chain <b>gear</b> <b>sprockets</b> wear {{faster than}} the {{ratcheting}} mechanism. Replacing individual sprockets on a freehub cassette is easy compared to that on some freewheels.|$|R
50|$|In cycling, an {{interactive}} glide gear system {{is an extension}} of hyperglide, in which both sides of the bicycle <b>gear</b> <b>sprockets</b> are physically contoured to improve upshifting.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturing methods {{consists}} of two phases. First phase, the skeleton structure has been fabricated with MS square rods, MS flat, sheet metals. The second phase, fixing of <b>gears,</b> <b>sprockets</b> and chains over the skeleton structure. The net weight of Enthira Kaalai is around 275kg. It took around 14 days to complete {{the structure of the}} Enthira Kaalai.|$|R
25|$|Gashing is a {{machining}} process used {{to rough out}} coarse pitched <b>gears</b> and <b>sprockets.</b> It is commonly used on worm wheels before hobbing, but also used on internal and external spur gears, bevel gears, helical gears, and gear racks. The process is performed on gashers or universal milling machines, {{especially in the case}} of worm wheels. After gashing the <b>gear</b> or <b>sprocket</b> is finished via hobbing, shaping, or shaving.|$|R
5000|$|... "Hyperglide HG" [...] - Cutaways on {{the rear}} <b>gear</b> <b>sprockets</b> (called the {{cassette}} if it slides onto a freehub body) that allow smoother downshifting (shifting from a small sprocket to a bigger one) as the cutaways allow the chain to roll from one sprocket to another without lifting as far off the sprocket teeth. This allows {{a certain amount of}} gear shifting under power, though this remains hard on the drivetrain.|$|R
5000|$|In high <b>gear,</b> the <b>sprocket</b> {{drives the}} planet carrier and the annulus drives the hub, {{resulting}} in a gear increase.|$|R
50|$|Duchesne {{is home to}} {{a number}} of heavy machine and steel manufacturers. A wide variety of {{products}} and parts are manufactured, including underground cranes, shield haulers, rifle barrels, steam locomotive parts, drill collars, turbine parts, <b>gears,</b> <b>sprockets,</b> and splines for the oil fields, steel mills, coal mines, trona mines, power plants, other machine shops, manufacturers and other industries in many capacities. Products are shipped both domestically and to Canada, Mexico, South America, Australia, and Europe.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} load speed on {{straight}} and involute tooth forms is studied using several finite-element models. It is {{found that for}} rapidly rotating <b>gears</b> and <b>sprockets,</b> the load speed along the tooth surface can significantly affect the tooth vibration. Indeed, {{it is found that}} for sufficiently high load speeds and for sufficiently slender tooth forms, the tooth deflection can, at times, be directed opposite to the load direction. Comparisons are made of various dynamic models of <b>gear</b> and <b>sprocket</b> teeth. It is shown that for stubby tooth forms there is considerable difference between results obtained with finite element models and results obtained with Timoshenko beam models. Finally, it is shown that <b>gear</b> or <b>sprocket</b> vibrations can be induced by the shape of the tooth form itself. This effect becomes increasingly significant at higher speeds...|$|R
5000|$|In low <b>gear,</b> the <b>sprocket</b> {{drives the}} annulus (in red above) {{and the planet}} carrier (in green above) drives the hub, giving a gear reduction.|$|R
5000|$|The player {{controls}} a motorcyclist in races {{on various}} international race tracks. Game modes are [...] "Practice" [...] and [...] "Championship". Each race has three parts: [...] "Practice Session", [...] "Qualifying" [...] and [...] "Race". There are closed-circuit Grand Prix tracks and street race tracks. The degree of [...] "realism" [...] {{can be modified}} (4 to 24 riders; 3 to 10 laps or [...] "full race" [...] which is 100 km). The bike setup offers tweaking of the <b>gear</b> <b>sprockets.</b> It is possible to play with five other players via network or splitscreen.|$|R
50|$|They {{are quick}} bikes once de-restricted {{and the power}} will be {{increased}} to over 20 bhp at the rear wheel easily reaching 85 mph with some modifications to the <b>gearing</b> ratio (<b>sprockets).</b>|$|R
50|$|The three-speed bicycle is {{a bicycle}} that uses {{internal}} hub gears {{at the rear}} wheel hub to provide three gear ratios. Typically, in low <b>gear,</b> the rear <b>sprocket</b> turns faster than the wheel; in middle <b>gear,</b> the rear <b>sprocket</b> turns {{at the same speed}} as the wheel; in high gear, the rear wheel turns faster than the sprocket.|$|R
40|$|Technology {{has led to}} the {{increased}} use of plastics as replacement to conventional materials in various sectors. The use of alloy steels in various rotary spares such as gears, cams, bearings, valve seats and other bearing and wear applications that requires quite operation, low coefficient of friction and wear resistance shall be replaced with nylon 66 as per requirements. In the present work I am applying nylon 66 in <b>gears</b> and <b>sprocket</b> wheels used in automotive it is proposed to substitute the metallic rotating spares like <b>gears</b> and <b>sprockets</b> with nylon 66 to reduce the weight and noise. For this purpose different types of polymers were considered namely Polyethylene, PVC, Polystyrene, Polypropylene and Nylon 66 and their viability are checked with their counterpart metallic gear (Cast iron). Based on the static analysis, the best plastic material is recommended for the purpose. 3 D model of <b>gears</b> and <b>sprocket</b> wheel chain assembly has been modeled by using Pro-E WF 4. The models are then pre-processed using hyper mesh 10...|$|R

50|$|Belts {{can have}} teeth in them also and be coupled to gear-like pulleys. Special <b>gears</b> called <b>sprockets</b> can be coupled {{together}} with chains, as on bicycles and some motorcycles. Again, exact accounting of teeth and revolutions {{can be applied}} with these machines.|$|R
5000|$|The player {{controls}} a motorcyclist in races {{on various}} international race tracks. Game types are [...] "Trainer" [...] (follow the bike of the trainer {{to learn the}} best line), [...] "Practice" [...] (solo on one track), [...] "Weekend" [...] (against the field on one track) and [...] "Championship" [...] (whole season against the whole field). Each race has three parts: [...] "Practice Session", [...] "Qualifying" [...] and [...] "Race". The degree of [...] "Realism" [...] can be modified (Difficulty: Rookie or Ace; 4 to 24 riders; 3 to 10 laps or [...] "full race" [...] which is 100 km; Wheelies; Penalties; Damage etc.). In the bike setup, gearbox transmission (automatic or manual), final drive speed for the 6 gears, and the <b>gear</b> <b>sprockets</b> can be modified. The game also features randomly changing weather conditions ("Weather forecast": dry, sunny, etc.).|$|R

5000|$|Bicycles {{usually have}} a system for {{selecting}} different gear ratios. There are two main types: derailleur gears and hub gears. The derailleur type is the most common, and the most visible, using <b>sprocket</b> <b>gears.</b> Typically there are several gears available on the rear sprocket assembly, attached to the rear wheel. A few more sprockets are usually added to the front assembly as well. Multiplying the number of <b>sprocket</b> <b>gears</b> in front by the number to the rear gives the number of gear ratios, often called [...] "speeds".|$|R
40|$|The use of PM {{materials}} is rapidly expanding concentrating {{more and more}} on highly loaded structural parts such as synchronizer hubs, <b>gears,</b> <b>sprockets</b> or shifting forks. Several papers, presented during the last years on PM-conferences have confirmed the highly stressed volume concept as an excellent method to assess the local durability in sharp notched areas considering the local properties of the material and stress gradients. Based on the method of highly stressed volume (HSV) this paper presents an approach to estimate the local durability by simply determinable static material properties including sinter-hardened condition. For this purpose, results of fatigue strength tests under axial, bending and torsion alternating loading (R = - 1) with up to six different specimen geometries, three different sinter alloys and two different densities will be analysed in order to estimate the endurable fatigue strength in correlation with the highly stressed volume...|$|R

50|$|A {{belt drive}} is {{analogous}} {{to that of a}} chain drive, however a belt sheave may be smooth (devoid of discrete interlocking members as would be found on a chain <b>sprocket,</b> spur <b>gear,</b> or timing belt) so that the mechanical advantage is approximately given by the ratio of the pitch diameter of the sheaves only, not fixed exactly by the ratio of teeth as with <b>gears</b> and <b>sprockets.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Derailleur gears are a variable-ratio {{transmission}} system commonly used on bicycles, {{consisting of a}} chain, multiple sprockets of different sizes, and a mechanism to move the chain from one sprocket to another. [...] Although referred to as gears in the bike world, these bicycle <b>gears</b> are technically <b>sprockets</b> since they drive or are driven by a chain, and are not driven by one another.|$|R
5000|$|The 1899 Outing {{magazine}} [...] lists Sterling's {{prices as}} [...] "Chainless, {{for men and}} women, $75; racers, $65; roadsters, for men and women, $50; tandems, double diamond or combination, $75 or $85." [...] The [...] "chainless" [...] drive is described as unique in that its longer connecting shaft connected the pinion to the rear <b>sprocket</b> <b>gears</b> back of the rear hub instead of in front of it.|$|R
5000|$|A {{sprocket}} or sprocket-wheel is a profiled {{wheel with}} teeth, or cogs, that mesh with a chain, track or other perforated or indented material. The name 'sprocket' applies generally to any wheel upon which radial projections engage a chain passing over it. It is distinguished from a <b>gear</b> in that <b>sprockets</b> are never meshed together directly, and differs from a pulley in that sprockets have teeth and pulleys are smooth.|$|R
50|$|Most often, {{the power}} is {{conveyed}} by a roller chain, known as the drive chain or transmission chain, passing over a <b>sprocket</b> <b>gear,</b> with {{the teeth of the}} gear meshing with the holes in the links of the chain. The gear is turned, and this pulls the chain putting mechanical force into the system. Another type of drive chain is the Morse chain, invented by the Morse Chain Company of Ithaca, New York, United States. This has inverted teeth.|$|R
30|$|In recent years, many {{researchers}} have reported the analysis process of forging gears using the upper-bound method and finite element method, but no attempt {{has been made}} to analyze the precision forging of multi-row sprockets. Upper-bound and FE methods are characterized by less computation time and reasonable accuracy (Can and Misirli 2008). Choi et al. (2000) proposed a mathematical method using the upper-bound method to forge a spur gear from a hollow billet. Choi and Choi (1998) also modeled a new tooth profile to obtain a more practical method to analyze the kinematically admissible velocity fields in external spur gear forging. Politis et al. (2014) established a simplified FE model to obtain the material flow behaviors and thickness distributions of forged Bi-metal gears. Compared with analyzing spur gear forging using the upper-bound and finite element methods above, the cold semi-precision forging with upper-bound and finite element methods for multi-row sprockets is a new approach to establishing similarity in the tooth profiles of the <b>gear</b> and <b>sprocket.</b>|$|R
50|$|For the clock, {{the work}} {{consisted}} of a RPH50C motor and Junior winder weighing approximately 16 pounds with overload protection and regulator. A 16-tooth split chain and 10 feet of one-half-inch pitch roller chain with idler and chain adjuster. For the strike, the installation {{consisted of a}} RPH50AC motor and Mark II winder weighing approximately 40 pounds with overload protection and regulator. A 16-tooth split chain and 35 feet of one-half-inch pitch roller chain with idler and chain adjuster. The clock was also cleaned and repainted with the internal dial re-lacquered. The work {{was carried out by}} the inventor of the system, David Gamble of Eaton Socon and consists of a small electric motor clamped to weights and <b>geared</b> with <b>sprockets</b> onto a continuous chain. As the weight operates the clock mechanism by pulling downwards, the electric motor monkey is climbing up the chain at the same speed, so that the weight never has to be cranked back to the top.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, {{the first}} CL125S was {{manufactured}} using this new motor in its design, {{with a larger}} 122 cc piston (which produced more low-end torque but little gain in power) and a slightly larger piston/rod connecting pin. That helped push the dry weight of the bike down to 196 lb. This motorcycle was almost identical to the 1970 to 1973 CL100, that was really only a slight modification of the CB series produced at the same time. The modifications included; lower rear <b>sprocket</b> <b>gearing,</b> slightly more aggressive tires, shorter front fender, braced handlebar, high mount exhaust system and elimination of the tachometer.|$|R
