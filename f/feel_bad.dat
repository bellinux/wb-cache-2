The Ephrons wove {{together}} {{a collection of}} stories adapted from the book with recollections of friends, including Rosie O'Donnell.

5|$|Moe {{speaks to}} Homer {{through the bars}} of his jail cell window and {{promises}} to bail him out, but changes his mind when Renee talks about wanting to vacation in Hawaii. While packing for the trip, Moe is confronted by his own conscience, {{in the form of}} Homer, who makes him <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> for his betrayal. Moe ends up telling Renee the truth about the insurance fraud scheme, and she is at first happy he was honest. However, when Moe starts scheming again for a way to get Homer out of jail without paying the bail, Renee is disgusted and leaves him.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on jury duty for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's end or their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws it in the trash, and pours his coffee on it. When Holly demands to know who did it, Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they had to break up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to make such an arrangement work with A.J. This, in turn, makes her <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> for Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him out, where he breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E

5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio {{argued that}} dissonance {{was caused by}} {{aversive}} consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people <b>feel</b> <b>bad.</b> Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when {{they feel they have}} not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.|$|E

[...] has anyone sent me a bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But I have more feelings on the business side of that than I do on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time than I did, and a lot better budget." ...|$|E
500|$|Greg Kot, {{writer for}} the Chicago Tribune, stated that the track [...] "seduces like a drug dealer", with Ocean crooning over a laid-back rhythm. Prefix Magazines David Padula commented that it [...] "centers around a jazzy {{keyboard}} lick that dips regularly into more lush surroundings. The crisp percussion is a highlight, but the winning point is the soulful croons and general smoothness of Ocean." [...] Mike Powell's Spin praised Ocean's writing abilities, musing [...] "my 'TV ain't HD, that's too real', the narrator of 'Sweet Life' complains, then returns to his swimming-pool floatie. If the song wasn't so pretty — Ocean's velvety voice, soft jazzy accompaniment — you might even <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> for him." [...] Killian Fox of The Observer reported that the song {{was one of the}} few times on the album when Ocean was actively courting heavy radio play, describing Sweet Life as a [...] "near-perfect distillation of every blissed-out summer jam from Stevie Wonder onwards." [...] Amy Dawson, critic for Metro, called the composition [...] "an irresistibly warm slice of old-school funk." ...|$|E

500|$|Vince Gilligan, {{the writer}} of the episode, wanted Bryan Cranston to play the {{antagonist}} because he felt he would humanize the role. “We needed a guy who could be scary and kind of loathsome {{but at the same}} time had a deep, resounding humanity," [...] he later said. [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Gilligan stated, [...] "We had this villain, and we needed the audience to <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> for him when he died. Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it.” Rick Millikan, the casting director for The X-Files noted that Cranston was nearly not chosen for this episode. Initially, the part of Crump had been assigned to a different actor, but Cranston came prepared to audition for the part. Although the character had already been cast, Millikan allowed him to audition and was very pleased with his performance and chose him for the part instead.|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} round of the League Cup, Arsenal faced Derby County at Pride Park. Wenger made several first team changes to give his younger players playing time; Arsenal ran out 2–1 winners, a {{performance}} where [...] "every touch by a Derby player was greeted with ironic cheers." [...] However, the team were beaten comprehensively in the next round to Chelsea at Highbury, losing 0–5. The result inflicted Arsenal's biggest defeat in over eight years and Wenger defended his team selection, virtually a 'second team': [...] "I knew before the game that this kind of thing might happen. You only had to look at the team sheets. If we had won I would still have gone on playing the same side because the players need the experience." [...] Bergkamp, who was rested for the match, echoed his manager's comments: [...] "We had a lot of young players on the field against Chelsea and, although they were feeling very down after losing like that, they will learn from it. To be honest, the scoreline doesn't mean anything, whether it was 1–0 or 5–0. The supporters will <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> but I hope they understand Saturday will be a different game [...]" ...|$|E

Carlos Macias from Terra USA, however, gave it a negative review and criticized its use of a [...] "cheap keyboard that drives the tune reminds us of music played at weddings and quinceañeras". In 2013, Latina included [...] "Addicted to You" [...] on their list of [...] "The 13 Best Songs in Spanglish" [...] and commented that [...] "If non-Spanish speakers can’t pick up the language after listening to this track, then we <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> for you, son".

500|$|Grunge lyrics {{developed}} {{as part of}} [...] "Generation X malaise", reflecting that demographic's feelings of [...] "disillusionment and uselessness". Grunge songs about love were usually about [...] "...failed, boring, doomed or destructive relationships." [...] (e.g., [...] "Black" [...] by Pearl Jam). Grunge songs contained explicit references to drug addiction, notably in Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley's songs [...] "Junkhead", [...] "Godsmack" [...] and [...] "Angry Chair", which express a [...] "...heroin philosophy of misery and hopelessness." [...] "Dirt" [...] and [...] "Hate to Feel" [...] also have heroin references. Grunge lyrics {{tended to be more}} introspective and aimed to enable the listener to see into [...] "hidden" [...] personal issues and examine the [...] "depravity" [...] of the world. This approach can be seen in Mudhoney's song [...] "Touch Me, I'm Sick", which includes lyrics with [...] "deranged imagery" [...] which depict a [...] "broken world and a fragmented self-image"; the song includes the lines [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>bad,</b> and I've felt worse" [...] and [...] "I won't live long and I'm full of rot". Nirvana's song [...] "Lithium", from their 1991 album Nevermind, is about a [...] "...man who finds faith after his girlfriend's suicide"; it depicts [...] "...irony and ugliness" [...] as a way of dealing with these [...] "dark issues".|$|E

[...] After receiving treatment {{on the bank}} of the river, he was taken to Charing Cross Hospital, where he made a complete recovery. [...] Oxford's coach Sean Bowden suggested that the loss of one of Oxford's blades had driven Woods to push himself [...] "beyond his limits". [...] As a result of the disruption and the concern for Woods' condition, the traditional award ceremony was cancelled. [...] Woods later apologised to the Cambridge crew and coach for his collapse that [...] "prevented their celebrations" [...] while thanking them for their [...] "sportsmanlike behaviour". Cambridge boat club president Nelson said [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>bad.</b> Finishing the race there was a lot of raw emotion and some of the celebrations seem pathetic in retrospect" [...] while his coach Steve Trapmore commented [...] "it's not the way anyone wants to take away the win". [...] Oxford cox Zoe de Toledo made a request that the race be re-rowed as a result of the broken blade, but the appeal was dismissed by umpire Garrett, who said [...] "I listened to Oxford’s complaint but I explained I did not see the clash as being the reason for the eventual result".|$|E
500|$|The track [...] "Freeway", {{which was}} {{referred}} by the band as [...] "the <b>feel</b> <b>bad</b> dance {{hit of the}} year", features a hip hop-influenced style with sampled voices. Its lyrics were inspired by an article in Los Angeles Times {{about a man who}} stopped his truck on a Los Angeles freeway and committed suicide after litting his truck on fire and obstructing the traffic. The sampled voices were taken from Casio keyboards that Sparks and Suzi had previously bought at a Guitar Center store. The album features humorous and irreverent lyrics. Sparks noted that many songs are [...] "double-sided. There's a lot of masking of fuck-you's going on." [...] She also said that Slap-Happy was [...] "almost a spit in the eye of our label, who had dropped us. It was like, 'Fuck you, we’re going to make another record anyway, so fuck off!' Some of the writing on [...] record is very angry, because we were pissed." [...] The opening track [...] "Crackpot Baby", which is the first L7 song that features a three-part vocal harmony, features [...] "unforgiving lyrics about plastic L.A. types", while [...] "Stick to the Plan" [...] is about a [...] "chronic masturbator / With love in his eyes".|$|E
