40|$|This paper investigates to {{what extent}} a New Keynesian, {{monetary}} model {{with the addition of}} a microfounded, non-Walrasian labor market based on union bargaining is able to replicate key aspects of the business cycle. The presence of a representative union offers an explanation for two features of the cycle. First, it generates an endogenous mechanism which produces persistent responses of the economy to both supply and demand shocks. Second, labor unionization causes a lower elasticity of marginal costs to output. This leads to lower inflation volatility. The model can replicate the negative correlation between productivity shocks and employment in the data.

40|$|This paper serves two purposes. First, it investigates to {{what extent}} a New Keynesian {{monetary}} model {{with the addition of}} a microfounded, non-Walrasian labor market based on union bargaining is able to replicate key aspects of the business cycle. Second, it explores the influence of this setting for the conduction of an optimal monetary policy in the specific class of Taylor-type rules. From a positive perspective, the presence of a representative union offers an explanation for two features of the cycle. Firstly, it generates an endogenous mechanism which produces persistent responses of the economy to both supply and demand shocks. Secondly, labor unionization reduces the elasticity of marginal costs to output. This leads to lower inflation volatility. Model simulations show the superiority of the unionized framework in reproducing <b>European</b> <b>business</b> cycle <b>statistics</b> relative to a model with a competitive labor market. From a normative standpoint, the union presence leads a welfare maximizing monetary authority to oppose output gap variations more strenuously and to attenuate reaction to inflation fluctuations compared with the competitive setting. Interest rate inertia preserves its welfare improving importance in a unionized labor market...|$|R

40|$|Because {{statistical}} analysis requires both familiarity with {{and the ability}} to use mathematics, students typically are required to take one or more prerequisite math courses prior to enrolling in the <b>business</b> <b>statistics</b> course. Despite these math prerequisites, however, students find it extremely difficult to learn <b>business</b> <b>statistics.</b> In this study, we use an ordered probit model to examine the effect of alternative prerequisite math course sequences on the grade performance of 1, 684 <b>business</b> and economics <b>statistics</b> students at a large Midwestern university. In addition, we show how the imposition of a minimum grade requirement of C- for the math prerequisite course would impact student success in the <b>business</b> <b>statistics</b> course. Although several studies have examined the impact of different math skills on student success in <b>business</b> and economics <b>statistics</b> courses, our study is the first to provide a detailed analysis of the impact of different prerequisite math course sequences on student performance in <b>business</b> <b>statistics.</b> Our study shows that, other things the same, taking more math credit hours, taking math courses that emphasize calculus, and imposing a minimum grade of C- on the prerequisite math course have significantly positive impacts on student grade performance in the <b>business</b> and economics <b>statistics</b> course. introductory <b>business</b> statistics; math prerequisites; math topics; student performance; minimum prerequisite math grade requirement. ...|$|R

40|$|Statistics is a {{required}} subject {{of study in}} many academic disciplines, including business, education and psychology, that causes problems for many students. This has long been recognised {{and there have been}} a number of studies into students’ attitudes towards statistics, particularly statistical anxiety. However, none of these studies investigated the classroom learning environment in relation to students’ attitudes towards statistics. This paper describes the development and validation of two new instruments, the <b>Business</b> <b>Statistics</b> Computer Laboratory Environment Inventory and the Attitude towards <b>Business</b> <b>Statistics</b> instrument. The former measures appropriate aspects of the learning environment of a computer-based statistics class, whilst the latter measures students’ attitudes towards <b>business</b> <b>statistics.</b> The instruments were administered to undergraduate business students at a university in Southern California. When exploratory factor analysis was carried out, it was found that the items of both instruments loaded onto their a priori scales. All the scales exhibited both internal reliability and discriminant validity. Correlation analysis between the scales of the two instruments demonstrated a strong relationship between aspects of the learning environment and students’ attitudes towards <b>business</b> <b>statistics...</b>|$|R
