40|$|A major {{question}} {{in the literature on}} the classical gold standard concerns the efficiency of international arbitrage. Authors have examined efficiency by looking at the spread of the <b>gold</b> <b>points,</b> <b>gold</b> <b>point</b> violations, or the flow of gold, or by tests of various asset market criteria, including speculative efficiency and interest arbitrage. These studies have suffered from many limitations, both methodological and empirical. We offer a new methodology for measuring market integration based on nonlinear theoretical models and threshold autoregressions. We also compile a new, high-frequency series of continuous daily data from 1879 to 1913. We can derive reasonable econometric estimates of the implied <b>gold</b> <b>points</b> and price dynamics. The changes in these measures over time provide an insight into the evolution of market integration. © 2004 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R

30|$|During the {{classical}} gold standard, aggravated levels of {{political or economic}} uncertainty manifested themselves in large deviations of the sight-rate from the mint-par (Clare 1902, p. 98). To uncover how the investment demand for bills of exchange reacted to such events, Table  3 splits the sample into observations within and outside (or on) the <b>gold</b> <b>points.</b> Of note, the vagaries to determine the <b>gold</b> <b>points</b> introduce an important caveat to this approach. Still, for observations laying outside the <b>gold</b> <b>points</b> according to the values reported in the “Exchange rates during the gold standard” section, the top panel suggests that the interest-parity condition as regards the London investment demand for continental bills of exchange {{can no longer be}} rejected for the case of Paris (whereas there is only a rejection at the 10 % level for the case of Amsterdam) 9. Although the London banker was, reportedly, “content with a safe and steady rate of interest” (Thomas 1921, p. 78), sufficiently large opportunities to make a chance profit did, perhaps, give rise to more active short-term investment activity in higher yielding bills of exchange on established financial centres such as Paris. Conversely, according to the bottom panel, the results of (3) differ hardly when distinguishing between observations within and outside the <b>gold</b> <b>points.</b> For the continental investment demand for London bills of exchange, where exchange rate risk was hedged, this distinction should indeed be less relevant.|$|R

40|$|We report first-principles {{calculations}} of the inelastic current-voltage (I-V) {{characteristics of a}} <b>gold</b> <b>point</b> contact and a molecular junction in the nonresonant regime. Discontinuities in the I-V curves appear in correspondence to the normal modes of the structures. Due to the quasi-one-dimensional nature of these systems, specific modes with large longitudinal component dominate the inelastic I-V curves. In {{the case of the}} <b>gold</b> <b>point</b> contact, our results are in good agreement with recent experimental data. For the molecular junction, we find that the inelastic I-V curves are quite sensitive to the structure of the contact between the molecule and the electrodes thus providing a powerful tool to extract the bonding geometry in molecular wires.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of silver through quartz at high temperatures leads to {{contamination of the}} platinum sensing element of high temperature platinum resistance thermometers. While some protection of the PRT element may be afforded by the application of appropriate electric fields, the contamination of the quartz elements of silver fixed points causes their premature failure. Contamination {{is evidenced by the}} yellowish colour imparted to the glass by the silver particles growing within the quartz glass matrix. The presence of silver as the contaminating element has been confirmed unambiguously through energy dispersive x-ray analysis and secondary ion mass spectrometry. To mitigate the risk of silver contamination, the <b>gold</b> <b>point</b> is proposed as an alternative calibration point. PRT resistance ratios measured at the freezing points of silver and gold in different laboratories at different times are highly correlated. This suggests that the ITS- 90 reference function might be extrapolated to 1064. 18 0 C (the <b>gold</b> fixed <b>point).</b> However, it remains unclear from the gold and silver PRT resistance ratios from the literature whether extrapolation of the reference function leads to the correct value at the <b>gold</b> <b>point.</b> A direct comparison of <b>gold</b> fixed <b>points</b> may be required to resolve the inconsistencies. Additional PRT data may help resolve the discrepancy. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|We report first-principles {{calculations}} of local heating in nanoscale junctions formed {{by a single}} molecule and a <b>gold</b> <b>point</b> contact. Due to a larger heat dissipation, the single molecule heats up less than the <b>gold</b> <b>point</b> contact. We also find, at zero temperature, a threshold bias V_onset of about 6 mV and 11 mV for the molecule and the point contact, respectively, is required to excite the smallest vibrational mode and generate heat. The latter estimate is in very good agreement with recent experimental results on the same system. At a given external bias V below V_onset, heating becomes noticeable when the background temperature is {{on the order of}} ∼ e(V_onset-V) /k_B. Above V_onset, local heating increases dramatically with increasing bias but is also considerably suppressed by thermal dissipation into the electrodes. The results provide a microscopic picture of current-induced heat generation in atomic-scale structures. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Approval of the {{quantity}} theory, of the Humean price-specie-flow mechanism (PSFM) and of lender {{of last resort}} analysis are characteristics of British monetary orthodoxy in the 1870 s.
