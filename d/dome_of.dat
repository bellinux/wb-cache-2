5|$|The Ayyubid {{period in}} Jerusalem {{following}} its conquest by Saladin {{was marked by}} a huge investment {{in the construction of}} houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels. Numerous works were undertaken at the Temple Mount. Saladin ordered all the inner walls and pillars of the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> the Rock to be covered in marble and he initiated the renovation of the mosaics on the dome's drum. The mihrab of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu'azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. The <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> the Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing free-standing domes of the Temple Mount.|$|E

5|$|In architecture, Filippo Brunelleschi was {{foremost}} {{in studying the}} remains of ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer Vitruvius and the flourishing discipline of mathematics, Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of engineering was building the <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> the Florence Cathedral. Another building demonstrating this style is the church of St. Andrew in Mantua, built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, combining the skills of Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Sangallo and Maderno.|$|E

5|$|In the Despotate of Epirus, the Church of the Parigoritissa (1282–9) is {{the most}} complex example, with a domed octagon core and domed ambulatory. Built {{in the capital of}} Arta, its {{external}} appearance resembles a cubic palace. The upper level narthex and galleries have five domes, with the middle <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> the narthex an open lantern. This Greek-cross octagon design, similar to the earlier example at Daphni, is one of several among the various Byzantine principalities. Another is found in the Hagia Theodoroi at Mistra (1290–6).|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurids, Majungasaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} {{with a short}} snout. Although the forelimbs are {{not completely}} known, they were very short, while the hind limbs were longer and very stocky. It can be distinguished from other abelisaurids by its wider skull, the very rough texture and thickened bone {{on the top of}} its snout, and the single rounded horn on the roof of its skull, which was originally mistaken for the <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> a pachycephalosaur. It also had more teeth in both upper and lower jaws than most abelisaurids.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} a century after the capture of Jerusalem, in 691, the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik {{commissioned}} the construction of the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> the Rock over a large outcropping of bedrock on the Temple Mount. The 10th-century historian al-Muqaddasi wrote that Abd al-Malik built the shrine in order to compete in grandeur with the city's Christian churches. Whatever the intention, the impressive splendor and scale of the shrine is seen as having helped significantly in solidifying the attachment of Jerusalem to the early Muslim faith.|$|E

5|$|Palestine was conquered by the Islamic Caliphate, {{beginning}} in 634 CE.

In 661, with the Assassination of Ali, Muawiyah I became the Caliph of the Islamic world after being crowned in Jerusalem. The <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> the Rock, completed in 691, was the world's first great work of Islamic architecture.|$|E
