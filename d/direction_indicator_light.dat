40|$|Vehicular ad hoc {{networks}} (VANETs) {{are getting}} growing interest {{as they are}} expected to play crucial role in making safer, smarter, and more efficient transportation networks. Due to unique characteristics such as sparse topology and intermittent connectivity, Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) routing in VANET becomes an inherent choice and is challenging. However, most of the existing DTN protocols do not accurately discover potential neighbors and, hence, appropriate intermediate nodes for packet transmission. Moreover, these protocols cause unnecessary overhead due to excessive beacon messages. To cope with these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework and an Adaptive Geographical DTN Routing (AGDR) for vehicular DTNs. AGDR exploits node position, current direction, speed, and the predicted direction to carefully select an appropriate intermediate node. <b>Direction</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>light</b> is employed to accurately predict the vehicle future direction so that the forwarding node can relay packets to the desired destination. Simulation experiments confirm the performance supremacy of AGDR compared to contemporary schemes in terms of packet delivery ratio, overhead, and end-to-end delay. Simulation results demonstrate that AGDR improves the packet delivery ratio (5 – 7 %), reduces the overhead (1 – 5 %), and decreases the delay (up to 0. 02 [*]ms). Therefore, AGDR improves route stability by reducing the frequency of route failures...|$|E

5000|$|The Yamaha DT50MX is {{the most}} common [...] {{motorcycle}} in the Yamaha DT series. It superseded the DT50M when introduced in June 1981 and can easily be identified by its Mono-Cross(MX) rear suspension with a silver painted square-section rear swinging arm and a more angular tank as opposed to the more rounded one found on the M variant. The 'MX' designation was commonly used on Yamaha motorcycles fitted with the 'Mono-Cross' rear suspension, which was the first to employ a single shock-absorber. It remained in production largely unchanged until 1996, gaining only a CDI ignition system and a change to square bodied <b>direction</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> in 1986 with the introduction of the 2FN model (sometimes referred to as the MX-S). The moped is very common in Scandinavia where its leading competitor was the Honda MT50 and can be ridden on a CBT at 16 in the UK.|$|R

5000|$|The Volkswagen Rabbit GTI, the North American {{version of}} the {{high-performance}} Golf GTI, debuted in Canada in 1979 and the United States for 1983. Assembled from parts made in Mexico, Canada, Germany and the U.S. in Volkswagen's Westmoreland assembly plant, it had the same Mk1 chassis, and the same A1 body type as the Mk1 Golf GTI {{that had been on}} sale in Europe since 1976, with a few exceptions. Key distinct features of the Rabbit GTI were its squared front end styling, and its alloy [...] "snowflake" [...] wheels. The interior came in red or blue felt and leatherette trim. The squared styling of the front end, particularly the wraparound <b>direction</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>lights,</b> gave it added safety and slight improvement in performance. Under the hood, the engine was a JH 1.8 litre four-cylinder gasoline engine that ran on unleaded fuel; in addition to being marginally larger than the regular engine it also had lightened pistons, bigger valves, a higher compression, and a free-flow exhaust as well as other minor improvements. The JH 1.8 litre was transversely mounted, and it would peak in stock condition at , delivered through a close-ratio five-speed manual transmission. For 1984 the Rabbit GTi was back, now with an updated engine offering [...] In total, 30,000 of these 1.8 litre Rabbit GTis were built in Pennsylvania.|$|R
