40|$|It {{has been}} clearly {{demonstrated}} that the maternal nutritional status during pregnancy and lactation has long-term effects on offspring health. In mammals, milk represents the first maternal support provided to the newborns so that its composition may {{play a major role}} in long-term programming. We therefore assessed the effects of maternal high-fat/high-sugar obesogenic (OD) or control (CD) diets on offspring growth and adiposity in the rabbit. Between 7 and 20 weeks of age, the body weight gain of OD milk fed rabbits was higher than that of CD milk fed rabbits (P < 0. 05). Body fat mass measurements at 21 weeks of age revealed a significant increase in body adiposity as a function of milk ingested during the neonatal period, in both female and male offspring (P < 0. 05). A marked weight gain difference was observed according to the milk in both female and male offspring. Moreover we investigated the composition in major proteins and leptin levels in milk from OD or CD fed dams. LC-MS analysis of individual control skimmed milk samples enabled identification and quantification of the rabbit main milk proteins and of their main phosphorylated isoforms at two different stages of lactation (3 and 10 days). Here we show that the OD diet induced a reduction in the whey acidic protein (WAP) content concomitantly with both an increase in serum albumin and lactoferrin contents and in the phosphorylated isoforms of the main milk proteins. Furthermore, a sharp rise in leptin levels was observed in the milk of OD fed dams on day 10 of lactation when compared to CD animals (P < 0. 05). Taken together these findings provide evidence that lactation is a critical window of development during which exposure to a <b>deleterious</b> <b>diet</b> is highly detrimental to long-term outcomes. Moreover, these insights suggest that it may be possible to prevent at least some of the adverse effects of inadequate maternal nutrition on the long-term metabolic outcomes of the offspring nutritional through nutritional interventions applied during the lactation period...|$|E
40|$|Developing a lean muscular {{figure for}} the {{purposes}} of sports and/or appearance has become a central issue for males. Concern has been raised because the desire to develop such a body build may lead to the adoption of numerous health-threatening behaviors. Consequently, this review presents a comprehensive analysis of the physical and psychological consequences that result from the use of steroids (legal and illegal), ephedrine, and <b>deleterious</b> <b>dieting</b> strategies specific to males. Putative risk factors for these behaviors will be identified, and the clinical disorder associated with the extreme abuse of these behaviors, muscle dysmorphia, will be examined. <br /...|$|R
40|$|One {{important}} {{area of research}} that has emerged {{in recent years is}} the assessment of factors that {{contribute to the development of}} body image problems and, more concretely, to the development of body dissatisfaction. The female sociocultural beauty ideal, a constant object of research for over three decades now, is so ultra-thin that it is both unattainable and unhealthy. Likewise, the male beauty ideal of a lean yet muscular body is becoming an important issue for men, with poor body image sometimes leading to the adoption of numerous health-threatening behaviors, such as the use of steroids, ephedrine and <b>deleterious</b> <b>dieting</b> strategies. Body image has been related with self-esteem, depressed mood, social anxiety and disordered eating. In recent years, physical self-perceptions are also studied from the parallel perspective of physical self-concept. In general, women report much higher body dissatisfaction tha...|$|R
40|$|Background: Stress may {{indirectly}} {{contribute to}} disease (e. g., cardiovascular disease, cancer by producing <b>deleterious</b> changes to <b>diet.</b> Purpose: To test {{effectiveness of a}} stress management support (SMS) tool to reduce stress-related unhealthy snacking and to promote stress-related healthy snacking. Methods: Participants were randomized to complete a SMS tool with instruction to link stressful situations with healthy snack alternatives (experimental) or a SMS tool without a linking instruction (control). On-line daily reports of stressors and snacking were completed for 7 days. Results: Daily stressors were associated with unhealthy snack consumption {{in the control condition}} but not in the experimental condition. Participants highly motivated towards healthy eating consumed a greater number of healthy snacks in the experimental condition on stressful days compared to participants in the experimental condition with low and mean levels of motivation. Conclusions: This tool is an effective, theory driven, intervention that helps to protect against stress-induced high calorie snack consumption...|$|R
40|$|Insulin {{signaling}} can be modulated {{by several}} isoforms of PKC in peripheral tissues. Here, we assessed whether one specific isoform, PKC-θ, was expressed in critical CNS regions that regulate energy balance {{and whether it}} mediated the <b>deleterious</b> effects of <b>diets</b> high in fat, specifically palmitic acid, on hypothalamic insulin activity in rats and mice. Using a combination of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we found that PKC-θ was expressed in discrete neuronal populations of the arcuate nucleus, specifically the neuropeptide Y/agouti-related protein neurons and the dorsal medial nucleus in the hypothalamus. CNS exposure to palmitic acid via direct infusion or by oral gavage increased the localization of PKC-θ to cell membranes in the hypothalamus, which was associated with impaired hypothalamic insulin and leptin signaling. This finding was specific for palmitic acid, as the monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid, neither increased membrane localization of PKC-θ nor induced insulin resistance. Finally, arcuate-specific knockdown of PKC-θ attenuated diet-induced obesity and improved insulin signaling. These results suggest {{that many of the}} deleterious effects of high-fat diets, specifically those enriched with palmitic acid, are CNS mediated via PKC-θ activation, resulting in reduced insulin activity...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This study {{explored}} whether α-lactalbumine (cysteine-rich protein), an antioxidant food compound from {{milk protein}} (isolat P), increased myocardial function and/or pro/antioxidant protein in swine. We measured {{the effect of}} isolat P after one month of detraining (following 12 months of moderate chronic training), with and without a high fat diet. Methods: Male Göttingen swine (n= 34, 18 - 24 weeks) were randomly assigned into sedentary (S) or exercise groups (E), fed with standard (N) or <b>deleterious</b> (D) <b>diets.</b> Only the D diet groups were supplemented with isolat P (+ or -). 6 groups were designed (NS-, NE-, DS-, DE-, DS+, DE+). Swine performed a treadmill training protocol that achieved 150 bpm for 60 min/day, 5 days/week for 12 weeks, and then detrained for 4 weeks. At {{the end of the}} program, myocardial tissues were analyzed for pro-oxydant NADPH oxydase (p 47 phox, p 67 phox) and eNOS expression by densitometry, as well as for antioxydant enzyme activities of SOD, CAT and GPx by spectrophotometry. Results: NADPH oxydase expression (p 47 phox only) (104. 94 ± 3. 24 vs. 101. 25 ± 1. 04 A. U., p 0. 05). In DE- group eNOS expression is lower than in DS- (71. 61 ± 1. 27 UA vs 77. 33 ± 2. 90 UA, p< 0. 05). No modifications statistically observe for the others enzymes. DS+ group led to decreased expression of eNOS (DS- 77. 33 ± 2. 90 AU vs. DS+: 71. 24 ± 2. 7 AU, p< 0. 05) to reach a basal value, without modifying other enzymes. These results suggest an eNOS recoupling. Finally, in DE+ group, isolat P restored the basal activity and expression of enzymes eNOS, NADPHoxydase, SOD, CAT and GPx to similar values as in sedentary animal fed a standard diet (NS-). Conclusion: Addition of isolat P to high fat diet reverses eNOS decoupling induced by high fat diet. Isolat P may have an antioxidant role allowing antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and GPx to recover basal activity levels while NADPH oxydase increases with a high fat diet. After one month of detraining, the beneficial effects of chronic exercise had disappeared. Isolat P may slow down the detraining effect on eNOS but not upon antioxidant enzymes. Therefore, early isolat P association with exercise training may be an interesting preventive strategy against metabolic diseases...|$|R
40|$|DURING {{the past}} decade {{much has been written}} about the <b>deleterious</b> effect of <b>diets</b> rich in protein. Since the kidney is the organ chiefly {{concerned}} with the removal of nitrogenous products in the metabolism of protein, attention has naturally been focused on this organ. However, in view of the apparent simplicity of the thesis, the experimental results have been surprisingly variable. It seems, therefore, that any controlled obser vations of the effects of high concentrations of dietary protein will be valu able in helping to clarify a situation which involves a subject of consider able practical importance. Among other confusing statements in the literature are those concerning growth and physiological well-being of experimental animals on rations rich in protein. In some cases poor growth is reported; in others, satisfac tory early growth but failure to reach the usual mature body weight; while normal development is observed in still other studies. In view of the lack of concordance in this respect and in the light of recent accounts (1, 2, 3) of rapid growth of albino ratsâ€”the animal most frequently used in these experimentsâ€”it seemed desirable to examine anew the influence of dietary protein upon the development of individuals of the same strain of rapidly-growing animals. The increase in body weight in young animals and main tenance in old ones should be a reliable criterion of the adequacy of a diet under conditions where other variables are ruled out. In the present report we have attempted to correlate change in body weight with concentration of dietary protein in white rats of different ages. The observations were made upon a large number of male albino rats from all of which the right kidney had been removed. They were grouped into four different ages and were given complete diets containing three dif ferent amounts of protein (see Table I). At 56 days and 150 days after nephrectomy (the experimental ration was first given on the day of th...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of diet on mitochondrial functions {{has been a}} longstanding question in evolutionary biology as well as human health and well-being. Discovering the interaction between diet and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can facilitate {{a better understanding of}} organelle and organism evolution and may be a tractable mechanism for improving human health in the age of obesity. Mitochondrial functions are determined by a tight coordination between mtDNA, nuclear DNA and the metabolic state of cells, which is highly influenced by diet. In theory, diet may also affect the selective advantage of different mitochondrial haplotypes. The overall goal of this thesis is to determine the role of diet in changing the mitochondrial functions of the organism. Mitochondria are an important regulator of organismal fitness and a key energy converting organelle. The flow of energy in the biological system involves the conversion of macronutrients to form substrates that drive mitochondrial respiration. The energy generated from mitochondrial respiration will then be invested into different physiological traits for optimising the organism fitness. To study how diet affects mitochondrial functions, I utilise Drosophila fly lines harbouring different mtDNA haplotypes in a constant nuclear background. These lines contain known mtDNA sequence variations and allow me to perform mitochondrial function tests to determine the consequences of specific mutations on mitochondrial and organism health. This thesis is composed of four main studies. The first two studies focus on the development of quantitation protocols that allow me to measure and determine the {{influence of}} diet on Drosophila age grading and mitochondrial functions. The last two studies specifically aim to characterise the relationship between diet and mitochondrial functions. Three major conclusions can be drawn from these studies. First, naturally occurring mtDNA variations in Drosophila melanogaster lead to differences in phenotype. Secondly, this variation in phenotypic expression is regulated by mitochondrial functions. Lastly, diet can influence mitochondrial functions and influence the phenotype of the organism. My data show that there is an intricate cross-talk between diet and mtDNA where mtDNA haplotypes show specific responses toward dietary change. Particularly, I have demonstrated that nonsynonymous mtDNA mutations may be slightly <b>deleterious</b> in one <b>diet</b> but confer beneficial effects when exposed to an alternate diet...|$|R
