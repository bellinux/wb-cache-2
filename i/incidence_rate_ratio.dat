40|$|The {{comparative}} effectiveness of fingolimod versus interferon beta/glatiramer acetate was assessed in a multicentre, observational, prospectively acquired cohort study including 613 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis discontinuing natalizumab in the Italian iMedWeb registry. First, after natalizumab suspension, the relapse risk during the untreated wash-out period {{and during the}} course of switch therapies was estimated through Poisson regression analyses in separated models. During the wash-out period an increased risk of relapses was found in patients with a higher number of relapses before natalizumab treatment (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> = 1. 31, P = 0. 0014) and in patients discontinuing natalizumab due to lack of efficacy (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> = 2. 33, P = 0. 0288), patient's choice (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> = 2. 18, P = 0. 0064) and adverse events (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> = 2. 09, P = 0. 0084). The strongest independent factors influencing the relapse risk after the start of switch therapies were a wash-out duration longer than 3 months (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> = 1. 78, P < 0. 0001), the number of relapses experienced during and before natalizumab treatment (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> = 1. 61, P < 0. 0001; <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> = 1. 13, P = 0. 0118, respectively) and the presence of comorbidities (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> = 1. 4, P = 0. 0097). Switching to fingolimod was associated with a 64 % reduction of the adjusted-risk for relapse in comparison with switching to interferon beta/glatiramer acetate (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> = 0. 36, P < 0. 0001). Secondly, patients who switched to fingolimod or to interferon beta/glatiramer acetate were propensity score-matched on a 1 -to- 1 basis at the switching date. In the propensity score-matched sample a Poisson model showed a significant lower incidence of relapses in patients treated with fingolimod in comparison with those treated with interferon beta/glatiramer acetate (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> = 0. 52, P = 0. 0003) during a 12 -month follow-up. The cumulative probability of a first relapse after the treatment switch was significantly lower in patients receiving fingolimod than in those receiving interferon beta/glatiramer acetate (P = 0. 028). The robustness of this result was also confirmed by sensitivity analyses in subgroups with different wash-out durations (less or more than 3 months). Time to 3 -month confirmed disability progression was not significantly different between the two groups (Hazard ratio = 0. 58; P = 0. 1931). Our results indicate a superiority of fingolimod in comparison to interferon beta/glatiramer acetate in controlling disease reactivation after natalizumab discontinuation in the real life setting...|$|E
40|$|Aberrant DNA {{methylation}} affects carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer. Folate metabolizing enzymes {{may influence}} the bioavailability of methyl groups, whereas DNA and histone methyltransferases are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We studied associations of genetic variants of folate metabolizing enzymes (MTHFR, MTR, and MTRR), DNA methyltransferase DNMT 3 b, and histone methyltransferases (EHMT 1, EHMT 2, and PRDM 2), with colorectal cancers, {{with or without the}} CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), MLH 1 hypermethylation, or microsatellite instability. Incidence rate ratios were calculated in case-cohort analyses, with common homozygotes as reference, among 659 cases and 1, 736 subcohort members of the Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer (n = 120, 852). Men with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype were at decreased colorectal cancer risk (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio,</b> 0. 49; P = 0. 01), but the T allele was associated with increased risk in women (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio,</b> 1. 39; P = 0. 02). The MTR 2756 GG genotype was associated with increased colorectal cancer risk (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio,</b> 1. 58; P = 0. 04), and inverse associations were observed among women carrying DNMT 3 b C→T (rs 406193; <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio,</b> 0. 72; P = 0. 04) or EHMT 2 G→A (rs 535586; <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio,</b> 0. 76; P = 0. 05) polymorphisms. Although significantly correlated (P < 0. 001), only 41. 5 % and 33. 3 % of CIMP tumors harbored MLH 1 hypermethylation or microsatellite instability, respectively. We observed inverse associations between MTR A 2756 G and CIMP among men (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio,</b> 0. 58; P = 0. 04), and between MTRR A 66 G and MLH 1 hypermethylation among women (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio,</b> 0. 55; P = 0. 02). In conclusion, MTHFR, MTR, DNMT 3 b, and EHMT 2 polymorphisms are associated with colorectal cancer, and rare variants of MTR and MTRR may reduce promoter hypermethylation. The incomplete overlap between CIMP, MLH 1 hypermethylation, and microsatellite instability indicates that these related "methylation phenotypes" may not be similar and should be investigated separately.

Methods: A population-based, retrospective, incidence case review was conducted to analyse the frequency of primary TJR surgery of the knee and hip in all patients, and specifically in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Central Finland between 1986 and 2003. Patients with TJR surgery of the knee and hip were identified in hospital databases over the 18 -year period. Age-standardised <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratios</b> for the primary TJR of the knee and hip were calculated, stratified to sex and diagnosis, with 1986 as the reference value.

40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} the therapeutic efficacy of loop diuretics in {{acute renal failure}} using Bayesian evidence synthesis, because despite widespread use, the role of diuretics is controversial. Data Source: Randomized controlled trials or nonrandomized studies, 1966 to January 2007, identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and manual bibliographic search. Study Selection: Studies with assessable predefined end points, exclusive of those pertaining to acute renal failure prophylaxis or chronic renal failure. Data Extraction: Data extraction was performed jointly by the first two authors; independent study assessment was via standard checklist, unblinded. Data Synthesis: The primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes were time to renal function normalization and total number of dialyses. Bayesian hierarchical random effects estimates of treatment effects were determined as risk ratio for mortality, <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> for dialysis number, and mean difference for continuous measures. Bayesian outcome probabilities were calculated as probability (P) that risk ratio or <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> of loop diuretics > 1 and probability that mean difference > 0. Five randomized controlled trials and eight nonrandomized studies were identified. Loop diuretics were not associated with decreased mortality in either randomized controlled trials or nonrandomized studies: overall risk ratio 1. 10; 95 % credible interval 0. 85, 1. 42; P (risk ratio > 1) = 83. 8 %. The oliguric period was decreased by loop diuretics: overall mean difference - 7. 70 days; 95 % credible interval - 12. 51, - 2. 08; P (mean difference > 0) = 0. 7 %. Although the dialysis rate credible interval, loop diuretics vs. control, spanned unity (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> 0. 71; 95 % credible interval 0. 47, 1. 06), {{the probability that the}} <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> exceeded unity indicated a substantial benefit: P (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> > 1 = 4. 1 %.

Overall, polio patients had a 40 % increased risk of being hospitalized for a psychiatric disorder (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> 1. 43, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 23, 1. 66). Apparently, the overall increased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations could not be con-fined to specific groups of psychiatric disorders but seemed to be explained by slightly increased risks of several different disorders, especially milder psychiatric disorders. Finally, psychiatric morbidity did not differ between paralytic and nonparalytic polio patients. History of hospitalization for polio might be associated with subsequent risk of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders. The underlying mechanism for this association remains uncertain.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the risk of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis among the users of acitretin. The <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis was estimated in a cohort of acitretin users by using prescription sequence analysis. Study subjects were 196 women between 15 and 45 years of age, exposed to acitretin in 1990. Prescriptions of drugs for treatment of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis were used as proxy for the occurrence of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis. Validation of the proxy drug was performed by record linkage of pharmacy and medical records. In addition to the risk estimation by incidence rate ratios a case-crossover study with patient-stratified logistic regression analysis was performed to control for distortion due to individual differences in contribution of exposure time. The positive predictive value of the proxy drug for vulvo-vaginal candidiasis ranged between 57 and 100 %, the sensitivity was 87 % and the specificity estimated 99 %. The crude <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> for vulvo-vaginal candidiasis following acitretin exposure was 2. 8 (CI 95 %: 1. 1 - 7. 1). The pooled Mantel-Haenszel <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> was 3. 3 (CI 95 %: 1. 1 - 9. 6) after stratification for accumulated level of exposure. Patient-stratified analysis on the subgroup of cases (n = 15) revealed an odds ratio of 6. 5 (CI 95 %: 2. 3 - 18. 2). This study strongly suggests that the higher occurrence of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis during acitretin exposure is attributable to the drug...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{evaluated}} {{the association between}} gestational age, birth weight, intrauterine growth, and epilepsy in a population-based cohort of 1. 4 million singletons born in Denmark (1979 – 2002). A total of 14, 334 inpatients (1979 – 2002) and outpatients (1995 – 2002) with epilepsy were registered in the Danish National Hospital Register. Children who were potentially growth restricted were identified through two methods: 1) sex-, birth-order-, and gestational-age-specific z score of birth weight; and 2) deviation from the expected birth weight estimated based on the birth weight of an older sibling. The <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> of epilepsy increased consistently with decreasing gesta-tional age and birth weight. The <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratios</b> of epilepsy {{in the first year}} of life were more than fivefold among children born at 22 – 32 weeks compared with 39 – 41 weeks and among children whose birth weight was < 2, 000 g compared with 3, 000 – 3, 999 g. The association was modified by age but remained into early adulthood. <b>Incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratios</b> of epilepsy were increased among children identified as growth restricted according to either of the two methods. In conclusion, short gestational age, low birth weight, and intrauterine growth restriction are associated with an increased risk of epilepsy...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} in risk prediction using genomic profiles has surged recently. A proper interpretation of effect size measures in association studies {{is crucial to}} accurate risk prediction. In this study, we clarified {{the relationship between the}} odds ratio (OR), relative risk and <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratios</b> in the context of genetic association studies. We demonstrated that under the common practice of sampling prevalent cases and controls, the resulting ORs approximate the <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratios.</b> Based on this result, we presented a framework to compute the disease risk given the current age and follow-up period (including lifetime risk), with consideration of competing risks of mortality. We considered two extensions. One is correcting the <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> to reflect the person-years alive and disease-free, the other is converting prevalence to incidence estimates. The methodology was applied to an example of breast cancer prediction. We observed that simply multiplying the OR by the average lifetime risk estimates yielded a final estimate > 100 % (101 %), while using our method that accounts for competing risks produces an estimate of 63 % only. We also applied the method to risk prediction of Alzheimer's disease in Hong Kong. We recommend that companies offering direct-to-consumer genetic testing employ more rigorous prediction algorithms considering competing risks. © 2010 S.

40|$|Summary Relationships between {{incidence}} of Wilms ' tumour and information recorded at birth were investigated in a prospective {{study of the}} 1 489 297 children born in Norway between 1967 and 1992. A total of 119 individuals were diagnosed with Wilms ' tumour in the age interval 0 - 14 years. A high length at birth {{was significantly associated with}} a high risk (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> 1. 8 for length> 53 cm vs. 49 cm, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 3. 2). A low Apgar score at 1 min was also associated with an increased risk (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> 2. 2 for Apgar score. 8 vs a score> 9, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 3. 9). For all variables for which an association was indicated, the association seemed to be restricted mainly to children aged less than 2 years. This suggests that Wilms ' tumour diagnosed early in life may differ aetiologically from that of cases diagnosed later...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} The lung cancer incidence was significantly {{increased in the}} past two decades in China. But the secular trend of lung cancer incidence difference between gender (male and female), area (urban and rural) and average age was not clear. The aim of this study is to analyze the trend of lung cancer <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> between gender, area and average age in China during 1989 - 2008, and provide some inspiration for lung cancer prevention and control activities. Methods Cancer registry data and population data in China from 1989 to 2008 were collected by the National Cancer Registration Center. Stratified for gender and area, Poisson regression model was used to estimate annual lung cancer <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> between male and female, urban and rural areas. The average age of lung cancer incidence was calculated. Linear regression was used to model the trend of annual <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> and average age over time. Results Incidence rate ratios of lung cancer between male and female, urban and rural areas were significantly decreased from 2. 47 and 2. 07 to 2. 28 and 1. 14 during 1989 - 2008, respectively. Meanwhile, the average age of lung cancer incidence among male and female dramatically increased from 65. 32 and 65. 14 to 67. 87 and 68. 05, respectively. Conclusion The difference of lung cancer incidence between male and female, urban and rural areas remarkably decreased from 1989 to 2008. The average age of lung cancer occurrence gradually increased. Researches, prevention and control activities on lung cancer with consideration of new incidence pattern should be strengthened...|$|E
40|$|Background: After the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in March 2011, {{radioactive}} {{elements were}} {{released from the}} Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Based on prior knowledge, concern emerged about whether an increased incidence of thyroid cancer among exposed residents would occur as a result. Methods: After the release, Fukushima Prefecture performed ultrasound thyroid screening on all residents ages <= 18 years. The first round of screening included 298, 577 examinees, and a second round began in April 2014. We analyzed the prefecture results from {{the first and second}} round up to December 31, 2014, in comparison with the Japanese annual incidence and the incidence within a reference area in Fukushima Prefecture. Results: The highest <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio,</b> using a latency period of 4 years, was observed in the central middle district of the prefecture compared with the Japanese annual incidence (<b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> = 50; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 25, 90). The prevalence of thyroid cancer was 605 per million examinees (95 % CI = 302, 1, 082) and the prevalence odds ratio compared with the reference district in Fukushima Prefecture was 2. 6 (95 % CI = 0. 99, 7. 0). In the second screening round, even under the assumption that the rest of examinees were disease free, an <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratio</b> of 12 has already been observed (95 % CI = 5. 1, 23). Conclusions: An excess of thyroid cancer has been detected by ultrasound among children and adolescents in Fukushima Prefecture within 4 years of the release, and is unlikely to be explained by a screening surge...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Incidence</b> <b>rates</b> {{for many}} cancers are lower in India than in Britain {{and it is}} {{therefore}} of interest to compare rates in British Indians to British whites, {{as well as to}} rates in India. We present estimates for Leicester, which has the largest population of Indian origin in Britain, and also has virtually complete, self-assigned, ethnicity data. METHODS: We obtained data on all cancer registrations from 2001 to 2006 for Leicester with ethnicity data obtained by linkage to the Hospital Episode Statistics database. Age-standardised <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated for British Indians and British whites as well as <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratios,</b> adjusted for age and income. RESULTS: <b>Incidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>ratios</b> for British Indians compared with British whites were significantly less than 1. 0 for all cancers combined (0. 65) and for cancer of the breast (0. 72), prostate (0. 76), colon (0. 46), lung (0. 30), kidney (0. 36), stomach (0. 54), bladder (0. 48) and oesophagus (0. 64), but higher than 1. 0 for liver cancer (1. 95). CONCLUSION: These results are likely to be the most accurate estimate of cancer incidence in British Indians to date and confirm that cancer incidence in British Indians is lower than in British whites in Leicester, particularly for cancer of the breast, prostate, colon and lung (and other smoking-related cancers), but much higher than in India...|$|R
