This results in it always keeping nearly the same <b>face</b> <b>turned</b> towards Earth.

Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow {{at the foot of the}} mast; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures.|$|E
5|$|Interest in Etty {{declined}} {{after his}} death as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Very few subsequent artists have been influenced by Etty, and one of the few later works on which Candaules can be considered an influence is The Knight Errant, painted by John Everett Millais in 1870, which in its depiction of a rape victim, distraught and with her <b>face</b> <b>turned</b> away from the viewer, was a return to the style developed by Etty in Candaules of forcing the viewer to feel complicity in witnessing the sexual degradation of a woman, and which drew similar criticism.|$|E
40|$|Duane’s {{retraction}} syndrome (DRS) type I {{is often}} associated with esotropia (ET) and <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> in those with fusion. This study was designed to delineate the quantitative relationship between the angles of eye deviation with that of <b>face</b> <b>turn.</b> Ten patients with DRS type I with ET and <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> toward the deviated eye, who had central fixation, were chosen. Esodeviation was measured by alternate prism-cover test, and the angle of <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> was measured by an orthopedic protractor in degree and then converted to prism diopter. The subtraction of eye deviation from <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> showed 2. 4 prism diopters of <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> underestimation in comparison with esodevition, which is so small that deviations of eye and face may be considered virtually equal...|$|R

5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her <b>face</b> <b>turned</b> towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely <b>face</b> <b>turned</b> sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E

Presto drops his hat, and when he grabs the wizard hat, he accidentally strips his slacks down to underwear, to Alec's amusement.|$|E

According to one American press report, when departing the Gare du Nord in Paris in May 1890, Albert Victor was cheered by a waiting crowd of English, but hissed and catcalled by some of the French; one journalist present asked him if he would comment [...] "as to the cause of his sudden departure from England".

500|$|A {{turning point}} came on 2 November. Air {{pollution}} in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses such as Thomas had. By {{the end of}} the month over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog. On 3 November, Thomas spent most of the day in bed drinking. He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments. After returning to the hotel he went out again for a drink at 2am. After drinking at the White Horse, a pub he had found through Scottish poet Ruthven Todd, Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea, declaring, [...] "I've had 18 straight whiskies. I think that's the record!" [...] The barman, and the owner of the pub who served him, later commented that Thomas could not have imbibed more than half that amount. Thomas had an appointment at a clam house in New Jersey with Todd on 4 November. When phoned at the Chelsea that morning, he said he was feeling ill and postponed the engagement. Later he went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and, feeling sick again, returned to the hotel. Feltenstein came to see him three times that day, administering the steroid ACTH by injection and, on his third visit, half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of morphine sulphate, which affected his breathing. Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice. He suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11pm. At midnight on 5 November Thomas's breathing became more difficult and his <b>face</b> <b>turned</b> blue. An ambulance was summoned.|$|E

She also claimed to have never met six of the victims buried at Cromwell Street, and to recall very little of her assault on Caroline Owens.

2500|$|Case 8. This case {{illustrates}} {{that children with}} Panayiotopoulos syndrome may be misdiagnosed and treated for encephalitis. This boy had a first seizure at age 4 years and 2 months. Whilst sleeping in his mother’s lap, he suddenly vomited. Then his eyes stared into the space upwards, his head deviated to the right, his <b>face</b> <b>turned</b> green and he became incontinent of urine and faeces. The seizure lasted for 15 min {{and there were no}} convulsions. Abdominal ultrasound performed because of the vomiting was normal. A second seizure occurred 16 months later at age 5 years and 6 months. At around 10 in the morning he walked into lounge looking pale and irritable. He fell to the floor and developed writhing movements, shaking arms and legs, hypersalivation and incontinence of urine. Convulsions stopped 15 min later with rectal diazepam. He recovered but remained very sleepy. He was febrile ~38.5°C. He was treated in a major teaching hospital with triple therapy for suspected encephalitis but in the third day after admission this was stopped and he was discharged home. Brain CT scan, EEG and CSF were normal. [...] Subsequent EEGs showed infrequent occipital and frontal spikes. [...] At follow-up aged 7, he was normal and had experienced no further seizures.|$|E
2500|$|Churchill claimed, {{perhaps not}} {{directly}} discussing himself, that [...] "ometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment {{has been of}} some assistance in securing {{the attention of the}} audience..."

His secretary Phyllis Moir commented that [...] "Winston Churchill was born and grew up with a stutter" [...] in her 1941 book I was Winston Churchill's Private Secretary. She also noted about one incident [...] "It’s s s simply s s splendid" [...] he stuttered, as he always did when excited." [...] Louis J. Alber, who helped to arrange a lecture tour of the United States, wrote in Volume 55 of The American Mercury (1942) that [...] "Churchill struggled to express his feelings but his stutter caught him in the throat and his <b>face</b> <b>turned</b> purple" [...] and that [...] "born with a stutter and a lisp, both caused in large measure by a defect in his palate, Churchill was at first seriously hampered in his public speaking.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} is an {{experimental}} investigation on the machinability of AISI 51100 and AISI 52100 steels (whose chemical compositions slightly differ) by <b>face</b> <b>turning</b> method. The <b>face</b> <b>turning</b> method makes use of cylindrical shaped steel specimen as a test piece and a triangular P- 30 insert as a cutting tool for testing the machinability. The effectiveness of this method is assessed by studying: the cutting time required for the tool to reach flank wear up to 0. 3 mm (tool life criterion); tool wear development and wear mechanisms involved in machining; tool life studies; and surface roughness investigations of the machined surfaces. These aspects are further tested and verified for its repeatability and reproducibility. The tests are being carried according {{to some of the}} indicated in the international standards,ISO 3685 : 1993 (E) and American Foundry Society standard machinability tests. The results presented here demonstrate the ability of the <b>face</b> <b>turning</b> method: to evaluate the tool wear development and tool life; to investigate surface integrity due to tool wear; and to differentiate very clearly the machinability of steels under con- sideration. The <b>face</b> <b>turning</b> method used here is simple and effective...|$|R
