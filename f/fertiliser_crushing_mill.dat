5000|$|In the 1990s, a new <b>crusher</b> <b>mill</b> {{was built}} at the Magma Robinson mine {{for the purpose of}} re-processing all of the waste piles onsite, as well as to process new ore.The crusher was atop a slurry process lagoon that allowed these years old waste piles to be {{processed}} to extact: Gold, Silver, Copper, Vanadium, and Tantalum; at one time and in one process. In the past, each metal extraction had required a separate process, and each waste pile exhibited metal ores that had not been extracted.Significant metals were extracted from these waste piles. This <b>crusher</b> <b>mill</b> and processing building were built by TIC - The Industrial Company of Steamboat Springs Colorado.|$|R
50|$|Lower-grade {{sources of}} iron ore {{generally}} require beneficiation, using techniques like <b>crushing,</b> <b>milling,</b> gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation {{to improve the}} concentration of the ore and remove impurities.

40|$|In this work, an {{overview}} of industrial employees’ noise exposure level in five selected processing and manufacturing industries in Ilorin are evaluated and compared. Emphasis is given to noise emitted by individual industrial machinery from the selected industries. Event LAeq and LN cycle were studied to identify the noisy machines and to generate baseline data.

50|$|The Yeppoon Sugar Company was {{the brainchild}} of William Broome who had {{property}} a few kilometres north of Yeppoon. Needing investors, he floated the company in 1883, and a <b>crushing</b> <b>mill</b> was subsequently built at Farnborough. The mill relied on other people to do the growing, but sugar was a premium commodity of the day, and landowners followed Broome's lead. Soon there were sugar cane plantations at Farnborough, Cawarral, and Joskeleigh.|$|R
50|$|Six-column engines {{were most}} popular {{for the smaller}} sizes of engine. They were all {{rotative}} beam engines, with a flywheel and rotating output shaft. These were used to drive machinery, as diverse as sugar cane <b>crushing</b> <b>mills,</b> winding engines in coal mines and sawmills. Many beam engines, working into the late 20th century, were non-rotative and drove vertical water pumps directly. These {{did not use the}} six column layout.|$|R

50|$|From 2004 to 2008 TVIRD {{operated}} an {{open pit}} mine, milling and processing operation producing {{gold and silver}} doré from the Gossan ore deposit. Over that period the operation produced {{in the order of}} 100,000 oz of gold (Au) and 1,700 oz of silver (Ag). The mill process consisted of <b>crushing,</b> <b>milling</b> and processing of mined ore. A hybrid process consisting of a Merrill-Crowe and Carbon in Leach circuit was used for the recovery of gold and silver.|$|R

30|$|The {{particle}} {{sizes of}} acetylated and unmodified wood meals differed by pulverization time and/or AA amount used. Clumps of wood meal due to plasticization {{were found in}} acetylated wood meals with more than 28  % WPG when they were subjected to elevated temperatures and pressures due to frictional heat and impact strength. Therefore, acetylated wood meals with 28.0 and 35.5  % WPG were crushed for 10  s using a <b>crush</b> <b>mill</b> (WDL- 1, Osaka Chemical Co. Ltd., Osaka) before test.|$|R
50|$|In 1865 {{the sugar}} {{plantation}} at Ormiston {{was the largest}} in Queensland. From September 1867 Hope was employing South Pacific islanders in his canefields, and producing 50-60 tons of sugar in a season. Most of this {{went directly to the}} station trade rather than to merchants in Brisbane. In 1869 the mill and a distillery were in active operation, with Hope both buying cane from smaller growers and operating the plant as a central <b>crushing</b> <b>mill</b> on the half-produce principle.|$|R

5000|$|In 1890 {{the first}} sugar cane <b>crushing</b> <b>mill</b> in the Isis {{district}} was established at Doolbi. The mill produced juice, {{which was then}} taken to Yengarie for processing into sugar. In 1900, the Doolbi mill was upgraded to produce sugar. As more sugar mills opened in the district, {{there was not enough}} cane to keep them all profitable and the Doolbi mill closed in 1924. The mill was in the south-western corner of the present Isis Golf Course (...) and an old brick chimney is still visible.|$|R
5000|$|Farquhar, {{like most}} of the Woongarra farmers, barely made a living from maize growing. Although the soil was good and two crops per year could be obtained, the inundations of pests and disease, the expense and {{difficulties}} of transport, and the lack of a strong market, combined to erode farmers' profits. However, in the early 1880s the district was transformed following the construction of the Millaquin Sugar Refinery (1880-82) and the establishment of a viable sugar industry in the area. Small crushing or [...] "juice" [...] mills were erected on farms throughout the Woongarra, and the juice piped directly to the refinery, or if along the Burnett River, transported by punt. In the period 1882-84, 24 <b>crushing</b> <b>mills</b> were established in the Bundaberg district, most of them in the Woongarra Shire. By October 1882, when the Millaquin refinery went into production, <b>crushing</b> <b>mills</b> were operating at Ashgrove, Avoca, Fairymead, Glenmorris, Grange, Kepnock, Mabbro, Summerville, Windermere and Woodbine plantations. Seaview, Mon Repos and Sunnyside Plantations were established in 1884. Woodlands followed soon after. Sugar was embraced wholeheartedly by the Woongarra farmers, particularly when they could obtain cheap indentured labour from the South Sea Islands to help clear the scrub and work the cane fields.|$|R
50|$|The {{coming of}} the railway not only {{promoted}} {{the development of the}} town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst {{for the establishment of a}} sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double <b>crushing</b> juice <b>mill</b> at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis district. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central <b>crushing</b> <b>mill</b> in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district.|$|R
40|$|Many {{industrial}} applications require rotating electric drives. These drives are normally capable of speed control and often require an equipment {{to attain a}} versatile and smooth speed control {{and to make the}} motor to operate on a desired specific speed torque characteristic.

Also, it must necessarily have a precise speed control of speed for application to a particular job i. e. for <b>crushing</b> <b>mill</b> in sugar industry...|$|R
50|$|Maryborough Sugar Factory, in Kent Street was {{established}} in 1956. There were many smaller sugar mills which were established by sugar cane farmers along the Mary River.
