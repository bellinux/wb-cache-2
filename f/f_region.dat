50|$|The <b>F</b> <b>region</b> of the {{ionosphere}} {{is home to}} the F {{layer of}} ionization, also called the Appleton-Barnett layer, after the English physicist Edward Appleton and New Zealander Miles Barnett. As with other ionospheric sectors, 'layer' implies a concentration of plasma, while 'region' is the volume that contains the said layer. The <b>F</b> <b>region</b> contains ionized gases at a height of around 150-800 km above sea level, placing it in the Earth’s thermosphere, a hot region in the upper atmosphere, and also in the heterosphere, where chemical composition varies with height.

40|$|Since 2004, {{observations}} of Saturn's F ring {{have revealed that}} the ring's core is surrounded by structures with radial scales of hundreds of kilometers, called "spirals" and "jets". Gravitational scattering by nearby moons was suggested as a potential production mechanism; however, it remained doubtful because a population of Prometheus-mass moons is needed and, obviously, such a population {{does not exist in}} the <b>F</b> ring <b>region.</b> We investigate here another mechanism: dissipative physical collisions of kilometer-size moonlets (or clumps) with the F-ring core. We show that it is a viable and efficient mechanism for producing spirals and jets, provided that massive moonlets are embedded in the F-ring core and that they are impacted by loose clumps orbiting in the <b>F</b> ring <b>region,</b> which could be consistent with recent data from ISS, VIMS and UVIS.

50|$|The main radar {{operates}} in mainly two modes: (1) incoherent scatter radar (ISR) mode, and (2) coherent scatter (CSR) mode. In the ISR mode using the high power transmitter, Jicamarca measures the electron density, electron and ion temperature, ion composition and vertical and zonal electric {{fields in the}} equatorial ionosphere. Given its location and frequency of operation, Jicamarca has the unique capability of measuring the absolute electron density via Faraday rotation, and the most precise ionospheric electric fields by pointing the beam perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field. In the CSR mode the radar measures the echoes that are more than 30 dB stronger than the ISR echoes. These echoes come from equatorial irregularities generated in troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, equatorial electrojet, E and <b>F</b> <b>region.</b> Given {{the strength of the}} echoes, usually low power transmitters and/or smaller antenna sections are used.|$|E
50|$|Turbulence {{causes the}} air within the lower {{atmospheric}} regions below the turbopause at about 110 km to be {{a mixture of}} gases that does not change its composition. Its mean molecular weight is 29 g/mol with molecular oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) as the two dominant constituents. Above the turbopause, however, diffusive separation of the various constituents is significant, so that each constituent follows its own barometric height structure with a scale height inversely proportional to its molecular weight. The lighter constituents atomic oxygen (O), helium (He), and hydrogen (H) successively dominate above about 200 km altitude and vary with geographic location, time, and solar activity. The ratioN2/O which {{is a measure of}} the electron density at the ionospheric <b>F</b> <b>region</b> is highly affected by these variations.
