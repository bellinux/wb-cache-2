The Department of State (State) faces an ongoing challenge of ensuring it has the right people, with the right skills, in the right places overseas to carry out the department's priorities. In particular, State has long had difficulty staffing its <b>hardship</b> <b>posts</b> overseas, which are places like Beruit and Lagos, where conditions are difficult and sometimes dangerous due to harsh environmental and extreme living conditions that often entail pervasive crime or war, but are nonetheless integral to foreign policy priorities and need a full complement of qualified staff.

40|$|Diplomats spend {{four years}} at a time abroad in South Africa's foreign missions, and after a home posting to Pretoria, {{typically}} lasting two years, they leave again. Children attend international schools. Thus diplomatic families have to adjust to a lifestyle of change and discontinuity, foreign cultures and unknown environments. The extent of this adjustment seems underrated and misunderstood. Since 1994 the number of missions abroad has doubled {{and most of the}} new missions are in the third world, hence the focus on hardship postings. In this narrative research, interviews were conducted with diplomatic families in several <b>hardship</b> <b>posts.</b> The aim was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the process of adjustment based on first hand information. Adjustment is described as a complex unfolding narrative with regressive as well as progressive story lines. The first stage lasting up to six months is seen as regressive, since the person is further removed from his goal of adjustment than at arrival. The rest of the stay is largely progressive if adjustment is seen as "being settled in a familiar routine". Regressive elements refer to environmental restrictions. Findings include a description of an ideal couple for the foreign service; a need for effective preparation for a posting is confirmed; a changed relationship between Head Office and an official when abroad; diffuse identity among adolescents who spend formative years abroad, resulting in poorly understood adjustment problems on reentry; importance of attending to the soft issues of relocation instead of focusing on financial compensation.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses the U. S. Department of State's (State) efforts to train its personnel. It is based on our report, which is being released today. Because State is the lead U. S. foreign affairs agency, its personnel require certain knowledge, skills, and abilities to equip them to address the global security threats and challenges facing the United States [...] including the threat of Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, HIV/AIDS and other pandemics, environmental degradation, nuclear proliferation, and failed states. In fiscal years 2006 through 2010, State's funding for training personnel grew by about 62 percent, and the department requested more than $ 266 million in fiscal year 2011 for programs providing training in professional skills such as foreign language proficiency, area studies, information technology, consular duties, and others needed {{for the conduct of}} foreign relations. State's Foreign Service Institute (FSI) is the primary training provider for the department's more than 66, 000 Foreign Service, civil service, and locally employed staff worldwide. Our prior work has identified staffing and foreign language shortfalls at State, including challenges the department has faced in filling positions at the mid-level in particular, and in attracting qualified personnel for some <b>hardship</b> <b>posts.</b> The department is currently in the midst of what it has called the most challenging military-to-civilian transition in U.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) of 1990 established locality pay to achieve pay comparability between federal and nonfederal jobs within the United States. Because FEPCA established pay localities only for areas within the United States, federal employees permanently stationed overseas, including members of the Foreign Service, did not receive locality pay. As the Washington, D. C., locality rate grew to over 24 percent in 2010, the pay gap between federal employees who receive locality pay {{and those who do}} not widened considerably. To close this gap, the fiscal year 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act granted the Department of State (State) temporary authority to provide locality pay at the Washington, D. C., rate, also known as Overseas Comparability Pay, to Foreign Service personnel posted overseas. State is implementing this pay in three phases. Currently, Foreign Service personnel serving overseas receive 16. 52 percent comparability pay, approximately twothirds of the Washington, D. C., locality rate. State had planned to implement the third and final phase of comparability pay, raising it to 24. 22 percent, in August 2011. However, these plans have been delayed by the administration's freeze on federal salaries and the passage of the Department of Defense and Full Year Continuing Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2011, which prohibited State from using funds to implement the final phase. In December 2010, the National Commission of Fiscal Responsibility and Reform identified comparability pay as a potential source of cost savings. Without a continuation of authority, State cannot continue to provide comparability pay with funds appropriated after fiscal year 2011. State estimates that the cost of implementing all three phases of comparability pay for State would be $ 302 million in fiscal year 2012. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that implementing comparability pay for all foreign affairs agencies would cost about $ 2 billion through fiscal year 2015. In a previous report, we found that State faces challenges filling staffing gaps at <b>hardship</b> <b>posts</b> overseas and cited State officials' claims that the lack of comparability pay may be a deterrent to serving at overseas posts. Congress asked us to review State's request for permanent authority to grant overseas comparability pay to certain members of the Foreign Service posted overseas to inform the fiscal year 2012 State Department authorization process. On May 27, 2011, we provided a briefing to Congressional staff on our preliminary findings. We also agreed to provide the information presented in the briefing, updated with additional material, which describes (1) State's rationale for providing overseas comparability pay, (2) how the provision of overseas comparability pay affects Foreign Service personnel pay and benefits, and (3) how the pay and benefits of Foreign Service personnel posted overseas compare with those of other civilian agency staff overseas. ...|$|R

Under the guise of “security,” no Panamanian man or woman was permitted employment in positions other than as domestic help, or to reside within the ten mile wide strip of land that split the country from ocean to ocean.

40|$|The Hardship Post: Poems, {{a poetry}} {{collection}} by Jehanne Dubrow, uses personal experience to meditate on the slipperiness of identity. The daughter of U.

The <b>Hardship</b> <b>Post</b> centers on experimentation with traditional forms. Following WWII, Polish poets such as Czes 2 ̆ 6 lstrok;aw Mi 2 ̆ 6 lstrok;osz rejected Romantic, formal verse, believing that such poetry did not reflect the horrors of genocide. Here, Dubrow employs sonnets, villanelles, and rhymed couplets to ask whether received forms might not still have meaning “after Auschwitz. ” Through a combination of narrative and lyric poems, she addresses the antisemitism of communist-era Poland, the impact of the Shoah, and the challenges of Diaspora Judaism. A scholarly introduction, “Milktongue and Poetic Witness: Notes Toward Feeling and Conscience in The Hardship Post,” draws on essays by poets Donald Hall and Czes 2 ̆ 6 lstrok;aw Mi 2 ̆ 6 lstrok;osz to discuss the intersection of the personal and political in Dubrow’s work. By connecting her own poetry to that of other American poets, including Alicia Ostriker, Robert Pinsky, and Marilyn Hacker, Dubrow places The <b>Hardship</b> <b>Post</b> within a Jewish literary tradition of political consciousness, displacement, and loss. ...|$|E
