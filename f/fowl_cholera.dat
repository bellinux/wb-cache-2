5000|$|P. multocida {{causes a}} range of {{diseases}} in wild and domesticated animals, as well as humans. The bacterium {{can be found in}} birds, cats, dogs, rabbits, cattle, and pigs. In birds, P. multocida causes avian or <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera</b> disease; a significant disease present in commercial and domestic poultry flocks worldwide, particularly layer flocks and parent breeder flocks. P. multocida strains that cause <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera</b> in poultry typically belong to the serovars 1, 3, and 4. In the wild, <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera</b> has been shown to follow bird migration routes, especially of snow geese. The P. multocida serotype-1 is most associated with avian cholera in North America, but the bacterium does not linger in wetlands for extended periods of time. [...] P. multocida causes atrophic rhinitis in pigs; it also can cause pneumonia or bovine respiratory disease in cattle. [...] In humans, P. multocida is {{the most common cause of}} infection from wound infections after dog or cat bites. The infection usually shows as soft tissue inflammation within 24 hours. High leukocyte and neutrophil counts are typically observed, leading to an inflammatory reaction at the infection site (generally a diffuse, localized cellulitis). [...] It can also infect other locales, such as the respiratory tract, and is known to cause regional lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph nodes). In more serious cases, a bacteremia can result, causing an osteomyelitis or endocarditis. The bacteria may also cross the blood-brain barrier and cause meningitis.|$|E

50|$|The {{field of}} {{bacteriology}} (later a subdiscipline of microbiology) {{was founded in}} the 19th century by Ferdinand Cohn, a botanist whose studies on algae and photosynthetic bacteria led him to describe several bacteria including Bacillus and Beggiatoa.

Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch were contemporaries of Cohn’s and are often considered to be the father of microbiology and medical microbiology, respectively. Pasteur is most famous for his series of experiments designed to disprove the then widely held theory of spontaneous generation, thereby solidifying microbiology’s identity as a biological science. One of his students, Adrien Certes, is considered the founder of marine microbiology. Pasteur also designed methods for food preservation (pasteurization) and vaccines against several diseases such as anthrax, <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera</b> and rabies. Koch {{is best known for his}} contributions to the germ theory of disease, proving that specific diseases were caused by specific pathogenic micro-organisms. He developed a series of criteria that have become known as the Koch's postulates.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{a strong}} need for a {{recombinant}} subunit vaccine against <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera.</b> We used a reverse vaccinology approach to identify putative secreted or cell surface associated P. multocida proteins that may represent potential vaccine candidate antigens. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A high-throughput cloning and expression protocol was used to express and purify 71 recombinant proteins for vaccine trials. Of the 71 proteins tested, only one, PlpE in denatured insoluble form, protected chickens against <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera</b> challenge. PlpE also elicited comparable levels of protection in mice. PlpE was localized by immunofluorescence to the bacterial cell surface, consistent with its ability to elicit a protective immune response. To explore the role of PlpE during infection and immunity, a plpE mutant was generated. The plpE mutant strain retained full virulence for mice. CONCLUSION: These studies show that PlpE is a surface exposed protein and was the only protein of 71 tested that was able to elicit a protective immune response. However, PlpE is not an essential virulence factor. This is the first report of a denatured recombinant protein stimulating protection against <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera...</b>|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} Pasteurella multocida causes <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera,</b> {{a highly}} contagious and severe disease in chicken and water fowls.

P. multocida was isolated from 25. 9 % of healthy looking ducks and 6. 2 % of chickens from free range family poultry farms and at slaughter slabs at marked. On experimental infection with 1. 2 – 2. 0 x 108 organisms of the P. multocida type strain (NCTC 10322 T), 12 week-old chickens expressed <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera</b> clinical signs significantly more times (372) than those of 4, 8 and 16 week chicken (173, 272, 187) and more signs were severe. In family ducks the 8 week-old birds expressed clinical signs significantly more times (188) than those of other age groups (117, 80, and 83) and severe signs were more frequent. P. multocida transmitted from seeder birds (n= 12) to sentinel birds (n= 30), which developed clinical signs, {{and in some cases}} lesions of <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera</b> and allowed bacterial re-isolation, whether infected ducks served as seeder for chicken or chicken served as seeder for ducks. This study has documented the occurrence of P. multocida among healthy-appearing family poultry in tropical setting, and demonstrated that age susceptibility is highest in 12 week old family chicken and 8 week old family ducks when challenged with a low virulent strain of P. multocida.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{economic}} important diseases of poultry worldwide is <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera,</b> caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida. Studies on free range layer and organic broiler cases have shown that these outbreaks of <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera</b> are caused by a single genotypic type of P. multocida, with the same strain causing outbreaks at different time periods.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to isolate and identify Pasteurella multocida from <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera</b> (FC) suspected chicken, and to prepare and efficacy determination of formalin killed <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera</b> vaccine using the isolated P. multocida strain. Materials and methods: A total of five suspected dead chickens were collected from Brothers Poultry Farm located at Gazipur district, Bangladesh. The samples were processed and the P. multocida was isolated through conventional bacteriological techniques, were finally confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using P. multocida specific primers targeting cap gene. The P. multocida isolate was used to develop a formalin killed <b>fowl</b> <b>cholera</b> vaccine. The efficacy of the newly prepared vaccine was determined in Starcross- 579 chickens (n= 30) aging 15 weeks either by injecting 1 mL (group-A; n= 10) or 0. 5 mL (group-B; n= 10) vaccine containing approximately 3. 2 x 108 CFU/mL P. multocida organism; 10 birds were kept as unvaccinated control. The sera from the vaccinated and control birds were collected and were subjected for antibody titre determination by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally the vaccinated birds were challenged using virulent strains of P. multocida to confer the protection against FC. Results: P. multocida could be isolated from both the samples. The formalin killed vaccine prepared from the isolated bacteria was subjected for the determination of antibody titre in chicken, and found that the antibody titres in the birds of group A and group B were 4. 513 and 4. 07 respectively after primary vaccination, and 4. 893 and 4. 37 respectively after booster vaccination. Most of the vaccinated birds were found to be survived after challenging with virulent strain of P. multocida. Conclusion: It is concluded that the causal agent of FC (P. multocida) was successfully isolated from FC affected dead chickens.
