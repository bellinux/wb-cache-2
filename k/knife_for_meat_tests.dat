Due to their special aggression, these combats can lead to severe injuries and even the death of bulls at great cost to the breeder.|$|R
40|$|Identification <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> <b>meat</b> {{species is}} of {{interest}} to regulatory bodies and cultural groups with special dietary requirements, e. g. Halal and Kosher foods. Current methodology <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> <b>meat</b> species is based on PCR assays; often followed by digestion with restriction enzymes to identify individual species [1, 2, 3]. These assays are time consuming and expensive to use as commercial test methods. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the feasibility of using a universal PCR primer set and real-time PCR to amplify a single product from meat species DNA; followed by a more recent method for sequence verification – high resolution melting analysis (HRMA) - to identify and distinguish between the different meat species. Results across multiple assays show the methodology can qualitatively identify and distinguish different meat species in both single species and mixed species samples. There is also potential to develop the assay system to quantitatively analyse mixed samples...|$|R

For vegetables, {{it is used}} to chop or thrust cut like a nakiri {{near the}} heel, to rock-chop stiffer produce in the belly, and to make fine cuts at the tip. <b>For</b> <b>meat,</b> {{it is used to}} saw back and forth for large cuts, to pull cut <b>for</b> softer <b>meats</b> and <b>for</b> a better surface finish, and to push cut <b>for</b> more sinewy <b>meat.</b> There is usually a slope from heel to tip which causes the wrist to point down and shoulder to raise up to make cuts. General size is 210 mm to 270 mm. 210 is more of a line knife size and most nimble, 240 is more of a general purpose size and allows more slicing, and 270 has more slicing power but is much more cumbersome, being the tallest and longest.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lyophilized {{meat powder}} with iron-fortified wheat flour {{can be used}} to produce an infant {{porridge}} with bioavailable iron, but its acceptability and safety are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acceptability and safety of porridges containing lyophilized meat powder and iron-fortified wheat flour. METHODS: Peruvian mothers' input was used to develop porridges without (no meat) and with meat powder (low or high chicken liver, low or high chicken thigh). Acceptability was determined by maternal hedonic scoring, 9 -day infant intake, and videotape analysis of how well infants liked each porridge. Dry and cooked porridges and <b>meat</b> ingredients were <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> microorganisms; <b>meats</b> were <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> pesticides. RESULTS: Mothers gave higher acceptability scores to the no-meat porridge, followed in order by low and high quantities of meat powder (e. g., mean +/- SD "taste"scores were 4. 5 +/- 0. 9 for the no-meat, 3. 7 +/- 1. 1 for the low-liver, and 3. 3 +/- 1. 1 for the high-liver porridges, p =. 0001). Infants' porridge intake did not differ: 61. 4 +/- 47. 1 g of no-meat, 62. 1 +/- 44. 9 g of low-thigh, and 67. 5 +/- 42. 0 g of low-liver (p =. 7), as supported by the video analysis. Microbiologic safety was acceptable except for marginally acceptable molds and yeasts in dry ingredients. No pesticide residues were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Despite mothers' clear preference for no-meat porridges, infants consumed equal amounts of porridges with and without meat. Thus, if mothers can be convinced to feed the meat-containing porridges to the infants despite their own preferences, the infants will consume these porridges. The mold and yeast content of the porridge ingredients must be reduced. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
