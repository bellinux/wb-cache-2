5000|$|The Allmusic review states, [...] "this quartet set for tenor saxophonist Benny Golson was the {{beginning}} of the close of an era.

5|$|As a {{young boy}} in India, Mercury {{received}} formal piano training up {{to the age of}} nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-oriented: his favourite artists at the time were The Who, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, and Led Zeppelin. He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments and from the early 1980s began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlisted Fred Mandel (a Canadian musician who also worked for Pink Floyd, Elton John and Supertramp) for his first solo project, and from 1985 onward collaborated with Mike Moran (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio)</b> <b>and</b> Spike Edney (in concert).|$|E
5|$|Black Eye is {{the only}} {{full-length}} studio album by the English punk rock band Fluffy, released on September 17, 1996 by The Enclave. It was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>and</b> the music was not arranged by the producer {{in order to achieve}} a rough, live sound. The record contains loud punk songs that explore social issues such as sex and abuse.|$|E
5|$|I went to New York {{and we were}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>and</b> came to a break. I {{was sitting}} at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
50|$|Curzon was {{a highly}} self-critical performer, and {{although}} he signed for the Decca recording company in 1937 and remained with them throughout his career, he was rarely at ease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studios,</b> <b>and</b> frequently refused to allow the release of recordings in which he felt dissatisfied with his performance.|$|R

5|$|Shooting of {{the film}} began on May 13, 1957, with the newly created choreography. Presley's {{characteristic}} hairstyle and sideburns were covered with a wig and makeup for the scenes in musical number and those set in the jail. During the performance, one of Presley's dental caps fell out and became lodged in his lung. He {{was taken to the}} Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, where he spent the night after the cap was removed. Shooting was resumed the next day. Throughout the film, Presley mimed the songs, which had been previously recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>and</b> were added to the finished scenes.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles' last {{concert was}} at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, on 29 August 1966, but Evans {{continued}} {{to work for them}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio,</b> <b>and</b> to run errands. After recording Revolver in 1966, McCartney went by himself on holiday to France, but asked to meet Evans in Bordeaux, at the Grosse Horloge church (on the corner of cours Victor Hugo and rue St. James). At exactly the pre-arranged time of one o'clock, Evans was standing under the church clock when McCartney arrived. They then drove to Madrid together, but after feeling bored, McCartney phoned Epstein's office in London and asked to be booked on a safari holiday in Kenya. When they arrived they visited the Amboseli Reserve at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro, and also stayed at the exclusive Treetops Hotel, where the rooms are built on the branches of trees.|$|E
5|$|They started {{recording}} Astraea in June at James Spence's {{house in}} Nottingham. They {{were forced into}} this situation as Sanderson's recording studio was taken from him through a contractual issue on the building with the landlord. The recording process was different from previous albums as {{there was a lot}} of production and pre-production involved. Sanderson would come to the practice sessions of the bands and make suggestions to the songs and then they would go to record it. The album took three months to record because of band member's personal commitments, this to James Spence had a positive effect as the members took their time with the music, believing the album was more “produced” than previous efforts. James believed Rolo Tomassi had much more of an opportunity to experiment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>and</b> try things they had never tried before. However, James had commented that the recording of the album in his house revealed to be a stressful decision. An example of this was were his basement- where all the recording equipment was- flooded due to heavy rainfall. Although nothing got damaged, stagnant water remained and they had to move the guitar cab to his bedroom. They recorded the drums upstairs at The Bodega in Nottingham then Rolo Tomassi then went to James and Eva Spence's parents house record the vocals, keyboard and pianos.|$|E

25|$|Much more {{disastrous}} {{for his life}} than the fire was the death of Anna from a kidney disorder in 1925 just six months after, and precipitated by, {{the birth of their}} son, Josef Ferdinand Ignác.
