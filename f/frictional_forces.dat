Understanding of the influencing factors about <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> is essential for the design of miniaturized devices and the use of minimal friction force. In the paper, dimensional analysis is used to analysis factors relative to <b>frictional</b> <b>force.</b> We show that the <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> scales with where A is the contact area and N is the normal contact force.

25|$|The {{work done}} by {{friction}} can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials {{such as in the}} process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (fretting) exacerbates wear of <b>frictional</b> <b>forces.</b> Bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, fit and surface finish of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.|$|E
25|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to adopt air cushion technology for use in fixed track systems, in order to utilize the lower <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> for delivering high speeds. The most advanced example of this was the Aérotrain, an experimental high speed hovertrain built and operated in France between 1965 and 1977. The project was abandoned in 1977 due to lack of funding, the death of its lead engineer and the adoption of the TGV by the French government as its high-speed ground transport solution.|$|E

25|$|Viscosity is {{associated}} with the <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> in a flow. In some flow fields, viscous effects are very small, and approximate solutions may safely neglect viscous effects. These approximations are called inviscid flows. Flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows. Finally, aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment. External aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes (e.g. around an airplane wing), while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects (e.g. through a jet engine).|$|E
25|$|An {{accretion}} disk is a structure (often a circumstellar disk) formed by diffused material in orbital motion around a massive central body. The central body is typically a star. Friction causes orbiting {{material in the}} disk to spiral inward towards the central body. Gravitational and <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> compress and raise {{the temperature of the}} material, causing the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The frequency range of that radiation depends on the central object's mass. Accretion disks of young stars and protostars radiate in the infrared; those around neutron stars and black holes in the X-ray part of the spectrum. The study of oscillation modes in {{accretion disk}}s is referred to as diskoseismology.|$|E
25|$|Thread forming is {{performed}} using a , or , which closely resembles a cutting tap without the flutes. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need}} to periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in a cutting tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to tap with a cutting tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Note that the tap drill size differs from that used for a cutting tap and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|E

40|$|Static {{and dynamic}} {{frictional}} phenomena at the interface with random impurities are investigated in a two-chain model with incommensurate structure.

It is confirmed that the static <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> is always finite in the presence of impurities, in contrast to the impurity-free system. The nature of impurity pinning is discussed in connection with that in density waves. The kinetic <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> of a steady sliding state is also investigated numerically.

25|$|Upon {{impacting}} the ground, some translational {{kinetic energy}} {{can be converted}} to rotational kinetic energy and vice-versa depending on the ball's impact angle and angular velocity. If the ball moves horizontally at impact, friction will have a 'translational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's motion. In the figure, the ball is moving to the right, and thus it will have a translational component of friction pushing the ball to the left. Additionally, if the ball is spinning at impact, friction will have a 'rotational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's rotation. On the figure, the ball is spinning clockwise, and the point impacting the ground is moving to the left with respect to the ball's center of mass. The rotational component of friction is therefore pushing the ball to the right. Unlike the normal force and the force of gravity, these <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> will exert a torque on the ball, and change its angular velocity (omega&).|$|E
25|$|Direct {{extrusion}}, {{also known}} as forward extrusion, {{is the most common}} extrusion process. It works by placing the billet in a heavy walled container. The billet is pushed through the die by a ram or screw. There is a reusable dummy block between the ram and the billet to keep them separated. The major disadvantage of this process is that the force required to extrude the billet is greater than that needed in the indirect extrusion process because of the <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> introduced by the need for the billet to travel {{the entire length of the}} container. Because of this the greatest force required is at the beginning of process and slowly decreases as the billet is used up. At the end of the billet the force greatly increases because the billet is thin and the material must flow radially to exit the die. The end of the billet (called the butt end) is not used for this reason.|$|E
2500|$|In {{indirect}} extrusion, {{also known}} as backwards extrusion, the billet and container move together while the die is stationary. The die is {{held in place by}} a [...] "stem" [...] which has to be longer than the container length. The maximum length of the extrusion is ultimately dictated by the column strength of the stem. Because the billet moves with the container the <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> are eliminated. This leads to the following advantages: ...|$|E

2500|$|Conservation of momentum: In fluid dynamics, the {{mathematical}} formulation of this principle {{can be considered}} an application of Newton's Second Law. Momentum within a flow is only changed by the work performed on the system by external forces, which may include both surface forces, such as viscous (<b>frictional)</b> <b>forces,</b> and body forces, such as weight. [...] The momentum conservation principle may be expressed as either a vector equation or separated into a set of three scalar equations (x,y,z components). In its most complete form, the momentum conservation equations are known as the Navier-Stokes equations. [...] The Navier-Stokes equations have no known analytical solution and are solved in modern aerodynamics using computational techniques. Because of the computational cost of solving these complex equations, simplified expressions of momentum conservation may be appropriate for specific applications. The Euler equations are a set of momentum conservation equations which neglect viscous forces and {{may be used in}} cases where the effect of viscous forces is expected to be small. Additionally, Bernoulli's equation is a solution to the momentum conservation equation of an inviscid flow that neglects gravity.|$|E

Numerous other spectroscopic techniques are used such as Second-harmonic generation (SHG), Sum-frequency generation (SFG), Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), [...] as well as High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS).

STM {{has been able to}} help understand the mechanisms of SAM formation as well as determine the important structural features that lend SAMs their integrity as surface-stable entities. In particular STM can image the shape, spatial distribution, terminal groups and their packing structure. AFM offers an equally powerful tool without the requirement of the SAM being conducting or semi-conducting. AFM has been used to determine chemical functionality, conductance, magnetic properties, surface charge, and <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> of SAMs. More recently, however, diffractive methods have also been used. The structure can be used to characterize the kinetics and defects found on the monolayer surface.

2500|$|Under {{steady state}} flow {{conditions}} (e.g. no flood wave), {{open channel flow}} can be subdivided into three types of flow: uniform flow, gradually varying flow, and rapidly varying flow. [...] Uniform flow describes a situation where flow depth does not change with distance along the channel. [...] This can only occur in a smooth channel that does not experience any changes in flow, channel geometry, roughness or channel slope. [...] During uniform flow, the flow depth is known as normal depth (yn). [...] This depth {{is analogous to the}} terminal velocity of an object in free fall, where gravity and <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> are in balance (Moglen, 2013). [...] Typically, this depth is calculated using the Manning formula. [...] Gradually varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is very small. [...] In this case, hydrostatic relationships developed for uniform flow still apply. [...] Examples of this include the backwater behind an in-stream structure (e.g. dam, sluice gate, weir, etc.), when there is a constriction in the channel, and when there is a minor change in channel slope. [...] Rapidly varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is significant. In this case, hydrostatics relationships are not appropriate for analytical solutions, and continuity of momentum must be employed. [...] Examples of this include large changes in slope like a spillway, abrupt constriction/expansion of flow, or a hydraulic jump.|$|E
