40|$|At SSAB EMEA in Luleå {{steel is}} {{manufactured}} mainly based on pellets from LKAB, Malmberget {{but a small}} part is from Kiruna. But in the future, {{the majority of the}} pellets will come from Kiruna instead of Malmberget. What distinguishes these two kinds of pellets from each other is that the pellet from Kiruna has higher phosphorus content. Coal and coke used in smelting the pellets will also have a higher level of phosphorus. This will contribute that the phosphorus content in pig iron will rise which will make phosphorus removal at SSAB more difficult because the company doesn’t have a practice in dealing with the new amounts of phosphorus. A common knowledge is that a good refining of impurities is to a large part due of the slag. Therefor when it comes to improving dephosphorization there is a proposal to modify the slag slag benefiting removal of phosphor. This can be done by not adding <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> at LD converter. <b>Dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> is added today at SSAB to reduce the wear of the LD converter linings composed of MgO. MgO from the linings has a tendency to dissolve in the slag and a method to prevent this is to saturate the slag with MgO by the addition of <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime.</b> But the adding of <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> hastens the formation of tricalciumsilikates, 3 CaO·SiO 2 which inhibits the dissolve of lime. This thesis purpose was to investigate the <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> effect on dephosphorization by excluding it in the LD process. The goal with this work was to get a clear picture of the dephosphorization without the <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> and then based from this report develop a praxis for depshosphorization on steel grade that demands low phosphor. At SSAB a computer system is used to calculate a model on how the pig iron should be treated as for example how much lime and <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> must be added to reach the demands. During this thesis two different trials were done. The first trial in which <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> was removed from the computer system and the system calculated a model where the ordered requirements were met without adding <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime.</b> The second trail was with a controlled blowing in which certain parameters were established in advance, for example the amount lime and <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> in the reference samples and then the amount lime in the trial samples. During the trials there were a desire to see the phosphorus behaviour during the entire blow, so samples were taken during the blowing as well as after. The results showed that the removal of <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> at LD converter contributed to improved phosphorus distribution but a controlled blowing method must be developed for it to have a clear impact. It has also been shown that a high FeO content in slag, high basicity and a low steel temperature contributes to a good phosphorus removal. By the results there is a marginal improvement of the dephosphorization by removing the <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> in the blowing of the pig iron. But the improvement came with a relativity large distribution and a more designed method to blow the pig iron must be developed to see a clearer improvement. Validerat; 20120207 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|<b>Dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> mortars, {{widely used}} in {{historic}} construction and as repair mortars today, are distinguished by their high magnesium content {{as well as their}} high plasticity, water retention, and workability. However, the <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> creates a more complicated chemistry in the resulting mortar in which the magnesium and calcium compounds carbonate at different rates. Although portlandite readily carbonates to calcite, the carbonation of brucite is delayed and could result in a variety compounds in the cured mortar. The reaction of these magnesium compounds with acidic sulfates in the environment could lead to the formation of magnesium sulfate salts, which have the potential to deteriorate the mortar itself and surrounding materials. Mortar deterioration could also occur due to the dissolution of the magnesium compounds in the mortar and subsequent material losses. A series of experiments have been conducted that examine the carbonation of <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> mortars as well as {{the extent to which these}} mortars interact with acidic sulfates.

Diversos sistemas agrícolas alternativos têm sido desenvolvidos e, dentre eles, a agricultura orgânica tem recebido destaque, despertando interesse por parte dos agricultores. Compararam-se o sistema orgânico (SO) e o convencional (SC) de tomates da variedade Débora e Santa Clara, por meio de um estudo interdisciplinar. O experimento foi conduzido em blocos casualizados com seis repetições, com parcelas medindo 25 ´ 17 m, em um Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo distrófico. Todas as práticas culturais foram realizadas de acordo com as técnicas utilizadas pelos agricultores convencionais ou orgânicos da região. No SO a fertilização foi realizada aplicando, em cada cova, composto orgânico, superfosfato simples e calcário dolomítico (5 L, 60 g e 60 g) e pulverizando biofertilizante duas vezes por semana.

40|$|Introduction According to {{different}} paleontological and paleomagnetic studies, Iran {{was part of}} the Gondwana during the Permian. The Permian lithostratigraphic units in the Alborz-Azerbaijan are introduced as Doroud, Ruteh and Nesen Formations. The Ruteh Formation, the second depositional cycle of the Permian in the Alborz Basin, have been studied at two stratigraphic sections in the Central Alborz. The Sangsar section located on the south flank of the Central Alborz, 1 km northwest of Mahdishahr city and the Makaroud section located on the north flank of the Central Alborz, about 37 km south of Chalous city. The thickness of the Ruteh Formation at the Sangsar section is 106 m and at the Makaroud section is 222 m. At the Sangsar section the Ruteh Formation is underlain by the Doroud Formation with gradual contact and is overlain by a lateritic horizon. At the Makaroud section the Ruteh Formation disconformably overlies the Doroud Formation and the upper boundary is faulted and the Chalous Formation overlies the Ruteh Formation at this section. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analysis microfacies, interpret depositional environments and delineate relative sea level changes of the Ruteh Formation. Other researchers studied the Ruteh Formation at different sections in the Alborz Basin believe that the carbonate sediments of this formation have been deposited in a homoclinal carbonate ramp and consist of two-three 3 rd order depositional sequences. But no sedimentological studies have been done at the selected sections in this study.   Material & Methods Two stratigraphic sections of the Ruteh Formation have been selected, measuted and sampled. One hundred sixty three samples (fifty seven samples from Sangsar and one hundred six samples from Makaroud section)  were collected and thin sections were prepared from all samples. Afew samples were collected from lower and upper formations. Thin sections were stained with potassium ferricyanide and alizarin-red S solution according to Dickson (1965) method. The grain and matrix percentages were estimated using visual percentage charts of Bacelle and Bosellini (1965). Dunham (1962) classiﬁcation were used for carbonate facies nomenclature. Based on lithological and textural characteristics, fossil content, abiotic allochems, facies succession and their comparision with well studied environments by Flugel (2010), microfacies and their subenvironments have been identified. In this study investigation of relative sea level changes is on the basis of field observations and facies analysis. Based on the vertical succession of microfacies and sedimentary paleoenvironmental features, Systems tracts and sedimentary sequences have been recognized. Discussion of Results & Conclusions Field and petrographic studies at the Sangsar and Makaroud sections, indicate that the Ruteh Formation sediments consist of 19 carbonate microfacies and one siliciclastic petrofacies that during the Middle Permian times deposited in tidal flat to open marine facies belts of a bioclastic homoclinal carbonate ramp on the southern passive margin of the Paleotethys located on the northern Gondwana Supercontinent in a tropical region. Tidal flat facies belt includes: <b>Dolomitic</b> mudstone, <b>lime</b> mudstone to sandy lime mudstone, pelloid intraclast packstone and one quartzarenite siliciclastic petrofacies. Lagoon facies belt includes: bioclast mudstone, dasycladacea wackestone, foraminifera pelloid wackestone, bioclast pelloid wackestone,  bioclast tubiphytes wackestone, bioclast algal wackestone/packstone. Shoal facies belt includes: ooid pelloid packstone/grainstone, bioclast pelloid packstone/grainstone, pelloid bioclast grainstone and algal packstone/grainstone. Open marine facies belt includes: tubiphytes gymnocodiacea wackestone, gymnocodiacea packstone, bioclast gymnocodiacea wackestone, sponge spicule bioclast wackestone, crinoid mudstone/wackestone and bioclast mudstone.   The Ruteh Formation at both sections deposited mainly in inner ramp environment but thickness of the sediments deposited in open marine facies belt at the Sangsar section is more than the Makaroud section. The main sediments constituents including algae, foraminifera and metazoans show different distribution in the various subenvironments of the carbonate platform. This studies resulted in identifying two low rank sequences at the Sangsar section and three low rank sequences at the Makaroud section. Sequence boundaries are identified by disconformities, volcanics, paleosol horizons, emergence of tidal flat microfacies and microfacies that are indicative of maximum sea level fall in each sequence. The deepest microfacies are also regarded as maximum flooding surfaces. Deposits of the Ruteh Formation at both sections is part of the Transpecos Supercycle (Absaroka II Subsequence). The most deepening of the sea water occurs in the middle parts of the Ruteh Formation and general trend of the sea level changes in this formation is accordant with the global sea level changes during the Permian...|$|R

The {{three different}} powders of <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime,</b> calcium lactate, and calcium carbonate were used for these comparisons. These three powders were characterized into different flowability classes using the Jenike classification, wherein <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> falls into the cohesive range, calcium lactate falls into the free-flowing range, and calcium carbonate falls into the very cohesive range. Results showed that the best agreement between the testers was found with moderately cohesive powders such as <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime.</b> Furthermore, the free-flowing material tends to produce more consistent data between the three testers in terms of shear stresses and yield loci. It {{should be noted that the}} pre-shear data of free-flowing powder obtained by the Jenike shear cell must be appropriately interpreted. The largest differences between the testers are found with calcium carbonate, which is a highly compressible powder. The ways in which a high powder compressibility can differently affect the results obtained with the different testers were discussed...|$|E

A finely pulverized <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> {{was used as a}} reference. A total of 6. 3 t/ha of <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> and 7. 4 t/ha of sugar factory lime scum were employed. Two years after its incorporation into the soil the effects of the lime scum on the change cations were similar to those caused by the <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime.</b> Throughout six years and six crops it was observed how, in the plots amended with lime refuse, a slightly higher pH was maintained than that measured in the plots without lime, and with fewer fluctuations. Once the maximum pH value was reached in the treated plots, the rate of the pH decline was similar to the acidification process undergone by the soil in the con-trol plots and fitted the regression: pHw =- 0. 000435 * daa + 6. 93 where daa are the days after the application of the amendment. The recycling of sugar beet factory lime refuse as a liming material for acid soils was seen to be a valuable and efficient alternative to traditional limes and dolomites...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the potential for using hydrated lime to form protective matrices with oil-rich feeds, such as flaxseed, to increase the incorporation of omega- 3 fatty acids into meat. <b>Dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> is mixed with ground flaxseed, water is added, the mixture is blended in a high-speed turbulizer, and the resulting material is then dried to form a granular matrix. During the manufacturing process, {{a portion of the}} hydrated lime becomes recarbonated. This recarbonated matrix is ruminally stable, which prevents rumen microbes from converting polyunsaturated oils to saturated fats. Additional recarbonation occurs in the rumen due to exposure to high concentrations of carbon dioxide produced by rumen microbes, further stabilizing the matrix. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare feedlot performance and carcass characteristics of heifers and steers fed traditional finishing diets to those of cattle supplemented with encapsulated blends of ground flaxseed and <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> hydrate...|$|E
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1965. Bibliography: leaves [125]- 132. xiii, 140 l mounted illus. (part col.) tables (part fold.) While calcium {{has long}} been known as an {{essential}} macro-nutrient for plants, it has had the distinction of having been used as a soil ameliorating agent {{from the very beginning of}} organized soil husbandry (Thompson, 1957). Calcium is ascribed several roles in plant nutrition, among which is its role in the formation of cell wall constituents, that of nitrogen metabolism and as activator of several enzyme systems. (Meyer et al., 1960). Even so, Fried and Peech (1946) discussing calcium as a nutrient, carne to the conclusion that supplying calcium as such was not important, on the probable assumption that most well-cultivated agricultural soils have a sufficient supply of calcium for nutritional purposes. Thus, it is no surprise that most of the work done with calcium has been on its role as a soil ameliorating agent, or as a liming material on acid soils, for promoting the growth of certain crops. Under the general term of lime, many materials, such as calcium carbonate, hydrated <b>lime,</b> <b>dolomitic</b> limestone, silicic slags of various descriptions, crushed serpentine rocks, cement kiln dusts, etc., have been included. Numerous reasons have been adduced by several workers for the ameliorating effect of these soil amendments in relation to the growth of specific plants on these acid soils. Among these, some of the more important are: a) Promotion of more favorable soil physical conditions (Coleman et ~, 1958). b) Improvement in the fixation of nitrogen by improved soil microbial activity (Black, 1957). c) Beneficial effect of phosphorus release from the breakdown of organic phosphates (Ghani & Aleem, 1942). d) Reduction of phosphorus fixation in soils (Mitscherlich, 1947). e) Reduction of toxic levels of manganese and aluminum in soils (Mulder & Gerretsen, 1952). f) Increasing the general effectiveness of other elements (Truog, 1953). The literature also gives ample evidence of injury to crops due to overliming (Richardson, 1951; Russel, 1961). In tropical soils, while a great deal of research has been concentrated on the amelioration and utilization of leached-out acid soils, nevertheless many gaps as in a "jigsaw puzzle" yet remain to be filled. 111 is situation is best illustrated in the words of Schmehl et al., (1950) "... the poor plant growth associated with acid soils is a complex function of many contributing factors, all of which may be modified by liming. Not until the relative importance of the different beneficial effects of liming acid soils is fully evaluated will it be possible to make the most intelligent use of lime... " As for the research findings reported in this thesis, it must be pointed out that much work has already been done on the amelioration with lime of these Akaka soils (Monteith, 1961; King, 1961; Rixon, 1962; Clements, 1962, 1963; Reddy, 1964; Rana, 1964). The present work is thus an extension of the work already done, in which Akaka subsoil (2 - 5 feet depth) has been investigated. The main areas where the work to be reported here would contribute to additional. knowledge are: a) The laboratory study of the progressive dehydration of these soils from the state of field moistness to complete dryness, with respect to certain chemical, physical, as well as mineralogical changes. b) Use of these soils at three different moisture levels (moist, 50 % moist, dry) 1 for studying their response to liming. This is the first time that an intermediate moisture level has been investigated in fertility studies in these soils. c) An investigation concerning the physical mixing of the moist and dry soils in varying proportions with respect to response to lime and plant growth. d) The use of crushed Olivine Sand as a soil amendment, since this material is found occurring in abundance in the Hawaiian islands. It would prove to be an economic soil amendment if found efficacious. In addition to crushed Olivine sand, crushed coral rock and calcium silicate (TVA) was also investigated...|$|R

O trabalho objetivou (a) avaliar o crescimento e o estado nutricional de videiras jovens submetidas à aplicação de K calcários no solo (b) avaliar como a adubação potássica pode afetar a produção de uva, composição do mosto e alteração das formas de K no solo (c) avaliar o potencial de água em folhas, o estado nutricional e a composição do mosto, de videiras cultivadas com e sem irrigação. Foram realizados quatro estudos. Para avaliar plantas jovens, no estudo I, foram instalados dois experimentos na Campanha Gaucha (RS), onde foi aplicado, no experimento 1 : 0, 30 e 60 kg de K 2 O ha- 1; e no experimento 2 : 0, 60, 120, e 180 kg de K 2 O ha- 1, com aplicação de calcário calcítico e dolomítico. Avaliou-se o teor de K em folhas, a altura de plantas, diâmetro de caule e massa do {{material}} podado. Para plantas em produção, Estudos II, III e IV, foram instalados outros três experimentos. Na Serra Catarinense (SC) com 0, 50, 100, 150 e 200 kg de K 2 O ha- 1 ano- 1 e outro na Campanha Gaucha com 5 níveis de K no solo, em ambos foram avaliados os teroes de K na folha, nas bagas, componentes de rendimento da uva e composição do mosto. Na região de Trento (Itália) foi instalado um experimento com videiras em produção, com e sem irrigação do solo, onde foi avaliado o potencial hídrico das plantas, além do teor de nutrientes na folha e na baga de uva. No experimento com plantas jovens, a adubação potássica no solo incrementou os teores de K somente na camada de 0 - 10 cm, influenciou o teor de K nas folhas na primeira safra, porém não influenciou os parâmetros de crescimento nas cv. Chardonnay e Pinot Noir. Para plantas em produção na Serra Catarinense houve incremento nos teores de K trocável, não trocável e total no solo com a aplicação da adubação potássica. A aplicação de K no solo aumentou os teores de K no limbo e pecíolo das videiras, mas não afetou a produção de uva e a composição do mosto. Na Campanha o incremento do teor de K trocável no solo aumentou o K total nas folhas no pleno florescimento, o teor de K nas bagas e o valor de pH do mosto, mas não afetou a produção de uva. A irrigação, apesar de proporcionar potencial de água menos negativo nas folhas da videira, não afetou o estado nutricional, os parâmetros enológicos e pouco interferiu no teor de nutrientes na baga. The {{application of}} potassium (K) and lime {{as a source}} of Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) in soil may affect the growth and nutritional status of young plants of grapevines as well as grape production, must composition and distribution of forms of K in the soil. This study aimed to i) evaluate the growth and nutritional status of young grapevines submitted to the application of K lime in soil ii) evaluate how potassium fertilization affects the grape production, must composition and alterations of forms of K in soil, and iii) evaluate the potential of water in leaves as well as the nutritional status and must composition of grapevines grown with or without irrigation. Four studies were carried out. In study I, two experiments were performed in Campanha Gaucha (RS) in order to assess young plants. In the experiment 1, 0, 30 and 60 kg K 2 O ha- 1 were applied. In the experiment 2, 0, 60, 120, and 180 kg K 2 O ha- 1 were applied with application of <b>dolomitic</b> and calcitic <b>lime.</b> The K content in leaves, plant height, stem diameter and pruned material weight were evaluated. Studies II, III and IV were carried out for plants in production with the installation of three other experiments. One of the experiments was performed in Serra Catarinense (SC) with 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg K 2 O ha- 1 yr- 1. The second experiment was in Campanha Gaucha with five levels of K in the soil. The K content in leaf, berries, grape yield components, and must composition were evaluated in both experiments. The third experiment was carried out in the region of Trento (Italy) with grapevines in production, with or without irrigation the soil, where the water potential of plants as well as the nutrient content in the leaf and berry of grapes were evaluated. In the experiment with young plants, soil potassium fertilization increased the K only in the 0 - 10 cm layer and influenced the content of K in the leaves in the first season; however, it did not influence the growth of cv. Chardonnay or Pinot Noir. For plants in production in Serra Catarinense there was an increase in the levels of exchangeable, non-exchangeable and total K in soil with the application of potassium fertilizer. The application of K in the soil increased the concentration of K in leaf and petioles of grapevines; however, it did not affect grape production or the must composition. In Campanha Gaucha, the increase of the content of exchangeable K in the soil increased the total K in the leaves in flowering, the K content in the berries and the pH of the must; however, it did not affect grape production. Although providing less negative water potential in grapevine leaves, irrigation did not affect nutritional status or the enological parameters of the berry, showing little interference in its nutrient content...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} soil {{chemical}} changes on soybean root growth, mineral nutrition and grain yield, {{as a result}} of surface application of lime under no-till (NT), are still under discussion. A field trial was carried out on a loamy dystrophic Typic Hapludox at Ponta Grossa, Paraná State, Brazil, using a completely randomized block design with three replicates, in a split-plot experiment. The main plots received four <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> rates applied on the surface (0, 2, 4, and 6 Mg ha- 1) in July 1993. In the subplots, two <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> rates were reapplied on the surface (0 and 3 Mg ha- 1) in June 2000. After nine years, liming increased pH, exchangeable Ca 2 + and reduced exchangeable Al 3 + as well as soil Al 3 + saturation down to a 60 cm depth. Re-liming, after two years, also provided soil acidity amelioration to a 60 cm depth. Soybean total root length per soil surface area (0 - 60 cm) decreased with the surface lime application under NT. The reduction in soil exchangeable Al 3 + with liming did not change Al concentrations in the soybean roots and leaves. Surface-applied <b>dolomitic</b> <b>lime</b> under NT brought an increase in Ca and Mg concentrations and a decrease in the Mn level in both soybean roots and leaves. Soybean grain yield was not influenced by surface liming because of the decreased Al toxicity and because root growth was stimulated by soil acidity stress under NT...|$|E
