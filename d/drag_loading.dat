40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the effects of body shape on the drag of a 45 deg sweptback-wing-body combination at Mach numbers from 0. 90 to 1. 43. Both the expansion and compression fields induced by body indentation were swept back as the stream Mach number increased from 0. 94. The line of zero pressure change was generally tangent to the Mach lines associated with the local velocities over the wing and body. The strength of the induced pressure fields over the wing were attenuated with spanwise distance and the major effects were limited to the inboard 60 percent of the wing semispan. Asymmetrical body indentation tended to increase the lift on the forward portion of the wing and reduce the lift on the rearward portion. This redistribution of lift had a favorable effect on the wave drag due to lift. Symmetrical body indentation reduced the <b>drag</b> <b>loading</b> near the wing-body juncture at all Mach numbers. The reduction in <b>drag</b> <b>loading</b> increased in spanwise extent as the Mach number increased and the line of zero induced pressure became more nearly aligned with the line of maximum wing thickness. Calculations of the wave drag due to thickness, the wave drag due to lift, and the vortex drag of the basic and symmetrical M = 1. 2 body and wing combinations at an angle of attack of 0 deg predicted the effects of indentation within 11 percent of the wing-basic-body drag throughout the Mach number range from 1. 0 to 1. 43. Calculations of the wave drag due to thickness, the wave drag due to lift, and the vortex drag for the basic, symmetrical M = 1. 2, and asymmetrical M = 1. 4 body and wing combinations predicted the total pressure drag to within 8 percent of the experimental value at M = 1. 43...|$|E

Dynamic pressure, resulting from the blast wave sweeping over the human body, causes the body to be swept along behind the wave at some displacement velocity. Injuries occur when the moving body encounters stationary, solid structures. The displacement velocities for various skull injury levels are known. Solving the motion equation for a body in a transient flow field yields the displacement velocity {{as a function of}} peak overpressure and impulse.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} primarily {{focuses on}} understanding the canonical problem of vortex-induced vibration (VIV), a self-excited vibration of bluff bodies {{caused by the}} instability of the bluff-body wake. In this work, dynamic response and active control of low mode number flexible cylinders undergoing vortex-induced vibrations are addressed which has potential to significantly impact the development of predictive models for flow-induced-vibrations, a topic of critical importance to the offshore {{oil and gas industry}} and important to the cost-effective development of new ocean structures, such as floating offshore wind platforms and offshore wind energy systems. ^ In the tests, first, dynamic response of a tensioned flexible cylinder is investigated in a recirculating flow channel. Different than hysteresis in the amplitude response, the idea of mode hysteresis is introduced. A transition in the amplitude of the response of a flexible cylinder undergoing vortex-induced vibrations is shown {{to be related to the}} transition between fluid coupled structural modes excited by the flow. Also, due to the symmetric <b>drag</b> <b>loading</b> across cylinder 2 ̆ 7 s span, the hypothesis of being unable to sustain a asymmetric excitation (even mode excitation) in in-line is discussed. To understand more about this fluid-structure interactions, tensioned flexible cylinder data is used for multivariate analysis. It is shown that traditional reduced order models such as proper orthogonal decomposition and recently introduced smooth orthogonal decomposition methods help to identify nonlinear mode interactions in the flexible cylinder 2 ̆ 7 s response. Later, mode shape effect in VIV and the idea of being unable to sustain asymmetric modes in a uniform flow is considered. In the tests, three bending-dominated cylinders are tested with varying stiffness in the cross-flow and in-line directions of the cylinder in order to produce varying structural mode shapes associated with a fixed 2 : 1 (in-line:cross-flow) natural frequency ratio. Then, the structural mode excitation of bending-dominated flexible cylinders undergoing vortex-induced vibrations is investigated using multivariate analysis of excited empirical modes. Both the analytic and experimental results show that for excitation of low mode numbers, the cylinder is unlikely to oscillate with an even mode shape in the in-line direction due to symmetric <b>drag</b> <b>loading,</b> even when the system is tuned to have an even mode at the expected frequency of vortex shedding. Later, to understand the effect of three-dimensional wake on an oscillating flexible cylinder in VIV, a novel experimental method is introduced. Finally, the idea of active control of flexible cylinders in VIV using piezo stripe actuators is discussed. Piezo stripe actuators are bonded at the anti-nodes of a flexible cylinder in the in-line direction to control low vibration modes (i. e. first, second and third).

A test model was carried out to investigate the role of a stationary fairing by varying the caudal horn angle to suppress riser VIV taking into account the effect of wake interference. The test results show significant reduction of VIV for risers disposed in tandem and side-by-side. In general, fairing with a caudal horn of 45 ° and 60 ° are efficient in quelling VIV in risers. The results also reveal fairing can reduce the <b>drag</b> <b>load</b> of risers arranged side-by-side.

40|$|Accurate {{characterisation}} of blast loading on intricate structural components is {{a challenging}} task. This paper reports experimental results {{pertaining to the}} effects of planar long-duration blast waves interacting with exposed I-shape steel sections about multiple axes. Long-duration blasts are defined by a positive phase duration t+> 100 ms, characteristic of very large explosion events in the far field. These can result in significantly large impulses and dynamic pressures. Multi-axis long-duration blast interaction with intricate I-sections gives rise to rapid blast diffraction and translational <b>drag</b> <b>loading</b> effects which are complex to characterise, generally requiring approximation using crude drag coefficients. Blast drag coefficients available in literature lack provision for multi-axis interaction with I-shape geometries. Four full-scale long-duration blast experiments investigate the blast interaction with an I-shape column as a function of section orientation with respect to the incident shock wave. High-fidelity pressure instrumentation record coupled incident and reflected surface blast parameters. It was found that constituent surface specific impulse varied with section orientation due to relative exposure to the blast and local shielding aerodynamic effects. Results demonstrate that I-section orientation with respect to blast propagation has significant influence on the resultant translational loading. Experimental drag force coefficients as a function of section orientation are calculated from experimental data and compared to values proposed in literature providing conclusions of direct relevance to both design practitioners and academics...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering and the definitive published version is available at [URL] aerodynamic drag characteristics of a passenger car have, typically, been defined by a single parameter: the drag coefficient at a yaw angle of 0 °. Although this has been acceptable in the past, it does not provide an accurate measure {{of the effect of}} aerodynamic drag on fuel consumption because the important influence of the wind has been excluded. The result of using drag coefficients at a yaw angle of 0 ° produces an underprediction of the aerodynamic component of fuel consumption that does not reflect the on-road conditions. An alternative measure of the aerodynamic drag should take into account the effect of non-zero yaw angles, and a variant of wind-averaged drag is suggested as the best option. A wind-averaged drag coefficient is usually derived for a particular vehicle speed using a representative wind speed distribution. In the particular case where the road speed distribution is specified, such as for a driving cycle to determine fuel economy, a relevant drag coefficient can be derived by using a weighted road speed. An effective drag coefficient is determined with this approach for a range of cars using the proposed test cycle for the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure, WLTP. The wind input acting on the car has been updated for this paper using recent meteorological data and an understanding of the effect of a shear flow on the <b>drag</b> <b>loading</b> obtained from a computational fluid dynamics study. In order to determine the different mean wind velocities acting on the car, a terrain-related wind profile has also been applied to the various phases of the driving cycle.

40|$|Animal {{movement}} is motivated {{in part by}} energetic constraints, where fitness is maximized by minimizing energy consumption. The energetic cost of movement depends on the resistive forces acting on an animal; changes in this force balance can occur naturally or unnaturally. Fishing gear that entangles large whales adds drag, often altering energy balance {{to the point of}} terminal emaciation. An analog to this is drag from tags attached to cetaceans for research and monitoring. This thesis quantifies the effects of <b>drag</b> <b>loading</b> from these two scenarios on fine-scale movements, behaviors and energy consumption. I measured drag forces on fishing gear that entangled endangered North Atlantic right whales and combined these measurements with theoretical estimates of drag on whales' bodies. Entanglement in fishing gear increased drag forces by up to 3 fold. Bio-logging tags deployed on two entangled right whales recorded changes in the diving and fine-scale movement patterns of these whales in response to relative changes in drag and buoyancy from fishing gear and through disentanglement: some swimming patterns were consistently modulated in response. Disentanglement significantly altered dive behavior, and can affect thrust production. Changes in the force balance and swimming behaviors have implications for the survival of chronically entangled whales. I developed two bioenergetics approaches to estimate that chronic, lethal entanglements cost approximately the same amount as the cost of pregnancy and supporting a calf to near-weaning. I then developed a method to estimate drag, energy burden and survival of an entangled whale at detection. This application is essential for disentanglement response and protected species management. Experiments with tagged bottlenose dolphins suggest similar responses to added drag: I determined that instrumented animals slow down to avoid additional energetic costs associated with drag from small bio-logging tags, and incrementally decrease swim speed as drag increases. Metabolic impacts are measurable when speed is constrained. I measured the drag forces on these tags and developed guidelines depending on the relative size of instruments to study-species. Together, these studies quantify the magnitude of added drag in complementary systems, and demonstrate how animals alter their movement to navigate changes in their energy landscape associated with increased drag. by Julie M. van der Hoop.

This wake model is further on applied to loading problems on isolated and buffeted structures.;Following a comprehensive review, a wake turbulence model is defined. Making use of a simple 2 ̆ 2 variable filtering 2 ̆ 2 eduction method, focusing on coherent turbulence rather than on random turbulence, and employing flow dimensions rather than body dimensions the similarity (self preservation) and universality (independence of constraint) of turbulence profiles is demonstrated for both smooth and turbulent flows. Longitudinal (downstream) variation of different wake parameters is introduced and used to demonstrate the validity of the vortex eduction method. CFD simulations by FLOW 3 D code are presented for different shapes for both steady and transient scenarios employing various turbulence models. Results are compared with present and other experimental data.;Direct applicability of the wake model for buffeting problems is found and tested. As a primary step an improvement of existing self-induced loading models for isolated structures is presented. A modified notched-hodograph theory is employed for drag and fluctuating lift modeling and comparison to experiment is provided. Based on vorticity-circulation calculations, the wake geometry for various 2 D bluff bodies is analysed and the notched hodograph theory is completed with a r. m. s. lift model (L Model) with improved simulation qualities in terms of results and applicability.;A detailed investigation of the buffeting loading problem for sharp edged bluff bodies is addressed. Tandem and staggered configurations are studied in both smooth, large scale and small scale turbulent flows for various shapes and geometries. Characterisation and partition of the buffeting domain is provided. Semi-empirical models for force coefficients and Strouhal number are defined for the upstream wake inertial domain. The term 2 ̆ 7 inertial 2 ̆ 7 is used somewhat loosely here but it defines the part of the wake field for which the body related turbulence production (close wake) and the dissipation effects (far wake) are in a certain equilibrium. This domain also corresponds to the similar and universal wake model previously defined (Chapter 2). Spectral modeling is also introduced and a new approach is proposed for <b>drag</b> <b>loading</b> so that wind-load linear dependence is extended.
