[...] "Even though his daddy did sell drugs, I didn't deprive my son," [...] the elder Mayweather says. [...] "The drugs I sold, he was a part of it. He had plenty of food. He had the best clothes and I gave him money. He didn't want for anything. Anybody in Grand Rapids can tell you that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> my kids". Floyd Sr. says he did all of his hustling at night and spent his days with his son, taking him to the gym and {{training}} him to be a boxer. [...] "If it wasn't for me he wouldn't be where he is today," [...] he maintains.|$|E
2500|$|When Bow was 16, {{her mother}} Sarah fell from a second-story window and {{suffered}} a severe head injury. She was later diagnosed with [...] "psychosis due to epilepsy". From her earliest years, Bow had {{learned how to}} care for her mother during the seizures, as well as how to deal with her psychotic and hostile episodes. She said her mother could be [...] "mean" [...] to her, but [...] "didn't mean to... she couldn't help it". Still, Bow felt deprived of her childhood; [...] "As a kid <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> my mother, she didn't take care of me". Sarah worsened gradually, and when she realized her daughter was set for a movie career, Bow's mother told her she [...] "would be much better off dead". One night in February 1922, Bow awoke to a butcher knife held against her throat by her mother. Clara was able to fend off the attack, and locked her mother up. In the morning, Bow's mother had no recollection of the episode, and later she was committed to a sanatorium by Robert Bow.|$|E

On the show he claimed he and Smith had a passionate love affair that lasted for two years and that Smith suffered from life-threatening seizures, for which she was on medication. When asked if Smith ever revealed to him the identity of her daughter's father, Denk responded, [...] "She always told me she wanted to have her kids with me." [...] Denk was not certain he was the baby's father and told Banderas that Smith [...] "always told me I want you to be there and care for Dannielynn no matter what, no matter who is the father, because <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> Anna with her health and everything, and she wanted to make sure her baby is healthy. And also this thing about the dieting and stuff, she doesn't want her baby to be overweight and obese. She wants to make sure she is healthy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1884, {{following}} his final term at Carlisle, Standing Bear, {{armed with a}} recommendation by Captain Pratt, returned home to the Rosebud Agency, Rosebud, South Dakota, where he was hired as an assistant at the reservation's school at the salary of three hundred dollars a year. In 1890, some time after Wounded Knee, Luther moved from Rosebud and followed his father and brother Ellis Standing Bear to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. [...] Pine Ridge provided a series of varying employment and family ventures. In 1891, Luther became principal of a reservation day school. Standing Bear also worked in his uncle’s little general store. [...] One day {{they were talking about}} the delay in mail delivery. [...] “I told my uncle that John Wanamaker, the man for whom I had worked in Philadelphia, was Postmaster-General, and that I would write and see if we could not have a post office established at his camp. [...] I suggested that we call it Kyle. [...] It was a short name and easy to spell. [...] When Mr. Wanamaker received my letter, he replied immediately. [...] He was pleased with my suggestion, but said that he could not appoint me postmaster, as I was an Indian. [...] It would have to be some white man. [...] There was a Joseph Taylor who was one of our missionaries, and we sent his name. [...] He received the appointment, but <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the office.” [...] Later, Luther opened a dry goods store with his brother Ellis at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle. Standing Bear organized public meetings at his dry goods store in Pine Ridge to discuss treaties and current events.|$|E

60|$|I {{remember}} another night, in {{that part}} of the country, when I just missed another bull. If I had hit him, I'd have telescoped him, for I was coming down from above, all holds free, with several other bulls one jump behind and reaching for me. This is how it happened. I had been lodging in a livery stable in Washington. I had a box-stall and unnumbered horse-blankets all to myself.

60|$|We {{returned}} to the places which we had already occupied. Ariel cast another threatening look at me.

I was now as eager as Ariel to hear the story. The subject was full of snares for the narrator.

60|$|I found a {{thousand}} difficulties.

The only insurmountable obstacle was that I had no vessel to contain the water I should need if I floated forth upon these untravelled seas. I would have even tried pottery, but the island contained no clay. I used to go moping about the island trying with all my might to solve this one last difficulty. Sometimes I would give way to wild outbursts of rage, and hack and splinter some unlucky tree in my intolerable vexation. But I could think of nothing.|$|E
