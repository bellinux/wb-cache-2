5|$|As Emperor, Domitian quickly {{dispensed}} {{with the republican}} facade his father and brother had maintained during their reign. by moving the centre of government (more or less formally) to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> the Roman Empire was to be governed as a divine monarchy with himself as the benevolent despot at its head.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a senator, Hugo L Black would give speeches based on his belief in the {{ultimate}} power of the Constitution. He came to see the actions of the anti-New Deal Supreme Court as judicial excess; <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> the Court was improperly overturning legislation that had been passed by large majorities in Congress.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the gekiken kogyo performances, in his later years Sakakibara regretted their development. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> the rules and strictures of gekiken were perverting kenjutsu into new forms that were no longer {{relevant}} to battlefield combat. He disdained the point-scoring swordsmanship of other kendoka of his era, ignoring light touches by his opponents in order to deliver his own powerful strikes. Nonetheless, the gekiken kogyo practices which he began created an interest in fencing which led ultimately to the development of modern kendo.|$|E
5|$|During the Genêt episode, Washington, after {{consulting}} his Cabinet, issued a Proclamation of Neutrality on April 22, 1793. In it he declared the United States neutral {{in the conflict}} between Great Britain and France. He also threatened legal proceedings against any American providing assistance {{to any of the}} warring countries. Washington eventually recognized that supporting either Great Britain or France was a false dichotomy. He would do neither, thereby shielding the fledgling U.S. from, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> unnecessary harm.|$|E
5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E

5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught {{the unity of}} man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was not sure what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E
5|$|He criticised the {{hypocrisy}} of chastity for women and argued that it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated {{to get rid of the}} Devadasi system. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>view</b> it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E
5|$|The play {{established}} Fielding as {{a popular}} London playwright, and the press reported that seats were in great demand. Although largely ignored by critics until the 20th century, most agree that the play is primarily a commentary on events in Fielding's life, signalling his transition from older forms of comedy to the new satire of his contemporaries. Fielding's play within a play satirised {{the way in which}} the London theatre scene, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> abused the literary public by offering new and inferior genres. The Author's Farce is now considered to be a critical success and a highly skilled satire.|$|E

5|$|Tulsidas {{identifies}} Maya with Sita, the inseparable {{energy of}} Rama which takes avatar along with Rama. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> Maya is of two types – Vidya and Avidya. Vidya Maya {{is the cause}} of creation and the liberation of Jiva. Avidya Maya {{is the cause of}} illusion and bondage of the Jiva. The entire world is under the control of Maya. Maya is essentially the same but the two divisions are made for cognitive purposes, this view of Tulsidas is in accordance with Vaishnava teachers of Vedanta.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{initially}} {{estimated that}} they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> was defeatist.

Orde-Lees was not a popular man, and his presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{postponement}} {{because of}} the death of her maternal uncle, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, Victoria married Prince Louis on 30 April 1884 at Darmstadt. Her father did not approve of the match; <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>view</b> Prince Louis had little money and would deprive him of his daughter's company, as the couple would naturally live abroad in Britain. However, Victoria was of an independent mind and took little notice of her father's displeasure. Remarkably, that same evening, Victoria's father secretly married his mistress, Countess Alexandrine Hutten-Czapska, the former wife of Alexander von Kolemine, the Russian chargé d'affaires in Darmstadt. His marriage to a divorcee who was not of equal rank shocked the assembled royalty of Europe and through diplomatic and family pressure Victoria's father was forced to seek an annulment of his own marriage.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{beliefs are}} one {{possible}} source {{for understanding the}} symbolism in the mysteries of Isis. J. Gwyn Griffiths, an Egyptologist and classical scholar, extensively studied Book 11 of Metamorphoses and its possible Egyptian background. He pointed out similarities between the first initiation in Metamorphoses and Egyptian afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took {{on the role of}} Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> the imagery of the initiation refers to the Egyptian underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the sun {{in the middle of the}} night, in Lucius' account of the initiation, might have been influenced by the contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient Egyptian funerary texts. According to these texts, the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do.|$|E
5|$|Ash died in 1887, and the United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations (now called The Association of American Orthodox Hebrew Congregations) began {{a search}} for a successor, to serve as rabbi of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol and as Chief Rabbi of New York City. This search was opposed by Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes, of Congregation Shearith Israel. Mendes felt that the money and energy would be better spent on {{supporting}} the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA), which he had co-founded with Sabato Morais in 1886. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> training American-born rabbis at the Seminary would be a much more effective means of fighting the growing strength of American Reform Judaism: these native English-speaking rabbis would appeal to the younger generation far more than imported, Yiddish-speaking ones.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} coup, {{officers}} loyal to Umran and the Aflaqites were purged from the armed forces, being imprisoned alongside Umran at Mezze prison. One {{of the first}} acts of Jadid's government was to appoint Assad Minister of Defence. Assad however, {{did not support the}} coup, and told Mansur al-Atrash, Jubran Majdalani, and other Aflaqites that he did not support Jadid's actions. Later, in an interview with Le Monde, Assad claimed that the military's intervention was regrettable because the Ba'ath Party was democratic, and that the disputes should have been resolved in a democratic manner. However, Assad did view the actions as necessary, as it put an end, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> to the dictatorship of the National Command.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, Erwin Panofsky {{established}} that Schöne's dating {{was at least}} twenty years too early. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> the girl's dress resembles Burgundian high fashion of the late 1460s to mid-1470s. He compared the hennin worn by Maria Portinari in a c. 1470 portrait by Hans Memling, and her gown to that worn by a lady in an illumination from around the 1470s Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse of Bruges. Sterling, placing the work as c. 1465, remarks that the hennin in the Berlin panel is of a different type {{to that of the}} New York painting. The New York headdress is far more extended, and seems to be of a style prevalent a few years after, and moreover lacks the draped and hanging veil. Sterling further notes that the panel has increased depth of field and more intricate detailing of light than Christus' earlier works. On this basis he believes the work was executed late in the artist's career.|$|E
5|$|In his {{theoretical}} writings, particularly Imperialism, Lenin discussed what {{he regarded}} as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> it {{had reached a}} new stage, state monopoly capitalism. He also believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, that monopoly capitalism existed in Russia meant {{that the country was}} sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism. Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism, and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its liberationist vision. It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution, and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} {{statement}} of the principal theme (between the C minor and A-flat major sections) there is a notational error which, in a literal performance of the score, causes a harmonic clash between the piano and the winds. Mozart probably wrote the piano and wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. Alfred Brendel, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole movement is another notational error: played in cut common time, which calls for two beats per bar rather than four, the movement is, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> too fast.|$|E
