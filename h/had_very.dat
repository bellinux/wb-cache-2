5|$|Coach Alexander found campus {{spirit to}} be {{particularly}} low following the Great Depression. His successful football program (and the other athletic teams) <b>had</b> <b>very</b> few student fans attending the games. He helped to establish a spirit organization known as the Yellow Jacket Club in 1930 to bolster student spirit. The group would later become the Ramblin' Reck Club. The 1939 team was SEC co-champion.|$|E

30|$|Gamification {{language}} intensity will be non-negligible. Some issues <b>have</b> <b>very</b> {{high levels}} of gamification, but others <b>have</b> <b>very</b> low levels, {{and there is no}} temporal pattern. The results suggest that gamification is being attempted, but with unsure technique leading to inconsistent levels.|$|R
5|$|In the sixties, Ray visited Japan {{and took}} {{particular}} pleasure {{in meeting the}} filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, for whom he <b>had</b> <b>very</b> high regard. While at home, he would take an occasional break from the hectic city life by going to places such as Darjeeling or Puri to complete a script in isolation.|$|E
5|$|Texas <b>had</b> <b>very</b> few {{problems}} affecting the roster. Only one defensive starter missed a game due to injury. On offense, starting running back Selvin Young injured his ankle {{in the game}} against Louisiana-Lafayette and re-injured it the following week against Ohio State. He did not play in the games against Rice or Baylor. Receiver Jordan Shipley missed the entire season due to a pulled hamstring.|$|E
5|$|The two Morrison Formation sauropod genera Diplodocus and Barosaurus <b>had</b> <b>very</b> similar limb bones. In the past, many {{isolated}} limb {{bones were}} automatically attributed to Diplodocus, but may, in fact, {{have belonged to}} Barosaurus. Fossil remains of Diplodocus have been recovered from stratigraphic zone 5 of the Morrison Formation.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{confusion}} {{as to who}} actually produced The Velvet Underground & Nico. Although Andy Warhol was the only formally credited producer, he <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little direct influence or authority over the album beyond paying for the recording sessions. In fact, several other individuals {{who worked on the}} album are often mentioned as the album's technical producer.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 {{globular}} clusters in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, suggesting the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they <b>had</b> <b>very</b> tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication is that most globular clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age as previously thought, but are actually in 'adolescence'.|$|E
5|$|According to the Council of Trent, every Catholic {{church is}} {{required}} to have a residing pastor. Before {{the building of the}} rectory began in 1944, the three priests and their housekeeper had lived in the Leslie Mansion (the mansion on the property). The mansion was over a hundred years old, was a frame building, <b>had</b> <b>very</b> few rooms, provided poor living conditions, and had a water pump at the main entrance.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate. They believed that ant-like mandibles first appeared before {{the development of an}} ant-like petiole, but such case was proven false when it was opposite on S. freyi specimens (ant-like petiole first appeared before the development of ant-like mandibles). Based on drawings, it was suggested that Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed tarsal claws and a broadly jointed petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants <b>had</b> <b>very</b> short mandibles, toothless tarsal claws and a separated petiole.|$|E
5|$|An Act of Parliament in 1857 {{provided}} {{for the establishment of}} a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made many works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams, whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens and Andrew Vicari <b>had</b> <b>very</b> successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. Sir Frank Brangwyn was Welsh by origin but spent little time in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Andorra's first {{official}} game was a 6–1 defeat {{in a friendly}} match to Estonia in 1996. Since the qualifying rounds for the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament, Andorra have competed in qualifying for every European Championship and World Cup but have <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little success. They have only ever won five matches, four of them at home. They have two wins in competitive matches, 1–0 wins against Macedonia in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition and against Hungary in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition.|$|E

5|$|At the 1967 Interzonal, held at Sousse, Tunisia, Fischer scored 8½ {{points in}} the first 10 games, to lead the field. His {{observance}} of the Worldwide Church of God's seventh-day Sabbath was honored by the organizers, but deprived Fischer of several rest days, which led to a scheduling dispute, causing Fischer to forfeit two games in protest and later withdraw, eliminating himself from the 1969 World Championship cycle. Communications difficulties with the highly inexperienced local organizers were also a significant factor, since Fischer knew little French and the organizers <b>had</b> <b>very</b> limited English. No one in Tunisian chess had previous experience running an event of this stature.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May, David Ben-Gurion was {{convinced}} that the Arab Legion expected to take control of all Jerusalem. Moreover, after the fighting, the situation there deteriorated: the Jewish community <b>had</b> <b>very</b> small reserves of fuel, bread, sugar and tea, which would last for only 10 days, and water for 3 months. In Glubb's opinion, the aim was still to prevent the Israelis from reinforcing the city and taking control of its Arab part. On 29 May, the UN Security Council announced its intention to impose a ceasefire for 4 weeks, which would prevent further capture of territory and thus prevent resupplying the besieged city.|$|E
5|$|Baird and Jackie {{were asked}} to visit Lennon at Kenwood which was his home in Weybridge in 1964. Cynthia Lennon—Lennon's wife at the time—took them both out {{shopping}} in Knightsbridge, buying them expensive clothes. During the same visit, The Beatles played at the Finsbury Park Astoria, and the sisters asked {{to be allowed to}} stand near the front, but had to be pulled out of the audience by security guards because of the crush. In December 1965, Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane. Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards. Dykins had married again, but Baird acknowledges that she and Jackie <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little contact with his wife, and did not attend their father's funeral.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} concerns, Aflaq kept quiet. But to his astonishment, keeping quiet {{caused him to}} lose his post as Secretary General – Aflaq was succeeded as Secretary General of the National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was {{unexpectedly}} reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little influence within or outside the party. Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain {{to form a new}} government.|$|E
5|$|Because the 1924 Rose Bowl {{and several}} later Rose Bowls <b>had</b> <b>very</b> high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the {{southern}} end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales. The strategy has been used since, with only a small number of tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.|$|E

For two months, his contingent was based at the training camp of the Australian Imperial Force at Tel-el-Kebir but <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little to do with only a few hours of training each day. The 12th Reinforcement left in July for Sling Camp in England, where it underwent more intense training.|$|E
