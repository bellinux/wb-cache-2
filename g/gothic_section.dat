25|$|Princeton has one {{graduate}} residential college, known {{simply as}} the Graduate College, located beyond Forbes College at the outskirts of campus. The far-flung location of the GC was the spoil of a squabble between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean Andrew Fleming West. Wilson preferred a central location for the College; West wanted the graduate students {{as far as possible}} from the campus. Ultimately, West prevailed. The Graduate College is composed of a large Collegiate <b>Gothic</b> <b>section</b> crowned by Cleveland Tower, a local landmark that also houses a world-class carillon. The attached New Graduate College departs in its design from Collegiate Gothic; it is reminiscent of the former dormitories of Butler College, the newest of the five pre-Whitman residential colleges.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} the Gothic double as articulated within the contemporary graphic novel. Discussing representations, interpretations and subversions of the Gothic double, the analysis will apply a synthesised theoretical framework of the psychoanalytical double and literary double to five key works from three canonical creators: Neil Gaiman, Frank Miller and Alan Moore. The discussion will be divided into three sections in order to focus on three recurring motifs in the image-text hybrid of the contemporary graphic novel. Firstly, a discussion of superheroes, SF and the Gothic double aims to explore how works such as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Batman: The Dark Knight Returns combine innovative approaches to the superhero with direct reference to SF and the motif of the <b>Gothic</b> double. <b>Section</b> two offers a reading of how Neil Gaiman’s A Game of You subtly explores complex issues of gender and sexuality in relation to the <b>Gothic</b> double. <b>Section</b> three discusses the urban Gothic, exploring the dualistic presentation of the city in both From Hell and Sin City alongside an interpretation of how each text approaches the issue of prostitution. Throughout, the discussion will approach these graphic novels as literary works and will focus on the analysis of narrative elements including structure, characterisation and, of course, genre.

The contracts that the master signed with the purchasers of the paintings are also preserved. Since the church {{is done in the}} Gothic style, the iconographer faced a difficult task to develop the scenes in the manner of the old Byzantine and Serbian church painting placing them in the <b>Gothic</b> divided <b>sections</b> of the walls. The whole main church as well as the chapels, from the ground {{up to the top of}} the Gothic vaults, among the intertwined pillars, according to the proportion of space that up in the arches gets narrower, are symmetrically filled with frescoes of saints and Serbian rulers and saints. The joints of the columns are nicely combined and covered with smaller images of the Evangelists, Apostles, Martyrs, Angels and Archangels. In the lower parts of the walls, between the vertical columns, the Serbian rulers, from Nemanja to Emperor Uroš and Prince Lazar, are aligned in their actual size.|$|R

Nakon postavljanja gradnje u kontekst zbivanja u srednjoeuropskoj arhitekturi druge polovine 19. stoljeća najveća se pozornost posvećuje glavnom oblikovnom uzoru za izgradnju tornjeva Zagrebačke katedrale – zvoniku crkve St. Pierre u Caenu, te razlikama između dvaju projekata – prvotnog Friedricha von Schmidta i realiziranog Hermana Bolléa. neo-gothic {{towers of}} Zagreb cathedral {{are a result}} of the {{undoubtedly}} most controversial restoration works in the history of Croatian monument conservation and the 19 th-century Croatian architecture in general. They were built {{in the context of the}} historicist approach to monument conservation in the region of Central Europe. The starting point and the principal model for such interventions was the completion of the cathedral of Cologne (1841 – 1880), which supplied it with two massive towers, built on the basis of preserved medieval plans. In the middle and late 19 th century, almost 180 towers were built in German-speaking areas. In case of gothic churches, additions were usually modelled upon the constructions of the cathedral belfries in Cologne, Strassburg, and Freiburg, with a rectangular lower part on which an octagonal upper level was built, ending in a perforated, richly ornamented cone, as in the examples of the medieval towers at Soest, Heidelberg, Ulm, Regensburg, Prague, and many other places. Ideological by towers of Zagreb cathedral belong entirely to this context, but their form follows it only partly. Restoration of the cathedral was begun by a student of Cologne – Friedrich von Schmidt – whose quest for analogies with the very modest remnants of the medieval towers in Zagreb led him to the church of St Pierre in Caen, which had similar solutions for articulation in the lower sections of the belfry, in the form of thin pilaster strips with blind arches on the top. Furthermore, he developed the tower of Zagreb cathedral upwards in accordance with his Caen model – sectioning the central part of the belfry by means of four massive arches, of which the two middle ones are open, while the side ones are closed; the cone of the belfry is solved in a similar way. Nevertheless, Schmidt also added a typical »German« motive – an octagonal level on the passage between the lower, rectangular part of the belfry and the cone. Later, during the construction works, his plan would suffer significant changes on the part of his student, Herman Bollé from Cologne. Bollé most strongly diverged from the solutions of his teachers in the cone of the belfry (Maßwerkhelm), perforating it with rich late <b>gothic</b> <b>sectioning,</b> thus bringing it closer to the context of the Central-European neo-gothic architecture of the period...|$|R
5000|$|The Lorca Castle, which {{overlooks the}} city of Lorca from a {{strategic}} location, and is thus distinctly visible from a distance, was built by the Moorish inhabitants during the 13th century. Its history {{dates back to the}} Islamic period when it was built between 8th and 12th centuries; some remnants of which are still seen in the form of water systems in the older part of the castle. The Alfonsí Tower is of a rectangular shape which is built in the castle. The castle has a polygonal floor plan. The tower has three <b>sections.</b> <b>Gothic</b> vaulted ceilings are seen in its three sections. It also has the Espolón Tower. During the final stages of Christian reconquest, the Moors had taken refuge in the castle. Alphonse tower was added to the fort defences when Alfonso X had retaken the city in 1243 provided security to the turrets and crenels of the fort. The castle is now a popular place for holding fiestas and civic functions. The castle is also transformed into a theme park with fine display of [...] "dioramas, actors in costumes and various gadgetry".|$|R
40|$|The master thesis {{analyses}} and compares {{the main characters}} of three significant works concerning the Dracula theme. It provides a comparison of Bram Stoker's Dracula and its film adaptations, namely Nosferatu - Die Symphonie des Grauens (1922) directed by F. W. Murnaua and Dracula (1992) by F. F. Coppola. The work contrasts the interpretation of a vampire through the character of Dracula, {{analyses and}} maps the evolution of female characters {{in regard to the}} rules and expectations of society and examines the role of the two most distinct male characters of the story, A. Van Helsing and R. M. Renfield. The three introductory chapters are dedicated to the authors of the works concerned and to the novel and its adaptations, i. e. it describes the circumstances of their conception and their content. The Bram Stoker chapter also comprises a brief characterization and an overview of the <b>gothic</b> novel, the <b>section</b> handling the Nosferatu movie provides a subchapter on expressionist film and the chapter on the work of F. F. Coppola is supplemented with a short outline of the notion of a vampire in pop culture of the 20 th century. The first chapter of the comparative analysis concerns the comparison of Dracula character in the novel and its two film adaptations based on the narratological theory of Bohumil [...] ...|$|R
