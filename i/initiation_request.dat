40|$|International audienceHow do {{children}} learn to think and talk about giving? The intentional transfer of an object is frequent and salient in children’s experience. Yet the earliest productions involving verbs like give are observed relatively late (Pine et al. 1998), well after they have mastered simpler argument structures—and, crucially, long after they have become competent event participants. Despite the central role such verbs and their associated dative constructions have played in linguistic and developmental theory, relatively few {{studies have focused on}} how the linguistic and conceptual underpinnings for giving events are first established. We present a study of the earliest utterances and interactions involving giving events, defined here as an intentional transfer of possession or control. We extend the participant structure of the giving scene or frame (Fillmore 1976) with a richer decomposition into three main phases: initiation (where giver or recipient prompts, requests or announces the transfer), execution (physical act of transfer), and acknowledgment (completion of transfer). Each phase can be accompanied by linguistic constructions that allow the participants to negotiate and coordinate their plans and actions. In English, for example, phrases like “Want more?”, “Here you go”, and “Thank you”, though lacking any verbs of giving, clearly mark specific phases of giving. We then present a longitudinal study of parent-child interactions from the Providence Corpus (CHILDES), coding transfer events for linguistic form (utterance, constructions, speaker), participant structure (giver, recipient, gift), event phase, and pragmatic function (self-initiated, cooperative <b>initiation,</b> <b>request).</b> Preliminary results highlight several patterns. Early utterances fall mainly into two categories: a parental request for a child to give her something, or a parental commentary about either her own or the child’s giving action. Later, the child takes {{a more active role in}} initiating transfers, using increasingly better-formed language for each phase. This progression may indicate that the child has mastered the “script” of such interactions, where the predictable nature of the event structure provides a convenient entry point to language (Nelson 2007). We further observe extended interactions in which the phases above each involve multiple steps; in these situations, it may instead be the well-established language associated with simpler events that provides the conceptual scaffold for the child to grasp more complex events. Overall, our analysis illuminates how the complex event structure of giving, and the variety of ways of talking about it, provide the means for the concurrent development and mutual reinforcement of language and conceptualization...|$|E
40|$|In Study 1, 381 {{students}} (Sample A) aged 9 to 15 {{responded to}} Gratitude and Indebtedness Questionnaire- 12 (GIQ- 12) developed {{on the basis}} of Gratitude Questionnaire-S (McCullough, Emmons & Tsang, 2002). Their responses were used to assess whether gratitude and indebtedness were perceived as distinct dispositions through exploratory factor analysis. The responses of 249 students (Sample B) with the same age range were used to confirm the factor structure derived from the exploratory factor analysis. The construct validity of gratitude and indebtedness was further examined through relating them to subjective well-being and helping tendencies. In the two experimental studies, separate groups of 123 and 126 students from Sample B responded to questions based on vignettes designed to elicit feelings of gratitude and indebtedness. In Study 2 a, three conditions of benefactor expectation for repayment (No-expectation, Expectation, and Ambiguous) were manipulated. In Study 2 b, three conditions of locus of help <b>initiation</b> (<b>Request,</b> Offer, and Ambiguous) were manipulated. The major findings of Study 2 a and Study 2 b provided general support that feelings of gratitude and indebtedness could be differentiated at the situational level. In Study 2 a, different conditions of benefactor's expectation to return were found to be a key factor in differentiating feeling thankful, owing others, and obliged to repay. Students felt more thankful than obliged to repay when not being expected to repay; but they felt more obliged to repay than thankful when being expected for repayment. In Study 2 b, different conditions of help initiation were not able to contribute to the differentiation. In predicting prosocial motivation, gratitude trait was consistently found to be a significant predictor under nearly all scenarios in Study 2 a and Study 2 b. However, in predicting the magnitude of reciprocation, traits and emotions of gratitude and indebtedness were found to be substantially weak predictors. Gratitude trait was found to be the only significant predictor for prosocial motivation under ambiguous conditions. The implications of the present findings for moral education and developing interventions to promote gratitude and well-being among children and adolescents are discussed. The results of Study 1 revealed that gratitude and indebtedness were perceived to be distinct among Chinese young adolescents in Hong Kong. Grateful students, compared with their less grateful counterparts, reported heightened subjective wellbeing, demonstrated by higher level of life satisfaction, more positive affect but less negative affect experienced in their lives. However, indebted students, compared with less indebted students, reported less satisfaction with life and more negative affect. In predicting helping tendencies, gratitude trait was found to be the strongest predictor but indebtedness trait significantly contributed to less helping tendencies. This study consisted of one survey study (Study 1) and two experimental studies (Study 2 a and Study 2 b). Study 1 aimed to examine whether gratitude and indebtedness could be empirically distinguished as two dispositional traits and how they were differentially related to subjective well-being and helping tendencies. Study 2 a and Study 2 b aimed to investigate whether gratitude and indebtedness could be differentiated as different emotions in specific situations and how gratitude and indebtedness as traits and emotions affected prosocial motivation and reciprocal behaviors.

We envision {{an environment in which}} relay networks are dynamically formed in different frequency bands in response to the degradation of network performance. Nodes experiencing poor service may use their agile radios to join one of the available, non-interfering relay networks. We propose and evaluate a set of algorithms used to form such relay networks on-demand. Each of the algorithms begins by designating the nodes best suited for acting as gateways between the relay and cellular networks. Each scheme then determines the order of route <b>request</b> <b>initiations.</b> These algorithms are evaluated for latency, signaling overhead and gateway load during the network formation process, and average path length and amount of link sharing in the resulting relay networks.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the input/output subsystem is becoming increasingly important for many applications. Commercial I/O intensive applications are a fast growing market segment and experience constantly increasing performance demands. Many of these applications exploit concurrency to overlap the latency of I/O operations to improve throughput. At the same time, semiconductor technology trends result in a growing gap between application and operating system performance. Consequently, operating system overhead increasingly limits the efficiency of latency-hiding techniques to improve throughput. This dissertation develops and evaluates a novel I/O architecture that, by providing user-level access to the I/O subsystem, minimizes I/O overhead while maintaining the level of protection and programming flexibility of conventional kernel-based architectures. Inexpensive hardware mechanisms in the I/O device and host processor implement protected user-level <b>request</b> <b>initiation,</b> user-space data transfers, and user-level notifications. Together, these mechanisms are able to reduce I/O overhead by up to two orders of magnitude. As a result, applications are able to efficiently overlap long-latency I/O operations to maximize throughput and to exploit the scalable bandwidth of next-generation distributed I/O architectures. The flexibility of the basic mechanisms facilitates library implementations {{of a variety of}} standard I/O programming models with low overhead, as the architecture does not restrict the allocation and use of I/O buffers...|$|R

Two-way communication is one of the fundamental communication methods, such as state feedback among IoT devices, data acknowledgement or route <b>initiation,</b> and update <b>requests.</b> Two-way transmission capacity of a wireless ad hoc network refers to the maximum number of successful transmissions existing per unit network area, constrained by two-way outage probability. The transmission capacity provides a framework to derive closed-form bounds for the interference distribution by using stochastic geometry when the locations of nodes form a Poisson point process (PPP). Most of the previous works on deriving transmission capacity only focused on one-way transmission capacity (reverse communication from the destination to the source is ignored), which considered the effect of various physical and medium access layer techniques such as successive interference cancellation [4], multiple antennas [5 – 8], guard zone-based scheduling [9], and cooperative relaying [10, 11].|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Manufacturers {{across many}} sectors {{increasingly}} operate in high variety environments. Research {{evidence suggests that}} variety has {{a negative impact on}} performance. However, the research literature is limited on the enablers that allow variety to be managed effectively and efficiently at the “front-end” of an organisation and in quotation processes in particular. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents case analysis of the quotation processes from manufacturers operating in high-variety environments. Qualitative process modelling tools have been developed to allow representation of process complexities and informal process elements. Findings – Findings are presented on generic mechanisms for absorbing and mitigating the impact of variety on quotation processes. A generic quotation process model is presented comprising four key decisions centres: customization <b>request</b> <b>initiation</b> and information gathering on customer needs, classification of requests, resource control, and identification of information for reuse. Practical implications – The implications of the study for the automation of quotation processes in high variety and mass customization environments are discussed and it is speculated that different decision centres will dominate in different environments. Originality/value – The generic model developed by this research offers insight into the functioning of the core process elements of the quotation system. Reviewing an organisation’s structure and the information systems infrastructure supporting these decision centres should lead to the identification of potential system or reorganisation improvements...|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, a young gay Wiccan named Eddie Buczynski {{contacted}} Martello, and <b>requested</b> <b>initiation.</b> Due to Buczynski's inexperience in the religion, Martello {{turned him}} down, although developed {{a friendship with}} him. Martello introduced Buczynski both to other covens who might initiate him, and to Herman Slater, who would become his long-time partner. Slater was ill with various medical complications, and on one occasion was rehabilitating at the New York University Medical Center when Martello performed a healing ritual on him {{with the assistance of}} Buczynski. Martello would {{come to be known as}} a regular at The Warlock Shop, an occult store opened by Slater in New York. Through The WICA Newsletter, Martello had met Lady Gwen Thompson, the founder of the New England Covens of Traditionalist Witches (NECTW), and decided to introduce Buczynski to her, resulting in Buczynski's initiation into the tradition in Spring 1972. Martello and Thompson later fell out, with some unconfirmed accounts claiming that it was because he lent her money and she did not pay him back. In October 1972, Buczynski founded his own tradition of Wicca, termed Welsh Traditionalist Witchcraft, with Martello becoming an early initiate and taking on the name of [...] "Nemesis" [...] within that tradition. In turn, Martello welcomed Buczynski into his La Vecchia tradition, and initiated him through its three degree system.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the policy implementation of the Teach for Florida Project, which was conducted as a grant program in 2003. The project was designed to help alleviate a critical shortage of teachers brought about {{in part by the}} passage in the fall of 2002 of Florida Constitutional Amendment 9, a referendum setting specific limits on {{the number of students who}} could be taught by one teacher. The project was created and run on a tight timeline, allowing only 6 months from <b>initiation</b> of the <b>request</b> for proposals to placement of new alternatively prepared teachers in their classrooms. Despite the short notice, 23 institutions submitted proposals, of which 19 were considered worthy of funding and 7 were selected. Of the institutions selected, three represented the State University System, three the State Community College System, and one was a consortium of independent private colleges and universities in Florida. Although each institution created its own plan, the programs demonstrated two divergent paradigms. The schools all proposed some form of classroom education methodology, while the consortium created an online training system. The potential to examine in detail the outcomes of the two approaches was lost because, as the literature review points out, there was no requirement in the request for proposals to maintain the data necessary to conduct such an investigation. The Teach for Florida Project was effective in creating alternative programs for teacher certification but could have provided greater insight into the alternative preparation process had evaluation planning been part of the implementation...|$|R
