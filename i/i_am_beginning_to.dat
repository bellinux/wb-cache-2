500|$|After the {{evacuation}} of Dunkirk, people believed that the threatened invasion could come at almost any time. Churchill was at times personally pessimistic about Britain's chances for victory, telling Hastings Ismay on 12 June 1940 that [...] "ou and I will be dead in three months' time". German preparations would require {{at least a few}} weeks, but all defensive precautions were made with an extreme sense of urgency. In mid-1940, an invasion attempt could have occurred at any time, but some times were more likely than others: the phase of the moon, the tides and, most of all, the weather were considerations. The weather usually deteriorates significantly after September, but an October landing was not out of the question. On 3 October, General Brooke wrote in his diary: [...] "Still no invasion! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> think that the Germans may after all not attempt it. And yet! I have the horrid thought that he may still bring off some surprise on us." ...|$|E
500|$|Nurmi stated to a Swedish {{newspaper}} that [...] "this is absolutely my last {{season on the}} track. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> get old. I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it." [...] However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin. Nurmi's one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945. In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn. He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile. Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925, and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him. In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20km. In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles. He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes. Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he [...] "won't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event." ...|$|E

"I {{was much}} {{depressed}} on reading your letter by your painful reflections on The Europeans, but now, an hour having elapsed, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> hold up my head a little; {{the more so}} as I think I myself estimate the book very justly & am aware of its extreme slightness. I think you take these things too rigidly and unimaginatively—too much as if an artistic experiment were a piece of conduct, to which one's life were somehow committed; but I think you're quite right in pronouncing the book 'thin' & empty." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 1 January 145, Marcus {{was made}} consul a second time. He {{might have been}} unwell at this time: a letter from Fronto {{that might have been}} sent at this time urges Marcus to have plenty of sleep [...] "so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice". Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: [...] "As far as my {{strength}} is concerned, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> get it back; and there is no trace of the pain in my chest. But that ulcer [...] I am having treatment and taking care not to do anything that interferes with it." [...] Marcus was never particularly healthy or strong. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the midst}} of the European sovereign-debt crisis, Radek Sikorski, Poland's Foreign Minister, stated in November 2011, [...] "I will {{probably}} be the first Polish foreign minister in history to say so, but here it is: I fear German power less than <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> fear German inactivity. You have become Europe's indispensable nation." [...] According to Jacob Heilbrunn, a senior editor at The National Interest, such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany's history. [...] "This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II. And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin's position {{at the center of the}} Continent." [...] Heilbrunn believes that the adage, [...] "what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union" [...] has been supplanted by a new mentality—what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its Nazi past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed—and not represented—by Nazism. The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski's effusive praise for his country's western neighbor. This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory.|$|E
