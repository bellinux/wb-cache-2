5|$|A delegation, {{consisting}} of {{the representatives of the}} twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad to serve as chief arbitrator for the entire community; due to his status as a neutral outsider. There was fighting in Yathrib: primarily the dispute involved its Arab and Jewish inhabitants, and was estimated to have lasted for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the Battle of Bu'ath in which all clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal concept of blood-feud and an eye <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases. The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves.|$|E

5|$|After {{maintaining}} {{peak strength}} for about 18hours, Kenneth began a sharp weakening trend due to unfavorable north-northeasterly wind shear; this {{was caused by}} the anticyclone over Hurricane Jova, which eroded the eyewall of Hurricane Kenneth. While weakening, the hurricane turned to a southwest drift, due to a weakness in steering currents. By September 20, its deepest convection was confined to the southern half of the hurricane, and later in the day Kenneth weakened to tropical storm status. Reduced moisture in the atmosphere weakened the system further, and by September 21 its circulation was exposed to the east-northeast of the convection. Kenneth began a steady west-northwest track due to a weak ridge to its north. Operationally the storm was predicted to continue weakening and dissipate within four days. However, deep convection re-developed near the center as the outflow became better defined, and Kenneth remained a moderate tropical storm for several days. On September 24, the motion became nearly stationary as steering currents again weakened. Vertical shear sharply declined, allowing the convection to become more symmetrical and <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> feature to develop. On September 25, Kenneth again attained hurricane status while located about 1085miles (1745km) east-southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii.|$|E

25|$|By Hammurabi's time, {{almost all}} trace of tribal custom had already {{disappeared}} from {{the law of the}} Code. It is state law—self-help, blood-feud, and marriage by capture, are all absent; though code of family solidarity, district responsibility, ordeal, and the lex talionis (an eye <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye),</b> are primitive features that remain. The king is a benevolent autocrat, easily accessible to all his subjects, both able and willing to protect the weak against the highest-placed oppressor. The royal power, however, can only pardon when private resentment is appeased. Judges are strictly supervised, and appeal is allowed. The whole land is covered with feudal holdings, masters of the levy, police, etc. There is a regular postal system. The pax Babylonica is so assured that private individuals do not hesitate to ride in their carriage from Babylon to the coast of the Mediterranean. The position of women is free and dignified.|$|E
500|$|Lowell's {{earliest}} poems {{were published}} without remuneration in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1840. He {{was inspired to}} new efforts towards self-support and joined with his friend Robert Carter in founding the literary journal The Pioneer. The periodical was distinguished {{by the fact that}} most of its content was new rather than material that had been previously published elsewhere, and by the inclusion of very serious criticism, which covered not only literature but also art and music. Lowell wrote that it would [...] "furnish the intelligent and reflecting portion of the Reading Public with a rational substitute for the enormous quantity of thrice-diluted trash, in the shape of namby-pamby love tales and sketches, which is monthly poured out to them by many of our popular Magazines." [...] William Wetmore Story noted the journal's higher taste, writing that [...] "it took some stand & appealled to a higher intellectual Standard than our [...] milk or watery namby-pamby Mags with which we are overrun". The first issue of the journal included the first appearance of [...] "The Tell-Tale Heart" [...] by Edgar Allan Poe. Lowell was treated <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> disease in New York shortly after the first issue, and in his absence Carter did a poor job of managing the journal. The magazine ceased publication after three monthly numbers beginning in January 1843, leaving Lowell $1,800 in debt. Poe mourned the journal's demise, calling it [...] "a most severe blow to the cause—the cause of a Pure Taste".|$|E
