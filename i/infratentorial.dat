40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Infratentorial</b> empyema is an {{uncommon}} complication of bacterial meningitis. Very {{little is known}} about its recognition and appropriate management. METHOD: We present a patient with <b>infratentorial</b> subdural empyema and compare findings with 41 cases with <b>infratentorial</b> empyema reported in the literature. RESULTS: Many patients with <b>infratentorial</b> empyema presented as subacute meningitis with neck stiffness and decreased consciousness. Diagnosis was often delayed. The minority had cerebellar findings and cranial nerve deficits. Clues to the diagnosis were presence of otitis, sinusitis, or mastoiditis and recent surgery for these disorders. The majority of patients underwent craniotomy; conservative treatment with antibiotics was associated with relapse of symptoms. The mortality rate was high especially in those with subdural empyema. CT failed to clearly visualize <b>infratentorial</b> subdural empyema in several reported cases. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Infratentorial</b> empyema is a life-threatening rare complication of bacterial meningitis. MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging, is the preferred imaging technique in patients with suspected or proven bacterial meningitis and associated ear-nose-throat infection with deterioration in consciousness and neurologic signs that suggest a posterior fossa lesion.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Infratentorial {{abnormalities}} {{may cause}} cognitive deficits, but current research criteria for vascular dementia (VaD) {{do not consider}} them. Our purposes were to determine the prevalence of <b>infratentorial</b> abnormalities in VaD, their relation with supratentorial abnormalities, and whether they are relevant to cognition. Methods—We examined 182 patients (120 men, mean age 73 years, SD 8) with probable VaD at inclusion into a multicenter clinical trial. MRI scans were evaluated for <b>infratentorial</b> vascular abnormalities, midbrain atrophy, cerebellar atrophy, basilar artery diameter and tortuosity, and supratentorial abnormalities. Cognitive testing included the mini–mental state examination (MMSE) and the vascular dementia assessment scale (VaDAS-cog). Results—One hundred forty-one (77. 5 %) patients had <b>infratentorial</b> abnormalities: 119 (65. 4 %) had focal <b>infratentorial</b> vascular lesions, 65 (35. 7 %) had diffuse pontine vascular abnormalities hyperintense on T 2 -weighted images, 20 (11. 0 %) had midbrain atrophy, and 16 (8. 8 %) had cerebellar atrophy. Significant correlations were found between number of <b>infratentorial</b> vascular lesions and basilar artery diameter (rs 0. 26; P 0. 0001), <b>infratentorial</b> and basal ganglia (including thalamus) vascular abnormalities (rs 0. 30; P 0. 0001), {{as well as between}} midbrain atrophy and global supratentorial atrophy (rs 0. 27; P 0. 0001). <b>Infratentorial</b> vascular abnormalities and cerebellar atrophy were not significantly associated with cognitive impairment.

40|$|Backgrounds: Tuberculoma is a granulomatous {{inflammatory}} process mimicking a neoplasm, both clinically and radiologically. Although {{those with}} an <b>infratentorial</b> origin are rare, this disease is still a diagnostic challenge using conventional workup. However, this disease should not be overlooked because it is essentially curable with proper diagnosis and therapy, usually, a Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) DNA test is performed. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentations, CSF results, and images of 11 MTB DNA positive and clinically cured cases of <b>infratentorial</b> tuberculoma. Results: <b>Infratentorial</b> tuberculoma usually deteriorated before antituberculosis treatment (ATT). Magnetic resonance imaging showed space-occupying lesions without specific features, 4 within the cerebellum and 7 within the brainstem. Evidence of systemic tuberculosis was found in only 1 case. Clinical manifestations included various combinations of focal signs and symptoms in the brain stem and cerebellum. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings were also nonspecific. The diagnoses of these cases {{were based on the}} positive tests of a nested polymerase chain reaction (N-PCR) assay. Trial therapy with antituberculous drugs resulted in clinical improvement, as documented by MRI in all patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Migraineurs are at {{increased}} risk of cerebellar infarcts and supratentorial white matter lesions. The prevalence, frequency, and distribution of <b>infratentorial</b> hyperintense lesions in migraine are unknown. METHODS: Migraineurs with aura (n= 161), without aura (n= 134), and controls (n= 140) from a population-based sample of adults (30 to 60 years of age) were evaluated with MRI. RESULTS: <b>Infratentorial</b> hyperintensities were identified in 13 of 295 (4. 4 %) migraineurs and in 1 of 140 (0. 7 %) controls (P= 0. 04). Twelve cases had hyperintensities, mostly bilaterally, in the dorsal basis pontis. Those with <b>infratentorial</b> hyperintensities also had supratentorial white matter lesions more often.

40|$|Background: Regulation {{of sleep}} and sleep-related {{breathing}} resides in different brain structures. Vascular lesions {{can be expected to}} differ in their consequences on sleep depending on stroke topography. However, studies addressing the differences in sleep and sleep-related breathing depending on stroke topography are scarce. The aim of the present investigation was to compare the sleep and sleep-related breathing of patients with supratentorial versus <b>infratentorial</b> stroke. Methods: This study was part of the prospective multicenter study SAS-CARE- 1 (Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) /Ischemic Stroke and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Treatment Efficacy (SAS-CARE); NCT 01097967). We prospectively included 14 patients (13 male, age 66 ± 6 years) with <b>infratentorial</b> lesions and 14 patients (14 male, age 64 ± 7 years) with supratentorial lesions, matched for age and stroke severity. Polysomnography was recorded in all during the acute phase within 9 days after stroke onset and 3 months later. Results: During the acute phase after stroke, patients with <b>infratentorial</b> lesions had significantly more sleep-related breathing disorders than patients with supratentorial lesions with an apnea-hypopnea index > 20 observed in 8 (57 %) patients with <b>infratentorial</b> stroke and in only 2 (14 %) patients with supratentorial stroke. Sleep-related breathing improved from the acute to the subacute phase (3 months), albeit remaining elevated in a significant proportion of subjects. Sleep parameters did not differ between the two patient groups but there was a general improvement of sleep from the acute to the subacute phase which was comparable for both patient groups. Although stroke severity was mild, recovery after 3 months was worse in patients with <b>infratentorial</b> stroke with 12 of 14 patients with supratentorial stroke being symptom free (NIHSS = 0), while this was the case for only 6 of 14 patients with <b>infratentorial</b> stroke. Conclusions: Patients with <b>infratentorial</b> lesions are at an increased risk for sleep-related breathing disorders, which are frequent in this group. Monitoring of sleep-related breathing is therefore especially recommended in patients with <b>infratentorial</b> stroke. Because of the absence of reliable differences in sleep parameters between the two patient groups, polygraphy, with reduced diagnostic costs, rather than polysomnography could be considered. The higher prevalence of sleep-related breathing disorders and the poorer recovery of patients with <b>infratentorial</b> lesions suggest that early treatment interventions should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Objective- The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the clinico-pat-hological characteristics, treatment, {{complications}} and outcome in paediatric patients with <b>infratentorial</b> ependymomas. Patients and Methods- A retrospective analysis of 6 patients younger than 15 years and hospitalized for surgical treatment of <b>infratentorial</b> ependymomas was performed. The intracra-nial hypertension, neurological status, radiological CT or MRI findings, tumours localization, type of resection, hydrocepha-lus treatment, histopathology, complications and outcome were analysed.

Moreover, their presence {{has been shown to}} have prognostic value for disability. However, their spatial distribution and impact on network damage is not well understood. As a preliminary step in this study, we mapped the overall <b>infratentorial</b> lesion pattern in relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis patients (N =  317) using MRI, finding the pons (lesion density, 14. 25 /cm 3) and peduncles (13. 38 /cm 3) to be predilection sites for <b>infratentorial</b> lesions. Based on these results, 118 fiber bundles from 15 healthy controls and a subgroup of 23 patients showing lesions unilaterally at the predilection sites were compared using diffusion tensor imaging to analyze the impact of an isolated <b>infratentorial</b> lesion on the affected fiber tracts. Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusion as well as axial and radial diffusivity were investigated at the lesion site and along the entire fiber tract. <b>Infratentorial</b> lesions were found {{to have an impact on}} the fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity not only at the lesion site itself but also along the entire affected fiber tract. As previously found in animal experiments, inflammatory attack in the posterior fossa in multiple sclerosis impacts the whole affected fiber tract.

Results: Patients had an average disease duration of 19. 98 (± 6. 99) years and a median EDSS score of 4 (range: 1. 0 - 8. 0). EDSS score was associated with number of <b>infratentorial</b> and cervical cord lesions, lesion volume in the CST, and mean upper cervical cord area (adjusted R 2 0. 403). Timed 25 -Foot Walk Test score was associated with number of <b>infratentorial</b> lesions and cerebellar volume (adjusted R 2 0. 150), 9 -Hole Peg Test score with number of <b>infratentorial</b> lesions and thickness of the cortex connected to the CST (adjusted R 2 0. 245), and Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale with number of <b>infratentorial</b> and cervical lesions, thickness of the cortex connected to the CST, and mean upper cervical cord area (adjusted R 2 0. 354).
