5|$|Olga Rudge, {{pregnant}} with Pound's child, followed them to Italy. She had {{little interest in}} raising a child, but may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> having one would maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 she gave birth to their daughter, Mary. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the matches}} were changed {{after they were}} first announced, as several wrestlers left the WWF shortly before the event. Critics have praised the main event and the tag team match that was won by Savage and Perfect. Although the {{remaining}} bouts have received low ratings, critics <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> those two matches made the event worth watching.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of his}} contemporaries, he {{does not}} seem to <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> his admiration for the pre-Islamic Iranian civilization {{conflicted}} with his Muslim Shiite faith. According to some accounts, he repaired the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala, and built a mausoleum of Ali in Najaf, which is today known as the Imam Ali Mosque. He {{is said to have been}} generous to a prominent Shiite theologian, but did not follow a Shiite religious policy and was tolerant to the Sunnis. He even tried to get closer to the Sunnis by giving his daughter in marriage to the caliph, which was a failure because the caliph refused to consummate the marriage.|$|E

5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so {{did not think it}} necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{identified}} {{a number of}} reasons why residents opposed self-government. Along with the previously mentioned fear of increases in taxation or decreases in services, he argued that those living in the ACT would <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> they already had a voice in the governance of the territory, through federal electoral representation. Canberra also had a high proportion of public servants who felt that they were already a part of the government, and knew how to work with the system.|$|E
5|$|Campbell was unapologetic. He {{said that}} he {{considered}} it his duty as president to attend the game. Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau was livid at Campbell for attending, and he laid {{the blame for the}} riot on Campbell. A Montreal city councilor wanted Campbell arrested for inciting the riot. Years later, Canadiens player Jean Béliveau stated that, although he disagreed with Campbell's decision to attend the game, as well as feeling Campbell might have been using his appearance to make a statement, he concluded that Campbell may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if he did not attend he could appear to be hiding. He also noted that Campbell's absence might not have made much of a difference.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Henry I's successor, King Stephen, Nigel {{remained as}} treasurer only briefly before {{his family was}} ousted from political office by the new king. Nigel rebelled and deserted to Stephen's rival Matilda, but eventually reconciled with Stephen. Although he subsequently held some minor administrative posts, he never regained high office under Stephen. On the king's death, Nigel was returned to the treasurership by the new king, Henry II. Nigel's second tenure as treasurer saw him return the administration to the practices of Henry I. He withdrew from much of his public work after around 1164, following an attack of paralysis. He was succeeded as treasurer by his son, Richard fitzNeal, whom he had trained in {{the operations of the}} Exchequer, or Treasury of England. Most historians, then and now, <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Nigel's administrative abilities were excellent; he is considered to have been more talented as an administrator than as a religious figure.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the revolt, Treblinka II {{continued}} to function and remained a top priority for the SS for another year. Stangl met the head of Operation Reinhard, Odilo Globocnik, and inspector Christian Wirth in Lublin, and decided not to draft a report, as no native Germans had died putting down the revolt. Stangl wanted to rebuild the camp, but Globocnik told him it would be closed down shortly and Stangl would be transferred to Trieste to help fight the partisans there. The Nazi high command may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Stangl, Globocnik, Wirth, and other Reinhard personnel knew too much and wanted to dispose of them by sending them to the front. With almost all the Jews from the German ghettos (established in Poland) killed, {{there would have been}} little point in rebuilding the facility. Auschwitz had enough capacity to fulfil the Nazis' remaining extermination needs, rendering Treblinka redundant.|$|E
25|$|This {{suggests}} that the Prince may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Cristofori would be a prize recruit {{and was trying to}} charm him into accepting his offer; consistent again with the view that the Prince was attempting to recruit him as an inventor.|$|E

25|$|Many leaders <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Virginia's {{annexation}} {{laws are}} {{a barrier to}} regional cooperation among localities, creating an air of mistrust, and a feeling among citizens that such changes often take place against their will. Many of the state's needs may be met best through regional cooperation, which is discouraged by annexation issues. As of 2007, a moratorium on many major annexations {{has been in place}} since the late 20th century by actions in the Virginia General Assembly.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{recommended}} Kiggell as {{his successor}} and thought {{the appointment of}} William Robertson “a tremendous gamble”, writing “my heart sinks when I think what it all may mean to the College & this house”. He may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Robertson’s lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining. Robertson visited Camberley with Lord Kitchener (28 July 1910), who criticised Wilson; {{this may have been}} one of the causes of the poor relations between Wilson and Kitchener in August 1914. Edmonds later told a story of how Wilson had, perhaps as a joke or wanting to draw attention to Robertson’s shortage of money, left a bill for £250 for furniture and improvements to the Commandant’s residence, and that Wilson’s predecessor Rawlinson, when approached by Robertson for advice, had been amused and had commented that many of these improvements had been made by his own wife or by previous Commandants. Whatever the truth of the matter, relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Kublai Khan had {{defeated}} Ariq Böke, {{and both}} Kublai and Phagpa must <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{the construction of}} the stupa in the Sakya monastery had gained religious merit that contributed to Kublai's military victory and other achievements. As Imperial Preceptor, Phagpa was ready to go to the court and disseminate his sect's teachings. Since no artist in China could make the bewildering array of Himalayan Tantric deities which would be indispensable for his religious activities, he needed to bring with him someone who could. Arniko was a natural choice. Instead of going back to Nepal, Phagpa encouraged him to go to the Mongol court to present himself to Kublai Khan. Phagpa accepted Arniko as his disciple and initiated him into secret Buddhist treaties, thus elevating his social status above an ordinary artisan. Thus having discovered Arniko, Phagpa personally prepared and trained Arniko for his future tasks at the court.|$|E

25|$|Haig {{told the}} War Policy Committee (19 June, and {{contrary}} to Robertson's advice of six days earlier) that “Germany was nearer her end than they seemed to think … Germany was within {{six months of the}} total exhaustion of her available manpower, if the fighting continues at its present intensity” and (20 June) he had no “intention of entering into a tremendous offensive involving heavy losses” whilst Robertson wanted to avoid “disproportionate loss” (23 June). At this time Haig was involved in discussions as to whether Robertson should be appointed First Lord of the Admiralty (a ministerial post), and Woodward suggests that he may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Robertson had outlived his usefulness as CIGS. Ministers were not entirely convinced by Jellicoe’s warnings about German submarines and destroyers operating from the Belgian ports, but were influenced by France’s decline (the opposite to Robertson’s original view that this made a major offensive less sensible) and by the apparent success of the Kerensky Offensive. The Flanders Offensive was finally sanctioned by the War Policy Committee on 18 July and the War Cabinet two days later, on condition that it did not degenerate into a long-drawn out fight like the Somme.|$|E
25|$|The first passage {{has been}} {{interpreted}} both literally, allegorically and otherwise. Although some commentators feel that this passage referred to a physical miracle, where Abraham was physically shown the entire kingdom of Heaven (Jannah), others <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{it refers to the}} spiritual understanding of Abraham; these latter scholars maintain that the Chaldeans were skilled in the observance of the stars, but Abraham, who lived amongst them, saw beyond the physical world and into a higher spiritual realm. The second passage has one mainstream interpretation amongst the Qur'anic commentators, that Abraham took four birds and cut them up, placing pieces of each on nearby hills; when he called out to them, each piece joined and four birds flew back to Abraham. This miracle, as told by the Qur'anic passage, was a demonstration by God to show Abraham how God gave life to the dead. As the physical cutting of the birds is not implied in the passage, some commentators have offered alternative interpretations, but all maintain that the miracle was for the same demonstrative purpose to show Abraham the power God has to raise the dead to life. The third passage has also been interpreted both literally and metaphorically, or in some cases both. Commentators state that the 'fire' refers to main aspects. They maintained that, firstly, the fire referred to the physical flame, from which Abraham was saved unharmed. The commentators further stated that, secondly, the fire referred to the 'fire of persecution', from which Abraham was saved, as he left his people after this with his wife Sarah and his nephew Lot.|$|E

500|$|At {{a meeting}} {{attended}} by {{the commander of}} Special Branch in Manchester, a GMP assistant chief constable and a [...] "senior officer" [...] from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), it was decided, for reasons never made public, not to present {{the findings of the}} investigation to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the body responsible for undertaking criminal prosecutions in England. The three may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> as the IRA suspects were already in police custody they were no longer a threat, or that to pursue the case against them may have jeopardised ongoing undercover operations. It was not until 1998 that the police finally sent their file to the CPS, who decided not to prosecute.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{seize the}} {{opportunity}} presented by More, John Marshall ducked[...] [...] [...] Without questioning the soundness or propriety of Marshall's decision, {{it is worth}} noting that the Court had previously entertained criminal appeals from the district without raising any such jurisdictional problem. One might reasonably wonder if the Court wanted to avoid a decision on the merits. By March of 1805, the repeal question had lost its political immediacy, and the impeachment strategy of the Jeffersonians had faltered. There was little to be gained in reopening the sores of the repeal battle. And Marshall may <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he had had his say on the critical matters of principle with his opinion in Marbury.|$|E
500|$|The see of Hereford {{had been}} vacant since 1127, and in 1130, King Henry I of England took {{the advice of}} the local magnates and {{nominated}} Bethune to the see. Bethune's diocesan bishop as prior, Urban, the Bishop of Llandaff, at first refused permission for Bethune's elevation. However, the archbishop of Canterbury, William of Corbeil, advised that the matter be referred to the papacy. Pope Innocent II ordered that Bethune be allowed to accept the see of Hereford in 1131. He was consecrated on 28 June 1131 at Rochester. In nominating Bethune, the king is said to <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he needed one [...] "godly bishop" [...] around. Most of Henry's bishops were given their sees as rewards for royal service, and were not particularly noted for piety.|$|E
