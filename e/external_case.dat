2500|$|Cristofori's pianos use an {{internal}} frame member (bentside) {{to support the}} soundboard; in other words, the structural member attaching {{the right side of}} the soundboard is distinct from the <b>external</b> <b>case</b> that bears the tension of the strings. This system was also applied by Cristofori to harpsichords. The use of a separate support for the soundboard reflects Cristofori's belief that the soundboard should not be subjected to compression from string tension. This may improve the sound, and also avoids the peril of warping—as harpsichord makers Kerstin Schwarz and Tony Chinnery point out , , a severely warped soundboard threatens a structural catastrophe, namely contact between strings and soundboard. Cristofori's principle continues to be applied in modern pianos, where the now-enormous string tension (up to 20 tons) is borne by a separate iron frame (the [...] "plate").|$|E

40|$|Size {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} measurements of software. For the past two decades, the source line of code (SLOC) and function point (FP) metrics have been dominating software sizing approaches. However both approaches have significant defects. For example, SLOC can only be counted when the software construction is complete, while the FP counting is time consuming, expensive, and subjective. In the late 1990 s researchers have been exploring faster, cheaper, and more effective sizing methods, such as Unified Modeling Language (UML) based software sizing. In this paper we present an empirical 14 -project-study of three different sizing metrics which cover different software life-cycle activities: requirement metrics (requirement), UML metrics (architecture), and SLOC metrics (implementation). Our results show that the software size in terms of SLOC was moderately well correlated with the number of <b>external</b> use <b>cases</b> and the number of classes. We also demonstrate that the number of sequence diagram steps per <b>external</b> use <b>case</b> is a possible complexity indicator of software size. However, we conclude that at least for this 14 -project eServices applications sample, the UML-based metrics were insufficiently well-defined and codified to serve as precise sizing metrics. 1...|$|R
