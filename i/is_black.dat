2500|$|..... the {{statement}} that all ravens <b>are</b> <b>black</b> <b>is</b> not merely satisfied by evidence of a <b>black</b> raven but <b>is</b> favored by such evidence, since a black raven disconfirms the contrary statement that all ravens <b>are</b> not <b>black,</b> i.e. satisfies its denial. A black raven, in other words, satisfies the hypothesis that all ravens <b>are</b> <b>black</b> rather than not: it thus selectively confirms that all ravens <b>are</b> <b>black.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the ship <b>is</b> <b>black.</b> Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the enemy <b>is</b> <b>black,</b> the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E
