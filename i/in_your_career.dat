She has credited Celia Franca, the Artistic Director, as being an important influence and coach during her development as a ballet dancer. She was promoted {{to the rank of}} principal dancer in 1965. Early in her career, she struggled with her weight. In an interview with Rose Eichenbaum, Van Hamel said, [...] "I think there is a small window <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>career</b> when you have some control." [...] She explained she was [...] "about three pounds too heavy" [...] and used weight as [...] "a way of rebelling against all the forces that controlled my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early October 2010, it was {{confirmed}} by the studio that Martin Freeman had officially been cast {{in the role of}} Bilbo Baggins. It was revealed that he had earlier been approached by the producers {{to play a role in}} the films, but was forced to turn it down because of scheduling conflicts with the BBC television series Sherlock. At the time, Freeman was quoted as saying, [...] "f something could be worked out, that would be great. I did it [...] with a heavy heart, definitely." [...] On his casting, Peter Jackson was quoted as saying, [...] "Despite the various rumours and speculation surrounding this role, there has only ever been one Bilbo Baggins for us. There are a few times <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>career</b> when you come across an actor who you know was born to play a role, but that was the case as soon as I met Martin Freeman. He is intelligent, funny, surprising and brave—exactly like Bilbo and I feel incredibly proud to be able to announce that he is our Hobbit." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>career,</b> nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E

You want a woman who will be wrapped up <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>career,</b> Hugh, and yet who will not share it,--who will devote herself body and soul to what you have become.

It's not a bit of good pretending there's any Higher Truth or {{wonderful}} principle in this business. There isn't. We never started out in any high-browed manner to scandalize and Shelleyfy. When first you left your home you had no idea that I was the hidden impulse. I wasn't. You came out like an ant for your nuptial flight. It was just a chance that we in particular hit against each other--nothing predestined about it. We just hit against each other, and here we are flying off at a tangent, a little surprised at what we are doing, all our principles abandoned, and tremendously and quite unreasonably proud of ourselves. Out of all this we have struck a sort of harmony.... And it's gorgeous!" ...|$|E

You must collect your friends about you. Our {{government}} is not too strong, I can tell you. We must brush up in the recess. What with Mr. Bertie Tremaine and his friends joining the Protectionists, and the ultra-Radicals wanting, as they always do, something impossible, I see seeds of discomfiture unless they are met with energy. You stand high, and are well spoken of even by our opponents. Whether we stand or fall, it is a moment for you to increase your personal influence. That is the element now to encourage <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>career,</b> because you are not like the old fogies in the cabinet, who, if they go out, will never enter another again.

I have cast your horoscope, and I find that the conjunction of the planets at your birth was eminently favourable. It seems to me that about this time you will pass through many perilous adventures, but you are destined to escape any dangers that threaten you.

There are other things <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>career</b> that are uncertain, since I cannot tell at what date they are likely to occur and whether the planets that were favourable at your birth may again be in the ascendant; but, for as much as I have told you, I have no doubt whatever." ...|$|E

I have often wondered what these islands are for--now, you see, I am wiser. This one at least is for you. Sooner or later some simple native will come along and take you off. Say what you like about us then--abuse us, if you like--we shan't care a solitary Grenadine! And here--here is half a sovereign's worth of silver. Do not waste that in foolish dissipation when you return to civilisation. Properly used, it may give you a fresh start in life.
