5|$|At the University of Heidelberg, Goebbels {{wrote his}} {{doctoral}} thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th century romantic dramatist. He {{had hoped to}} write <b>his</b> <b>thesis</b> {{under the supervision of}} Friedrich Gundolf, who at that time was a well known literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. However, Gundolf was no longer performing teaching duties, so he directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg.

5|$|Tronstad {{spent the}} first year of a {{research}} period as an assistant to Herbert Freundlich in Dahlem, Berlin. He studied the passivity of metal surfaces, and made a breakthrough when he managed to measure extremely thin oxide surface coatings, thus solving a problem dating from the time of Michael Faraday. He continued to Stockholm to study metallography under Carl Benedicks, and to elaborate further on his results from Berlin. The work was completed in 1931 and <b>his</b> <b>thesis,</b> spanning 250 pages, was published in German as Optische Untersuchungen zur Frage der Passivität des Eisens und Stahls. For it, he received the doctorate degree. He was hired at the Norwegian Institute of Technology as a lecturer in the summer of 1931, although he {{spent the first}} year at the University of Cambridge, conducting further research with a scholarship from a memorial fund of Christian Michelsen.

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Jamaica High School in 1958, Savage {{attended}} Queens College, where {{he earned a}} bachelor's degree in biology in 1963. After college Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in Millbrook, New York, to which Leary had been given access.
