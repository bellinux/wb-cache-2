40|$|Abstract. A quantum {{mechanical}} {{formulation of}} the distorted-wave Born theory is presented, taking full account of the internuclear potential. Upon expansion in terms {{of one of the}} two electronic potentials, the strong-potential Born theory is rederived. Thereby an additional term emerges which had not been considered previously and which has considerable influence on the capture probability at large scattering angles. The distorted-wave Born (DWB) theory as introduced by Taulbjerg and Briggs (1983) gives a consistent description of charge transfer in energetic near-symmetric ion-atom collisions provided that sufficient care is taken to avoid <b>divergencies</b> (Macek 1987) <b>which</b> emerge in the case of Coulomb potentials (Dewangan and Eichler 1985). The DWB theory consists of the first term in an expansion of the exact scattering amplitude in terms of a distortion potential, which is defined through the choice of strong-potential Born wavefunctions as distorted waves in the initial and final channels (Burgdorfer and Taulbjerg 1986). By means of construction, the DWB theory is symmetric with respect to the two electron-nucleus potentials. A first-order expansion in one of the potentials yields the familiar strong-potential Born (SPB) approximation (Macek and Shakeshaft 1980, JakubaBa-Amundsen and Amundsen 1980) which has been success-fully applied to asymmetric collision systems (Macek and Alston 1982, Amundsen an...|$|R

A detailed analysis of the infrared structure of the perturbative series of the theory is presented. We start by analyzing the two-point Green’s function, in the Bloch-Nordsieck approximation. The theory appears to be plagued by severe infrared <b>divergencies,</b> <b>which</b> nevertheless disappear when vacuumpolarization effects are non-perturbatively taken into account. The dynamical induction of a Chern-Simons term is at the root of this mechanism.

We calculate numerically the binding energies and average radius of the bound states.

Next, we employ a thermodynamical metric for studying thermodynamical geometry of these black holes.

However, owing to its low -galactosidase activities, Xc 17 can't grow well in the medium containing lactose as the sole carbon source, so it can''t directly use whey as a substrate for xanthan production. A lactose-utilizing strain of X. campestris strain (Xc 17 L) obtained by nitrous acid mutagenesis can use lactose directly for xanthan gum production without incorporation of any exotic DNA or antibiotic resistance gene is reported here. The results of characteristic analyses of Xc 17 L, including -galactosidase activity, optimal condition of enzymatic activity, strain stability and xanthan gum production, indicate that Xc 17 L is potentially useful for xanthan production from whey. In the genome of Xc 17, three annotated -galactosidase genes (galA, galB and galC) are molecularly characterized. Opposite to GalA and GalB which show no detectable enzyme levels even after being cloned in-frame with the lacZ'' gene of vector, GalC displays significant -galactosidase activity. Based {{on the results of}} insertional mutation, transcriptional fusion assay and Western blotting, galC is co-transcribed with the upstream gene(s) and expressed constitutively. GalC is a homologue of X. axonopodis pv. manihotis Bga proposed to be involved in cleaving - 1, 3 - and - 1, 4 -linked galactose from the terminal position of polysaccharide chains available in the environment instead of lactose. The homology together with the genome organization suggest that galC is not responsible for lactose utilization, but polysaccharide degradation. Xc 17 appears to be deficient in lactose uptake system, because Xc 17 carrying cloned lacZY can grow on lactose but not those with cloned galC or lacZ only. Results of DNA sequencing of galA and galB, mutation in galA, galB and galC, and the Western blotting of galC indicate that the galA, galB and galC genes are not correlated to the elevation of -galactosidae activity in Xc 17 L. A novel -galactosidase gene, galD, is revealed by insertional mutagenesis, and its homology, galE, exists in the genome. GalD, indeed expressed in Xc 17, exists obvious -galactosidase activity, but GalE shows no detectable enzymatic activity. Combined the genome organization and Western blotting, it is indicated that galD is co-transcribed with the upstream two genes. The results of phylogenetic analysis strongly suggest that galD and galE form a separately evolutional <b>divergency</b> <b>which</b> is significantly different from the traditionally well-known GH 35 family. Comparing the amino acid sequences of galD and galE in Xc 17 and Xc 17 L, no difference is observed. But, the result of Western blotting indicates that the amount of GalD expressed in Xc 17 L is as three times as that in Xc 17 which shows a perfect consistence between the -galactosidase activity and the expressed amount of GalD. So, elevated -galactosidase activity in Xc 17 L results from amount of GalD. Using the strategy of affinity chromatography,GalD protein can be purified and a lot of key factors determining the enzyme activity of GalD are revealed. Seven amino acid residues of GalD are substituted by site-directed mutagenesis, separately, and effects of a. a. substitution on the enzyme activity of GalD are evaluated. 英文摘要 中文摘要 I. 前言 II. 材料與方法 (A) 材料 一、 菌種及質體 二、 藥品、酵素及放射性同位素 三、 培養基 四、 抗生素濃度 五、 試劑與緩衝溶液 (B) 方法 一、 DNA 之製備 二、 電泳分析 三、 DNA選殖 四、 轉形作用 五、 質體快速篩檢法 六、 亞硝酸鈉突變法 七、 致病性測試 八、 生長曲線 九、 -galactosidase 活性測定 十、 黃原膠定量 十一、 蛋白質含量的測定 十二、 南方轉漬法 十三、 點測試法 (spot test) 十四、 聚合酶連鎖反應(PCR) 十五、 GalC 及 GalD 蛋白之大量表現與純化 十六、 抗 GalC 或 GalD 之抗血清之製備 十七、 西方轉漬法 十八、 接合生殖 (conjugation) 十九、 定點突變 (site-directed mutagenesis) III. 結果 (A) 乳糖利用突變株(lactose-utilizing mutant) Xc 17 L之篩選與 特性分析 (一) 菌落外觀等特性 (二) 生長曲線 (三) -galactosidase 最佳活性條件之分析及活性之測定 (四) Xc 17 L 的穩定性 (五) 黃原膠產量的測定 (B) Xc 17 整個基因體中，三個 -galactosidase 基因之選殖與分析 (一) galA 1. galA 基因的選殖及特性分析 2. galA基因的表現與GalA 之-galactosidase活性分析 3. galA 鄰近基因的組成 (genome organization) (二) galB 1. galB 基因的選殖及特性分析 2. galB基因的表現與GalB之-galactosidase活性分析 3. galB 鄰近基因的組成 (genome organization) (三) galC 1. galC 基因的選殖及特性分析 2. galC基因的表現與GalC 之-galactosidase活性分析 3.

Istovremeno se osniva Ravnateljstvo za javni red i sigurnost (RAVSIGUR) kao standarna policija s posve ograničenim pravima i Ustaška nadzorna služba (UNS) kao tajna državna policija, izgrađena po uzoru na njemački Gestapo. Istovremeno se uspostavljala i mreža nižih policijskih organa. Zbog nesređenih prilika u Srijemu 1942. godine je osnovano Više redarstveno povjerenstvo na čelu s Viktorom Tomićem. With the {{foundation}} of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) in April 1941, there also came to the establishment of organized police forces. Simultaneously, the so-called Direction for Public Order and Security (RAVSIGUR) was founded as a standard form of police force with limited rights, and the so-called Ustasha Surveillance Service (UNS) as the secret state police, structured on analogy to the German Gestapo. This went {{hand in hand with the}} establishment of lower-rank police bodies. Due to some unsettled circumstances, a Higher Police Committee was founded in Srijem in 1942, which was headed by Viktor Tomić. After the emergence of RAVSIGUR and UNS, which were both headed by the same person (Dido Kvaternik), any police operations, whether handled by the protection or župa (county) police forces, were under the control of the Office I of UNS. This gave a guarantee of a functional unity and ensured that there be no adverse effects in case of <b>divergencies</b> in practice, <b>which</b> were theoretically conceivable; all top management was in a single man 2 ̆ 7 s hands. In practice there came to overlaps in jurisdictions only in those places where there were protection forces; in Zagreb, Sarajevo and for a short while in Banja Luka. Namely, the župa police jurisdictions as well as the police jurisdiction of the city of Zagreb also comprised within their structure separate political divisions with, at least in theory, the same objectives as the protection forces. Since the very inception of NDH, all through 1943 there were in NDH two police force organizations, i. e. RAVSIGUR with limited rights and authority and the UNS with unlimited authorities as a secret state police, built on the model of the Gestapo. At the very beginning the entire UNS apparatus was filled by completely inexperienced and for the most part unprofessional staff, who had only come to acquire the regulatory and intelligence-service competencies required as they gained more and more experience. This explains at least the initial disorientation and errors which could not have been avoided. This also resulted in frequent shifts in work methods. The organization itself developed at a gradual pace. Taking all that into consideration, UNS achieved significant results, and such results could only have been achieved thanks to a complete reliance in the work of most employees. Due to some unsettled matters in Srijem, i. e. due to the strengthening of the Partisan resistance movement, in 1942 E. Dido Kvaternik prompted, and Pavelić ordered, {{the foundation}} of the Higher Police Committee...|$|R
40|$|We {{apply the}} methods of Field Theory to study the {{turbulent}} regimes of statistical systems. First we show how one can find their probability densities. For {{the case of the}} theory of wave turbulence with four-wave interaction we calculate them explicitly and study their properties. Using those densities we show how one can in principle calculate any correlation function in this theory by means of direct perturbative expansion in powers of the interaction. Then we give the general form of the corrections to the kinetic equation and develop an appropriate diagrammatic technique. This technique, while resembling that of ϕ 4 theory, has many new distinctive features. The role of the ǫ = d − 4 parameter of ϕ 4 theory is played here by the parameter κ = β + d − α − γ where β is the dimension of the interaction, d is the space dimension, α is the dimension of the energy spectrum and γ is the “classical ” wave density dimension. If κ> 0 then the Kolmogorov index is exact, and if κ < 0 then we expect it to be modified by the interaction. For κ a small negative number, α < 1 and a special form of the interaction we compute this modification explicitly with the additional assumption of the irrelevance of the IR <b>divergencies</b> <b>which</b> still needs to be verified...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{comparison of}} Is 6 and 1 Kings 22, 19 – 22 {{reveals that the}} two texts substantially differ in their worlds of thought and intentions. They are not based on {{a common set of}} ideas – a characteristic which would be required if they were to constitute a single genre. As a visionary commission account, 1 Kings 22, 19 – 22 is the objective testimony of an independent prophet who was granted insight into the heavenly council. The text represents JHWH as an unostentatious king with superior dominion over history. He defeats his sworn enemy Ahab by turning the latter’s own eagerness for power into a deadly weapon against him. Is 6, on the other hand, is a vocation account where the prophet gives a personal testimony of how he saw the holy and divine king of kings ruling from his lofty throne. In the course of this visionary experience, the prophet is saved from his people’s mortal entanglement in sin and impurity by accepting the commission of hardening. JHWH appears as the centre of the cosmos, the master of a divine and life-engendering order. Anything alive, from the seraphim to the creatures populating the earth, is oriented towards him. This "fullness of all the earth" (Isa 6, 3) is, at the same time, passively filled with and actively praising his glory. JHWH’s people do not participate in this abundance of life since their sin and impurity imply the practical rejection of JHWH’s rule and its benefits. With the help of divine grace, the prophet is removed from his people’s way to death when he recognizes JHWH as king and serves him as an envoy. By fulfilling the commission of hardening, the prophet ultimately reestablishes JHWH’s rule in his people’s heart - although this paradoxically results in their complete alienation from JHWH and brings them from the sphere of life to that of death and chaos. The above-outlined substantial differences of the two texts go along with formal and structural <b>divergencies</b> <b>which</b> outweigh the similarities on the textual surfaces. All in all, the comparison shows that the two texts do not follow the same generic pattern but use a number of traditional narrative elements independent of any specific genre. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{subtraction}} {{procedure of}} Dyson is modified {{in order to}} eliminate a certain difficulty in the renormalization programme, namely the so-called ‘ b ’ divergencies, The conclusions of Dyson concerning the finiteness of the renormalized S matrix are confirmed. I T {{has been shown to}} be very probable that the <b>divergencies</b> <b>which</b> arise in quantum electrodynamics manifest themselves in unobservable mass and charge renormalization effects alone (Dyson 1949). The demonstration of this behaviour rested, however, on a correct, but hitherto unproved, hypothesis concerning the behaviour of divergencies associated with self-energy Feynman graphs, the ‘ b ’ divergencies in Dyson terminology. By a slight change of Dyson’s renormalization procedure, it is possible to avoid this difficulty, and the proof of the finiteness of the renormalized matrix is complete. We shall use the notation of Dyson, and refer the reader to his paper for the meaning of the notation used. The difficulties referred to above arise because it is possible to regard a reducible self-energy part of a graph as constructed from irreducible components in many different ways, according as vertex parts are considered to be inserted at ane vertex or the other of the irreducible second order graph, and each possible way in fact contributes separately to the resulting divergencies. A method of avoiding the ambiguity of construction of reducible self-energy parts will therefore be explained here, which makes use of the formal identity (Ward 1950) If we definep”=pA+p’(l-A) wherep ’ is the energy-momentum vector of a free electron then 2 ~ =-) 257 j: W,-PL:) ~~,(~~, pi) where the effects of the contribution of the mass renormalization term to Cy have been taken into account. A, (V’,,P’,,P”) will now contain the infinities arising from inserted self-energy and vertex parts in the V as well as the divergence associated with the Y ’ themselvesa However, there is now no overlapping of divergent parts, and the finite parts may be separated out unambiguously in sequence. An analogous procedure may be adopted for the reduction of photon S. E* parts. It is here necessary to define a new linearly divergent operator A,(tl, ta) by the equation tz) = Apt, tl, h>. all X...|$|E
