50|$|Galleting, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} garretting or <b>garnetting,</b> is an architectural technique in which {{small pieces of}} stone are pushed into wet mortar during {{the construction of a}} building. It is mostly used for stone building when freestone is not available, since it helps to fill the uneven gaps and reinforces the mortar. Although primarily for this purpose, it is sometimes also used for decorative effect. Norwich Guildhall is an early 15th-century example, but the technique was used in vernacular architecture until the 19th century. In higher status buildings it was superseded by square knapping the flints to produce flat, squared stones that produced a surface with little exposed mortar.|$|E

Based on the concentrations of Cr 2 O 3, CaO, TiO 2 and rare earth elements (REE) the <b>garnets</b> were divided into seven groups: (1) lherzolitic “depleted” <b>garnets</b> (“Lz 1 ”), (2) lherzolitic <b>garnets</b> with normal REE patterns (“Lz 2 ”), (3) lherzolitic <b>garnets</b> with weakly sinusoidal REE patterns (“Lz 3 ”), (4) lherzolitic <b>garnets</b> with strongly sinusoidal REE patterns (“Lz 4 ”), (5) harzburgitic <b>garnets</b> with sinusoidal REE patterns (“Hz”), (6) wehrlitic <b>garnets</b> with weakly sinusoidal REE patterns (“W”), (7) <b>garnets</b> of megacryst paragenesis with normal REE patterns (“Meg”). Detailed mineralogical and geochemical <b>garnet</b> studies and modeling results suggest several stages of mantle metasomatism influenced by carbonatite and silicate melts. Carbonatitic metasomatism at the first stage resulted in refertilization of the lithospheric mantle, which is evidenced by a nearly vertical CaO-Cr 2 O 3 trend from harzburgitic (“Hz”) to lherzolitic (“Lz 4 ”) <b>garnet</b> composition. Harzburgitic <b>garnets</b> (“Hz”) have probably been formed by interactions between carbonatite melts and exsolved <b>garnets</b> in high-degree melt extraction residues. At the second stage of metasomatism, <b>garnets</b> with weakly sinusoidal REE patterns (“Lz 3 ”, “W”) were affected by a silicate melt possessing a REE composition similar to that of ADP alkaline mica-poor picrites. At the last stage, the <b>garnets</b> interacted with basaltic melts, which resulted in the decrease CaO-Cr 2 O 3 trend of “Lz 2 ” <b>garnet</b> composition. Cr-poor <b>garnets</b> of megacryst paragenesis (“Meg”) could crystallize directly from the silicate melt which has a REE composition close to that of ADP alkaline mica-poor picrites.

40|$|Abstract Numerical {{thermodynamic}} modelling of min-eral {{composition and}} modes for specified pressure-tem-perature paths reveals the strong influence of fractional <b>garnet</b> crystallisation, {{as well as}} water fractionation, on <b>garnet</b> growth histories in high pressure rocks. Dis-equilibrium element incorporation in <b>garnet</b> due {{to the development of}} chemical inhomogeneities around por-phyroblasts leads to pronounced episodic growth and may even cause growth interruptions. Discontinuous growth, together with pressure- and temperature-dependent changes in <b>garnet</b> chemistry, cause zonation patterns that are indicative of different degrees of dis-equilibrium element incorporation. Chemical inhomo-geneities in the matrix surrounding <b>garnet</b> porphyroblasts strongly affect <b>garnet</b> growth and lead to compositional discontinuities and steep compositional gradients in the <b>garnet</b> zonation pattern. Further, in-tergranular diffusion-controlled calcium incorporation can lead to a characteristic rise in grossular and spes-sartine contents at lower metamorphic conditions. The observation that <b>garnet</b> zonation patterns diagnostic of large and small fractionation effects coexist within the same sample suggests that <b>garnet</b> growth is often con-trolled by small-scale variations in the bulk rock chem-istry. Therefore, the spatial distribution of <b>garnet</b> grains and their zonation patterns, together with numerical growth models of <b>garnet</b> zonation patterns, yield infor-mation about the processes limiting <b>garnet</b> growth. These processes include intercrystalline element trans-port and dissolution of pre-existing grains. Discontinu-ities in <b>garnet</b> growth induced by limited element supply can mask traces of the thermobarometric history of the rock.

Electron back-scattered diffraction, {{transmission electron microscopy}} and scanning electron microscope imaging coupled with quantitative analysis of digitized images (PolyLX software) {{have been used in}} order to understand the deformation mechanisms associated with this grain-size evolution. The <b>garnet</b> grain-size reduction trend has been summarized in a typological evolution (from Type I to Type IV). Type I, the original porphyroblasts, form cm-sized elongated grains that crystallized upon multiple nucleation and coalescence following biotite breakdown: biotite + sillimanite + quartz = <b>garnet</b> + alkali feldspar + rutile + melt. These large <b>garnet</b> grains contain quartz ribbons and sillimanite inclusions. Type I <b>garnet</b> is sheared along preferential planes (sillimanite layers, quartz ribbons and ⁄ or suitably oriented <b>garnet</b> crystallographic planes) producing highly elongated Type II <b>garnet</b> grains marked by a single crystallographic orientation. Further deformation leads to the development of a crystallographic misorientation, subgrains and new grains resulting in Type III <b>garnet.</b> Associated grainsize reduction occurs via subgrain rotation recrystallization accompanied by fast diffusion-assisted dislocation glide. This plastic deformation of <b>garnet</b> is associated with efficient recovery as shown by the very low dislocation densities (1010 m) 3 or lower). The rounded Type III <b>garnet</b> experiences rigid body rotation in fine-grained matrix.
