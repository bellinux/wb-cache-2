5|$|Lemoine's work defined many of {{the noted}} traits of this movement. His Géométrographie and {{relation}} of equations to tetrahedrons and triangles, as well as <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of concurrencies and concyclities, contributed to the modern triangle geometry of the time. The definition of points of the triangle such as the Lemoine point was also {{a staple of the}} geometry, and other modern triangle geometers such as Brocard and Gaston Tarry wrote about similar points.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo started <b>his</b> <b>study</b> in {{the anatomy}} {{of the human body}} under the {{apprenticeship}} of Andrea del Verrocchio, who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject. As an artist, he quickly became master of topographic anatomy, drawing many studies of muscles, tendons and other visible anatomical features.|$|E
50|$|He started <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> in {{chemistry}} at Moscow State University, but <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> were {{interrupted by the}} outbreak of World War II. Talrose served in the Soviet Army and was wounded and hospitalized three times. He returned to <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> in 1945, graduating in 1947.|$|R
50|$|Many of <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> were {{followed}} by Gustav Fechner and Le Corbusier, who elaborated <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> of human proportion to develop the Modulor.|$|R
50|$|In 1861 Eis began <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> for {{the priesthood}} at St. Francis Seminary in Milwaukee. <b>His</b> <b>studies</b> were {{interrupted}} by the American Civil War, which prompted Bishop Frederic Baraga {{to send him to}} the College of Joliette in Canada to complete <b>his</b> <b>studies.</b> During <b>his</b> final years at Joliette, he taught English, mathematics and commerce.|$|R
5|$|Marx {{longed to}} return to his {{economic}} studies, as he had left these studies in 1844 and had been preoccupied with other projects over the last thirteen years. By returning to <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of economics, Marx felt {{he would be able to}} understand more thoroughly what was occurring in the world.|$|E
5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. <b>His</b> <b>study</b> concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. <b>His</b> <b>study</b> concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia: The Epigenetic Puzzle {{outlined}} the approaches, conclusions and models Gottesman used in <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of schizophrenia. He co-wrote {{the book with}} James Shields, who died before it was published. The book introduces methods for diagnosing schizophrenia in a research setting, taking into account national differences in how the disorder was defined, debunked myths such as the mother transmitting schizophrenia, and introduced the concepts of the threshold model and the reaction range.|$|E
50|$|In late 1994, Tanović {{left the}} film crew {{he had worked}} with for over two years. A year later, Tanović decided to resume <b>his</b> <b>studies,</b> this time in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. In 1997, Tanović {{completed}} <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> in Brussels, graduating {{at the top of}} his class.

5|$|Though cyclizations {{following}} the general template above had been observed prior to Nazarov's involvement, it was <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones {{that marked the}} first major examination of this process. Nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring closure to the cyclopentenone product. The reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to New York, Koppelman continued <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of Aesthetic Realism, {{and under the}} G.I. Bill, he studied at the Amédée Ozenfant School and became Ozenfant's assistant. While he continued to exhibit sculpture and drawings, he also began printmaking, a medium which, he said, combines the carving quality of sculpture with the subtleties of light and shade in drawing and painting.|$|E
5|$|Willard Spiegelman, in <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of Romantic poetry, {{suggests}} that the indolence of the poem arises from the narrator's reluctance to apply himself to the labour associated with poetic creation. Some critics provide other explanations, and William Ober claims that Keats's description of indolence may have arisen {{from the use of}} opium.|$|E
25|$|Mucha {{moved to}} Paris in 1887, and {{continued}} <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> at Académie Julian and Académie Colarossi. In addition to <b>his</b> <b>studies,</b> {{he worked at}} producing magazine and advertising illustrations.|$|R
50|$|He was {{the seventh}} {{son of a}} wine grower. After {{completing}} <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> in the Roman Catholic Secondary School, he began studies in the University of Pest. The 1848 European revolutions disrupted <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> and due <b>his</b> active participation was imprisoned and after enrolled in the Imperial Army. Finally, he finished <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> graduating in 1854 in the Military Engineering Academy in Vienna.|$|R
50|$|He focused <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> {{there on}} mathematics, physics and engineering. He {{continued}} <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> in National University of San Marcos and former Escuela de Ingenieros, now National University of Engineering.|$|R
5|$|According to {{specialist}} Gabriel Defert on {{the basis}} of statistical data available from the Portuguese and Indonesian authorities, and from the Catholic Church, between December 1975 and December 1981, approximately 308,000 Timorese lost their lives; this constituted about 44% of the pre-invasion population. Similarly Indonesian Professor George Aditjondro, formerly of Salatiga University in Java, concluded from <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of Indonesian Army data that in fact 300,000 Timorese had been killed {{in the early years of}} the occupation.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple—the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy published in 1940, 10years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500years. While <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.|$|E
5|$|Although Emerson {{credits his}} grandfather's {{gift of a}} Barlow knife {{to him at the}} age of eight years with {{starting}} his interest in knives, it was not until later in life that he turned to making them. The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a balisong knife for <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of a Filipino martial art and, unable to afford one on his salary, Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead. He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his dining room table with a butane torch.|$|E
50|$|In 1972 {{he started}} <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> in Master of Philosophy in Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, India and finally {{completed}} <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> with Ph.D {{from the same}} university in 1978.|$|R

5|$|Chartwell is {{a country}} house {{near the town of}} Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the {{property}} in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in <b>his</b> <b>study,</b> he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of his expeditions Beebe {{gradually}} developed an interest in marine biology, ultimately leading to his 1930s dives in the Bathysphere, along with its inventor, Otis Barton, off the coast of Bermuda. This was the first time a biologist observed deep-sea animals in their native environment, and set several successive records for the deepest dive ever performed by a human, the deepest of which stood until it was broken by Barton 15 years later. Following his Bathysphere dives, Beebe returned to the tropics and began to focus <b>his</b> <b>study</b> on the behavior of insects. In 1949, he founded a tropical research station in Trinidad which he named Simla, and which remains in operation as part of the Asa Wright Nature Centre. Beebe's research at Simla continued until his death from pneumonia in 1962 at the age of 84.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} from 1935 to 1956, Jolin {{spent much of his}} time travelling. In 1954, he toured the United States with an exhibition. It was opened in January, by Swedish {{ambassador}} Erik Boheman, at Galerie St. Etienne in New York. Secretary-General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld, attended the exhibition and bought a painting depicting Riddarholmen for <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of the United Nations building. The exhibition was shown on national TV in the United States. Jolin also exhibited his works at galleries in several other countries, and in 1957, the Liljevalchs konsthall hosted a retrospective exhibition featuring over 200 of his paintings.|$|E

5|$|Fermi {{was fond}} of {{pointing}} out that Alessandro Volta, working in his laboratory, could have {{had no idea where}} the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E
5|$|Following a footballing career spent {{exclusively}} with Torpedo, Streltsov, {{a supporter of}} Spartak Moscow, repeatedly complained about his failure to play for his favourite team. After his retirement, Torpedo continued to pay his salary to fund <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of football coaching at the Institute of Physical Culture. Streltsov returned to Torpedo in the capacity of youth team manager following his qualification; he also spent a brief spell as manager of the first team {{before returning to the}} youth team in 1982. He also took part in matches contested by former players before dying in 1990 from throat cancer, which his first wife Alla later claimed had been brought about by irradiated food served to him in the camps. Seven years later, Marina Lebedeva, the woman Streltsov had confessed to raping, was seen laying flowers at his grave in Moscow on the day after the anniversary of his death.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>his</b> <b>study</b> in Puerto Rico, in 1933 Rhoads {{was chosen}} to lead a special service at the Rockefeller Institute in {{clinical}} hematology, to study diseases of the blood-forming organs.
