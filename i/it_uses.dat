The soles of its paws are nearly bare {{and covered with}} strong pads. The fossa has very flexible ankles that allow it to readily grasp tree trunks so as to climb up or down trees head first or to leap to another tree.

40|$|The {{information}} systems (IS) community has developed many theories, approaches, and models that identify conditions and determinants of successful <b>IT</b> <b>use.</b> However, each {{model in the}} IS literature has evolved to address specific aspects and dimensions. This has led to conflicting results concerning the impact of <b>IT</b> <b>use.</b> Consequently, while a rich body of knowledge has emerged, with prominent models such as the Technology Acceptance Model or the IS Success Model, the complexity of defining a suitable multi-dimensional construct for <b>IT</b> <b>use</b> has largely been neglected. In this paper, we develop a new causal model of <b>IT</b> <b>use.</b> Based on Adaptive Structuration Theory, we argue for the multidimensionality of <b>IT</b> <b>use</b> and thoroughly derive its components. Moreover, we introduce two new concepts into studies of successful IT use: functional affordance and symbolic expression. Both establish a relation between the IT system under investigation and its users. In doing so, we provide a novel, synthesized approach for investigating <b>IT</b> <b>use</b> {{in the context of}} post-adoptive behaviours and the framework of Adaptive Structuration Theory...|$|R
