FDA found that lemon and lime juice was held in unsanitary conditions, which was a potential <b>health</b> <b>threat</b> to consumers.

5|$|The {{human body}} absorbs {{strontium}} {{as if it}} were its lighter congener calcium. Because the elements are chemically very similar, stable strontium isotopes do not pose a significant <b>health</b> <b>threat.</b> The average human has an intake of about two milligrams of strontium a day. In adults, strontium consumed tends to attach only to the surface of bones, but in children, strontium can replace calcium in the mineral of the growing bones and thus lead to bone growth problems.|$|E
5|$|Outside a {{protective}} atmosphere and magnetic field, {{there are few}} obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 106eV up to an extreme 1020eV of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of electrons is only about 1% of that of protons. Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a <b>health</b> <b>threat</b> to space travelers. According to astronauts, like Don Pettit, space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an arc welding torch.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} how {{the proximity}} of threatening health news affects cognition and emotion through a 2 (Proximity: High=Low) 4 (Topic) fractional experiment. Fifty-one participants read four news stories about either local or distant <b>health</b> <b>threats,</b> with their heart rate, skin conductance, and corrugator electromyography recorded. Results showed that high-proximity <b>health</b> <b>threats</b> elicited greater heart rate deceleration than did lowproximity <b>health</b> <b>threats,</b> indicating greater allocation of automatic resources to encoding high-proximity threats. Recognition data demonstrated that details from high-proximity <b>health</b> <b>threats</b> were recognized more accurately than details from low-proximity <b>health</b> <b>threats.</b> There were no significant effects of proximity on either skin conductance levels or corrugator activation.

5|$|In Belize, the {{rainfall}} in {{one week}} represented the average monthly values at some stations. Heavy rainfall from the depression caused levels to rise along rivers and creeks. A bridge that had been rebuilt following earlier Tropical Storm Arthur was flooded, prompting the Belize Defence Force to assist in crossings. This isolated much of Cayo District {{from the rest of}} the country until the bridge was repaired. On the western portion of the district, flooding along the Macal River damaged a bridge crossing into northern Guatemala, which restricted traffic only to people returning home. Levels along the Macal and the Belize River were higher than the floods of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, but less than that of Hurricane Keith in 2000. The floods caused residents to evacuate after over 1,000homes were flooded; 311people stayed in shelters, while the remainder stayed with families and relatives. Of the affected houses, 12 were destroyed and 802 were severely damaged. Most of the affected population was in rural areas of western Belize. One village in Orange Walk District had to be quarantined due to the <b>health</b> <b>threat</b> from the floods for 25days. Many roads were closed, and there were widespread school closures. Overall, the floods killed two people in the country and caused BZ$54.1million (BZD, $27.1million USD) in damage. Most of the damage was agricultural, accounting for BZ$28.2million (BZD, $14.1million USD), or 25% of the country's agricultural gross domestic product. Other damage included BZ$11.7million (BZD, $6.3million USD) to roads and bridges. The ongoing floods caused BZ$2.7million (BZD, $1.5million USD) in tourism losses, due to closed facilities and water damage.|$|E

40|$|MedISys is a media {{monitoring}} system initially intended for news {{items related to}} human health. The tool has how been extended by the Joint Research Centre, Universitat de Lleida and IRTA to also deal with plant <b>health</b> <b>threats.</b> This EFSA-funded project {{was based on a}} knowledge representation approach that generated an ontology, a formal representation of knowledge related to plant <b>health</b> <b>threats.</b> The ontology models plant pests and diseases, together with other concepts related with them: affected crops, hosts, vectors and symptoms. First of all, a collection of news sources related to plant <b>health</b> <b>threats</b> was collected to be monitored by MedISys. These sources included already known manually curated Web pages but also additional ones discovered by performing global Web searches using terms appearing in the ontology. Then, the news items coming from these sources were filtered using MedISys using a set of categories with keywords to identify those actually about plant <b>health</b> <b>threats.</b> Most of these categories focused on known threats and used terms associated with the 117 pests and diseases selected {{at the beginning of the}} project. Additionally, categories for unknown threats were also developed. In this case the categories included keywords that are usually used by experts to describe unknown threats and keywords related with symptoms expressions. All these MedISys categories combined provide mechanism to monitor plant <b>health</b> <b>threats</b> mentions in media, from newspapers to social media, ranging from those that explicitly mention a named threat (useful to monitor re-emerging threats or their spread) to those related to unknown ones (to monitor potential new threats). The project concluded with an evaluation of the e-mail alerts and reports generated by MedISys based on the previous categories. A survey and tests with real users were conducted and the results analysed to generate a set of recommendations and improvements to facilitate the use of MedISys as a plant <b>health</b> <b>threats</b> monitoring tool...|$|R

The current socio-economic, environmental {{and public health}} challenges that countries are facing clearly need common-defined strategies to inform and support our transition to a sustainable economy. Here, the technology-critical elements (which includes Ga, Ge, In, Te, Nb, Ta, Tl, the Platinum Group Elements {{and most of the}} rare-earth elements) are of great relevance in the development of emerging key technologies—including renewable energy, energy efficiency, electronics or the aerospace industry. In this context, the increasing use of technology-critical elements (TCEs) and associated environmental impacts (from mining to end-of-life waste products) is not restricted to a national level but covers most likely a global scale. Accordingly, the European COST Action TD 1407 : Network on Technology-Critical Elements (NOTICE) —from environmental processes to human <b>health</b> <b>threats,</b> has an overall objective for creating a network of scientists and practitioners interested in TCEs, from the evaluation of their environmental processes to understanding potential human <b>health</b> <b>threats,</b> with the aim of defining the current state of [ [...] . ] COBELO-GARCÌA, A., et al.
