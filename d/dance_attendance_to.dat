60|$|Brain. I {{will not}} <b>dance</b> <b>attendance.</b> At the present, your closet shall be honoured.|$|R
6000|$|... "'What!' said I, 'you have gendarmes for guards, and <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> on bishops? There {{are no more}} janissaries and Jesuits, I suppose?' The {{sub-prefect}} smiled.|$|R
60|$|While curiosity {{was active}} in {{guessing}} at {{the business of the}} different individuals present, and whispers, nods, shrugs of the shoulders, and meaning glances, passed among the old stagers, as they communicated to each other the little they knew, or thought they knew, on different subjects, there stood {{in the corner of the}} principal apartment, one in particular, who might be distinguished from all around him, by his stature, the gravity and dignity of his air, and the peculiar sort of notice that he attracted. Few approached him, and they that did, as they turned their backs, cast those glances of self-sufficiency and ridicule about them, that characterize the vulgar-minded when they fancy that they are deriding or sneering in consonance with popular opinion. This was Columbus, who was very generally regarded by the multitude as a visionary schemer, and who necessarily shared in that sort of contemptuous obloquy that attaches itself to the character. But even the wit and jokes of the crowd had been expended upon this subject, and the patience of those who <b>danced</b> <b>attendance</b> was getting <b>to</b> be exhausted, when a little stir at the door announced the approach of some new courtier. The manner in which the throng quickly gave way, denoted the presence of some one of high rank, and presently Don Luis de Bobadilla stood in the centre of the room.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Thankful blushed slightly, but {{answered}} with savage celerity, [...] "And since {{when is it}} necessary that I should <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> upon every foreign jack-in-the-box that may lie at the house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Eh!' said Mr. Egremont. 'It is not entailed--worse luck; {{if it had}} been, I {{should not}} have been bound <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> at the heels of such an old sinner as the General.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No doubt,' said Annaple, 'but {{he has got}} a daughter, also a son, and a brother, {{and agents}} are plentiful, so I can't see why all the family should <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> on him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's hard,' said Charles, 'that {{having made}} the world <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> on me for my pleasure, I must now do it for theirs. But {{what do you think}} about telling her of this letter, or showing it, remembering that not a word about her {{troubles}} has passed between us?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ingratiate {{yourself}} with Miss Savine, or get that crack-brained aunt of hers to cure your neuralgia. There are also two young premium pupils, sons of leading Montreal citizens, in Mr. Savine's service, who <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> upon the fair Helen continually. It shouldn't {{be difficult to}} flatter them a little and set them talking." ...|$|R
60|$|ANTHONY. He goes, the coward! Ay, is {{this more}} of your contrivance? Madam, you make me blush. But to-day at least I know where I can find him. This afternoon, on the Pantiles, he must <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> on the Duke of York. Already he must be there; {{and there he is}} at my mercy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My {{father is}} very ill,' she said; 'and why am I called from his bedside? Why didn't you send to absolve {{me from my}} promise, when you wished I wouldn't keep it? Come! I desire an explanation: playing and trifling are {{completely}} banished out of my mind; and I can't <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> on your affectations now!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I like to {{hear you}} preach," [...] said he. [...] "Without a penny, indeed! Do {{you think that you}} would <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> upon him if he were a poor man? Do you think that Laura would ever have looked twice at him? You know as well as I do that she is marrying him only for his money." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY PLYMDALE. Because I {{want you}} to take my husband with you. He has been so {{attentive}} lately, that he has become a perfect nuisance. Now, this woman is just the thing for him. He'll <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> upon her as long as she lets him, and won't bother me. I assure you, women of that kind are most useful. They form the basis of other people's marriages.|$|R
60|$|Brain. What's the matter, gentlewoman? Am I {{excluded}} {{from my own}} fortress; {{and by the way}} of barricado? Am I <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> at the door, as if I were some base plebeian groom? I'll have you know, that, when my foot assaults, the lightning and the thunder are not so terrible as the strokes: brazen gates shall tremble, and bolts of adamant dismount from off their hinges, to admit me.|$|R
60|$|It was {{evening in}} the road of Groix. After a fagging day's work, trying to conciliate the hostile jealousy of his officers, and provide, {{in the face of}} endless {{obstacles}} (for he had <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> on scores of intriguing factors and brokers ashore), the requisite stores for the fleet, Paul sat in his cabin in a half-despondent reverie, while Israel, cross-legged at his commander's feet, was patching up some old signals.|$|R
60|$|There was {{one room}} we got into, I scarce know how. It was a long, high gallery, plainly {{finished}} for a palace, {{and it seemed}} to be lighted from an interior court, or well; for one was completely caged when in it. This was the celebrated Bull's Eye (oeil de boeuf), where the courtiers <b>danced</b> <b>attendance</b> before they were received. It got its name from an oval window over the principal door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad o' that," [...] {{said the}} man bluntly. [...] "Then thar ain't no police {{business}} to tie up to in 'Frisco? We were stuck thar a week once, just because we chanced {{to pick up a}} feller who'd been found gagged and then thrown overboard by wharf thieves. Had <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> at court thar and lost our trip." [...] He stopped and looked half-pathetically at the prostrate Elijah. [...] "Look yer! ye ain't just dyin' to go ashore NOW and see yer friends and send messages, are ye?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Not {{long after}} the birth of their {{daughter}} Gladys (aka [...] "Alma") Aimée’s marriage collapsed. Porter plunged into a score of speculations, none of which proved successful. He spent a small fortune on horse racing studs, and then sold off many of them to settle gambling debts. Porter became a patron of prize-fighters, and began <b>to</b> <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> upon the latest favorite of the ballet or the comic opera. His friendships with actresses Lillie Langtry and Lotta Crabtree were the source of much gossip. [...] Aimée was herself seen everywhere at fashionable entertainments, not with her husband, but with some young cavalier.|$|R
25|$|Wills and the Texas Playboys played dances {{throughout}} the West {{to more than}} 10,000 people every week. They held <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> records at Jantzen Beach in Portland, Oregon; in Santa Monica, California, and at the Oakland (California) Auditorium, where they drew 19,000 people in two nights. Wills also broke an attendance record of 2,100 previously held by Jan Garber at the Armory in Klamath Falls, Oregon, by attracting 2,514 dancers. Wills and the Playboys also played small towns on the West Coast. Actor Clint Eastwood recalled seeing Wills when he was 18 or 19 (1948 or 1949) and working at a pulp mill in Springfield, Oregon.|$|R
6000|$|But {{he was too}} clever not to {{know that}} they might be {{fattening}} him for some very special feast, and his thanks took the form of a vow to need their help no more. To-morrow he would begin to climb the mountains around St. Gian; if he <b>danced</b> <b>attendance</b> on her dangerous Ladyship again, Mrs. Jerry should be there also, and he would walk circumspectly between them, like a man with gyves upon his wrists. He {{was in the midst of}} all the details of these reforms, when suddenly he looked at himself thus occupied, and laughed bitterly; he had so often come upon Tommy making grand resolves! ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{fortnight}} Anne {{spent in}} Bolingbroke {{was a very}} pleasant one, with a little under current of vague pain and dissatisfaction running through it whenever she thought about Gilbert. There was not, however, much {{time to think about}} him. [...] "Mount Holly," [...] the beautiful old Gordon homestead, was a very gay place, overrun by Phil's friends of both sexes. There was quite a bewildering succession of drives, dances, picnics and boating parties, all expressively lumped together by Phil under the head of [...] "jamborees"; Alec and Alonzo were so constantly on hand that Anne wondered if they ever did anything but <b>dance</b> <b>attendance</b> on that will-o'-the-wisp of a Phil. They were both nice, manly fellows, but Anne would not be drawn into any opinion as to which was the nicer.|$|R
