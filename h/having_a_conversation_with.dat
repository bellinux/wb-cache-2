5|$|After Floyd's wedding, Liz goes to {{the office}} of her fiancé, Wesley Snipes (Michael Sheen), to {{retrieve}} his shoes for Cerie Xerox's (Katrina Bowden) wedding. At Wesley's office, she meets an airline pilot named Carol (Matt Damon). When she learns that Carol is a big fan of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS), for which Liz is the head writer, she asks Carol to go with her to Cerie's wedding, which he accepts. At Cerie's wedding, Wesley is distraught that Liz ended their engagement through a text message she sent to him. Liz tells him that fate brought them together so that she would meet Carol, with whom she can see herself spending the rest of her life. Wesley is devastated and leaves. Unbeknownst to Liz, Carol, who Liz thought had stepped out from the party area, heard everything she told Wesley, which shocks Carol, prompting him to leave. At the same time, at Cerie's wedding, Nancy learns that Avery is pregnant after <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> her in the ladies room, and tells Jack before she leaves him. When Jack finds Avery, he tells her he wants to marry her, which she accepts.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, the two {{visit the}} Ghats as Sahil had planned. He takes Jai to an {{overhanging}} cliff, with a scenic view of Mahabaleshwar, {{where the two}} share a quiet moment. On returning to their resort, Jai offers {{to pay for the}} trip's expenses, to which Sahil agrees after some initial reluctance. The two return to a hotel in Mumbai for Jai's scheduled business meeting. At the hotel room, the two admit to their mutual attraction right before Jai has to leave for his meeting. Sahil interrupts Jai and his clients and embarrasses the latter with a romantic gesture in front of everyone. This leads to a confrontation between the two, during which Sahil accuses Jai of being scared of coming out to the world. On the contrary, Jai blames him for not reciprocating his affection from the beginning. The two kiss, but when Sahil tries to withdraw from him, Jai rapes him, only to immediately regret it. He apologises and tells Sahil that he doesn't have to stay any longer if he doesn't want to. However, Sahil decides to stay, but refrains from <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Jai.|$|E

500|$|Despite being friends, she {{has driven}} Margaret to {{distraction}} on several occasions. Most notably in [...] "Only a Story", when {{she stayed with}} the Meldrews after her flat had been flooded and drove Margaret {{to the point of}} distraction with her complaining and laziness. Jean was also shown as a somewhat absent-minded character, as she has a pet cockatiel despite having a lifelong allergy to feathers. She would often bore the Meldrews by showing them her complete collection of holiday pictures at the most unwelcome times. A running joke is her beating Victor at board-games, including Trivial Pursuit and chess, while <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> someone else. Doreen Mantle described her character as [...] "wanting {{to do the right thing}} but always finding out that it was the wrong thing".|$|E
500|$|In , {{which is}} set six years prior to Final Fantasy VII, Vincent is seen in his Turk attire <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Veld, leader of the Turks. He {{subsequently}} helps Veld obtain some Materia needed for a mission. In the film , set two years after Final Fantasy VII, Vincent rescues Cloud from Kadaj and his gang. He reveals to Cloud Kadaj's intentions to merge with the remaining Jenova cells so as to bring about Sephiroth's rebirth. Vincent later helps Cloud and his Final Fantasy VII allies defeat the summon creature Bahamut SIN. In the [...] On the Way to a Smile novella [...] "Case of Nanaki", set between the original game and Advent Children, Vincent encounters his former comrade, Red XIII (Nanaki), who is fearful that he will soon be alone due to his lifespan being much longer than humans. Vincent explains to Red that he is immortal and promises {{to meet with him}} every year to prevent his loneliness.|$|E

500|$|... "The Damage a Man Can Do" [...] {{was filmed}} in early October 2008. On playing Harry as {{a figment of}} Dexter's imagination, James Remar told Vanity Fair that [...] "it's {{challenging}} to play a specter in somebody’s current existence." [...] He said: [...] "In my own life, I find myself doing some task [...] and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> my mother or father, who are both deceased. [...] I suspect lots of people do it. And when I hold that conversation, different images of my parents appear to me. And so it's my job {{to do my best}} to be that image in Dexter's mind." [...] When asked about playing the only character to join Dexter in his [...] "kill room," [...] Jimmy Smits said: [...] "The crew has a great respect for what they are doing in those scenes. They are energized because those moments are the staple of the show, {{but at the same time}} they are very somber. Michael doesn't really like to interface with a lot of people on those days, because it's such a serious subject matter." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{backstage}} drama {{portrayed in}} the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage {{about the same time}} she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health {{as a result of her}} diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: [...] "I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love." [...] The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going. The lyricist thought for a second, then said [...] "I hate that show." [...] According to Bill Hayes in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he states We played nearly five hundred performances, however, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits went into the R till. So, though not in the same category as the storied five that were made into films - Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music - our show must be considered a success.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, when Marvel {{launched}} its MAX imprint of [...] "mature readers" [...] comics, Gerber returned {{to write the}} six-issue Howard the Duck mini-series, illustrated by Phil Winslade and Glenn Fabry. Featuring several familiar Howard the Duck characters, the series, like the original one, parodied {{a wide range of}} other comics and pop culture figures, but with considerably stronger language and sexual content than what would have been allowable 25 years earlier. [...] The series has Doctor Bong causing Howard to go through multiple changes of form, principally into a mouse (as a parody of Mickey Mouse, in retaliation for the earlier lawsuit), and entering a chain of events parodying comics such as Witchblade, Preacher and several others, with Howard ultimately <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> God in Hell.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2004, Brown took a {{firearms}} class. He {{bought a}} [...]45-caliber Glock pistol {{days before the}} class at Totally Awesome Guns & Range in Salt Lake City. Brown passed a background check, {{and as part of}} the class, was fingerprinted and his prints were sent to state and federal authorities. Brown's instructor, Clark Aposhian, described him as [...] "an obnoxious student" [...] who was inexperienced with firearms. Brown accidentally fired a round into a truck during a practice shooting. He paid approximately $1,300 in damages to the car owner. At this time, Brown was living in an Ahwatukee, Arizona hotel near an AMC movie theater. He was captured on surveillance tape <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> another man in the hotel lobby. The man {{is considered to be a}} possible accomplice or witness; however, his identity remains unknown.|$|E
2500|$|On May 27, 2007, ESPN {{reported}} that Bryant {{stated that he}} wanted to be traded if Jerry West did not return to the team with full authority. Bryant later confirmed his desire for West's return to the franchise, but denied stating that he would want to be traded if that does not occur. However, three days later, on Stephen A. Smith's radio program, Bryant expressed anger over a Lakers [...] "insider" [...] who claimed that Bryant was responsible for Shaquille O'Neal's departure from the team, and publicly stated, [...] "I want to be traded." [...] Three hours after making that statement, Bryant stated in another interview that after <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> head coach Jackson, he has reconsidered his decision and backed off his trade request. Bryant was later shown in an infamous amateur video saying that center Andrew Bynum should have been traded for All-Star Jason Kidd.|$|E
2500|$|Howard and Grazer chose {{frequent}} collaborator James Horner {{to score}} the film {{because they knew}} {{of his ability to}} communicate. Howard said, regarding Horner, [...] "It's like <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> a writer or an actor or another director." [...] A running discussion between the director and the composer was the concept of high-level mathematics being less about numbers and solutions, and more akin to a kaleidoscope, in that the ideas evolve and change. After the first screening of the film, Horner told Howard: [...] "I see changes occurring like fast-moving weather systems." [...] He chose it as another theme to connect to Nash's ever-changing character. Horner chose Welsh singer Charlotte Church to sing the soprano vocals after deciding that he needed a balance between a child and adult singing voice. He wanted a [...] "purity, clarity and brightness of an instrument" [...] but also a vibrato to maintain the humanity of the voice.|$|E

2500|$|Little else {{is known}} {{precisely}} of Armin's time with Chandos's Men. A dedication to his patron's widow in 1604 suggests some personal acquaintance with the Brydges family; {{on the other}} hand, a reference in another work suggests he may have spent some time, like Kempe, as a solo performer. The pair of books Armin published {{around the turn of}} the century demonstrate a performer with an interest in his craft. Fool Upon Fool (1600, 1605; reissued in 1608 as A Nest of Ninnies), offers the wit of assorted natural fools, some of whom Armin knew personally. The same year he published Quips upon Questions, a collection of seemingly extemporaneous dialogues with his marotte, named by him Signor Truncheon. In this he demonstrates his style; instead of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> the audience, as Tarlton did, and entering into a battle of wits, he jests using multiple personas, improvised song, or by commenting on a person or event. Rather than exchanging words, he gave words freely. Armin reported in that work that on either Tuesday 25 December 1599, or Tuesday 1 January 1600, he would be travelling to Hackney to wait on his [...] "right honourable good lord". This was possibly Baron Chandos, who may have been visiting Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche over the holidays, or more likely Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford who lived in Hackney.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1996, Marshall University {{sociology}} professor Dr. William Westbrook was <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> a recent Master's graduate. [...] The graduate inquired about Marshall's traditional admissions policy, which had a lower SAT/ACT apparent requirement than his undergraduate school, Shepherd University, with a [...] "selective" [...] admissions policy and higher SAT/ACT apparent requirement. The graduate made an incorrect inference from the averages and thought Shepherd was arbitrarily turning new students away below a higher fixed ACT or SAT score. Dr. Westbrook clarified the situation first by explaining that every university or college is going to meet its enrollment quota with the best students available, and asked where both Marshall University and Shepherd University got their students. Marshall typically recruited from Cabell, Logan, Wayne, and Putnam Counties, WV, and Lawrence County, OH. Shepherd typically recruited both from West Virginia, both locally in the Eastern Panhandle and {{in the interior of}} and elsewhere in the state, and from the comparatively wealthy Maryland and Virginia suburbs surrounding Washington D.C. Dr. Westbrook made the point that SAT and ACT scores are an indirect measure of socioeconomic status. [...] County kindergarten to twelfth-grade school boards are funded by property taxes assessed on home values. [...] At nearly the end of grade school, a college-bound student takes the SAT or ACT. The difference between Shepherd University and Marshall University is that Shepherd recruited more from areas whose home values were higher, whose homeowners paid more in property taxes, whose school systems were better funded, and whose students benefitted as a result, took the SAT or ACT, some of whom applied to Shepherd University and were accepted, and attended. Colleges and universities, then, have less control over setting their ACT and SAT requirements than the graduate assumed and than most parents might imagine. [...] Parents need to understand that large scale political and economic forces such as the level of Federal employment and commensurate income around Washington, or other regional differences in living standards, have more to do setting ACT and SAT requirements than the decisions of college committees trying to enroll the best students they can under the circumstances over which they have no control.|$|E
60|$|As to the sailor, Averil frankly {{liked him}} very much; {{he was the}} pleasantest young man, of the most open and {{agreeable}} manners, who had ever fallen in her way.

6000|$|Robson seemed {{anxious to}} monopolize the {{attention}} of the gentlemen, to the exclusion of Madison; and while Tom was thus thrust aside, Mary succeeded in <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> him, such as she felt was a sort of duty to Louis. She asked him the names of the various mountain-peaks in sight, whose bare crags, too steep to support the snow, here and there stood out dark in salient contrast to the white scenery, and as he gave them to her, mentioning the few facts that {{he had been able to}} gather respecting them, she was able to ask him whether he was in the habit of seeing anything approaching to society. He smiled, saying that his nearest neighbours were many miles off--an engineer conducting some far more extensive mining operations, whom he sometimes met on business, and an old Spanish gentleman, who lived in a valley far down the mountain side, with whom he sometimes smoked his cigar on a Sunday, if he felt inclined for a perpendicular promenade on a Peruvian causeway for nearly four miles. Mary asked whether he often did feel inclined. No, he thought not often; he had generally worked hard enough in the week to make his book the best company; but he liked now and then to see something green for a change after these bare mountains and rocks, and the old Don Manrique was very civil and agreeable. Then, after a few minutes' conversation of this kind, something of the old conscious abruptness of tone seemed to come over the young man, and looking down, he said bluntly, 'Miss Ponsonby, do you think there would be any objection to my coming into Lima just for Christmas?' ...|$|E
