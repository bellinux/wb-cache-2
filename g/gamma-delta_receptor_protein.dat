Antibodies against D 2 S <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> were localized in molecular layer {{and to a lesser}} extent, in granular layer. A few Purkinje neurons displayed a faint D 2 S <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity. D 3 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was observed primarily in molecular and in Purkinje neurons layers of lobules 9 and 10. A faint D 3 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was also localized in Purkinje neurons and to a lesser extent, in molecular and granular layers of cerebellar lobules 1 - 8. D 4 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was found in cerebellar white matter. A pale immunostaining was also visualized in molecular layer. D 5 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was localized primarily in molecular and Purkinje neurons layers and to a lesser extent, in granular layer and in white matter. The above results indicate that rat cerebellar cortex expresses the DA receptor subtypes so far identified. Purkinje neurons, which are the only efferent neurons of cerebellum, are richest in DA <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity. This suggests that dopaminergic neurotransmission may modulate efferent inputs from cerebellum.

Faint dopamine D 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was observed in smooth muscle of tunica media of pial, renal and mesenteric artery branches. Dopamine D 2 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was located in the adventitia and adventitia-media border of pial and renal artery branches {{and to a lesser}} extent of mesenteric artery branches. No dopamine D 3 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was observed in pial and mesenteric arteries. In renal arteries a moderate dopamine D 3 receptor immunoreactivity was detectable in the adventitia and adventitia-media border. A strong dopamine D 4 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity displaying the same localization of dopamine D 2 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> was observed in pial and mesenteric arteries, but not in renal artery branches. Moderate dopamine D 5 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was observed in smooth muscle of the tunica media of pial, renal and mesenteric artery branches. Bilateral removal of superior cervical ganglia, from which sympathetic supply to cerebral circulation originate abolished dopamine D 2 and D 4 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity in pial arteries but was without effect on dopamine D 1 and D 5 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity. These findings indicate that systemic arteries express dopamine D 1 -like (D 1 and D 5) and D 2 -like (D 2, D 3 and D 4) receptor subtypes displaying respectively a muscular (postjunctional) and prejunctional localization. The specific distribution of dopamine D 2 -like receptor subtypes in systemic arteries suggests that they may have a different role in regulating blood flow through the vascular beds investigated...|$|R
40|$|Reversible {{tyrosine}} phosphorylation, catalyzed by receptor tyrosine kinases and receptor tyrosine phosphatases, {{plays an}} essential part in cell signaling during axonal development. <b>Receptor</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine phosphatase-sigma has been implicated in the growth, guidance and repair of retinal axons. This phosphatase has also been implicated in motor axon growth and innervation. Insect orthologs of <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine phosphatase-sigma are also implicated in the recognition of muscle target cells. A potential extracellular ligand for vertebrate <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine phosphatase-sigma has been previously localized in developing skeletal muscle. The identity of this muscle ligand is currently unknown, but {{it appears to be}} unrelated to the heparan sulfate ligands of <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine phosphatase-sigma. In this study, we have used affinity chromatography and tandem MS to identify nucleolin as a binding partner for <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine phosphatase-sigma in skeletal muscle tissue. Nucleolin, both from tissue lysates and in purified form, binds to <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine phosphatase-sigma ectodomains. Its expression pattern also overlaps with that of the <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine phosphatase-sigma-binding partner previously localized in muscle, and nucleolin can also be found in retinal basement membranes. We demonstrate that a significant amount of muscle-associated nucleolin is present on the cell surface of developing myotubes, and that two nucleolin-binding components, lactoferrin and the HB- 19 peptide, can block the interaction of <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine phosphatase-sigma ectodomains with muscle and retinal basement membranes in tissue sections. These data suggest that muscle cell surface-associated nucleolin represents {{at least part of the}} muscle binding site for axonal <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine phosphatase-sigma and that nucleolin may also be a necessary component of basement membrane binding sites of <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> tyrosine phosphatase-sigma...|$|R

A faint DA D 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivitv unaffected by bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy (BSCGN) was observed in the tunica media of different sized pial arteries. DA D 2 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was located in the adventitia-media border and disappeared after BSCGN., No apparent changes in the density and pattern of DA D 2 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity were observed in pial arteries of different size. No DA D 3 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was observed in pial or intracerebral arteries. An intense DA D 4 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was observed in the adventitia-media transitional zone of pial arteries. DA D 4 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was more pronounced in medium and small sized pial arteries than in larger ones and disappeared after BSCGN. DA D 5 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity unaffected by BSCGN was localized in the tunica media of different sized pial arteries without changes {{depending on the size}} of the vessels examined. Comparatively, among DA receptor subtypes investigated, the D 5 receptor was the most expressed of the D 1 -like receptor superfamily, the D 4 receptor the most expressed of the D 2 -like receptor superfamily. No DA <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was observed in intracerebral vessels, whereas adjacent structures known to express DA D 1 -D 5 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity showed the expected distribution and pattern of immune reaction. These results indicate that different sized pial arteries but not intracerebral arteries express postjunctional (D 1 and D 5) and prejunctional (D 2 and D 4) DA receptors. This may have consequences in the regulation of brain perfusion by dopaminergic drugs...|$|R

In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the mechanisms leading to insulin resis-tance, the number of fat tissue insulin receptors, their anity and insulin <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> in rats with monosodium glutamate-induced obesity were studied. Obese rats displayed signicantly lower number of insulin receptors with high anity. Sur-prisingly, the amount of insulin <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> was signicantly elevated in these animals. The same relations have been already reported for angiotensin II binding and AT 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> in the same model of obesity.

Currently, we have isolated intragenic suppressors of the crp mutations. These crp (Sup) mutants require cAMP for activity. The crp (Sup) mutations map in regions which define new sites of changes involved in cAMP <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> activation. From these results, we suggest that to activate cAMP <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> cAMP brings about (i) a hinge reorientation to eject the DNA-binding F alpha-helices, (ii) proper alignment between the two subunits, and (iii) an adjustment between {{the position of the}} two domains.

The synthetic <b>receptor</b> <b>protein</b> is a non-antibody-based protein scaffold with variable peptide regions inserted to provide the specific binding, and was designed to bind anti-myc tag antibody (Mw � 150 kDa), as a proof-of-principle exemplar.

Until now, however, little has been known about the adrenomedullin receptor. Recently, a group called <b>receptor</b> activity-modifying <b>proteins</b> that complex with the calcitonin receptor-like receptor, and thereby regulate its transport and ligand specificity, were identified.
