25|$|The R33 Skyline (Spec 2) {{continued}} the concepts {{introduced in the}} R32. Driver and Passenger airbags became standard in 1996. As a result, pre-1996 models are barred from being imported into various countries for consumer road use as they {{do not meet the}} frontal impact standards. (However, in the U.S., there are Federal Laws regarding safety and emissions that require certain documents to be obtained, certain criteria to be met and adhered to, or 25 years to pass, before the sale of this vehicle becomes legal.) For the RB25DET engine the ignition system was also changed, with the <b>ignition</b> <b>module</b> no longer located on the cam covers and was instead replaced by smart ignition coils (Ignitor built into coil) and ECU. The RB25DET's turbo was also given a nylon compressor wheel to improve response. Throughout the time the R33 was produced there were quite a number of different styled lights and bodykits fitted, the actual body/chassis underwent no changes. Among the cosmetic changes in the spec 2 were, the headlights which tapered down more towards the grill and were fitted with improved reflectors, the grill (which was longer on the Spec 1), the bonnet which had a re-shaped leading edge to fit the new lights and front bumper changing shape in the smallest amount to match the lower edge of the new headlights. Later models of the Spec 2 also had the option of having an Active-LSD fitted.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 12 {{ventilation}} experiments with various combinations of hydrogen release rates and ventilation speeds were performed {{in order to}} study how ventilation speed and release rate effect the hydrogen concentration in a closed system. The experiential facility was constructed out of steel plates and beams {{in the shape of}} a rectangular enclosure. The volume of the test facility was about 60 m 3. The front face of the enclosure was covered by a plastic film in order to allow visible and infrared cameras to capture images of the flame. The inlet and outlet vents were located on the lower front face and the upper backside panel, respectively. Hydrogen gas was released toward the ceiling from the center of the floor. The hydrogen gas was released at constant rate in each test. The hydrogen release rate ranged from 0. 002 m 3 /s to 0. 02 m 3 /s. Ventilation speeds were 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 4 m 3 /s respectively. Ignition was attempted at the end of the hydrogen release by using multiple continuous spark ignition modules on the ceiling and next to the release point.

40|$|Compared to a basic {{scramjet}} design, {{operation of}} scramjet combustors using plasma assisted ignition and flameholding offers considerably more flexibility over {{the choice of}} its geometry, due to replacing mechanical flameholders with a highly effective electrically driven apparatus. The articlce {{presents the results of}} an experimental study of supersonic combustor operation enhanced by an electrical discharge. A novel scheme of plasma assisted mixing, ignition, and flameholding is demonstrated, which combines a wall fuel injector and a high-voltage electric discharge into a single module. The experimental combustor with the cross-section of 72 mm (width) ´ 60 mm (height) and length of 600 mm operates at a Mach number of M = 2, initial stagnation temperature of airflow of T 0 = 290 – 300 K, and stagnation pressure of P 0 = 1. 3 – 2. 0 Bar. The combustor is equipped with four plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>modules,</b> flush-mounted side-by-side on the plane wall of the combustion chamber. The combustion tests were performed using ethylene injection with a total mass flow rate of GC 2 H 4 3 ̆c 10 g/s and discharge power in the range of Wpl = 3 – 24 kW. The scope of the experiments includes characterization of the discharge interacting with the main flow and fuel injection jet, parametric study of ignition and flame front dynamics, and comparison of this scheme to earlier tested configuration. This approach demonstrates a significant advantage in terms of flameholding limits. An operation mode with strong combustion oscillations was observed at high fuel injection flow rates. Methods of flame front stabilization based on plasma application are discussed. The technique studied in this study may have significant potential for high-speed combustion applications, including cold start/restart of scramjet engines and support of transition regime in dual-mode and off-design operation...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was {{to find ways to}} improve combustion and reduce emissions from supercharged natural gas engines. In-cylinder flow measurements were made with laser doppler velocimetry, LDV, heat release was calculated from cylinder pressures and emissions were measured at various locations. The original combustion chamber was a low turbulence-generating geometry, resulting in an overall slow combustion. Four new combustion chambers were designed, to generate high turbulence and hence a fast combustion. The piston-geometry with the highest turbulence was more tolerant for highly diluted mixtures in terms of engine stability, which is favorable for lean burn operation or high amounts of EGR at stoichiometric operation. The flow-measuring tests were made on a single-cylinder engine. Base-engine performance measurements were conducted on a multi-cylinder version of the engine. The results show that pulse-width fuel-injection close to the cylinders (at the throttle) resulted in variations in air/fuel ratio between the cylinders. Cycle-to-cycle variations were high in cylinders with leaner mixtures, and NOX emissions were high from cylinders with richer mixtures. Late ignition timing, high boost pressure and lean mixture led to the need for a small spark gap in order to avoid misfires with the original ignition system. A larger gap results in higher spark energy, but the ignition system must be powerful enough not to cause misfires. The original ignition settings were retarded to suppress NOX formation. The HC and CO emissions were also lower than at maximum brake torque ignition (MBT) due to higher temperatures during expansion and exhaust, leading to more post-oxidation. Load and efficiency were reduced with the retarded ignition timing. A new engine control system was installed with high power <b>ignition</b> <b>modules,</b> enabling a larger spark gap. Idle quality was improved and maximum load was increased with this new system. Cylinder-individual control of fuel injection and ion-current measurements in all six cylinders made it possible to adapt port fuel-injection and cylinder balancing. Both cycle-to-cycle and cylinder-to-cylinder variations were reduced with cylinder balancing at lean operation. The ion-current integral and variations in the integral were used to perform the cylinder balancing. Lean burn operation was compared to stoichiometric operation diluted with EGR. The raw emissions of NOX and HC were higher at lean burn operation than for the EGR case. NOX emissions after a three-way catalyst were up to 700 times higher at lean operation (29. 5 g/kWh vs. 0. 042 g/kWh), and HC emissions approximately 20 times higher (2. 7 g/kWh vs. 0. 13 g/kWh). The early flame period (ignition to 5 % burned) was much longer for the EGR case, since EGR has a stronger influence on laminar flame speed than excess air. The main combustion duration (10 % to 90 % burned) was similar for both cases. The ion-current signal was very weak for the lean burn cases, but a strong signal was found for the EGR case...|$|R
50|$|The {{choice in}} HEI system type is vitally {{important}} based on the engine {{it will be used}} with. Each GM division had its own engine design. Thus, a Chevrolet ignition may not be identical to an Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick, or Cadillac engine. Typically, the ignition system compatibility followed the engine size. Most GM engines (of the same size) between 1974 and 1988 used a similar distributor <b>ignition</b> system. The <b>module</b> type is important as well. For non-computer controlled carburetor engines, the 4-pin unit is used since it uses mechanical timing controls (vacuum and centrifugal advance). The 5-pin module is like the 4-pin, with an added knock/detonation sensor input to the <b>module</b> so the <b>ignition</b> could be deliberately retarded and the power output dropped to the spark plug to aid disruption of the knock condition. The 7-pin module is designed for computer timing controls. It incorporates 2 magnetic signals from the pickup sensor, and 3 signals shared with the ECM engine control module), while the remaining 2 pins provide signal and power to the coil. Normally the 7 pin is not used on non-computerized engines since it does not contain mechanical timing controls, but some early designs used a seven-pin distributor module in conjunction with mechanical and vacuum advance in the distributor body, so the seven-pin module would be backward compatible.|$|R
40|$|Lignocellulosic {{biomass is a}} {{promising}} alternative fuel source which can promote energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and minimize fuel consumption when paired with advanced combustion strategies. Pyrolysis is used to convert lignocellulosic biomass into a complex mixture of phenolic-rich species {{that can be used}} in a transportation fuel. Anisole (or methoxybenzene) can be used as a surrogate to represent these phenolic-rich species. Anisole also has attractive properties as a fuel component for use in advanced spark-ignition engines because of its high blending research octane number of 120. Presented in the current work are new measurements of laminar burning velocities, jet-stirred reactor (JSR) speciation of anisole/O 2 /N 2 mixtures, and the development and validation of a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for anisole. Homogeneous, steady state, fixed gas temperature, perfectly stirred reactor CHEMKIN simulations were used to validate the mechanism against the current JSR measurements and published JSR experiments from CNRS-Nancy. Pyrolysis and oxidation simulations were based on the experimental reactant compositions and thermodynamic state conditions including P = 1 bar and T = 675 – 1275 K. The oxidation compositions studied in this work span fuel-lean (ϕ = 0. 5), stoichiometric, and fuel rich (ϕ = 2. 0) equivalence ratios. Laminar burning velocities were measured on a heat flux stabilized burner at an unburnt T = 358 K, P = 1 bar and simulated using the CHEMKIN premixed laminar flame speed <b>module.</b> <b>Ignition</b> delay times of anisole were then simulated at conditions relevant to advanced combustion strategies. Current laminar burning velocity measurements and predicted ignition delay times were compared to gasoline components (e. g., n-heptane, iso-octane, and toluene) and gasoline surrogates to highlight differences and similarities in behavior. Reaction path analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to explain the pathways relevant to the current studies. Under pyrolysis and oxidative conditions, unimolecular decomposition of anisole to phenoxy radicals and methyl radicals was found to be important due to the relatively low bond strength between the oxygen and methyl group, ∼ 65 kcal/mol. Reactions of these abundant phenoxy radicals with O 2 were found to be critical to accurately reproduce anisole's reactivity...|$|R
