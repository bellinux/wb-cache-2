5000|$|Kokkino Chorio (or [...] "Red Village") is {{a village}} {{situated}} in the Chania regional unit of Crete, Greece. It was the filming location of the 1964 film Zorba the Greek starring Anthony Quinn, Alan Bates, Irene Papas and many locals. The village also plays host to a tunnel complex which was used in World War II by the Nazis as an artillery spotting position. The area has been bought by a local property developer who has subsequently built {{a large number of}} houses on the site, obliterating in the process an old gun emplacement. In 2006 a memorial to those killed during world war two was constructed {{at the entrance to the}} tunnels. Access is possible, but it is unlit. Kokkino Chorio has three churches: St. George's which is located at the entrance of the cave and used on St. George's Day (April 23); St Katherines in the village which is used on November 25. The main church, used weekly and at other times during Lent/Easter and Advent/Christmas is St. Haralambos and is located in the village square. Kokkino Chorio is located near Plaka, Almiryda, Gavlahori, Kalyves and Kambia. Recently a Mini Market has opened in Kokkino Chorio (run by Giorgos) selling a range of goods, from food to household appliances. There is also a Glass blowing factory in the village with an embryo taverna attached. Above Kokkino Horio one can see the strangely shaped hill Drapanokefala or Calapodha (so named during the Venetian occupation). The coastline northwest of the village is an extremely interesting place for a stroll due to the <b>ground</b> <b>formation</b> and the caves, such as the cave of Petsi (or Karavotopos).

40|$|Abstract. Ground source {{heat pump}} (GSHP) systems {{exchange}} heat with the ground, often through a closed-loop, vertical, borehole heat exchanger (BHE). The {{performance of the}} BHE depends on the thermal properties of the <b>ground</b> <b>formation,</b> as well as soil or backfill in the borehole. The design and economic probability of GSHP systems need the thermal conductivity of geological structure and thermal resistance of BHE. Thermal response test (TRT) method allows the in-situ determination of the thermal conductivity (λ) of the <b>ground</b> <b>formation</b> {{in the vicinity of}} a BHE, as well as the effective thermal resistance (Rb) of this latter. Thermal properties measured in laboratory experiments do not comply with data of in-situ conditions. The present article describes the results of thermal properties of the BHE whose depth is 100 m in Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, China. As shown in these results, λ and Rb of borehole are determined as 1. 84 (W·m- 1 ·K- 1) and 0. 121 (m·K·W- 1) respectively...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a high-resolution 2 D seismic survey of mid-Pleistocene glaciogenic sediments in the Central Graben region of the central North Sea. Sediments have undergone major glaciotectonic thrusting and folding associated with the repeated southerly advance of a mid-Pleistocene ice sheet. The total observed length of the thrust-stacked section is approximately 5 – 6 [*]km, comprising a series of discrete thrust slices, which range in length from [*] 700 [*]m. The basal detachment of the thrust complex occurs at a depth of ca. 220 [*]m below the sea bed within the upper Aberdeen <b>Ground</b> <b>Formation.</b> A thin-skinned glaciotectonic model involving proglacial to ice-marginal glaciotectonic thrusting followed by post-tectonic deposition is proposed. Initial ice advance led to the over-pressurizing of groundwater within a laterally extensive sand sheet in the upper Aberdeen <b>Ground</b> <b>Formation,</b> promoting the formation of a major décollement surface {{at the base of the}} developing thrust-stack. Over-pressurization of the groundwater system is thought to have occurred in response to rapid ice advance, suggesting that the development of large-scale thrust complexes may be associated with surge-type behaviour. The proposed model evidences complex dynamics of mid-Pleistocene ice sheets within the central North Sea...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} guiding a number of ground vehicles from some initial location to a specified destination, while avoiding obstacles in an unmapped field and maintaining formation relative to each other. Potential applications for recently developed <b>ground</b> <b>formation</b> are described in this paper, illustrating the need for autonomy in such formation systems. The behaviorbase technique has been implemented to reach this autonomy in differential drive kinematics systems. The basic behaviors: move-to-goal, avoid-obstacle, maintainrelative-distance, maintain-relative-angle, and stop have been assigned to the independent systems to form a guidance algorithm. Validation of this guidance algorith...|$|E
