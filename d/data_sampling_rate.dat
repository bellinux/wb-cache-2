Different critical aspects are discussed {{in order to assess}} optimal test conditions. These are primarily <b>data</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>rate,</b> microphone positioning, frequency spectrum of interest, sound/noise ratio and selection of measuring probe. A <b>data</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>rate</b> of more than 50 kHz was shown to be sufficient to register fracture event and acoustic event, and the frequencies audible by human ear (at least 40 kHz needed). The optimum positioning of the microphone with respect to the test piece should be a compromise between a distance that the microphone registers a good sound over the whole human audible frequency spectrum and a good sound/noise ratio. It is shown that test method selection has to depend on whether the goal is determining material fracture behavior or correlation of data to consumer perception.

In the presented solutions, a terminal includes three acceleration sensors positioned like xyz co-ordinate system {{in order to}} get three-dimensional acceleration vector, xyz (gesture). The acceleration vector is used as an input to a reasoning unit for classification.

30|$|From {{application}} point of view, for such heterogenous sensor networks to be functional, it is {{required that the}} sink node obtain a desired amount of information in each sampling interval for each specific target. Note that a sensor node usually consists of two functional modules: the target sensing module (i.e., transducer) and the communication module (i.e., radio) {{that are responsible for}} target coverage requirement and data gathering requirement, respectively, [1]. Therefore, the application requirement actually implies two essential constraints to the sensor networks, that is, target coverage requirement and data gathering requirement. The target coverage requirement states that each target under monitoring must be covered by a specific number of sensors for each specific type (modality) of sensor, possibly at different <b>data</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>rates.</b> The <b>data</b> gather requirement simply mandates that all the sensed data must be effectively gathered into the sink node for further processing.|$|R

The algorithm is computationally fast although it requires large input data sets.
