40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} a {{digital image processing}} technique for the automated visual <b>inspection</b> of <b>glass</b> bottles based on a well-known method used for inspecting aluminium die castings. The idea of this method is to generate median filters adapted {{to the structure of}} the object under test. Thus, a “defect-free ” reference image can be estimated from the original image of the inspection object. The reference image is compared with the original one, and defects are detected when the difference between them is considerable. The configuration of the filters is performed off-line including a priori information about real defect-free images. In the other hand, the filtering self is performed on-line. Thus, a fast on-line inspection is ensured. According to our experiments, the detection performance in glass bottles was 85 % and the false alarms rate was 4 %. Additionally, the processing time was only 0. 3 s/image...|$|R

40|$|Hot end <b>inspection</b> of <b>glass</b> bottles necessitates the {{localization}} of designed textures on that bottle. In {{this paper}} {{we proposed a}} method to localize designed textures on a test bottle by matching its image to {{a certain number of}} reference images and then mapping the texture to the test bottle. The intended purpose of this algorithm is to localize the designed texture on the bottle so that the designed texture areas and other areas on the image of the bottle can be distinguished. The localization is done by finding the amount of rotation caused due to the motion of the conveyor belt. The average orientation angle feature is used in the matching. Reference databases are created which contain necessary information regarding the different textured regions. A selected portion of the image is used to match the bottle at the hot end with the same area of the reference bottles. The design texture is marked, according to the appropriate match. All the methods involved experiments and results and conclusions based upon them are presented subsequently...|$|R
40|$|Issue: Every use of {{recycled}} glass, from container manufacturing through construction aggregate, requires specifications that include definitions of acceptable levels of contamination. For {{the development of}} reasonable yet effective specifications, {{an understanding of the}} nature of typical contaminants in glass is critical. This Best Practice describes some procedures for judging levels of contaminants in recycled glass and presents some of the issues to be considered when developing contaminant guidelines. Best Practice: Visual Classification. A visual classification procedure has been developed to judge the level of contaminants in recycled glass to be used as a construction aggregate. See Visual <b>Inspection</b> for <b>Glass</b> Construction Aggregate Best Practice. The classification procedure was developed during the Glass Feedstock Study (1) conducted by Dames & Moore consulting engineers in Seattle. The classification method facilitates a judgment of the percentage of contaminants in a two-dimensional area covered by a sample. Model specifications developed in that same study recommended applications for glass in construction aggregate allowing up to 10 % contaminants by visual classification. While 10 % may sound like a large percentage of contaminants, most of the contamination in recycled glass is usually paper labels, which actually constitute a very small percentage of the mass of a recycled glass stockpile...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{automotive}} <b>glass</b> <b>inspection</b> {{system based}} on fringe patterns is proposed. This system can inspect the 3 D shape, reflection normal and transmission distortion of the automotive glass simultaneously. A stereo vision and an iterative algorithm based on the reflection law of the specular surface are utilized to obtain the 3 D shape and reflection normal of the inspected part. Then, the bottom reflection of the glass is analyzed such that the line-shifting fringe pattern, based on step wave, is adopted. Additionally, the transmission distortion is defined as an angle between the incoming ray and the outgoing ray for the inspected automotive glass. The method proposed is simpler and more flexible than traditional methods. Finally, the system accuracy has been examined, with the results demonstrating its high accurate performance. </p...|$|R
40|$|Issue: Visual {{inspection}} is {{a common}} procedure for the initial assessment of the acceptability of construction aggregate. The inspection is usually performed at storage sites prior to any laboratory testing of the material. Sometimes, visual inspection is performed as a field screening procedure. In some cases, the acceptability of the material for a particular application may be {{based solely on the}} results of the field visual <b>inspection.</b> Recycled <b>glass</b> is a relatively new construction aggregate material, so there is little background for standardized visual inspection procedures. Such procedures will allow effective information exchange and ultimately increase the use of recycled glass in construction. The inspection should be simple, easy to perform, and provide an initial classification of debris content and material gradation. Best Practice: Debris Content A simple method has been used to obtain a percentage level of debris content of a glass cullet sample. The debris includes metal caps, plastic, paper, and any other nonglass materials. The method is based on the Percent Composition Charts developed by American Geological Institute (Comparison Chart for Estimating Percentage Composition, AGI Data Sheets 23. 1 and 23. 2). These charts show the estimated percentage of composition of debris in a sample from 1 to 50 %. The method uses a test pan of eight to ten inches in diameter and one to two inches in depth.

40|$|Abstract — This paper aims at {{designing}} {{and developing a}} suitable tool for identifying defects in glass bottles through visual inspection based on segmentation algorithm. Defects are identified in three stages namely Image acquisition, Pre-processing and filtering and Segmentation. In the Image acquisition stage, samples of real time images are taken and are converted into monochrome images. In the Pre-processing and filtering stage, the image acquired is passed through median filters. The de-noised images are further sent to the third stage which is Segmentation. In this paper, Segmentation is done using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The defects in the images are segmented and highlighted and the areas of defects are spotted out. The Particle Swarm segmentation has produced high Sensitivity, high Specificity, high Accuracy and produced effective results and hence this tool shall be useful for food processing industries for the Quality <b>Inspection</b> of the <b>glass</b> bottles...|$|R
40|$|Ferromagnetic {{resonance}} intensity, I(s), {{relies on}} the absence or presence of single-domain Fe formed during impact melting by autoreduction of Fe(2 +) in the melt to distinguish volcanic from impact glass spherules in the lunar soil. SEM <b>inspection</b> of individual <b>glass</b> bead surfaces gave reliable evidence of the mode of glass genesis. Ferromagnetic resonance intensity was tested against the Apollo 15 and 17 volcanics. I(s) values of less than one were found in 94 % of the volcanic glasses, implying the absence of single-domain Fe, while 75 % of the impact glasses had elevated I(s) values. These samples lack single-domain Fe, and may represent impact melts of bedrock {{with little or no}} regolith contribution. Both the primary discrimination of volcanic and impact glasses, and the secondary one of bedrock-derived impact melts from impact melts partially or entirely derived from regolith, have been demonstrated for the I(s) technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of ceramic glass contaminants in glass recycling plants reduces production quality and increases production costs. The problem of ceramic <b>glass</b> <b>inspection</b> {{is related to}} the fact that its detectable physical and pictorial properties are quite similar to those of glass. As a consequence, at the sorting plant scale, ceramic glass looks like normal glass and is detectable only by specialized personnel. In this paper an innovative approach for ceramic glass recognition, based on imaging spectroscopy, is proposed and investigated. In order to define suitable inspection strategies for the separation between useful (glass) and polluting (ceramic glass) materials, reference samples of glass and ceramic glass presenting different colors, thicknesses, shapes and manufacturing processes have been selected. Reflectance spectra have been obtained using two equipment covering the visible and near infrared wavelength ranges (400 - 1000 and 1000 - 1700 nm). Results showed as recognition of glass and ceramic glass is possible using selected wavelength ratios, in both visible and near infrared fields...|$|R

The gauge glass will fail due to stress, temperature and fittings problem. This analysis is concentrate on the glass as the glass is brittle and have higher tendency to fail rather than other fittings and connector. As the failure due to stress and temperature is unavoidable, the inspection must be done periodically. During the inspection, overall boiler must be checked to make sure there is no faultiness to the part that attached to the boiler especially gauge glass.

40|$|Impact {{sites in}} glass affect its {{fracture}} strength. An analytical model that predicts fracture strength from grey-field polariscope (GFP) readings (photoelastic retardations) {{has been developed}} and reported in the literature. The model is suggestive that stress fields, resulting from impact damage, destablizes sites within the glass, which lead to pathways that cause strength degradation. Using data collected from fused silica specimens fabricated from outer window panes that were designed for the space shuttle, the model was tested against four categories of inflicted damage. The damage sites were cored from the window carcasses, examined with the GFP and broken using the ASTM Standard C 1499 - 09 to measure the fracture strength. A correlation is made between the fracture strength and the photoelastic retardation measured at the damage site in each specimen. A least-squares fit is calculated. The results are compared with the predictions from the model. A plausible single-sided NDE damage site inspection method (a version of which is planned for <b>glass</b> <b>inspection</b> in the Orion Project) that relates photoelastic retardation in glass components to its fracture strength is presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{excellent}} {{pressure sensor}} based a simple fabrication technology is presented. Differently {{from the present}} prevailing fabrication process of silicon piezoresistive pressure sensor: platinum is used as the sensing material, with a smaller but acceptable sensitivity and much simpler processes; adhesive bonding with SU- 8 is used as an alternative choice to anodic bonding, and we choose a vacuum hot plate to avoid using a bonding machine. To achieve a successful bonding, {{it is found that}} pre-bake time and pumping time are the most important factors. Bonding quality is evaluated by <b>inspection</b> through the <b>glass</b> with 95 % of the area successfully bonded and the failed area in the edge of the wafers. The measured bonding strength is 17. 34 MPa. The Pressure-Voltage characteristic test results display a good linearity within 0. 2 % and especially a good precision within 0. 035 % in square fitting. The temperature drifting is also tested and the TCO is 1250 ppm/(°C FSO). The long-term stability of the sensor at a constant pressure is a fluctuation within 40 Pa (0. 098 % FSO) in 7 days. Both the simple fabrication process and the excellent performance of the sensor suggest that this sensor is a much good choice in measuring atmospheric pressure. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new point cloud registration strategy for 3 D surface inspection, named object-oriented method. Traditionally, the registration methods use a fitting based algorithm, which is a recursive process and too time consuming to do quality inspection. Moreover, the fitting based algorithms require that the measured data and the CAD model have same shapes. Photogrammetry and ICP-based fitting algorithms are commonly used in this area. However, both of them cannot be applied directly to online point cloud registration for quality inspection. Since it requires: 1. no markers on the object surface. 2. a very limited inspection period of time for each part on an assembly line. 3. the measured work piece can not be assumed as same as the CAD model. The online registration is currently demanded by 3 D surface <b>inspection</b> in automotive <b>glasses</b> manufacturing industry. The object-oriented registration method is developed based on matching the invariant geometric features between two data sets instead of the artificial markers and the recursive fitting algorithms. Therefore the registration speed is much higher. A datum filter is developed to extract the invariant features from the measured point cloud, {{based on the information}} that the CAD model carries. The curvature information and moment values are used as characteristic features to design the filter. The registration matrix is calculated by the invariance parts in both data sets. The new online registration method has been applied to the quality inspection in the windshield manufacturing industry. Experimental results are presented in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed strategy. © 2008 IEEE. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
