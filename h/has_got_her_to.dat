Presently, 'He <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> the Royal Academy. She has gone forthwith to the Prae-Raffaelites. Oh! she is walking Prae-Raffaelitism herself. Symbols and emblems!

50|$|In his sixties, Edward thinks back to Florence {{again and}} of the night they separated, {{wondering}} {{what would have happened}} if they had not separated. He concludes that he and Florence would have enjoyed a loving and happy marriage, that Florence would have been beneficial to his career success, and that with love and patience he might <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> open up and enjoy sex. He muses that one's life can be changed by simply doing nothing: Florence had loved him deeply as they left each other, and wanted nothing more than for him to call out for her, at which she would have turned back to reconcile. The novel ends with Edward remembering the sight of Florence walking away before disappearing from his sight.|$|R

6000|$|The sick woman's hold {{upon the}} fact {{weakened}} most {{when she was}} tired. When she was better, she knew how it was with them.

She said I was her only boy and that she could not spare me, and I had to promise to give up the thought. She was still more against your plan, but when I wrote to you I thought that {{possibly}} in time she might agree to it. But it was not long afterwards that <b>her</b> health began <b>to</b> fail, and I saw then that I must give up all thought of leaving her, and must, when I left school, take anything that offered; and it was only after her death that I talked it over with the girls, and they agreed that to come here was the best thing for me." ...|$|R

60|$|It was blazing hot up the valley, windless, with vehement sun upon my shoulders; and I had to labour so {{consistently}} with my stick {{that the}} sweat ran into my eyes.

And at last, in the village of Ussel, saddle and all, the whole hypothec turned round and grovelled in the dust below the donkey's belly. She, none better pleased, incontinently drew up and seemed to smile; and a party of one man, two women, and two children came up, and, standing round me in a half-circle, encouraged her by their example.|$|R

60|$|But {{between the}} first year of Queen Anne's reign, and the second, sad changes for the worse had taken place in the two younger ladies, at least in the elder's {{description}} of them. Rachel, Viscountess Castlewood, had no more face than a dumpling, and Mrs. Beatrix was grown quite coarse, and was losing all her beauty. Little Lord Blandford--(she never would call him Lord Blandford; his father was Lord Churchill--the King, whom he betrayed, had made him Lord Churchill, and he was Lord Churchill still)--might be making eyes at her; but his mother, that vixen of a Sarah Jennings, would never hear of such a folly. Lady Marlborough <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be a maid of honor at Court to the Princess, but she would repent of it. The widow Francis (she was but Mrs. Francis Esmond) was a scheming, artful, heartless hussy. She was spoiling her brat of a boy, and she would end by marrying her chaplain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Except for {{the reason}} she gave--that she couldn't make a start for herself till she had done so. And she <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> own way <b>to</b> make; she is poor. Of course, you may say her motive was an obsession, and not a reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Emily and I owed {{everything}} <b>to</b> <b>her!</b> She was as near being {{a mother}} to us as any one could be; and Camilla could not say enough of gratitude, or show esteem enough, and fascinated her {{like all the rest}} of us; but she never rested till she <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> off <b>to</b> a situation in Russia. I did not perceive the game at the time, but I see now how all the proposals for situations within reach of me were quashed." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{by degrees}} he {{proposed}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> leave <b>her</b> home and her friends, and trust herself to him, and go off with him unmarried, without her father's blessing, or the priest's--to {{go with him}} in a manner which she knew would disgrace herself, her name, and <b>her</b> family, and <b>to</b> trust to him afterwards <b>to</b> give <b>her</b> what reparation a tardy marriage could afford. She, poor girl, at first received the offer with sobs and tears. She proposed a clandestine marriage, but he swore that when afterwards detected, it would cause his dismissal;--then that she would come to him at Cashel, when he was settled; but no,--he told her other lies equally false, to prove that this could not be done. She prayed and begged, and lay upon his bosom imploring him <b>to</b> spare <b>her</b> this utter degradation; but now that the proposal had been fairly made, that he <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> discuss the plan, his usual sternness returned; and at last he told her, somewhat roughly, that if she would not come with him in the manner he proposed, he would leave her now and for ever.|$|R

Lady Ushant doesn't do her any good at all by cockering her up." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Maguire, as he {{went away}} to a {{clerical}} advertising office in the neighbourhood of Exeter Hall, thought over the matter profoundly. It was clear enough {{to him that the}} Mackenzies of Gower Street were not interfering with him; very probably they might have hoped and attempted to keep the heiress among them; that assertion that {{there was no room for}} her in the house--as though they were and ever had been averse <b>to</b> having <b>her</b> with them--seemed <b>to</b> imply that such was the case. It was the natural language of a disappointed woman. But if so, that hope was now over with them. And then the young lady had plainly exposed the suspicions which they all entertained as to the Balls. These grand people at the Cedars, this baronet's family at Twickenham, must <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come among them with the intention of keeping her there. It did not occur to him that the baronet or the baronet's son would actually want Miss Mackenzie's money. He presumed baronets to be rich people; but still they might very probably be as dogs in the manger, and desirous of preventing their relative from doing with her money that active service to humanity in general which would be done were she to marry a deserving clergyman who had nothing of his own.|$|R
6000|$|With a shudder, she sprang up; {{the ants}} <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and she <b>had</b> {{to pick them}} off her neck and dress. She wandered back towards the beach.

She would sooner die! ...|$|R

Talking of mysteries, by-the-bye," [...] says Mr. Franklin, dropping his voice, [...] "I have another word to say to you before you go to the stables.

50|$|In early April 2016, {{the film}} was {{announced}} by Guru Deshpande who was working simultaneously on other two scripts.

Later it was revealed that he would only be presenting the film and not producing. After having roped in the three male lead roles, the makers browsed through many profiles to select the female lead. The search ended with the makers signing in Mumbai based model Kamna Ranawat <b>to</b> make <b>her</b> debut through this film. Although skeptical about Malashri's consent to star in the film for an important character role, the producers were surprised <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> nod <b>to</b> play the role. Actress Aindrita Ray was roped in to dance for a special song alongside all the three male leads.|$|R
60|$|That day we got {{everything}} {{on board the}} schooner that it was thought desirable to take with us. We left much behind that was valuable, it is true, especially the copper; but Marble wisely determined that it was inexpedient to put the vessel deeper than good ballast-trim, lest it should hurt <b>her</b> sailing. We <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> fairly <b>to</b> <b>her</b> bearings, and this {{was believed to be}} as low as was expedient. It is true, a great deal remained to be stowed; the deck being littered, and the hold, the ground-tier excepted, in great confusion. But our bread, water, beef, pork, and other eatables, were all there, and in abundance; and, though not to be had for the asking, they were still to be had. The sails were bent, and the only anchor, la Pauline's stream, with her two largest kedges, was on our bows. While in this condition, Marble gave the unexpected order for all hands to come on board, and for the shore-fasts to be cast off.|$|R

60|$|Let us trace {{this from}} the beginning, and suppose a person has a servant- maid sent {{him out of the}} country, at fifty shillings, or three pounds a year.

60|$|The {{great thing}} was that her mamma should be buried in the cemetery, and not in unconsecrated ground with a stake through her as the boys had predicted, {{and it was only}} after she was promised this that Grizel told her little tale. She had feared {{for a long time that}} her mamma was dying of consumption, but she told no one, because {{everybody}} was against her and her mamma. Her mamma never knew that she was dying, and sometimes she used to get so much better that Grizel hoped she would live a long time, but that hope never lasted long. The reason she sat so much with Ballingall was just to find out what doctors did to dying people to make them live a little longer, and she watched his straiking to be able to do it <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mamma when the time came. She was sure none of the women would consent <b>to</b> straik <b>her</b> mamma. On the previous night, she could not say at what hour, she had been awakened by a cold wind, and so she knew that the door was open. She put out her hand in the darkness and found that her mamma was not beside her. It had happened before, and she was not frightened. She had hidden the key of the door that night and nailed down the window, but her mamma had found the key. Grizel rose, lit the lamp, and, having dressed hurriedly, set off with wraps <b>to</b> the Den. <b>Her</b> mamma was generally as sensible as anybody in Thrums, but sometimes she had shaking fits, and after them she thought it was the time of long ago. Then she went to the Den to meet a man who had promised, she said, to be there, but he never came, and before daybreak Grizel could usually induce <b>her</b> <b>to</b> return home. Latterly she had persuaded <b>her</b> mamma <b>to</b> wait for him in the old Lair, because it was less cold there, and she <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> do this last night. Her mamma did not seem very unwell, but she fell asleep, and she died sleeping, and then Grizel went back to Double Dykes for linen and straiked her.|$|R
60|$|She slipped {{those words}} into Anne's ears--swinging <b>her</b> parasol <b>to</b> and fro, and {{looking as if}} the merest gossip was {{dropping}} from her lips--with the dexterity which rarely fails a woman when she is called on to assist a deception in which her own interests are concerned. Cleverly {{as it had been}} done, however, Geoffrey's inveterate distrust was stirred into action by it. Blanche <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> last sentence before he was able to turn his attention from what Sir Patrick was saying to what his niece was saying. A quicker man would have heard more. Geoffrey had only distinctly heard {{the first half of the}} last sentence.|$|R
