2500|$|By the mid-1980s, Beam {{was working}} with new {{techniques}} for incorporating photo-imagery into his work. He utilized a heat transfer technique learned from fellow artist Ann Beam, with his work on paper and Plexiglas. He also began working with photo emulsion and mixed media on paper and large scale canvas works. The works contained various juxtapositions of imagery from the spiritual, the natural, and political world, and incorporated his own poetic inscriptions and math equations. [...] "My works are like little puzzles, interesting little games. I {{play a game of}} dreaming ourselves as each other. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>we</b> find out that we're all basically human....

2500|$|The Hutchinsonian niche framework, on {{the other}} hand, {{directly}} precludes the possibility of there being vacant niches. Hutchinson defined the niche as an n-dimensional hyper-volume whose dimensions correspond to resource gradients over which species are distributed in a unimodal fashion. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>we</b> see that the operational definition of his niche rests {{on the fact that}} a species is needed in order to rationally define a niche in the first place. This fact didn't stop Hutchinson from making statements inconsistent with this such as: “The question raised by cases like this is whether the three Nilghiri Corixinae fill all the available niches...or whether there are really empty niches.[...] [...]The rapid spread of introduced species often gives evidence of empty niches, but such rapid spread in many instances has taken place in disturbed areas.” Hutchinson (1957).|$|E
2500|$|In his Open Society and Its Enemies, Karl R. Popper {{writes that}} Thucydides was the [...] "greatest historian, perhaps, who ever lived." [...] Thucydides' work, however, Popper {{goes on to}} say, {{represents}} [...] "an interpretation, a point of view; and <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>we</b> need not agree with him." [...] In the war between Athenian democracy and the [...] "arrested oligarchic tribalism of Sparta," [...] we must never forget Thucydides' [...] "involuntary bias," [...] and that [...] "his heart was not with Athens, his native city:" [...] "Although he apparently {{did not belong to}} the extreme wing of the Athenian oligarchic clubs who conspired throughout the war with the enemy, he was certainly a member of the oligarchic party, and a friend neither of the Athenian people, the demos, who had exiled him, nor of its imperialist policy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cousin's {{doctrine}} of spontaneity in volition {{can hardly be}} said to be more successful than his impersonality of the reason through Volition [...] spontaneous apperception. Sudden, unpremeditated volition may be the earliest and the most artistic, {{but it is not the}} best. Volition is essentially a free choice between alternatives, and that is best which is most deliberate, because it is most rational. Aristotle touched this point in his distinction between $oi~X~-ns and srpoatpecric. The sudden and unpremeditated wish represented by the former is wholly inferior in character to the free choice of the latter, guided and illumined by intelligence. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>we</b> can deliberately resolve upon what is in our power; in that we are subject to the vain impulse of wishing the impossible. Spontaneity is pleasing, sometimes beautiful, but it is not in this instance the highest quality of the thing to be obtained. That is to be found in a guiding and illumining reflective activity.|$|E

2500|$|We {{believe them}} deluded fanatics, or weak and {{designing}} knaves, {{and that they}} and their pretensions would soon pass away; but <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>we</b> were deceived. The arts of a few designing leaders amongst them have less far succeeded in holding to them together as a society; and since {{the arrival of the}} first of them, they have been daily increasing numbers; and if they had been respectable citizens in society and thus deluded it would have been entitled to our pity rather than to our contempt and hatred; but from their parents, from their manners, and from their conduct since their coming among us, we have every reason to fear that, with but very few exceptions, they were of the very drags of that society from which they came, lazy, idle, and vicious. This we can see it is not idle assertion, they fact susceptible of proof, or with these few exceptions above-named, they brought into our country little or no property with them and left less behind them, and we infer that those only yoked themselves to the [...] "Mormon" [...] car who had nothing earthly or heavenly to lose by the change; and we fear that of some of the leaders amongst them, had paid to forfeit due to crime, instead of being chosen ambassadors of the Most High, they would have been inmates of solitary cells. But their conduct here stands their characters in their true colors. More than a year since, it was ascertained that they had been tampering with our slaves, and endeavoring to sow dissensions and raise seditions amongst them. Of this their [...] "Mormon" [...] leaders were informed, and they said they would deal with any of their members who should again in like case offend. But how spacious are appearances. In a late number of the Star, published in Independence by the leaders of the sect, there is an article inviting free Negroes and mulattoes from other states to become [...] "Mormons," [...] and remove and settle among us. This exhibits them in still more odious colors. It manifests a desire on the part of their society, to inflict on our society an injury that they know would be to us entirely insupportable, and one of the surest means of driving us from the country; for it would require none of the supernatural gifts that they pretend to, to see that the introduction of such a caste among us would corrupt our blacks, and instigate them to bloodshed.|$|E
