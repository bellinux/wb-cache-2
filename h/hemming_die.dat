50|$|Reginfrid (or Ragnfrid) (died 814) was a co-King of Denmark from 812, when <b>Hemming</b> I <b>died,</b> to 813, {{when he and}} his {{brothers}} were ousted by the sons of a previous king, Gudfred. He was probably a son of Halfdan, a Danish leader who became a vassal of Charlemagne in 807, and brother of Anulo (<b>died</b> 812), <b>Hemming</b> (<b>died</b> 837), and Harald Klak (died c. 852). He was probably also related to the Danish king he succeeded.|$|R

50|$|He {{was born}} in London and was educated at Westminster School and King's College London. Heming came to Canada in 1905, {{settling}} on a homestead near Arcola, Saskatchewan. He was also working for the Canadian Pacific Railway {{at the same time}} and sold his farm in 1912 to become a full-time employee of the railway at Moose Jaw. He helped organize the Labour Representative League there in 1916, which led to the election of William George Baker to the provincial assembly in 1921. Heming was elected to Moose Jaw City Council in 1937, serving until 1947. He retired from politics in 1960. <b>Heming</b> <b>died</b> in Moose Jaw at the age of 81.|$|R
50|$|Between 2010 and 2011, {{he moved}} to Cambodia in search of {{surviving}} witnesses (professionals, spectators, buildings) of {{the golden age of}} Cambodian cinema between 1960 and 1975, and found out that nearly 400 films were destroyed or lost under the Khmer Rouge regime. He interviewed actress Dy Saveth and filmmakers Ly Bun Yim, Yvon <b>Hem</b> (who <b>died</b> on August 10, 2012) and Ly You Sreang.|$|R
50|$|The Bentley Estate {{came into}} being when William Hemming bought the land from Mr. John Cookes in Approximately 1830. Upon Williams death in 1848 the land and {{property}} went to his son Richard <b>Hemming.</b> Richard <b>died</b> in 1891, leaving the Estate to his Daughter Maude. Maude married a Scotsman named George Clark Cheape. Mrs Cheape (known as the Squire of Bentley) was known for her love of hunting and kept a pack of Beagles in the village. After losing her son, who drowned in 1917, Maude died in 1919 leaving the Estate to her Grandson Leslie. Colenel Gray Cheape (as Leslie was formally known) died in 1991 and the estate passed {{into the hands of}} his grandchildren.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hemming</b> Halfdansson (<b>died</b> 837) was [...] "of the Danish race, a most Christian leader". He was {{probably}} a son of Halfdan, a leading Dane who became a vassal of Charlemagne in 807. He {{was probably}} related to the Danish royal family, as [...] "Hemming" [...] {{was one of their}} favoured names. The onomastic evidence includes the Danish king Hemming I (reigned 810-12) and then a Hemming II, who was recalled to Denmark from Francia by his brothers Harald Klak and Reginfrid after Hemming I's death. This Hemming was probably the same person as Hemming Halfdansson. He probably soon returned to Francia, since {{there is no evidence of}} him in Danish politics after he and his brothers were driven out by the sons of Godfrid in 813.|$|R
40|$|Cajal-Retzius cells (CRs), the first-born neurons in the {{developing}} cerebral cortex, coordinate crucial steps {{in the construction of}} functional circuits. CRs are thought to be transient, as they disappear during early postnatal life in both mice and humans, where their abnormal persistence is associated with pathological conditions. Embryonic CRs comprise at least three molecularly and functionally distinct subtypes: septum, ventral pallium/pallial-subpallial boundary (PSB), and hem. However, whether subtype-specific features exist postnatally and through which mechanisms they disappear remain unknown. We report that CR subtypes display unique distributions and dynamics of death in the postnatal mouse cortex. Surprisingly, although all CR subtypes undergo cell death, septum, but not <b>hem,</b> CRs <b>die</b> in a Bax-dependent manner. Bax-inactivated rescued septum-CRs maintain immature electrophysiological properties. These results underlie the existence of an exquisitely refined control of developmental cell death and provide a model to test the effect of maintaining immature circuits in the adult neocortex...|$|R
5000|$|The Annales Fuldenses give {{an almost}} {{identical}} {{account of this}} reign. This is not surprising as the entries of the Annales Fuldenses from 714 to the 830s were adopting material from earlier sources, including the Royal Frankish Annals. Hemming also appears in an 810 entry of the Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum by Adam of Bremen. [...] "After their king Gudfred (Latin: Gotafridus) had subjected the Frisians and likewise the Nordalbingians, the Abodrites, and other Slavic peoples to tribute, he threatened even Charles with war. This strife very seriously retarded the emperor's purpose with respect to Hamburg. When at length, by the dispensation of Heaven, Gudfred <b>died,</b> <b>Hemming,</b> his cousin, succeeded and soon made peace with the emperor, accepting the Eider River as the boundary of the kingdom." [...] The term used in Latin was [...] "patruelis" [...] which would mean a paternal cousin.|$|R
