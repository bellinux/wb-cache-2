Before he can do so, Rudolph {{declares}} that he would <b>give</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> avoid being blown up the next day, and Ludwig sees a way out. He feigns patriotism and suggests that the two engage in a statutory duel. He explains that they will hide cards up their sleeves, guaranteeing victory to Ludwig. When the plot unfolds, Ludwig will {{bear the brunt of}} it. The next day, when the Act authorizing statutory duels expires, Rudolph can come back to life unharmed. Although Rudolph is sceptical, he accepts Ludwig's proposal.|$|E

500|$|By 2001, {{the project}} had become {{stranded}} in development hell. In a Q panel at Comic-Con 2007, Gaiman remarked, [...] "I'd rather see no Sandman movie made than a bad Sandman movie. But I {{feel like the}} time for a Sandman movie is coming soon. We need someone who has the same obsession with the source material as Peter Jackson had with Lord of the Rings or Sam Raimi had with Spider-Man." [...] That same year, he stated that he could imagine Terry Gilliam as a director for the adaptation: [...] "I would always <b>give</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> Terry Gilliam, forever, so if Terry Gilliam ever wants to do Sandman then as far as I'm concerned Terry Gilliam should do Sandman." [...] In 2013, DC President Diane Nelson said that a Sandman film would be as rich as the Harry Potter universe. David S. Goyer announced in an interview in early December that he would be producing an adaptation of the graphic novel, alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Neil Gaiman. Jack Thorne was hired to write the script. On October 16, 2014, Gaiman clarified that while the film was not announced with the DC slate by Warner Bros., it would instead be distributed by Vertigo and announced with those slate of films. Goyer told Deadline.com in an interview that the studio was very happy with the film's script. According to Deadline.com, the film was to be distributed by New Line Cinema. In October 2015, Goyer revealed that a new screenwriter was being brought on board to revise the script by Jack Thorne and stated that he believed the film would go into production the following year. In March 2016, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Eric Heisserer was hired to rewrite the film's script. The next day, Gordon-Levitt announced that he had dropped out due to disagreements with the studio over the creative direction of the film. On November 9, 2016, i09 reported that Heisserer had turned in his draft of the script but left the film, stating that the film should be an HBO series instead.|$|E

In Brazil, the Clio had a trim level called Va Va Voom. The trim level has been discontinued. In Mexico, The Clio II's latest campaign reads [...] "todo por mi Clio" [...] (anything for my Clio), depicting one would <b>give</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> keep one's Clio safe from danger.|$|E
2500|$|By {{that time}} Kraus {{and two other}} Marines were in the Embassy {{cafeteria}} with more than 18 civilians. One of the militants approached the building and Kraus caught him by surprise and pointed a shotgun at his head. [...] He and his fellow Marines negotiated to let the civilians go peacefully. [...] The Marines then destroyed most of the weapons {{to keep them from}} falling {{into the hands of the}} militants. [...] Militants then stormed the restaurant and captured the Marines. One of them fired a shotgun at Kraus, but his body armor absorbed the brunt of the impact. [...] He was hit in his head and chest with shrapnel, but not severely. [...] He was then beaten for information. [...] When he did not <b>give</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> his captors, one of them pulled a gun and fired it in close proximity, intentionally not to kill, but to wound him further; he was bleeding from his neck, arms and chest.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Shila of Nawha (a place east of Gadara in the Galilee) {{interpreted}} the word [...] "needy" [...] ( [...] , evyon) in [...] to teach {{that one should}} give to the poor person from one's wealth, for that wealth is the poor person's, given to you in trust. Rabbi Abin observed that when a poor person stands at one's door, God stands at the person's right, as [...] says: [...] "Because He stands at the right hand of the needy." [...] If one gives something to a poor person, one should reflect that the One who stands at the poor person's right will reward the giver. And if one does not <b>give</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> a poor person, one should reflect that the One who stands at the poor person's right will punish {{the one who did}} not give, as [...] says: [...] "He stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that judge his soul." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album took {{eighteen}} months to complete, the longest Jackson had spent recording an album. Its {{initial stages of}} [...] "hard-hitting dance music" [...] were inspired by Zero 7 and Télépopmusik, who later produced the album's interludes. [...] "Some of the songs have a definite sort of ambient quality to them," [...] said producer Jimmy Jam. Jam added [...] "There's some house stuff, which there always is [...]" [...] "There {{is going to be}} some more guitar-flavored things" [...] "happy up-tempo songs, the very funky tunes, the very sensual, sexy ballads." [...] Dallas Austin considered it [...] "easily the most sexy thing she's done." [...] "To me, this is her Dirty Mind," [...] Austin explained. [...] "It's a really sexy record, but not in a sensual way. It's bold, it's fun, it's really positive. Nobody's sad, nobody's mad. It's just really fun songs where she happens to be talking frankly about sex." [...] The sensual direction originated from the aura Jackson exuded to Austin while recording. [...] "Guys won't {{know what to do with}} themselves after this," [...] said Austin, laughing at the prospect. [...] "It's one of the best records she's made." [...] Then-newcomer Kanye West exclaimed his sessions with Jackson were [...] "unbelievable," [...] having previously expressed desire to collaborate. Songwriter Sean Garrett described being [...] "starstruck," [...] calling the session an [...] "essential" [...] part of his early career. [...] "I thought working with Janet would change my life and it definitely did. [...] She was one of those people that I really wanted to work with." [...] Anders Bagge of BAG & Arnthor commented [...] "That's my dream, she's the one I would <b>give</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> work with.
