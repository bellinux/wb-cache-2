5|$|Filming was {{scheduled}} to start in December 1983, but was postponed for six months to accommodate Modine's shooting schedule for Mrs. Soffel (1984). Principal photography began in Philadelphia on May 15, 1984, with a budget of $12 million. The script required that a total of 24 locations be used for filming in Philadelphia and Santa Clara, California. Animal trainer Gary Gero employed the use of 80 different canaries for various scenes in the film, as well as pigeons, a <b>hornbill,</b> a cat, eighteen dogs and a seagull.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of parental care in frigatebirds {{is among the}} longest for birds, rivalled only by the southern ground <b>hornbill</b> and some large accipitrids. Frigatebirds take many years to reach sexual maturity. A study of great frigatebirds in the Galapagos Islands found that they only bred once they have acquired the full adult plumage. This was attained by female birds when they were eight to nine {{years of age and}} by male birds when they were ten to eleven years of age.|$|E

50|$|Rainforests with {{abundant}} fruit-bearing {{trees are}} the natural habitat of these birds. The Walden's <b>hornbills</b> live {{in small groups}} and are noisy. The Walden's <b>hornbills</b> use natural or carved-out hollows in tree trunks for its nest. As other <b>hornbills,</b> they reproduce very slowly. As lack of appropriate nesting sites is a problem, nest boxes are being attached to tree trunks in certain reserves.|$|R
5|$|There are {{at least}} 508 bird species. Most of Karnataka's five hundred species of birds are from the Western Ghats region. There {{are at least}} 16 species of birds endemic to the Western Ghats {{including}} the endangered rufous-breasted laughingthrush, the vulnerable Nilgiri wood-pigeon, white-bellied shortwing and broad-tailed grassbird, the near threatened grey-breasted laughingthrush, black-and-rufous flycatcher, Nilgiri flycatcher, and Nilgiri pipit, and the least concern Malabar (blue-winged) parakeet, Malabar grey <b>hornbill,</b> white-bellied treepie, grey-headed bulbul, rufous babbler, Wynaad laughingthrush, white-bellied blue-flycatcher and the crimson-backed sunbird.|$|E
5|$|Care {{of young}} is protracted, {{extending}} {{for as long}} as six months, among the longest for birds. For example, once common guillemot chicks fledge, they remain with the male parent for several months at sea. The frigatebirds have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern ground <b>hornbill,</b> with each chick fledging after four to six months and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months. Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. This life-history strategy has probably evolved both in response to the challenges of living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land-living birds.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{visitors}} to Sarawak are predominantly from Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and China. A {{number of different}} organisations, both state and private, {{are involved in the}} promotion of tourism in Sarawak: the Sarawak Tourism Board is the state body responsible for tourism promotion in the state, various private tourism groups are united under the Sarawak Tourism Federation, and the Sarawak Convention Bureau is responsible for attracting conventions, conferences, and corporate events which are held in the Borneo Convention Centre in Kuching. The public and private bodies in Sarawak hold a biannual event to award the Sarawak <b>Hornbill</b> Tourism Award, an award for achievements within various categories, to recognise businesses and individuals for their efforts in the development of tourism within the state.|$|E
50|$|The Manas hosts {{more than}} 450 species of birds. It {{has the largest}} {{population}} of the endangered Bengal florican to be found anywhere.

The river houses at Palembang are built on rafts moored to piles, rising and falling with the tide. He admires the traditional houses of the villages, but had difficulty getting any food there, the people living entirely on rice through the rainy season. He discovers some new species of butterfly including Papilio memnon which occurs in different forms, some being Batesian mimics of Papilio coon. He admires the camouflage of a species of dead leaf butterfly, Kallima paralekta. He is pleased {{that one of his}} hunters brings him a male <b>hornbill,</b> shot at its nest hole while feeding the female.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{provides}} sanctuary to {{many animals}} that {{need a place}} to live for various reasons. Some (like the Arabian oryx, Bali mynah, rhinoceros <b>hornbill,</b> Mexican gray wolf, and white rhinoceros) participate in captive breeding programs, some (such as the African spotted dogs) have retired from such programs and need a home, some have behavioral problems, and some are being rehabilitated to return to the wild. Animals that are in sanctuary are treated somewhat differently from other animals by the zoo. While normal exhibits balance the needs of the animals with those of visitors (for example, incorporating large viewing areas), the sanctuary exhibits are almost completely focused on the comfort and well-being of the animals.|$|E
5|$|Kerala's fauna are {{notable for}} their {{diversity}} and {{high rates of}} endemism: it includes 118 species of mammals (1 endemic), 500 species of birds, 189 species of freshwater fish, 173 species of reptiles (10 of them endemic), and 151 species of amphibians (36 endemic). These are threatened by extensive habitat destruction, including soil erosion, landslides, salinisation, and resource extraction. In the forests, sonokeling, Dalbergia latifolia, anjili, mullumurikku, Erythrina, and Cassia number {{among the more than}} 1,000 species of trees in Kerala. Other plants include bamboo, wild black pepper, wild cardamom, the calamus rattan palm, and aromatic vetiver grass, Vetiveria zizanioides. Indian elephant, Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Nilgiri tahr, common palm civet, and grizzled giant squirrels are also found in the forests. Reptiles include the king cobra, viper, python, and mugger crocodile. Kerala's birds include the Malabar trogon, the great <b>hornbill,</b> Kerala laughingthrush, darter and southern hill myna.

50|$|A mutualistic {{relationship}} has evolved between dwarf mongooses and <b>hornbills,</b> in which <b>hornbills</b> {{seek out the}} mongooses {{in order for the}} two species to forage together, and to warn each other of nearby raptors and other predators.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hornbills</b> are diurnal, {{generally}} travelling {{in pairs}} or small family groups. Larger flocks sometimes form outside the breeding season. The largest assemblies of <b>hornbills</b> form at some roosting sites, where {{as many as}} 2400 individual birds may be found.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hornbills</b> select nest sites {{based on}} the {{availability}} and type of fruiting trees, {{as well as on}} the availability and quality of nest site cavities in their particular habitat. Some oriental pied <b>hornbills</b> have demonstrated tree species preferences for nest site selection. In Rajaji National Park in India, oriental pied <b>hornbills</b> nest in a variety of tree species such as Bombax ceiba, Careya arborea, Cordia myxa, Lagerstroemia parviflora, Mitragyma parviflora, Terminalia belerica, Shorea robusta, and Syzigium cumini.|$|R

50|$|Great <b>hornbills</b> {{are usually}} seen in small parties, with larger groups {{sometimes}} aggregating at fruit trees. A congregation of 150 to 200 birds {{has been recorded}} in southeastern Bhutan. In the wild, the great <b>hornbill's</b> diet consists mainly of fruit. Figs are particularly important as a food source. Vitex altissima has been noted as another important food source. Great <b>hornbills</b> also forage on lipid-rich fruits of the Lauraceae and Myristicaceae families such as Persea, Alseodaphne and Myristica. They obtain the water that they need entirely from their diet of fruits. They are important dispersers of many forest tree species. They will also eat small mammals, birds, small reptiles and insects. Lion-tailed macaques have been seen to forage alongside these <b>hornbills.</b>|$|R
