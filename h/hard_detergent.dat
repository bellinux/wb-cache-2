40|$|Regular {{concentrations}} of hard detergents in domestic wastewater do not affect algal growth in a high-rate-oxidation pond. The addition of nonionic <b>hard</b> <b>detergent</b> at concentrations above 60 mg/liter decreased the algal {{concentration in the}} batch culture, and complete lysis of algal cells was observed {{within a few days}} at a detergent concentration of 100 mg/liter...|$|E
50|$|Simoniz USA {{was formed}} {{as a result of}} a {{purchase}} by Syndet Products, Inc. of the Simoniz brand name in 1997 from First Brands Corp. Syndet, at the time, was a 25-year-old manufacturer of <b>hard</b> surface <b>detergents,</b> cleaners and waxes, serving the automotive, institutional and industrial marketplaces. Simoniz was already a part of consumer product and advertising history and lore.|$|R
50|$|Laundry {{detergent}}, or washing powder, {{is a type}} of detergent (cleaning agent) that {{is added}} for cleaning laundry, commonly mixtures of chemical compounds including alkylbenzenesulfonates, which are similar to soap but are less affected by <b>hard</b> water. While <b>detergent</b> is still sold in powdered form, liquid detergents have been taking major market shares in many countries since their introduction in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|It {{is often}} {{desirable}} to soften <b>hard</b> water. Most <b>detergents</b> contain ingredients that counteract {{the effects of}} hard water on the surfactants. For this reason, water softening is often unnecessary. Where softening is practised, it is often recommended to soften only the water sent to domestic hot water systems so as to prevent or delay inefficiencies and damage due to scale formation in water heaters. A common method for water softening {{involves the use of}} ion exchange resins, which replace ions like Ca2+ by twice the number of monocations such as sodium or potassium ions.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{the amount}} of {{detergent}} industries in world in spite of having abundant benefits; entering {{a new kind of}} contamination into environment and attract the attention of environment liable of different countries to itself. Entering detergents into an aqueous solution cause pollution of water sources and environment in respect of appearing e problem and charges like: nutritive phenomenon, decomposition of <b>hard</b> group of <b>detergent</b> and producing foam. After using Detergents, they were poured into rivers, seas and lakes and have destructive effect on environment. A lot of hygiene problems were attributed to the water having detergents more than allowed value. So, it is specified the importance of eliminating detergents from contaminated water and it is application for secondary use. In order to attain to this aim, we can use inorganic nano and micro-caolin. In this study the adsorptive properties of detergent on the micro and nano caolin adsorbents were studied and the effect of various parameters like {{the amount of}} adsorptive materials, initial concentration of detergent, speed of stirring, electrolyte, temperature, time and pH were determined. The surface area of micro- and nano-caoline was reported 11. 867 and 49. 1438 m 2 g- 1, respectively. That increasing in nano-caoline surface area confirms increasing in capacity and more rate of adsorption. The results gained by this research recommend using micro- and nano-caolin as a plentiful, available and effective adsorbents. Also in comparison, using nano-caoline was recommended in order to have more effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus equi is the causative {{agent of}} the {{purulent}} infection equine strangles. This disease is transmitted through shedding of live bacteria from nasal secretions and abscess drainage or by contact with surfaces contaminated by the bacteria. Disinfectants are effective against S. equi, but inactivation by environmental factors, damage to equipment, and toxicity are of great concern. Bacteriophage-encoded lysins (cell wall hydrolases) have been investigated as therapeutic agents due {{to their ability to}} lyse susceptible gram-positive organisms. Here, we investigate the use of one lysin, PlyC, as a narrow-spectrum disinfectant against S. equi. This enzyme was active against > 20 clinical isolates of S. equi, including both S. equi subsp. equi and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. Significantly, PlyC was 1, 000 times more active on a per weight basis than Virkon-S, a common disinfecting agent, with 1 Î¼g of enzyme able to sterilize a 108 CFU/ml culture of S. equi in 30 min. PlyC was subjected to a standard battery of tests including the Use Dilution Method for Testing Disinfectants and the Germicidal Spray Products Test. Results indicate that aerosolized PlyC can eradicate or significantly reduce the S. equi load on a variety of materials found on common stable and horse-related equipment. Additionally, PlyC was shown to retain full activity under conditions that mimic a horse stable, i. e., in the presence of nonionic <b>detergents,</b> <b>hard</b> water, or organic materials. We propose PlyC as the first protein-based, narrow-spectrum disinfectant against S. equi, which may augment or supplement the use of broad-spectrum disinfectants in barns and stables where equine strangles is prevalent...|$|R
40|$|Die {{compaction}} of powders is {{a process}} which involves filling a die with powder, compression of the powder using rigid punches to form a dense compact, and ejection from the die. The choice of powder composition and selection of process parameters determine the microstructure and final properties of the compacts. The practical issues in the powder-forming industries (powder metallurgy, ceramics, <b>hard</b> metals, pharmaceuticals, <b>detergents,</b> etc.) are related to mechanical strength, control of microstructure, avoidance of cracks and defects, content uniformity, etc. We review the modelling strategies used for powder compaction. The main {{focus is on the}} constitutive model development for finite element analysis. Knowledge of the following input factors is required: 1. constitutive equations which describe the deformation of a volume of powder under the loads applied during compaction 2. friction interaction between powder and tooling 3. geometry of die and punches 4. pressing schedule, e. g. sequence of punch motions 5. initial conditions that relate to the state of the powder in the die after die fill The constitutive model and friction relate to fundamental properties of the material and are reviewed in more detail. The methodologies used for model calibration are also described. The remaining factors (geometry, pressing schedule and initial conditions) are specific to particular problems. Their relative effect is discussed by presenting examples for a range of powder materials. We show how compact microstructure can be manipulated by changing the factors discussed above and illustrate the effect of microstructure on final properties. The model predictions are validated using experimental data. The use of numerical analysis in powder formulation design and optimisation of the process parameters is discussed.
