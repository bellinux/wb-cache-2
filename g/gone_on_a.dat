5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between August and November 1996, Venom: The Hunger {{introduces the}} Venom symbiote's reliance on phenethylamine for survival (which requires it to eat human brains after depleting Brock's {{supply of the}} chemical) and reveals that chocolate {{is a source of}} the chemical. Brock refuses to eat human brains; the symbiote abandons him, and he is locked in an asylum under the care of the deranged Dr. Paine. Brock escapes to hunt the symbiote, which has <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> killing spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the symbiote (after finding an alternative source of the chemical), but Paine steals the symbiote for himself. Brock frees the symbiote, and again becomes Venom.|$|E

After she is discharged, Akash realises his love for her, and tries everything to make her happy.

Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.|$|E

5|$|Lyrically, All Hope Is Gone {{centers on}} themes such as anger, disaffection, obsession, {{and the music}} industry. The album name also {{features}} a more prominent focus on politics than their previous albums. Slipknot promoted All Hope Is <b>Gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> world tour and at the Mayhem Festival. Generally well received by critics, the album reached the top position on nine record charts worldwide, including the Billboard 200—the first Slipknot album to do so. It was certified platinum by the RIAA on August 10, 2010 for shipments in excess of 1,000,000 albums in the United States. It is the final studio album released by the band to include two longtime members: bassist and founding member Paul Gray, who {{was found dead in}} an Iowa hotel on May 24, 2010, almost two years after the release of All Hope Is Gone, and drummer Joey Jordison, who departed from the group in December 2013.|$|E
5|$|On one occasion, the two {{scientists}} had <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fossil-collecting expedition to Cope's marl pits in New Jersey, where William Parker Foulke {{had discovered the}} holotype specimen of Hadrosaurus foulkii, described by the paleontologist Joseph Leidy (under whom Cope had studied comparative anatomy); {{this was one of}} the first American dinosaur finds, and the pits were still rich with fossils. Though the two parted amicably, Marsh secretly bribed the pit operators to divert future fossil finds to him, instead of Cope. The two began attacking each other in papers and publications, and their personal relations deteriorated. Marsh humiliated Cope by pointing out that his reconstruction of the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus was flawed, with the head placed where the tail should have been (or so he claimed, 20 years later; it was Leidy who published the correction shortly afterwards). Cope, in turn, began collecting in what Marsh considered his private bone-hunting turf in Kansas and Wyoming, further damaging their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{place in}} 1997, {{the story begins}} when Laura Harris is {{contacted}} by Los Angeles police, receiving a disturbing message: her father, Dr. Richter Harris, has <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mass murdering spree and barricaded himself in the hospital. Laura rushes {{to the scene of}} the crime, desperate to find an explanation for the well-respected doctor's actions. Upon entering the hospital, she is so horrified at the murdered bodies lying about the halls that she covers her eyes. When she uncovers them again, she finds herself in an unknown medieval castle. Unwilling to give up her search, Laura continues through the dark corridors of the castle. While attempting to find her father, she experiences a series of flashbacks of her mother being stabbed to death. Laura's father (taking the form of apparitions) warns her to leave, saying that staying too long means being stuck in the alternate reality forever. He warns that he will soon become an emotionless monster and will eventually try to kill her. Still shaken, Laura proceeds to find her father.|$|E

After these victories, Konoe regarded the war as good as won. Ominously for the Chinese, Konoe spoke {{of the status of}} Manchukuo as the ideal basis for a Sino-Japanese peace. Sometimes Konoe went even further and mentioned the protectorate that the Japanese had imposed on Korea in 1905, which had been followed up by Korea's annexation in 1910, as an ideal basis for peace. Whether Manchukuo or Korea was the model of new relationship with Japan, Konoe was quite open that the Chinese would have to accept a subordinate position to Japan if the war were ever to end to Japan's satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|Tempestuous music {{accompanies the}} entry of a crowd of vagabonds who have {{captured}} the boyar Khrushchov. The crowd taunts him, then bows in mock homage ("Not a falcon flying in the heavens"). The yuródivïy enters, pursued by urchins. He sings a nonsensical song ("The moon is flying, the kitten is crying"). The urchins greet him and rap on his metal hat. The yuródivïy has a kopek, which the urchins promptly steal. He whines pathetically. Varlaam and Misail are heard in the distance singing of the crimes of Boris and his henchmen ("The sun and moon have gone dark"). They enter. The crowd gets worked up to a frenzy ("Our bold daring has broken free, <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rampage") denouncing Boris. Two Jesuits are heard in the distance chanting in Latin ("Domine, Domine, salvum fac"), praying that God will save Dmitriy. They enter. At the instigation of Varlaam and Misail, the vagabonds prepare to hang the Jesuits, who appeal to the Holy Virgin for aid. Processional music heralds the arrival of Dmitriy and his forces. Varlaam and Misail glorify him ("Glory to thee, Tsarevich!") along with the crowd. The Pretender calls those persecuted by Godunov to his side. He frees Khrushchov, and calls on all to march on Moscow. All exeunt except the yuródivïy, who sings a plaintive song ("Flow, flow, bitter tears!") of {{the arrival of the}} enemy and of woe to Russia.|$|E

Borough midfielder Mitchell Cole was also stretchered off with an ankle injury in the first-half of the same game. Later that week, it was announced that utility player Peter Vincenti had <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> three-month loan deal to recently relegated Conference South side Woking. On 31 July, Stevenage played League One club Southend United. Stevenage won the game 21, with two first half goals from Joel Byrom and Darren Murphy. The following day, Stevenage played out a 00 draw with Conference South side Woking in their final pre-season fixture. Despite joining Woking on-loan, Peter Vincenti featured for his parent club, whilst former Mansfield Town winger Nathan Arnold also played a part in the match. However, it was announced that Vincenti's loan deal to Woking had fallen through after Borough boss Graham Westley decided he wants to keep the player as cover.
