500|$|... 21st-place {{qualifier}} Casey Mears had his car lose {{power on}} his second warm-up lap after exiting the fourth turn and stopped in turn two; he was allowed one attempt to record a timed lap as a result. Dario Franchitti and Moreno qualified in the 22nd and 23rd positions, while Castroneves took 24th. Carpentier, who qualified in 25th, was observed speeding after he exited pit road and was limited to one lap time. On his run, he went up onto the track's dirty side in turn two and removed his foot from the accelerator pedal. Fernández qualified {{at the back of}} the grid in 26th position and turned off his engine on the backstretch while {{on his second}} warm-up lap and stopped at the bottom of turn three. After qualifying,Tagliani said: [...] "The car is very fast, the team was very quick earlier this year at Michigan and we're looking good right now. We didn't expect to qualify that fast actually, but the car was free and it was great. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good shot to stay up front with that time." ...|$|E
500|$|Let the Right One In was an {{international}} success. Critics lauded {{the performances of}} the young leads, often highlighting Leandersson for particular acclaim. According to Karen Durbin of Elle, she [...] "evokes Eli's radical apartness {{with an air of}} watchful caution and a contained stillness of body that not only belies her childish appearance (...)", and [...] "In a performance devoid of sentimentality she perfectly captures the awful solitude of a creature who exists outside time". James Berardinelli also praised Leandersson for [...] "crafting an individual who is both mysterious and compelling", while Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "The youthful actors imbue even the most emotional and disturbing scenes with remarkable complexity. Leandersson is particularly impressive as the conflicted young vampire who wants nothing more than to be an ordinary girl again". Luke Y. Thompson of LA Weekly compared her performance favorably to that of Kirsten Dunst as the child vampire Claudia in Interview with the Vampire. He concluded that, while Dunst [...] "used to be the gold standard; in Leandersson, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> new champion." [...] The Oregonian called Leandersson's performance [...] "incredible", and expressed doubt that any actress in the American remake could top it. While Swedish reviewers generally made positive comments about the two leads, Emma Engström of Göteborgs-Posten felt that Leandersson's character was lacking in depth.|$|E

500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something {{that we want to}} hear when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to our surprise there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, {{days before}} the release of The Hangover Part II, {{director}} Todd Phillips said that [...] "there already are plans for a third film but no script or start date". About the possibility of The Hangover Part III, Phillips stated, [...] "If we were to do a third one, if the audience, if the desire was there, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very clear idea where that would head. It's certainly {{not in the same}} template that you've seen these movies. The third would be very much a finale and an ending. The most I could say about it, what's in my head, and I haven't discussed it with these actors, {{is that it is not}} following that template but very much a new idea. As far as where it takes place, I said I'm very open." [...] Also during May, Craig Mazin, who co-wrote The Hangover Part II, entered early talks to write the script for the third installment.|$|E
2500|$|Guadalajara, due to {{the ongoing}} Mexican Drug War, has seen {{escalating}} violence. Some countries, including the United States and Canada, expressed concerns about the safety and security of the region. Scott Backmun of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) raised concerns about the city's ability to host the games {{in light of the}} drug war. Due to the increased safety issues the USOC had its own security plan for the games. During a meeting of the USOC in March 2011, chief security officer Larry Buendorf gave a report {{to the rest of the}} committee in which he said, [...] "We’re going to prepare for Guadalajara like we would any other Games. A lot of that is just preparing your athletes for the individual environments that they’re going into. Everybody is quite aware of the violence that has happened. We’re obviously concerned about it, and at the end of the day, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good security plan in place to try to protect our athletes". After grenades were thrown near a nightclub entrance in two separate incidents in February 2011, organizers said they were making security a priority and arranged for police and members of the armed forces to patrol in Guadalajara throughout the games.|$|E

2500|$|Jordan Thomas, BioShock 2s {{creative}} director, {{said that}} the first concern with a sequel to BioShock was [...] "where do you go with this? How do you bring people back to an experience and terrify them and shock {{them in a way}} that they’re not expecting, but also fulfill the many expectations they’re projecting onto it?" [...] Early on, Thomas decided that it couldn't be a BioShock game without the city of Rapture, and that there were many unseen locations and untold stories that could remained with the setting. The developers wanted to bring some of the mystery back to the location of Rapture, and maintain a balance of surprising old players while introducing the setting to newcomers. Thomas and environmental artist Hogarth De La Plante agreed that the setting of Rapture was fertile ground for new ideas, and that as they were both veterans of the original game, they were excited to add never-before-seen parts of the city and push the artistic style they had developed. [...] "Any idea was out on the table at that point, and I think nobody has played BioShock more than the developers that made it, so I feel like in one respect we are a pretty good litmus test for whether it’s still an interesting place or not," [...] La Plante recalled. [...] "And if that doesn’t bore us and we’re the people that played it for thousands upon thousands of hours, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pretty good perspective on how interesting that location really is." ...|$|E

Perhaps we have some other things there that might interest you. We have a few second-hand things in the alcove there that you might care to look at. There's an Aristotle, two volumes--a very fine thing--practically illegible, that you might like: and a Cicero came in yesterday--very choice--damaged by damp--and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Machiavelli, quite exceptional--practically torn to pieces, and the covers gone--a very rare old thing, sir, if you're an expert." ...|$|E

Let us refuse to associate with the young men whom we know to be what is called 'gay,' and accept as friends those of whose good habits we are sure.

It is more serious to me--" [...] She looked round at Mr. Clare, who sat closely watching her, and instantly looked back again, with the first outward betrayal of emotion which had escaped her yet. [...] "It is even more serious to me," [...] she resumed, [...] "for private reasons--than it is to my sister. I know nothing yet but that our father's brother has taken our fortunes from us. He must have some motives of his own for such conduct as that. It is not fair to him, or fair to us, to keep those motives concealed. He has deliberately robbed Norah, and robbed me; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right, if we wish it, to know why?" ...|$|E

However, we must insure that word is not sent from the village, when the troops begin to get up. A stir {{an hour before the}} usual time is sure to excite remark, and as it is certain these fellows will have arranged with some one in the village for early news of any unusual movement, we must take steps to prevent a messenger passing. I propose that you two shall be astir half an hour before the troops; and that you shall, before any one else is moving, go along the path leading to the cliffs, stop a couple of hundred yards beyond the village, and arrest any one who may come along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{you find}} Mr Todhunter tied up," [...] he said, [...] "you all {{jump to the}} {{conclusion}} that Mr Glass had tied him up; and then, I suppose, escaped. There are four objections to this: First, why should a gentleman so dressy as our friend Glass leave his hat behind him, if he left of his own free will? Second," [...] he continued, moving towards the window, [...] "this is the only exit, and it is locked on the inside. Third, this blade here has a tiny touch of blood at the point, but there is no wound on Mr Todhunter. Mr Glass took that wound away with him, dead or alive. Add to all this primary probability. It is much more likely that the blackmailed person would try to kill his incubus, rather than that the blackmailer would try to kill the goose that lays his golden egg. There, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pretty complete story." ...|$|E

"And if thieves {{are about}} the house," [...] said Pen, grimly {{pursuing}} the simile, [...] "forty besetting thieves {{in the shape of}} lurking cares and enemies in ambush and passions in arms, my Morgiana will dance round me with a tambourine, and kill all my rogues and thieves with a smile. Won't she?" [...] But Pen looked as if he did not believe that she would. [...] "Ah, Blanche," [...] he continued after a pause, [...] "don't be angry; don't be hurt at my truth-telling.--Don't you see that I always take you at your word? You say you will be a slave and dance--I say, dance. You say, 'I take you with what you bring:' I say, 'I take you with what you bring.'

If I offer myself to you because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fair chance of being happy together, and because by your help I may get for both of us a good place and a not undistinguished name, why ask me to feign raptures and counterfeit romance, in which neither of us believe? Do you want me to come wooing in a Prince Prettyman's dress from the masquerade warehouse, and to pay you compliments like Sir Charles Grandison? Do you want me to make you verses as in the days when we were--when we were children? I will if you like, and sell them to Bacon and Bungay afterwards.
