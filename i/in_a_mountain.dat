5|$|After his {{establishment}} in Aleppo, in winter 945–946, Sayf al-Dawla resumed the old Muslim custom of launching annual raids into Byzantine territory. This first operation was of limited scope and {{was followed by}} a prisoner exchange. Warfare on Byzantium's eastern frontiers then subsided for a couple of years, and recommenced only in 948. Initially, the Byzantines were led by the Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief) Bardas Phokas the Elder, but although he was capable enough as a subordinate commander, his tenure as commander-in-chief proved largely a failure. In 948–950 the Byzantines scored a few successes, sacking the border fortresses of Hadath and Marash. Bardas' second son, Leo, distinguished himself in these years, especially in November 950, when he ambushed Sayf al-Dawla, who had previously defeated his father in battle, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain</b> pass; Sayf al-Dawla lost 8,000 men and barely escaped himself.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{penultimate}} novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background, using a fictional obituary, purportedly from The Times. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character. The novel reveals Bond is the son of a Scottish father, Andrew Bond, of Glencoe, and a Swiss mother, Monique Delacroix, of the Canton de Vaud. The young James Bond spends much of his early life abroad, becoming multilingual in German and French because of his father's work as a Vickers armaments company representative. Bond is orphaned at the age of 11 when his parents are killed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain</b> climbing accident in the Aiguilles Rouges near Chamonix.|$|E

25|$|Geology existed as a {{cloud of}} isolated, {{disconnected}} ideas about rocks, minerals, and landforms long before it became a coherent science. Theophrastus' work on rocks, Peri lithōn, remained authoritative for millennia: its interpretation of fossils was not overturned until after the Scientific Revolution. Chinese polymath Shen Kua (1031–1095) first formulated hypotheses for the process of land formation. Based on his observation of fossils in a geological stratum <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain</b> {{hundreds of miles from}} the ocean, he deduced that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.|$|E

25|$|La Grande Illusion, a 1937 film by Jean Renoir, {{depicts the}} story of two French {{officers}} of the First World War sent to a prisoners’ camp in Germany.

The story does not portray negative characters: soldiers or guards, the Germans are good guys, while the Allied prisoners perform their duties conscientiously but without excessive heroism.
