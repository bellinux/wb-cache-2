50|$|The symmetrization and anti-symmetrization of a {{bilinear}} map are bilinear; thus {{away from}} 2, every bilinear form is a sum of a symmetric <b>form</b> <b>and</b> a skew-symmetric <b>form,</b> <b>and</b> {{there is no}} difference between a symmetric <b>form</b> <b>and</b> a quadratic <b>form.</b>|$|R

The crucial conceptual link between modular <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> number theory is furnished by the theory of Hecke operators, which also gives the link between the theory of modular <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> representation theory.|$|R
5|$|A {{study in}} 1971–72 found that {{although}} Cleveland's crime rate {{was significantly lower}} than other large urban areas, most Cleveland residents feared crime. In the 1980s, gang activity was on the rise, associated with crack cocaine. A task force was <b>formed</b> <b>and</b> was partially successful at reducing gang activity {{by a combination of}} removing gang-related graffiti and educating news sources to not name gangs in news reporting.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} goal of measuring enzyme kinetics {{is to determine}} the chemical mechanism of an enzyme reaction, i.e., the sequence of chemical steps that transform substrate into product. The kinetic approaches discussed above will show at what rates intermediates are <b>formed</b> <b>and</b> inter-converted, but they cannot identify exactly what these intermediates are.|$|E
5|$|As a result, a {{coalition}} between the undisciplined Army faction headed by Deodoro and the Positivist faction headed by Constant was <b>formed</b> <b>and</b> directly {{led to the}} 15 November 1889 republican coup.

5|$|Hurricane Humberto was {{a minimal}} {{hurricane}} that <b>formed</b> <b>and</b> intensified {{faster than any}} other North Atlantic tropical cyclone on record before landfall. Developing on September 12, 2007, in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, the tropical cyclone rapidly strengthened and struck High Island, Texas, with winds of about 90mph (150km/h) early on September 13. It steadily weakened after moving ashore, and on September 14 it began dissipating over northwestern Georgia as it interacted with an approaching cold front.|$|E

40|$|Process <b>and</b> <b>form</b> {{have always}} been {{important}} to my work. I emphasize the soft qualities of clay while working with traditional forms that are altered for visual interest. Usability is very important, the forms have to function well according to their intended use. The relationship between <b>form</b> <b>and</b> manipulation relied on usability of the form. Functionality was paramount within this body of work. I consciously searched for balance between <b>form</b> <b>and</b> manipulation, <b>form</b> <b>and</b> glaze, <b>form</b> <b>and</b> function, and overall character. Though altered, the <b>forms</b> were traditional <b>and</b> dependent on function. Manipulations of the <b>forms,</b> surface treatment, <b>and</b> deep colorful glazes contributed to creating harmony between function and expression. Personal stylistic elements became refined through working on this project. The body of work that was made allocated personal expression and new variations on functional forms.

5|$|In late 1857, Buckner and {{his family}} {{returned}} to his native state and settled in Louisville. Buckner's daughter, Lily, was born there on March 7, 1858. Later that year, a Louisville militia known as the Citizens' Guard was <b>formed,</b> <b>and</b> Buckner was made its captain. He served in this capacity until 1860, when the Guard was incorporated into the Kentucky State Guard's Second Regiment. He was appointed inspector general of Kentucky in 1860.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} moment after an enzyme is mixed with substrate, no product has been <b>formed</b> <b>and</b> no {{intermediates}} exist. The study of the next few milliseconds of the reaction is called pre-steady-state kinetics. Pre-steady-state kinetics is therefore concerned with the formation and consumption of enzyme–substrate intermediates (such as ES or E*) until their steady-state concentrations are reached.|$|E
