The NTC had no funds to replace defective boilers and postponed the repairs until the next year. The ships returned into the drydocks of Kronstadt. Their captains hoped to install all missing guns and equipment {{in time for the}} 1911 navigation. This did not happen: the Navy committed all available financing to the dreadnought program; Andrey Pervozvanny and Imperaror Pavel <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> properly completed until the autumn of 1912.|$|E
25|$|The second Romana {{enjoys a}} more {{intimate}} relationship with the Doctor than her previous incarnation, {{to the point that}} some fans have assumed a romantic relationship with the Doctor. Although a relationship was never explicitly shown or intended by the writers, many fans have found the signs of a romantic relationship particularly evident in the story City of Death, perhaps reflecting the real-life romance between Tom Baker and Lalla Ward which blossomed during the production of that story, leading to their brief marriage in 1981. In many ways, she might be claimed to be the companion most like her Doctor (if Romana <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> more like the Doctor than her) – besides being of the same race and comparable intelligence, she occasionally mimics his sense of style, wields her own sonic screwdriver and can occasionally get the better of him in moments of banter and more practical situations. As her practical experience develops, she also becomes more assured and capable in the situations she encounters.|$|E

500|$|Verdi {{still had}} doubts, {{and on the}} next day sent another letter to Boito expressing his concerns. He wrote of [...] "the large number of years" [...] in his age, his health (which he {{admitted}} was still good) and his ability to complete the project: [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> to finish the music?" [...] He said that the project could all be a waste of the younger man's time and distract Boito from completing his own new opera (which became Nerone). Yet, as his biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz notes, [...] "Verdi could not hide his delight at the idea of writing another opera". On 10 July 1889 he wrote again: ...|$|E

500|$|A new [...] drydock and two [...] slipways {{were built}} at Ferrol to {{accommodate}} {{the construction of the}} three battleships. All material, save the armor plate, heavy guns, and fire control equipment, was manufactured in Spain. The contract specified a build time of four years for the first ship, five years for the second, and seven years for the third. Despite the allowance for longer construction times for the later units, their completion, and particularly the third unit, Jaime I, was held up by a lack of materials from Britain {{as a result of the}} outbreak of World War I. Most importantly, the main guns for Jaime <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> delivered until 1919.|$|E
500|$|Alexander {{stopped at}} Thermopylae, {{where he was}} {{recognized}} {{as the leader of}} the Amphictyonic League before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels. The famous encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic occurred during Alexander's stay in Corinth. When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for him, the philosopher disdainfully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side, as he was blocking the sunlight. This reply apparently delighted Alexander, who is reported to have said [...] "But verily, if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> Alexander, I would like to be Diogenes." [...] At Corinth, Alexander took the title of Hegemon ("leader") and, like Philip, was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia. He also received news of a Thracian uprising.|$|E
500|$|The {{search for}} a new guitarist and drummer began with {{advertisements}} placed in copies of Melody Maker. The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, [...] "My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working if I get the gig'." [...] Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth band mate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. [...] "They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, [...] "It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> very good at back-up vocals". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of Otello Verdi commented, [...] "After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to laugh a little." [...] He had {{considered}} a variety of comic subjects but had found none of them wholly suitable and confided his ambition to Boito. The librettist said nothing at the time but secretly began work on a libretto based on The Merry Wives of Windsor with additional material taken from Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2. Verdi received the draft libretto probably in early July 1889 after he had just read Shakespeare's play: [...] "Benissimo! Benissimo!... No one could have done better than you", he wrote back to Boito. But he still had doubts: his age, his health (which he admits to being good) {{and his ability to}} complete the project: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> to finish the music?". If the project failed, {{it would have been a}} waste of Boito's time, and have distracted him from completing his own new opera. Finally on 10 July 1889 he wrote again: [...] "So be it! So let's do Falstaff! For now, let's not think of obstacles, of age, of illnesses!" [...] Verdi emphasised the need for secrecy, but continued [...] "If you are in the mood, then start to write." [...] Later he wrote to Boito (capitals and exclamation marks are Verdi's own): [...] "What joy to be able to say to the public: HERE WE ARE AGAIN!!! COME AND SEE US!" ...|$|E

[...] When Winston Churchill campaigned for rearmament in the 1930s, he was compared to Palmerston in warning the nation to look to its defences. The policy of appeasement led General Jan Smuts to write in 1936 that [...] "we are afraid of our shadows. I sometimes long for a ruffian like Palmerston or any man who {{would be more than}} a string of platitudes and apologies." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was in Corinth that {{a meeting}} between Alexander the Great and Diogenes is {{supposed}} to have taken place. These stories may be apocryphal. The accounts of Plutarch and Diogenes Laërtius recount that they exchanged only a few words: while Diogenes was relaxing in the morning sunlight, Alexander, thrilled to meet the famous philosopher, asked if there was any favour he might do for him. Diogenes replied, [...] "Yes, stand out of my sunlight." [...] Alexander then declared, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes." [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> Diogenes, I would still wish to be Diogenes.", Diogenes replied. In another account of the conversation, Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, [...] "I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the inter-Allied {{conference at}} Boulogne (20 October) Asquith {{supported}} Robertson in opposing major offensives at Salonika, although Britain {{had to agree}} to send a second British division, rather than be the only Ally not to send reinforcements.

2500|$|Hesiod {{knew from}} the {{traditional}} poetry, such as the Iliad, and the heirloom bronze artifacts that abounded in Greek society, that before the use of iron to make tools and weapons, bronze had been the preferred material and iron was not smelted at all. He did not continue the manufacturing metaphor, but mixed his metaphors, switching over to {{the market value of}} each metal. Iron was cheaper than bronze, so {{there must have been a}} golden and a silver age. He portrays a sequence of metallic ages, but it is a degradation rather than a progression. Each age has less of a moral value than the preceding. Of his own age he says: [...] "And I wish that <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> any part of the fifth generation of men, but had died before it came, or had been born afterward." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{an early}} age, Alice was {{interested}} in politics. When advancing age and illness incapacitated her Aunt Bamie, Alice stepped into her place as an unofficial political adviser to her father. She warned her father against challenging the renomination of William Howard Taft in 1912. Alice took a hard-line view of the Democrats and in her youth sympathized with the conservative wing of the Republican Party. She supported her half-brother Ted {{when he ran for}} governor of New York in 1924. When Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for president in [...] 1932, Alice publicly opposed his candidacy. Writing in the Ladies' Home Journal in October 1932, she said of FDR, [...] "Politically, his branch of the family and ours have always been in different camps, and the same surname is about all we have in common.....

2500|$|Holt {{enlisted in}} the Militia in February 1939, joining a {{part-time}} artillery unit for businessmen and professionals. He was given indefinite leave during his ministerial service. In May 1940, without resigning his seat, Holt {{enlisted in the}} Australian Imperial Force {{with the intent of}} becoming a full-time soldier. He was posted to the 2/4th Field Regiment, holding the rank of gunner. He had been offered a commission as an officer in the Royal Australian Air Force, but declined due to his lack of experience. In a press statement, Holt said [...] "as the youngest member of the House, I could not feel happy in my position if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> prepared to make some sacrifice and take an active part". He was sent to Puckapunyal for training, and expected to be posted to North Africa or Palestine. Two of his parliamentary colleagues, William Hutchinson and Keith Wilson, enlisted around the same time, while Thomas White had already done so. In total, nine sitting MPs served in the military at some point in World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Bourguiba {{was officially}} born on August 3, 1903 in Monastir. However, {{there was a}} strong {{uncertainty}} related to his date of birth. According to his biographies, his date of birth may have been falsified in order to rejuvenate him, certain families avoiding to declare too early the birth of a boy in order to avoid circumcision, according to Samya El Mechat in her book La Tunisie et les chemins vers l'indépendance. 1945–1956 (Tunisia on the roads of independence. 1945–56). During a conference he gave on October 12, 1973, Bourguiba stated that they referred to his birth with that of his cousin, Chedli Zouiten, being nine months older than him. He concluded that his birthday might be on August 3, 1902. Nevertheless, the doubt remained since he might actually be born in 1901 or even 1898. In 1955, Bourguiba declared: [...] "I was born in 1901. But when I enrolled in law school in Paris, circa 1924, the secretary made a mistake and wrote 1903. As <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> a young student, I was satisfied with this date of birth and kept it". One of his ministers, Mahmoud El Materi, confirmed this hypothesis in his memoirs.|$|E
