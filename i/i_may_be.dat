Of them all, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> permitted {{to say that}} while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E

25|$|After {{this had}} the king a large meeting, and very deep {{consultation}} with his council, about this land; {{how it was}} occupied, and by what sort of men.

Also he commissioned them to record in writing, 'How much land his archbishops had, and his diocesan bishops, and his abbots, and his earls;' and though <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> prolix and tedious, 'What, or how much, each man had, who was an occupier of land in England, either in land or in stock, and how much money it were worth.' So very narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to trace it out, that there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he thought it no shame to do it), not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in his writ.

500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV News, co-writer of [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] Ne-Yo, who had collaborated with Rihanna on her previous albums A Girl like Me (2006) and Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), clarified {{that he would not}} write a song for Rihanna with regard to Brown as he found it unnecessary and because of his friendship with Brown. Producer Chuck Harmony concurred with Ne-Yo's statement, saying that no matter what song Rihanna released as the lead single people would immediately think that the song is about Brown. In {{an interview}} with USA Today, Ne-Yo later revealed that the song was written two days before Rihanna and Brown's altercation, citing it as [...] "a premonition." [...] In an interview with Sway Calloway for MTV News at Rated Rs [...] preview in New York City, Rihanna stated that the album represented her honesty and vulnerbility. During the preview, Calloway noted that [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] was the song most likely to receive comparisons to Brown, with emphasis on the lyric [...] "I still love you, but I can't do this/ <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> dumb but I'm not stupid." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{alternative}} {{rock band}} Siouxsie and the Banshees picked {{the title of}} Billboard Top 100 hit single [...] "Kiss Them for Me" [...] (included in their 1991's album Superstition) from Mansfield's 1957 film Kiss Them for Me. Lyrics of the song uses Mansfield's catchword [...] "divoon", and refers to her heart-shaped swimming pool, her love of champagne and parties, and to the grisly automobile accident which claimed her life in 1967. In Grok, a novel by Tom Maremaa, a character plays the CD and asks, [...] "Yes, kiss them for me [...] <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> delayed." [...] Too Hot To Handle, the UFO song considered {{to one of the}} top 500 heavy metal songs, takes its title from a Jayne Mansfield film. Mansfield is also alluded in the song [...] "The Actor" [...] by Robbie Williams, from the album [...] "Rudebox". Alternative rock band The Chills released [...] "16 Heartthrobs" [...] as a memorial to Mansfield. In 1997, Courtney Love of the alternative rock band Hole used a photo of Mansfield's wrecked car in the album artwork for the group's compilation album, My Body, the Hand Grenade.|$|E

A 2013 Daytime Confidential poll entitled [...] "Who should win Outstanding Younger Actress?" [...] saw Wood rank ahead of fellow daytime actresses [...] Hunter King (The Young and the Restless), Kristen Alderson and Lindsey Morgan (General Hospital), with readers favoring her as the likely winner of the award. For the 2013 Daytime Emmy Awards, Wood submitted the scenes where Steffy surprises Liam by presenting him with signed annulment papers. Michael Logan listed Wood as his predicted winner in the Outstanding Younger Actress category for that year, writing: [...] "Wood is startlingly versatile and in supreme command as Steffy hands over the signed annulment papers to her husband Liam. There are surprises galore, including a wondrously off-key, Bob Hope-inspired rendition of [...] "Thanks for the Memory," [...] and Wood is at once raw, goofy, sexy. luminous, profound and so very memorable. <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> fairly crummy at my Emmy predictions but this I'm dead certain about: Wood {{is going to be a}} major star." ...|$|E
500|$|During the track, Rihanna's vocal range spans one octave, {{from the}} low note of B3 to the high note of B4. Proposing illicit acts, she uses a [...] "sexually {{aggressive}} tone" [...] in her vocal performance. The lyrics are about sex, sadomasochism, bondage and BDSM fetishes, including the sexual fantasies and turn-ons of its protagonist. The song opens with the hook, [...] "Na, na, na, c'mon". During the chorus the lyrics include, [...] "'Cause <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> bad, but I'm perfectly good at it / Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it." [...] In the song, Rihanna describes herself as [...] "bad" [...] and openly praises her own sexual prowess; lyrics include, [...] "Sticks and stones may break my bones / But chains and whips excite me." [...] Rihanna told Spin magazine that the lyrics are metaphoric. She said that she thought the song was mainly about having confidence in one's identity, and about being impervious to rumors and criticism. According to Jake Conway of Q Magazine at Yale, the lyrics are guilty of [...] "divesting sex of emotion" [...] and re-envisaging violence as fetish; {{he went on to}} say that Rihanna pays homage to the sexual acts in an empowered dance and club mood. Chris Ryan described the song as being about [...] "dirty, naughty, illicit bedroom activities".|$|E

500|$|Taking {{matters into}} his own hands, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago Eric Williams wrote an apology letter for Sobers to sign, {{addressed}} to WICB president Noel Pierce, and had it delivered to the West Indies captain by the Barbadian fast bowler Wes Hall. The letter explained that Sobers had not known of the [...] "deep feelings of the West Indian people" [...] on Rhodesia, that he now better understood the political issues, {{and that he would}} not go to the southern African country again. [...] "I therefore wish to convey to you {{and the members of the}} board my sincere regrets for any embarrassment which my action may have caused, and to assure you of my unqualified dedication whenever <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> called upon to represent my country—the West Indies—and my people," [...] it concluded. Sobers signed, and the apology was promptly conveyed to the WICB in late October 1970, with copies also going to the council of the West Indies Associated States and the prime ministerial offices of Barbados, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica. [...] "A grateful Caribbean grabbed the apology with both hands," [...] Manley records—"The thought that [...] might be lost as a consequence of a political gaffe was intolerable. For the great majority, the incident was forgiven and promptly forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} the 1986 season, Weaver retired for good, and Ripken was named {{manager of the}} Orioles. The Orioles were coming off their first last-place finish in Baltimore, but Ripken expressed confidence in the team {{at the beginning of}} the 1987 season, saying, [...] "I know these guys can get the job done. <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> hardheaded, but that's what I believe. We'll be a competitive team." [...] The Orioles got off to a slow start in April 1987, going 9-12 while losing seven of nine games in ones stretch. However, the ballclub would improve in May, moving over [...]500 while setting a May record with 56 home runs. In June, the team fell out of contention, dropping to 28-36, their worst start since 1955. Pitching plagued the club; Harvey Rosenfeld wrote it was [...] "the root cause of the Orioles' problems. In 1987, Ripken became the first—and only—father to manage two sons simultaneously in the majors, as his son Billy was called up at the All-Star break. Ripken managed Cal Jr. and Billy for the first time on July 11, in a 21 loss to the Minnesota Twins. The Havre de Grace Record wrote, [...] "The Ripkens of Aberdeen became the first family of sports." [...] On September 14, during a 173 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays, Ripken substituted Cal Jr. with Ron Washington after the eighth inning, ending Cal Jr.'s major-league record streak of 8,243 consecutive innings played. Senior said after the game, [...] "I've been thinking about it for a long time. I wanted to take the monkey off his back. It was my decision, not his." [...] The Orioles finished sixth in the American League East at 6795, setting a team record with 51 home losses.|$|E
500|$|The Fourteenth Amendment {{provides}} that children {{born in the}} United States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their parents. At {{the time of the}} amendment's passage, three Senators, including Trumbull,Mr. Cowan: [...] "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"Mr. Trumbull: [...] "Undoubtedly."...Mr. Trumbull: [...] "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."Mr. Cowan: [...] "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."Mr. Trumbull: [...] "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European." [...] the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as President Andrew Johnson, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at birth; however, Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a definitively contrary opinion.Mr. Cowan: [...] "...Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I look upon Gypsies. I do not know how many my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, and I have no doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they may be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit..."Mr. Johnson: [...] "...Who is a citizen of the United States is an open question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States except through the medium of a citizenship in a State..." [...] These congressional remarks applied to non-citizens lawfully present in the United States, as the problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866, and some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized immigrants, although {{the law of the land}} continues to be based on the standard interpretation. Congress during the 21st century has occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of [...] "birth tourism", in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in the United States for purposes of the child's citizenship.|$|E
