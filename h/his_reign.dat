5|$|Shahîd further {{argues that}} the facts of Philip's alleged Christianity would also {{discourage}} Eusebius from celebrating that emperor. Firstly, Philip lacks an exciting conversion narrative; secondly, his religion was private, unlike Constantine's very public patronage of the faith; and, thirdly, <b>his</b> <b>reign</b> only lasted five years, not long enough to enact much amelioration of the Christians' condition. In Shahîd's view, the insignificance of <b>his</b> <b>reign</b> to the progress of Christianity, Eusebius' subject, combined with Eusebius' role as Constantine's panegyrist, explain the tone and content of his account.|$|E

5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning of <b>his</b> <b>reign</b> unless he died in the thirtieth year of <b>his</b> <b>reign.</b> Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 {{years old at}} the beginning of <b>his</b> <b>reign</b> is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 {{years old at the}} time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E

5|$|Amon {{was the son}} of King Manasseh of Judah and Meshullemeth, a {{daughter}} of Haruz of Jotbah. Although the date is unknown, the Hebrew Bible records that he married Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. Amon began <b>his</b> <b>reign</b> of Judah at the age of 22, and reigned for two years. Biblical scholar and archeologist William F. Albright has dated <b>his</b> <b>reign</b> to 642 – 640, while professor E. R. Thiele offers the dates 643/642– 641/640. Thiele's dates are tied to the reign of Amon's son Josiah, whose death at the hands of Pharaoh Necho II occurred in the summer of 609. Josiah's death, which is independently confirmed in Egyptian history, places the end of Amon's reign, 31 years earlier, in 641 or 640 and the beginning of his rule in 643 or 642.|$|E
