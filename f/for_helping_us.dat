McKagan was confirmed as a permanent member of the group, in April, performing at shows in the United States and Europe. His tenure with the band only lasted five months, with his departure from the group announced on September 6. In a statement, the band commented: [...] "We wanted to thank Duff <b>for</b> <b>helping</b> <b>us</b> write songs for our new record. We love the songs we worked on with him — and the gigs were a blast — but musically we were all headed in different directions.

2500|$|On April 8, 2011, Louis Marinelli, a 25-year-old NOM {{activist and}} online {{strategist}} who {{describes himself as}} [...] "the one behind the 2010 Summer for Marriage Tour", had driven the bus during that tour, and had moderated many of NOM's web properties (including its Facebook page, its Twitter account, and the Tour blog), resigned from his affiliation with the organization, announced his support for same-sex marriage, and categorically apologized for and repudiated his past actions on behalf of the organization. He also shut down the Facebook page he had built up for NOM, which had 290,000 followers. The next day, NOM created a new official Facebook page (to replace Marinelli's), and released this statement: [...] "Louis Marinelli worked in a volunteer capacity as a bus driver during our summer marriage tour. Around this time, NOM began to pay him as a part-time consultant <b>for</b> <b>helping</b> <b>us</b> expand our internet reach. He has since chosen a different focus. We wish him well." [...] NOM president Brown publicly downplayed Marinelli's role with the organization, however, after Marinelli published several articles critical of NOM on his website, Brown contacted him and said that if the articles were not removed, NOM would pursue legal action against Marinelli for violation of a confidentiality agreement he had signed as a contractor with access to specialized information.|$|E

5000|$|The Drake {{equation}} {{amounts to}} {{a summary of the}} factors affecting the likelihood that we might detect radio-communication from intelligent extraterrestrial life. The last four parameters, , , , and , are not known and are very hard to estimate, with values ranging over many orders of magnitude (see criticism). Therefore, the usefulness of the Drake equation is not in the solving, but rather in the contemplation of all the various concepts which scientists must incorporate when considering the question of life elsewhere, and gives the question of life elsewhere a basis for scientific analysis. The Drake equation is a statement that stimulates intellectual curiosity about the universe around us, <b>for</b> <b>helping</b> <b>us</b> to understand that {{life as we know it}} is the end product of a natural, cosmic evolution, and <b>for</b> <b>helping</b> <b>us</b> realize how much we are a part of that universe.

50|$|John Dirkx views {{transformational}} {{learning as}} a meaning-making process within adult education, aimed at promoting a democratic vision {{of society and}} self-actualization of individuals. Learning is life—not a preparation for it. Therefore, transformational learning requires authenticity, a commitment {{to focus on the}} here and now, and awareness of feelings and emotions within the learning setting. The relationship between the individual and the broader world is discussed in terms of the critical role it plays in learning. Dirkx describes our emotions and feelings as a kind of language <b>for</b> <b>helping</b> <b>us</b> learn about ourselves, our relationships with others and how we makes sense of all aspects of our experiences, both objective and subjective. Our sense of who we are and what our relationship is to the world must naturally be drawn into the learning process, leading to deeper engagements with ourselves and the world.|$|E

The point {{about this is that}} you cannot just choose any concept. What is useful is not just on our whim to choose. concept is a better concept for looking at the world because it works much better than others. You don't have to worry, as some British philosophers have thought that if you go down the pragmatic route that you might believe the world is flat because fits best with our sensory input. Ultimately it isn't useful to believe that the world is flat. All sorts of things won't work if you construct your view in that way. These concepts are tools <b>for</b> <b>helping</b> <b>us</b> manipulate the world and some work better than others." [...] Julian Baggini, (aired 2005) Editor of The Philosophers' Magazine.|$|E

U.S. Army special operations forces have historically worked with U.S. partner nation military forces and was expected {{to continue to do}} so. These Army personnel attain a high degree of cultural awareness and language capability and develop specialized, regionally focused areas of expertise. Conventional forces were directed to support the geographic combatant commanders with logistics, maintenance, communication, finance, administration, military rule of law and other services critical for sustaining and maintaining security forces that can participate in multinational operations, who remain answerable to their civilian authorities, and who respect the rule of law.|$|E
