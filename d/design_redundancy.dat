At the time of a repairable failure, a repair kit is removed from inventory and used to renew the system. Nonrepairable failures are assumed to occur at some time in the future distributed as a random variable of phase type and permanently terminate the life of the system. Under general stochastic assumptions concerning the lifetime of the components and the time required to perform repair, reorder strategies are identified which maximize the expected net discounted contribution over the lifetime of the systems. reliability modeling, optimal inventory of spares, <b>design</b> <b>redundancy,</b> computational probability...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine several models for systems subject to both {{repairable}} and nonrepairable failures. A repairable failure can be remedied by {{the application of}} a repair kit (spare part, standby system, etc.), whereas a nonrepairable failure terminates the life of the system. The stochastic properties of key system parameters are derived under appropriate assumptions. These results are then used to determine the optimal number of repair kits to stock in order to maintain a system having a specified cost structure. The applicability of such models to problems of systems design is illustrated in several examples. Our results make use of distributions of phase type, and demonstrate that this family of distributions provides considerable flexibility and computational tractability in reliability modeling. reliability modeling, optimal inventory of spares, <b>design</b> <b>redundancy,</b> computational probability...|$|E

40|$|WIT Transactions on the Built EnvironmentThe Human-Machine Interface (HMI), which {{displays}} the real-time status of electrical systems, {{interacts with the}} driver or operator, and collects and reports system fault information, is an important device in railway vehicles. The HMI is {{a critical component of}} the control and diagnosis system in the railway vehicle, thus the reliability of the HMI software affects the reliability and safety of the whole railway vehicle. Therefore, it is necessary to design the HMI software with high reliability for railway vehicles so as to ensure the reliability, stability and safety of the railway vehicle operation. This paper analyzes the HMI software function requirements, which include information display, the human machine interaction, and communication. A kind of redundancy mechanism is proposed, which employs two structural redundancy methods: N-version programming and recovery blocks. The HMI software is divided into the information display module, the human-machine interaction module and the communication module, and each module is made up of some components. Based on the analysis of the reliability requirement, complexity, and the implementation cost for each component in the HMI software modules, the corresponding <b>redundancy</b> <b>design</b> mechanism is proposed, which consider the tradeoff between the reliability and the cost.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the ability of these two-stage systems to remove nitrate and residual organics from treated water as compared to single-stage units. In the reversible flow system, the second-stage (i. e. follow) reactor is operated in series with the first-stage (i. e. lead) reactor.

40|$|Abstract—Safety-critical feedback-control {{applications}} {{may suffer}} faults in the controlled plant {{as well as}} in the execution platform, i. e., the controller. Control theorists design the control laws to be robust with respect to the former kind of faults while assuming an idealized scenario for the latter. The execution platforms supporting modern real-time embedded systems, however, are distributed architectures made of heterogeneous components that may incur transient or permanent faults. Making the platform fault tolerant involves the introduction of <b>design</b> <b>redundancy</b> with obvious impact on the final cost. We present a design flow that enables the efficient exploration of redundancy/cost tradeoffs. After providing a system-level specification of the target platform and the fault model, designers can rely on the synthesis of the low-level fault-tolerance mechanisms. This is performed automatically as part of the embedded software deployment through the combination of the following three steps: replication, mapping, and scheduling. Our approach has a sound foundation in faulttolerant data flow, a novel model of computation that simplifies the integration of formal validation techniques. Finally, we report on the application of our design flow to two case studies from the automotive industry: a steer-by-wire system from General Motors and a drive-by-wire system from BMW.

IP telephony changes the proprietary traditional telephony deployed in enterprises into standards based application that runs on top of IP.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2017. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisors: William Durfee, Michael Schwartz. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 137 pages. Ankle foot orthoses (AFOs) are commonly recommended {{for individuals with}} cerebral palsy (CP) {{as a means to}} improve gait. Goals of this dissertation were to evaluate the current efficacy of AFO use for children with CP, investigate the biomechanical mechanism of how AFOs influence gait, and describe new methods for analyzing and improving AFO outcomes as they pertain to gait. Retrospective data analysis, statistical machine learning, and simulation techniques were used to achieve these goals. Data analysis revealed that the general efficacy of AFO use was poor. However, a data driven model developed through machine learning techniques suggests that efficacy can likely be improved by using the model to recommend AFO prescriptions for individuals that are predicted to improve their gait with AFO use and refrain from prescribing AFOs for individuals whose gait will not improve with AFO use. Investigations of gait efficiency and muscle function revealed new factors that could potentially be leveraged to improve the efficacy of AFO use. Finally, an AFO <b>design</b> <b>redundancy</b> between two commonly prescribed AFOs was identified, eliminating misconceptions about the efficacy of a redundant AFO design. The techniques and conclusions presented in this dissertation have the potential to significantly improve the efficacy of AFO use for children with CP...|$|E

The optimal selection of a fleet of several recoverable and expendable launch vehicles, upper stages, and interplanetary spacecraft necessary to logistically establish and support these space missions can be examined by means of a linear integer programming optimization model. Such a selection must be made because the economies of scale which comes from producing large quantities of a few standard vehicle types, rather than many, will be needed to provide learning curve effects to reduce the overall cost of space transportation if these future missions are to be affordable. Optimization model inputs come from data and from vehicle designs. Each launch vehicle currently in existence has a launch history, giving rise to statistical estimates of launch reliability. For future, not-yet-developed launch vehicles, theoretical reliabilities corresponding to the maturity of the launch vehicles' technology and the degree of <b>design</b> <b>redundancy</b> must be estimated. Also, each such launch vehicle has a certain historical or estimated development cost, tooling cost, and a variable cost.

In this thesis, a new technique called UInData is introduced as an alternative method for designing database based on attribute sanitization.

Attributes sanitization is introduced to remove the unused attributes and to provide final schema table. An experiment using three case studies has shown that some improvements of designing optimal database have been achieved in term of data sanitization and data accessibility. Attribute sanitization was applied in LAS, SPKS and MPBP database. Data sanitizations have removed 2. 2 %, 14. 1 % and 24. 5 % from defined attributes which are not used by user interface. Meanwhile the results shown in data accessibility for these three cases have shown that LAS was reduced by 50 %, SPKS have not reducing of data accessibility and MPBP was reduced by 20 % when UInData is used as compared to using ordinary object-oriented.

40|$|Defining a {{level of}} {{redundancy}} is a strategic question when planning a new data centre, as it will directly impact the entire design of the building {{as well as the}} construction and operational costs. It will also affect how to integrate future extension plans into the <b>design.</b> <b>Redundancy</b> is also a key strategic issue when upgrading or retrofitting an existing facility. Redundancy is a central strategic question to any business that relies on data centres for its operation. In the traditional data centre reliant industries such as Internet Service Providers (ISP’s), banks, insurances, or credit card services redundancy is of paramount importance, as a loss of availability has an immediate and sometimes drastic impact on revenue or legal due diligence for example. For this reason, the industry has formed a number of clear standards and guidelines that address the topic of redundancy and reliability. Both these topics are of course just as important for HPC centres too, but not always in the same way given that some of the trade-off mechanisms may differ substantially and thus make it difficult for an HPC centre to rely fully on the existing standards used by the traditional data centre industry.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to the protection of power transmission systems wherein all the component activities associated with system protection design are gathered together in one integrated environment referred to as the Unified Approach to transmission system protection. These activities consist of automatically generating the most probable abnormal events in the network and analyzing the resulting consequences that arise from these abnormalities. From this analysis, the appropriate characteristics are determined for the relay under study as part of the performance specification of that relay. The proposed Unified approach overcomes the disadvantages that are associated with the current approaches in which the performance specification is carried out on an ad-hoc basis. In such approaches, it is required to run various programs to estimate the consequences of various types of abnormal events. The results are then reviewed by a protection expert who takes into account various critical situations particular to the system under study and a relay performance specification is produced. In the development of the concept of the proposed Unified Approach, the ultimate objective is to propose a systematic methodology that will result in improved efficiency in terms of engineering cost and protection design methods. The engineering cost is reduced since this methodology requires a minimum human intervention to process the complex tasks involved. Similarly, the protection design methods are enhanced by the proposed methodology {{so that they can be}} processed relatively quickly, be an integral part of power system design, cover all possible events, remove protection <b>design</b> <b>redundancy,</b> specify protection systems according to the power system needs, consolidate protection methods, assure the desired consistency, optimize transmission capacity and assure the security of the power system and the protection system at all times...|$|E
40|$|The Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), Canadarm 2, was {{launched}} in 2001 and deployed on the International Space Station (ISS). The Canadarm 2 {{has been instrumental in}} ISS assembly and maintenance. Canadarm 2 shares its heritage with the Space Shuttle Arm (Canadarm). This article explores the evolution from the Shuttle Canadarm to the Space Station Canadarm 2 design, which incorporates a 7 degree of freedom design, larger joints, and changeable operating base. This article also addresses phased <b>design,</b> <b>redundancy,</b> life and maintainability requirements. The design of Canadarm 2 meets unique ISS requirements, including expanded handling capability and the ability to be maintained on orbit. The size of ISS necessitated a mobile manipulator, resulting in the unique capability of Canadarm 2 to relocate by performing a walk off to base points located along the Station, and interchanging the tip and base of the manipulator. This provides the manipulator with reach and access to {{a large part of the}} Station, enabling on-orbit assembly of the Station and providing support to Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA). Canadarm 2 is evolving based on on-orbit operational experience and new functionality requirements. SSRMS functionality is being developed in phases to support evolving ISS assembly and operation as modules are added and the Station becomes more complex. Changes to sustaining software, hardware architecture, and operations have significantly enhanced SSRMS capability to support ISS mission requirements. As a result of operational experience, SSRMS changes have been implemented for Degraded Joint Operations, Force Moment Sensor Thermal Protection, Enabling Ground Controlled Operations, and Software Commutation. Planned Canadarm 2 design modifications include: Force Moment Accommodation, Smart Safing, Separate Safing, and Hot Backup. In summary, Canadarm 2 continues to evolve in support of new ISS requirements and improved operations.

The compounding uncertainty of service conditions and in the design capabilities is causing the designer to over-design, conduct extensive pre-service testing and introduce <b>design</b> <b>redundancy.</b> As such, designers {{have been forced to}} turn to reliability techniques in order to quantify the life of their designs. This has extended as far as needing to integrate reliability concepts, tools and methodologies into the design process. In recent times, the industry has attempted to apply conventional reliability tools within the design process, in terms of failure identification and reliability quantification. However, the use of historical reliability data has shown to be a particular downfall. As such, there has been a drive to predict the reliability of mechanical components based on their underlying degradation and failure processes and mechanisms. Consequently, this research is initially concerned with the development of a methodology, including an assessment of existing methods, {{that could be used to}} more readily understand the underlying failure characteristics of a mechanical component in terms of material, geometrical, environmental and operational characteristics. A particular underlying mechanism has been chosen and mathematical models were developed that simulate its physical behaviour and its degradation characteristics. Additionally, due to the potential uncertainty in the models and limited understanding of the characteristics of the underlying mechanism, the model was simulated within a probabilistic framework, fundamentally by application of the stress strength interference modelling approach. Finally, the model and its parameters were assessed to determine how uncertain governing parameters could appear to lead to variations in the reliability of the actuator...|$|E

40|$|The planned Mars Science Laboratory mission {{requires}} inlet funnels for channeling unconsolidated powdered {{samples from}} the sampling and sieving mechanisms into instrument test cells, which are required to reduce cross-contamination of the samples and to minimize residue left in the funnels after each sample transport. To these ends, a solid-state shaking mechanism has been created that requires low power and is lightweight, but is sturdy enough to survive launch vibration. The funnel mechanism is driven by asymmetrically mounted, piezoelectric flexure actuators {{that are out of}} the load path so that they do not support the funnel mass. Each actuator is a titanium, flextensional piezoelectric device driven by a piezoelectric stack. The stack has Invar endcaps with a half-spherical recess. The Invar is used to counteract the change in stress as the actuators are cooled to Mars ambient temperatures. A ball screw is threaded through the actuator frame into the recess to apply pre-stress, and to trap the piezoelectric stack and endcaps in flexure. During the vibration cycle of the flextensional actuator frame, the compression in the piezoelectric stack may decrease {{to the point that it}} is unstressed; however, because the ball joint cannot pull, tension in the piezoelectric stack cannot be produced. The actuators are offset at 120. In this flight <b>design,</b> <b>redundancy</b> is required, so three actuators are used though only one is needed to assist in the movement. The funnel is supported at three contact points offset to the hexapod support contacts. The actuator surface that does not contact the ring is free to expand. Two other configurations can be used to mechanically tune the vibration. The free end can be designed to drive a fixed mass, or can be used to drive a free mass to excite impacts (see figure). Tests on this funnel mechanism show a high density of resonance modes between 1 and 20 kHz. A subset of these between 9 and 12 kHz was used to drive the CheMin actuators at 7 V peak to peak. These actuators could be driven by a single resonance, or swept through a frequency range to decrease the possibility that a portion of the funnel surface was not coincident with a nodal line (line of no displacement). The frequency of actuation can be electrically controlled and monitored and can also be mechanically tuned by the addition of tuning mass on the free end of the actuator. The devices are solid-state and can be designed with no macroscopically moving parts. This design has been tested in a vacuum at both Mars and Earth ambient temperatures ranging from 30 to 25...|$|E
