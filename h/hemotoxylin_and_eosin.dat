We investigated tadalafil's beneficial effects on nonischemic cardiomyopathy and the specific mechanisms of its effects. MethodsCardiomyopathy was induced in mice by a single intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (15 mg/kg). In some cases, tadalafil (4 mg/kg/day, p. o., 14 days) was started simultaneously. After two weeks, cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography and cardiac catheterization, then all of the mice were killed and cardiac specimens were subjected for <b>hemotoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> staining, Masson's trichrome staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot. ResultsTwo weeks later, left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction were apparent in mice given doxorubicin but were significantly attenuated by tadalafil treatment. Tadalafil also protected hearts against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte atrophy/degeneration and myocardial fibrosis. No doxorubicin-induced apoptotic effects were seen between groups. Cardiac cGMP level was lower in the doxorubicin-treated group, however it was significantly increased with tadalafil treatment. Compared to the control group, the myocardial expression of 3 sarcomeric proteins, myosin heavy chain, troponin I, and desmin were significantly decreased in the doxorubicin-treated group, which were restored by the tadalafil treatment.

40|$|Every year 180, 000 Americans are {{diagnosed}} with epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder that {{is characterized by}} spontaneous seizures. It is known that neuropeptides such as Substance P are involved in seizure initiation and maintenance, however limited studies have explored the role of Neurokinin-B (NKB). To better understand the role of this neuropeptide in seizures, we are developing NKB-over expressing transgenic mice in a C 57 Bl/ 6 J background. In this study, we investigate various seizure models {{that can be used}} in our transgenic lines, focusing on long-lasting seizures known as status epilepticus (SE). Additionally, we look at NKB expression in both rats and mice after SE. In rats, lithium-pilocarpine showed complete success with 100 % entering SE, however only 20 % mice entered status. Ongoing studies include the addition of the physostigmine and electrical stimulation of the hippocampus. In animals reaching SE, brain tissue was examined using <b>hemotoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> staining to image actively dying cells and immunohistochemistry to reveal NKB expression. Cell death, evidenced by eosin, showed fluorescence in the thalamic nuclei and hippocampus, suggesting that these regions are most susceptible to damage resulting from seizures.

40|$|Acesso restrito: Texto completo. p. 719 - 723. Background & Aims: Hepatocellular {{ballooning}} {{is a key}} {{finding in}} nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It is conventionally defined by <b>hemotoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> (H&E) staining showing enlarged cells with rarefied cytoplasm and recently by changes in the cytoskeleton. Fat droplets are emerging as important organelles in cell metabolism. To address a possible relation between fat droplets and ballooning, we studied fat staining, H&E, and keratin 18 staining in human NASH. Methods: Sequential staining and high resolution imaging were used to study freshly prepared cryo-sections from 10 patients with histologically confirmed steatohepatitis using oil red O for fat droplet identification, H&E to identify ballooning, and anti-K 18 to confirm cytoskeletal changes. High resolution images were captured at each stage using the Aperio Scanscope. To provide ultrastructural correlation, glutaraldehyde-fixed specimens were studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with serial sectioning for localization of ballooned cells by light microscopy and TEM in identical specimens. Results: Serial staining consistently demonstrated that hepatocellular ballooning is associated with fat droplet accumulation evident by oil red O positivity and depletion of cytoplasmic keratin 18 with K- 18 positive Mallory–Denk bodies (MDB). TEM confirmed the association between osmium stained fat droplets,MDB formation, and cellular enlargement and suggested droplet-associated dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum. Conclusions: These results indicate a relationship between cellular ballooning, fat droplet accumulation, and cytoskeletal injury in NASH. We speculate that injury to multiple organelles, including fat droplets and endoplasmic reticulum, contribute to this characteristic finding...|$|E

40|$|Apoptosis {{is thought}} to be {{important}} in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. The mechanism of apoptosis induction remains unclear but several studies suggest that it is preferentially triggered by mild/moderate microcirculatory disturbances. We examined in cats whether induction of apoptosis after 2. 5 h of unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion plus 10 h of reperfusion is influenced by the degree of cerebral microcirculatory disturbance. Quantitative monitoring over time of the disturbances of cerebral microcirculation in ischemic brain areas and evaluation of cytotoxic edema associated with perfusion deficits was achieved by using two noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging techniques: (a) high-speed echo planar imaging combined with a bolus of magnetic susceptibility contrast agent; and (b) diffusion-weighted imaging. Apoptosis-positive cells were counted in anatomic areas with different severity of ischemic injury characterized by magnetic resonance imaging, triphenyltetrazolium chloride, and <b>hemotoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> staining. The number of apoptosis-positive cells was significantly higher in anatomic areas with severe perfusion deficits during occlusion and detectable histologic changes 10 h after reperfusion. In contrast, in areas where perfusion was reduced but maintained during occlusion there were no detectable histological changes and significantly fewer apoptosis-positive cells. A similar number of cells that undergo apoptosis were shown in regions with transient or prolonged subtotal perfusion deficits. These results suggest that the apoptotic process is induced in the ischemic core and contributes significantly in the degeneration of neurons associated with transient ischemia...|$|E
40|$|Background: Micronucleus (MN) {{represents}} small, additional nuclei {{formed by}} the exclusion of chromosome fragments or whole chromosomes lagging at mitosis. MN rates, therefore, indirectly reflect chromosome breakage or impairment of the mitotic apparatus. During the last few decades, micronuclei ("MNi") in oral exfoliated epithelial cells are widely used as biomarkers of chromosomal damage, genome instability and cancer risk in humans. However, until now only {{little attention has been}} given to the effect of different staining procedures on the results of these MN assays. Aim: To compare the MNi frequencies in oral exfoliated epithelial cells using three different stains, i. e.,Feulgen stain, Papanicolaou stain (Pap) and <b>hemotoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> stain (H and E). Materials and Methods: Oral exfoliated cells from 45 cases of potentially malignant disorders (15 oral submucous fibrosis, 15 lichen planus and 15 leukoplakia) and 15 controls with healthy mucosa, were taken and MNi frequencies (No. of MNi/ 1000 cells) were compared using three different stains. Results: Mean MNi frequency in cases was found to be 3. 8 with Feulgen stain, 16. 8 with PAP and 25. 9 with H and E. In controls, mean MNi frequency was 1. 6 with Feulgen stain, 7. 7 with PAP and 9. 6 with H and E stain. Statistically significant value (P < 0. 01) were observed when the three stains were compared together using Kruskal Walli′s ANOVA test.

40|$|Background: Research in biliary atresia {{has been}} {{hindered}} {{by lack of}} a suitable animal model. Lampreys are primitive vertebrates with distinct larval and adult life cycle stages. During metamorphosis the biliary system of the larval lamprey disappears. Lamprey metamorphosis has been proposed {{as a model for}} biliary atresia. We have begun to explore cellular events during lamprey metamorphosis by assessing for cholangiocyte apoptosis. Materials and Methods: Sea lamprey larvae were housed under controlled environmental conditions. Premetamorphic larvae were induced to undergo metamorphosis by exposure to 0. 01 % KClO(4). Animals were photographed weekly, and the stage of metamorphosis was assigned based upon external features. Livers were harvested and processed for routine histology and immunohistochemistry. DNA fragmentation was detected using deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays and cholangiocytes were identified with antibodies to cytokeratin- 19. Percent TUNEL+ cholangiocytes at different stages of metamorphosis was determined. Results: The percentage of TUNEL+ cholangiocytes was 10 % in premetamorphic (stage 0) lamprey (n = 6), 51 % at stage 1 (n = 6), 40 % at stage 2 (n = 5), 18 % at stage 3 (n = 5), and 9 % stage 4 (n = 4). Routine <b>hemotoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> stained paraffin-embedded tissue sections revealed frequent apoptotic bodies at stages 3 and 4 of metamorphosis without histologic evidence of necrosis. Conclusions: DNA fragmentation is identified at the earliest stages of metamorphosis during induced metamorphosis in lampreys. Additional studies are necessary to validate this potentially valuable animal model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

There {{have been many}} reports of in vitro analysis of inflammatory mechanism and comorbidities in gout. However, the associations of immune response cells and comorbidities of gout have not been well documented. Our studies aimed to examine the immune cell types and quantity in gout tissues, and to define the association of individual cell type with comorbidities. Methods: Surgically resected or biopsied tissues from 48 patients diagnosed as gout were used for this study. Cell count was performed on <b>Hemotoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eosin</b> stained sections for macrophages, plasma cells, neutrophils and on immunostained slides for T and B lymphocytes. Results: Hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were seen in 70. 8 %, 87. 5 % and 37. 5 % of patients, respectively. There were 35. 6 % and 37. 8 % of patients who admitted history of smoking and alcohol intake, respectively. Mean serum uric acid level was 8. 5 mg/dl. The average body mass index was 30. 1 kg/m 2.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) are {{promising}} grafts to treat a variety of diseases, including reproductive dysfunction. Primary ovarian failure is characterized by amenorrhea and infertility in a normal karyotype female, with an elevated serum level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and a decrease level of estrogen caused by a mutation in FSH receptor (FSHR) gene. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this condition. The phenotype of FSHR (-/-) mouse, FORKO (follitropin receptor knockout), is a suitable model to study ovarian failure in humans. Female FORKO mice have elevated FSH, decreased estrogen levels, are sterile because {{of the absence of}} folliculogenesis, and display thin uteri and small nonfunctional ovaries. In this study, we determined the effects of BMSC transplantation on reproductive physiology in this animal model. Twenty four hours post BMSC transplantation, treated animals showed detectable estroidogeneic changes in daily vaginal smear. Significant increase in total body weight and reproductive organs was observed in treated animals. <b>Hemotoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> (H&E) evaluation of the ovaries demonstrated significant increase in both the maturation and the total number of the follicles in treated animals.

40|$|Gap {{junctions}} are intercellular channels connecting adjacent cells, allowing {{cells to}} transport small molecules. The loss of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) {{is one of}} the important hallmarks of cancer. Restoration of GJIC is related to the reduction of tumorigenesis and increase in drug sensitivity. Previous reports have shown that PQ 1, a quinoline derivative, increases GJIC in T 47 D breast cancer cells, and subsequently attenuates xenograft breast tumor growth. Combinational treatment of PQ 1 and tamoxifen can lower the effective dose of tamoxifen in cancer cells. In this study, the effects of PQ 1 were examined in normal C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, evaluating the distribution, toxicity, and adverse effects. The distribution of PQ 1 was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The expressions of survivin, caspase- 8, cleaved caspase- 3, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and gap junction protein, connexin 43 (Cx 43), were assessed using western blot analysis. Our results showed that PQ 1 was absorbed and distributed to vital organs within 1 h and the level of PQ 1 decreased after 24 h. Furthermore, PQ 1 increased the expression of survivin, but decreased the expression of caspase- 8 and caspase- 3 activity. Interestingly, the expression of AhR increased in the presence of PQ 1, suggesting that PQ 1 may be involved in the AhR-mediated response. Previously, PQ 1 caused an increase in Cx 43 expression in breast cancer cells; however, PQ 1 induced a decrease in Cx 43 in normal tissues. <b>Hemotoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> staining of the tissues showed no histological change between the treated and the untreated organs.

40|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} wounds {{is one of}} the key elements of analysis performed by forensic anthropologists and forensic pathologists. Gross examination and histological analysis can be used to determine the timing of the wound and its cause. While forensic pathologists are trained to analyze hard and soft tissue wounds, forensic anthropologists, bioarchaeologists, and paleopathologists, focus on hard tissue. Forensic anthropologists have the added benefit of potentially working with residual soft tissue and would benefit from the incorporation of microscopy techniques that take advantage of the soft tissue to better understand perimortem events. Little research has been published that examines if any healing processes, the defining characteristic of an antemortem wound that do not progress beyond the time of death, are preserved within the tissues beyond death and how long they may be visible. The objectives of this study were to examine if the use of multiple stains will allow earlier visualization of healing processes in skeletal fractures than gross examination and to observe the length of time microscopic healing structures remain visible after death. A total of 224 slides from 19 specimens representing both fractured and un-fractured bones for control samples were taken from nine autopsied individuals at the Hillsborough County Medical Examiner 2 ̆ 7 s Office and analyzed using four stains: <b>Hemotoxylin</b> <b>and</b> <b>eosin</b> (H 2 ̆ 6 E), trichrome, Prussian blue, and elastin stain.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} transfusional hemochromatosis after repeated blood transfusions in anemic patients and {{the similarity of}} certain morphological changes between the transfusional and idiopathic hemochromatosis {{have suggested that the}} excessive storage of iron after transfusions might be the chief etiological factor of idiopathic hemochromatosis. However, the experimental evidence supporting such a possibility is still lacking. The purpose of this investigation has been to study the late morphological changes of organs of non-anemic and anemic rabbits after prolonged intravenous administration of saccharated iron oxide and to see whether prolonged administration of large amount of the iron will result in hemochromatosis. 	A total of 103 young male rabbits and 9 young female rabbits weighing 3. 5 to 5. 0 kg., kept in individual cages and all fed with ordinary rabbit pellets, carrots, green vegetables and water ad libitum, were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 58 non-anemic rabbits, 16 used as controls receiving no treatment and 42 treated with repeated intravenous injections of saccharated iron oxide (Feojectin-Smith, Kline and French Laboratories) with dosages gradually increasing from 20 to 20 mg. at intervals from 2 days to 2 months for a total period of 4 days to 14 months. The total dosages ranged from 45 to 4100 mg. of elemental iron per rabbit. The longer intervals of injections occurred in rabbits showing phlebothrombosis of the superficial veins that took time to recover so as to become available again for further injections. The second group consisted of 54 anemic rabbits rendered anemic by repeated bleeding from ear veins with hemoglobin maintained below 6. 0 gm. per 100 c. c. Seventeen of them were used for controls and 37 were injected with iron {{in a manner similar to}} that of the non-anemic rabbits for a period from 4 days to 12 months, with a total corrected dosage of iron varying from 25 to 4040 mg. The dosage was corrected for the iron lost through bleeding by subtraction of 50 mg. of iron for each 100 cc. of blood lost.

We found that quantitatively the amount of erythrocytes significantly decreased between the 48 hour and 3 week survival length groups (1 -way ANOVA, P-value=. 020). The amount of neutrophils significantly decreased between the 48 hour and 3 week (1 -way ANOVA, P-value= 0. 22) and 48 hour and 3 month survival length groups (1 -way ANOVA, P-value= 0. 28). Membrane formation around the implant and presence of foreign body giant cells (FGBCs) and fibrocytes were evident in the chronically implanted animals. Damage to inner and outer hair cells of the Organ of Corti was observed in both implanted and control cochlea. Angiogenesis, a normal phase of the healing process, was significant only in the 3 week survival group (Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s exact test, P-value=. 0002). Animals were assigned individual scores that were related to a certain intensity level of the FBR. There was a significant increase in the average score of the FBR between the 48 hour and 3 week survival length group (Kruskal-Wallis test, P-value=. 030). The majority of animals were assigned the lowest intensity level, very mild, while 3 animals received a mild intensity rating. We determined that PVDF film was biocompatible based on the observation that acute responses of the FBR decreased after the initial time of implantation, chronic response of the FBR did not progress in intensity after the 3 week time point, the average rank of the FBR was the lowest score on our intensity scale, and the components of the FBR did not spread from the site of implantation into surrounding areas of the cochlea. PVDF film did not interrupt the healing process of the host such as the clotting mechanism or become extruded from the cochlea...|$|E
