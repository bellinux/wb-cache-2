5|$|Andronikos Komnenos murdered Emperor Alexios II in late 1183. The {{contemporaneous}} Eustathius of Thessalonica {{writes that}} Andronikos's opponents sent letters to many monarchs, including Béla III, {{urging them to}} attack Andronikos. According to Ansbert and other Western European chroniclers, Béla invaded the Byzantine Empire in early 1185. After Andronikos <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> September, Béla signed a peace treaty with the new emperor, Isaac II Angelos. Isaac married Béla's daughter, Margaret, and Béla granted the region of Niš and Barancs to Isaac as his daughter's dowry. The relics of Saint Ivan of Rila were also returned to Sardica on this occasion. Béla married Margaret of France, a sister of Philip II of France, {{in the summer of}} 1186.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but {{is one of the}} best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E
5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

500|$|In April 1994, {{the label}} {{arranged}} her {{to fly to}} London and meet with producer Tom Bailey. They recorded the songs [...] "I Want You", [...] "Fly" [...] and [...] "Just Like Honey", which was later re-recorded by Keith Fernley of Bailey's group Babble with {{a different set of}} lyrics and became the song [...] "Father's Field". Lords used lyrics she had previously written in New Zealand based on her personal journals she kept since she was a child. After finishing her recording with Bailey, Lords wanted something with a harder edge to add another dimension to her album. She was introduced to producer Ben Watkins of the electronic group Juno Reactor and decided to incorporate more rave sound. Mainly inspired by the music she would hear at warehouse parties during her stay in London, Lords teamed up with American singer Wonder with whom she created the lyrics to the song [...] "Control". Lords later commented on the inspiration behind the album's sound: [...] "It was in England that <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love with techno music. I was working in the UK doing some modelling a couple of years ago, and I was sharing a flat with some other girls in South London. We were really broke, and the cheapest place to go and have a good night out were raves - you could get in for about three bucks. So I went to a lot of raves and clubs, and <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love with the music - it was something that wasn't happening in the States at the time." [...] Lords recorded three more songs with Watkins; [...] "Good-N-Evil", [...] "Outlaw Lover" [...] and [...] "Fallen Angel".|$|E

500|$|Santiago {{describes}} his guitar playing as [...] "angular and bent," [...] "all derived from guitar moments that perk my ears up". Notable in his style {{is how he}} uses distortion and feedback to leave spaces open. A good example is the intro of There Goes My Gun. He attributes much of his style to songs he enjoyed when first learning the guitar, such as The Beatles' [...] "Savoy Truffle", where [...] "George Harrison played that bent note that <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love with and later milked it for all it was worth." [...] He used such techniques with the Pixies: Doolittle's [...] "Dead" [...] begins with Santiago's guitar [...] "squawking" [...] on an E-flat like [...] "a wounded animal". As Santiago was learning the guitar, he saw himself as a self-conscious amateur, and still speaks {{of a lack of}} confidence in his playing.|$|E

Reynolds called the film [...] "an origin story to a certain degree, but it's not a labored origin story, where the movie begins in the third act. The movie starts when it starts. We find out Hal is the guy fairly early on, and the adventure begins". Alternatively Chris Pine and Sam Worthington had been in discussions for the role. Bradley Cooper, Jared Leto and Justin Timberlake were other top contenders, while Brian Austin Green, a Green Lantern fan, campaigned for the part, but ultimately did not audition.|$|E
500|$|Brandon Teena was a trans {{man who was}} gang {{raped and}} murdered by two male acquaintances in December 1993, when he was 21. Kimberly Peirce, {{at the time a}} Columbia University film student, became {{interested}} in the case after reading a 1994 Village Voice article by Donna Minkowitz. Peirce became engrossed in Brandon's life and death; she said, [...] "the minute I read about Brandon, <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love. With the intensity of his desire to turn himself into a boy, {{the fact that he did}} it with no role models. The leap of imagination that this person took was completely overwhelming to me." [...] The sensationalist news coverage of the case prolonged her interest. Peirce said she looked beyond the brutality of the case and instead viewed the positive aspects of Brandon's life as part of what eventually causes his death. [...] She admired Brandon's audacity, ability to solve complicated problems, and what she perceived as the sense of fantasy invoked by his personality.|$|E

"Calico Skies", which Paul McCartney {{had written}} when Hurricane Bob had hit while McCartney was staying on Long Island in 1991, and [...] "Great Day", which {{features}} backing vocal {{from his wife}} Linda McCartney, hailed from a 1992 session, recorded even before Off the Ground had come out. Starting from the mid-1990s for four years, McCartney was involved in The Beatles Anthology, a documentary {{on the history of}} The Beatles. The documentary was originally titled The Long and Winding Road, named after the Beatle song of the same name. During 1995, as the Anthology albums were starting to be released over a two-year period, EMI did not want McCartney to release a solo album in the meantime. McCartney said that he [...] "was almost insulted at first" [...] before then realising that [...] "it would be silly to go out against yourself in the form of The Beatles. So <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> with the idea and thought, 'Great, I don't even have to think about an album.'" [...] McCartney was occupied with working on Standing Stone in the interim.|$|E

In an interview with MTV UK, Derulo commented on the [...] "Show Me Love" [...] sample: [...] "I'm in love with that bassline, it's just really hypnotic and I just wanted to play around {{with it in the}} studio. I heard it a bunch of times in the club and <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love with it, like most people do." [...] Meena Rupani from DesiHits noted that the song borrows lyrics from Lil Wayne, while Shahryar Rizvi from Dallas Observer noted that its pre-chorus line [...] "from the window / to the wall" [...] comes from Lil Jon's 2003 single [...] "Get Low".|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to New York, the New York Dolls played to capacity crowds at venues such as Max's Kansas City and the Mercer Arts Center in what Sylvain called a determined effort to [...] "fake it {{until they could}} make it": [...] "We had to make ourselves feel famous before we could actually become famous. We acted like we were already rock stars. Arthur even called his bass 'Excalibur' after King Arthur. It was crazy." [...] Their performance at the Mercer Arts Center was attended by journalist and Mercury Records publicity director Bud Scoppa, and Paul Nelson, an A executive for the label. Scoppa initially viewed them as an amusing but inferior version of the Rolling Stones: [...] "I split after the first set. Paul stuck around for the second set, though, and after show he called me and said, 'You should have stayed. I think they're really special.' Then, after that, <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love with them anyway." [...] In March 1973, the group signed a two-album deal with a US $25,000 advance from Mercury. According to Sylvain, some of the members' parents had to sign for them {{because they were not}} old enough to sign themselves.|$|E
