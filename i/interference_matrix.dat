In densely deployed radio networks, User Equipments (UE) will experience high levels of interference which limits the achievable spectral efficiency. In this case, a way to improve the achievable performance is by mitigating interference at the UE side. Advanced linear interference aware receivers are linear receivers able to mitigate external co-channel interference. Optimum linear interference rejection is obtained with the Interference Rejection Combining (IRC) receiver which relies on the ideal knowledge of the <b>interference</b> covariance <b>matrix.</b> The IRC <b>interference</b> covariance <b>matrix</b> is the sum of all <b>interference</b> channel covariance <b>matrices.</b> In practical radio networks, like LTE-Advanced, the knowledge of <b>interference</b> channel covariance <b>matrices</b> might not always be available.

In addition, optical amplifiers are included to enhance the overall system performance while the Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) is considered as the main noise source. The objective function defined as the sum of the transmitted optical power from all nodes is minimized subject to a signal-to-interference (SIR) constraint. Moreover, the network feasibility, defined as the ability to evaluate a power vector that satisfy the target SIR, is discussed in terms of the spectral radius of the network <b>interference</b> <b>matrix.</b> Next, the spectral radius of the network <b>interference</b> <b>matrix</b> is investigated and modeled as a truncated Gaussian distribution.

As more nodes are added to the rate reduction campaign, the network feasibility is significantly enhanced.
