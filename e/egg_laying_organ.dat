40|$|Queensland {{fruit fly}} is Australia's most serious insect pest of horticulture. The fly lays its eggs into fruit, where they hatch into maggots which destroy the fruit. Understanding egg laying behaviour, known as oviposition, is a {{critical}} but under-researched aspect of fruit fly biology. This thesis focused on three aspects of oviposition: the role of fruit peel as a physical barrier to oviposition; the quality of fruit for maggot development; and the structure and wear of the <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> <b>organ</b> – the ovipositor. Results showed that flies selected fruit based on their suitability for offspring survival, {{not because of the}} softness or hardness of fruit peel. Previously reported use of holes or wounds in fruit peel by ovipositing females was determined to be a mechanism which saved the female time, not a mechanism to reduce ovipositor wear. The results offer insights into the evolution of host use by fruit flies and their sustainable management...|$|E
40|$|Queenright Apis mellifera capensis colonies exhibit <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> {{by workers}} in periods of both {{low and high}} egg removal. To {{reproduce}} workers should lay in times of low egg removal to increase survival of their eggs. Were this so, a negative correlation between <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> and removal would be expected. Egg removal rates for queen (N= 240) and worker-laid (N= 240) <b>eggs</b> and <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> by workers were tested in queenright colonies. Worker-laid eggs were removed significantly faster than queen-laid eggs; but significant differences in <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> by workers occurred among colonies. <b>Egg</b> <b>laying</b> and removal are positively correlated and co-dependent. Egg removal appears triggered {{by the number of}} worker-laid eggs. Intercolonial variation for <b>laying</b> worker <b>egg</b> number and egg removal rates may explain the phenotypic variation in worker reproduction in queenright Cape honeybee colonies...|$|R
40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) regulates key {{processes}} in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Previously, four 5 -HT receptors {{that contributed to}} the 5 -HT modulation of <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> were identified in Caenorhabditis elegans. Therefore, to assess potential receptor interactions, we generated animals containing combinations of null alleles for each receptor, especially animals expressing only individual 5 -HT receptors. 5 -HT-stimulated <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> and <b>egg</b> retention correlated well with different combinations of predicted excitatory and inhibitory serotonergic inputs. For example, 5 -HT did not stimulate <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> in ser- 1, ser- 7, or ser- 7 ser- 1 null animals, and ser- 7 ser- 1 animals retained more eggs than wild-type animals. In contrast, 5 -HT-stimulated <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> in ser- 4;mod- 1 animals was greater than in wild-type animals, and ser- 4;mod- 1 animals retained fewer eggs than wild-type animals. Surprisingly, ser- 4;mod- 1;ser- 7 ser- 1 animals retained the same number of eggs as wild-type animals and exhibited significant 5 -HT-stimulated <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> that was dependent on a previously uncharacterized receptor, SER- 5. 5 -HT-stimulated <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> was absent in ser- 5;ser- 4;mod- 1;ser- 7 ser- 1 animals, and these animals retained more eggs than either wild-type or ser- 4;mod- 1;ser- 7 ser- 1 animals. The 5 -HT sensitivity of <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> could be restored by ser- 5 muscle expression. Together, these results highlight the dual excitatory/inhibitory serotonergic inputs that combine to modulate <b>egg</b> <b>laying...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the case}} of ground beetles, the number of studies {{investigating}} the effects plant-related structure and microclimate on the selection of <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> sites is very limited. The <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> site preference of Pterostichus melanarius, an important carabid beetle in agricultural fields, was studied under laboratory conditions. The effects of wet/dry substrate, light/shadow and structured/unstructured environment {{on the number of}} eggs laid were investigated, as well as the influence of the presence of barley and Brussels sprout plants. We found that there was a strong influence of plant structure and microclimate on the selection of <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> sites. Results showed a higher numbers of eggs laid in barley compared to Brussels sprouts. These results were supported by a significant preference for moist, shadowed, structurally complex environments as <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> sites. Results indicate that vegetation characteristics in themselves may influence <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> site preferences, beside the availability of prey for the adults and larvae, in the different plant systems...|$|R
50|$|Although very thin, the {{ovipositor}} is a {{tube and}} the egg moves down a minute channel {{in its center}} during <b>egg</b> <b>laying.</b> The outer two filaments are the sheaths which protect the ovipositor. They arc out to the sides during <b>egg</b> <b>laying.</b>|$|R
40|$|Reproduction is {{influenced}} by many external factors. For <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> of pond snails, one important trigger is the transfer from dirty, oxygen-poor water to clean, oxygen-rich water. This response {{is due to the}} combined effects of elevated oxygen level, chemical water composition and clean substrate. Whether this clean-water stimulus (CWS) resembles the natural egg-laying process has remained untested. Given that the response relies heavily on a pretreatment that suppresses <b>egg</b> <b>laying,</b> the animal's internal state is clearly important. <b>Egg</b> <b>laying</b> is known to be influenced by day length, hence external factors signifying time of day or season may be involved. We here study the effect of light on the CWS in the freshwater pulmonate Lymnaea stagnalis. Clean water was more effective in inducing oviposition in the light than during darkness, irrespective of the presence of eyes. Thus, light has a profound influence on <b>egg</b> <b>laying,</b> which is most likely mediated by nonocular photoreceptors. We show that more eggs are laid during the day than during the night in wild-caught animals kept outside, which indicates that the effect of light on CWS-induced <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> is relevant for the induction of <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> under natural conditions. © The Author 2012.

Various studies have been {{conducted}} on life history and behavior of RPW, however some key points in <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> period is still missing. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the egg-laying timing as a number of egg /day /female, time interval between <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> event and the female bio-etiological needs while ovipositing. The study was carried out through recording the behavior of adults with PC-driven video cameras equipped with natural bright and artificial IR light source.

40|$|In many bird populations, {{variation}} in the timing of reproduction exists {{but it is not}} obvious how this variation is maintained as timing has substantial fitness consequences. Daily energy expenditure (DEE) during the <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> period increases with decreasing temperatures and thus perhaps only females that can produce eggs at low energetic cost will lay early in the season, at low temperatures. We tested whether late laying females have a higher daily energy expenditure during <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> than early laying females in 43 great tits (Parus major), by comparing on the same day the DEE of early females late in their laying sequence with DEE of late females early in their <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> sequence. We also validated the assumption that there are no within female differences in DEE within the <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> sequence. We found a negative effect of temperature and a positive effect of female body mass on DEE but no evidence for differences in DEE between early and late laying females. However, costs incurred during <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> may have carry-over effects later in the breeding cycle and if such carry-over effects differ for early and late laying females this could contribute to the maintenance of phenotypic {{variation in}} laying dates. ...|$|R

Egg density and the progeny sex ratio of Bracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was studied in relation to the larval density of its host Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Our findings revealed that parasitoid’s egg density increased with the increase in host density. A comparison was made between <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> and <b>egg</b> hatching on different host densities and maximum number of <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> was observed (134. 7 eggs) at the highest host densities (16 larvae) while a minimum number of <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> (15. 6 <b>eggs)</b> was registered at lowest host density (one larvae).

40|$|Decision-making {{is defined}} as {{selection}} amongst options based on their utility, in a flexible and context-dependent manner. Oviposition site selection by the female fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been suggested to be a simple and genetically tractable model for understanding the biological mechanisms that implement decisions [1]. Paradoxically, female Drosophila {{have been found to}} avoid oviposition on sugar which contrasts with known Drosophila feeding preferences [1]. Here we demonstrate that female Drosophila prefer <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> on sugar, but this preference is sensitive {{to the size of the}} <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> substrate.
