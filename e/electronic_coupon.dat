40|$|In {{a variant}} of the {{electronic}} cash protocol, an <b>electronic</b> <b>coupon</b> protocol, a withdrawn coin is divided into many sub-coins whose face values are fixed in advance, and the sub-coins are only used in payments. The original coin is called ticket and the sub-coins are called sub-tickets. The electronic cash protocol should satisfy not only the anonymity that the payer cannot be traced from the payments, but also the unlinkability. The unlinkability means that anyone cannot determine whether payments were made by the same payer. If the unlinkability does not hold, tracing the payer from one payment leads to tracing the payer from all his/her payments, and the link between the payments also facilitates the de-anonymization. In the previously proposed <b>electronic</b> <b>coupon</b> protocol, payments of sub-tickets derived from the same ticket are linkable. Since the complete anonymity of payments facilitates fraud and criminal acts, the electronic cash protocols should equip the revocati [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Previous work on <b>electronic</b> <b>coupon</b> (e-coupon) systems {{mainly focused}} on {{security}} properties such as unforgeability, doubleredemption detection, and anonymity/unlinkability. However, achieving both traceability against dishonest users and anonymity for honest users without involving any third party {{is an open}} problem {{that has not been}} solved by the previous work. Another desirable feature of an e-coupon system that has not been studied in the literature is user privacy, which means the shop cannot identify the good (among all the choices specified in the coupon) that has been chosen by the customer during the redemption process. In this paper, we present a novel e-coupon system that can achieve all these desirable properties. We define the formal security models for these new security requirements, and show that our new e-coupon system is proven secure in the proposed models...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} P 3 -coupon, a Prompt and Privacy-preserving <b>electronic</b> <b>coupon</b> {{distribution}} {{system based on}} a Probabilistic one-ownership forwarding algorithm. In this algorithm, only one hop of forwarder (coupon owner) information instead of the complete forwarder list is recorded to keep the coupon short and privacy-preserving. Such information is updated probabilistically following two ownership flipping models, namely, One-Flip and Always-Flip models. We also use a Bluetooth Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) toolkit to enable fast, configuration-free coupon exchange. We have implemented the system in Java ME. Our experiments on real world mobile phones, such as Nokia and Samsung phones, and large scale simulations show that our system is efficient in peer to peer coupon distribution and capable of massive deployment. We believe our key methodology {{can serve as a}} general framework for facilitating information propagation on mobile phones, which requires promptness and privacy protection...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{new kind}} of carbon steel (CS) and {{stainless}} steel (SS) galvanic sensor system was developed for the study of rebar corrosion in different pore solution conditions. Through the special design of the CS and SS <b>electronic</b> <b>coupons,</b> the <b>electronic</b> resistance (ER) method and zero resistance ammeter (ZRA) technique were used simultaneously for the measurement of both the galvanic current and the corrosion depth. The corrosion processes in different solution conditions were also studied by linear polarization resistance (LPR) and the measurements of polarization curves. The test result shows that the galvanic current noise can provide detailed information of the corrosion processes. When localized corrosion occurs, the corrosion rate measured by the ER method is lower than the real corrosion rate. However, the value measured by the LPR method is higher than the real corrosion rate. The galvanic current and the corrosion current measured by the LPR method shows linear correlation in chloride-containing saturated Ca(OH) 2 solution. The relationship between the corrosion current differences measured by the CS <b>electronic</b> <b>coupons</b> and the galvanic current between the CS and SS <b>electronic</b> <b>coupons</b> {{can also be used to}} evaluate the localized corrosion in reinforced concrete...|$|R

40|$|Since {{nowadays}} {{mobile phone}} messages are flourishing, {{the application of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>coupon</b> (e-coupon) will become a trend for mobile users.

40|$|Big Data, {{more than}} ever, {{is playing a}} vital role in IT {{decision}} making, with such decisions increasingly moving towards being made in real-time. Organisations are optimizing service performance, better handling capacity across overall organisations, and effectively making decisions utilising operational analytics. Realizing the full value of business data is a key challenge for today’s operational analytics. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a technique for tracking, analyzing, and processing data as an event happens and is useful for Big Data because it is intended to manage data in motion. Data in motion is processed and communicated based on business rules and processes. For decisions to be better-informed, data used for decision making has to be timely, complete, accurate, trusted, valid, reliable, and relevant. CEP utilizes data generated from moment-to-moment from different emerging sources such as sensor, sentiment, geo-locational, etc… There is a need {{to bridge the gap between}} traditional business intelligence with new Big Data technologies such as CEP. Bridging of this gap will enable organisations to become agile and data-driven so that business outcomes can be maximized by delivering better-informed decisions about a customer and delivering a better service to them. In this paper we discuss the architecture developed for CEP using open source technologies and show how CEP is applied to the use case of an <b>Electronic</b> <b>Coupon</b> Distribution Service (ECDS), using location information, past shopping/travel history, gender, likes/dislikes, etc… We further explore how different types of data such as static information (gender, age, etc.), previous history (where the person travelled to, what they bought, etc.), as well as real-time information about a customer (current location, current shopping habits, etc.) would all be utilised in CEP...|$|E

Since nowadays mobile devices may have Gigabytes of storage, a reasonably large database of product and coupon information may be created on each device. Furthermore, mobile devices may be interconnected via short range wireless protocols, such as IEEE 802. 11, Bluetooth, Zigbee, or Ultra Wide Band (UWB).

40|$|The {{problem we}} address {{is how to}} {{communicate}} securely {{with a set of}} users (the target set) over an insecure broadcast channel. In order to solve this problem, several broadcast encryption schemes have been proposed. In these systems, the parameters of major concern are the length of transmission and number of keys held by each user's set top terminal (STT). Due to the need to withstand hardware tampering, the amount of secure memory available in the STTs is quite small, severely limiting the number of keys each user holds. In such cases, known theoretical bounds seem to indicate that non-trivial broadcast encryption schemes are only feasible when the number of users is small. In order to break away from these theoretical bounds, our approach is to allow a controlled number of users outside the target set to occasionally receive the multicast. This relaxation is appropriate for low-cost transmissions such as multicasting <b>electronic</b> <b>coupons.</b> For this purpose, we introduce f-redundant est [...] ...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the Internet and information technology, electronic commerce sys-tem is flourishing. In electronic commerce, customers use electronic money (e-money) instead of cash. E-money in wide use includes electronic cash, <b>electronic</b> checks, <b>electronic</b> <b>coupons,</b> and so on. E-money is fixed at face-value and is backed by banks. The fact that e-money is not issued in the actual amount to be used, it is somewhat inconvenient for customers to use. In addition, security requirements consume huge amounts of computing resources. Limited computing capability makes {{it is difficult to}} engage in electronic commerce with mobile devices. This study presents a new pay-ment system, wherein customers are not required to purchase e-money of a fixed value in advance. The amount of every transaction is deducted directly from the customer’s bank account, eliminating the inconvenience of fixed value currency, and reducing online computing requirements. Through the application of trapdoor hash functions to streamline computational processes, the system can be used with mobile devices. We have named the system, mobile banking payment system...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{authentication}} scheme in which users can be authenticated anonymously {{so long as}} times that they are authenticated is within an allowable number. The proposed scheme has two features that allow 1) no one, not even an authority, identify users who have been authenticated within the allowable number, and that allow 2) anyone to trace, without help from the authority, dishonest users who have been authenticated beyond the allowable number by using the records of these authentications. Although identity escrow/group signature schemes allow users to be anonymously authenticated, the authorities in these schemes have the unnecessary ability to trace any user. Moreover, since {{it is only the}} authority who is able to trace users, one needs to make cumbersome inquiries to the authority to see how many times a user has been authenticated.

30|$|Previous {{studies have}} used various ways of {{providing}} incentives to respondents and compensate {{them for their}} participation (Navratil et al. 1994). With an increasing reliance on ICT-based communication, it has become less feasible to send gifts or vouchers to respondents directly. Different from the conventional face-to-face interview, incentives {{may need to be}} transmitted electronically, such as <b>electronic</b> <b>coupons,</b> prepaid mobile phone cards, and credits for online games and services. This panel study provided prepaid mobile phone cards of around RMB 30 – 50 yuan (≈ 4.8 - 8.0 USD) to compensate respondents, and this amount could be deposited directly to their phone numbers. As with the strategy of sending gift vouchers together with a change-of-address card (Laurie and Scott 1999), this study also used this chance to update contact information by sending confirmation messages to their phone numbers. However, such economic incentives may not be big enough to persuade some to participate, and for others, the exchange relationship may cause discomfort since they do not like the instrumental feeling of “selling information.” In both situations, the research team worked on the emotional aspects of how respondents felt about the survey in various ways.|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} {{offering}} incentives for ecological modes of transport is presented. The main {{focus is on}} the verification of claims of having taken a trip on such a mode of transport. Three components are presented for the task of travel mode identification: A system to select features, a means to measure a GPS (Global Positioning System) trace's similarity to a bus route, and finally a machine-learning approach to the actual identification. Feature selection is carried out by sorting the features according to statistical significance, and eliminating correlating features. The novel features considered are skewnesses, kurtoses, auto- and cross correlations, and spectral components of speed and acceleration. Of these, only spectral components are found to be particularly useful in classification. Bus route similarity is measured by using a novel indexing structure called MBR-tree, short for "Multiple Bounding Rectangle", to find the most similar bus traces. The MBR-tree is an expansion of the R-tree for sequences of bounding rectangles, based on an estimation method for longest common subsequence that uses such sequences. A second option of decomposing traces to sequences of direction-distance-duration-triples and indexing them in an M-tree using edit distance with real penalty is considered but shown to perform poorly. For machine learning, the methods considered are Bayes classification, random forest, and feedforward neural networks with and without autoencoders. Autoencoder neural networks are shown to perform perplexingly poorly, but the other methods perform close to the state-of-the-art.

However, RDS faces logistical and theoretical challenges that threaten efficiency and validity in settings worldwide. We present innovative adaptations to conventional RDS to overcome barriers encountered in recruiting a large, {{representative sample of}} {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) who travel internationally. Novel methodological adaptations for the "International Travel Research to Inform Prevention" or "I-TRIP" study were offering participants a choice between <b>electronic</b> and paper <b>coupons</b> referrals for recruitment and modifying the secondary incentives structure from small cash amounts to raffle entries for periodic large cash prize raffle drawings. Staged referral limit increases from 3 to 10 referrals and progressive addition of 70 seeds were also implemented. There were 501 participants enrolled in up to 13 waves of growth. Among participants with a choice of referral methods, 81 % selected electronic referrals. Of participants who were recruited electronically, 90 % chose to remain with electronic referrals when it was their turn to recruit. The mean number of enrolled referrals was 0. 91 for electronic referrals compared to 0. 56 for paper coupons. Median referral lag time, i. e., the time interval between when recruiters were given their referrals and when a referred individual enrolled in the study, was 20 days (IQR 10 - 40) for electronic referrals, 20 days (IQR 8 - 58) for paper coupons, 20 days (IQR 10 - 41) for raffle entries and 33 days (IQR 16 - 148) for small cash incentives. The recruitment of MSM who travel internationally required maximizing known flexible tools of RDS while at the same time necessitating innovations to increase recruitment efficiency. Electronic referrals emerged as a major advantage in recruiting this hard-to-reach population who are of high socio-economic status, geographically diffuse and highly mobile.
