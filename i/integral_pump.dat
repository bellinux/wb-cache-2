40|$|The {{results of}} <b>integral</b> <b>pumping</b> tests (IPTs) {{performed}} {{in the city of}} Fabriano, Italy, are presented. The IPT methodology was developed by the European Union project INCORE, as a tool for groundwater investigation and source localization in contaminated areas. This methodology consists of a multiple-well pumping test in which the wells are positioned along a control plane downstream of suspected contaminant source zones and perpendicular to the mean groundwater flow direction. During the pumping, concentration time series of target contaminants are measured. In Fabriano, two control planes were realized to identify a chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon plume, to estimate the mass fluxes and draw up a ranked list of the main contamination sources. A numerical flow model was implemented to support the IPT design and to interpret the results. This study revealed low-level trichloroethylene contamination (concentration below 8 μg/l), tetrachloroethylene contamination (mean concentration up to 500 μg/l) and a mass flow rate of about 300 g/day. Through the application of the IPT method, the mean contaminant concentrations, the spatial distribution of concentration values along the control planes, and the total contaminant mass flow rates were evaluated, and the investigation area was reduced for further and deeper investigation activities...|$|R

This paper presents a method to quantify exfiltration mass flow rates Mex of wastewater constituents from losing streams by the operation of <b>integral</b> <b>pumping</b> tests (IPT's) up- and downstream of a target section.

40|$|ABC {{transporters}} are <b>integral</b> membrane <b>pumps</b> {{that are}} responsible for the import or export of a diverse range of molecules across cell membranes. ABC transporters have been implicated in many phenomena of medical importance, including cystic fibrosis and multidrug resistance in humans. The molecular architecture of ABC transporters comprises two transmembrane domains and two ATP-binding cassettes, or nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), which are highly conserved and contain motifs that are crucial to ATP binding and hydrolysis. Despite the improved clarity of recent structural, biophysical, and biochemical data, the seemingly simple process of ATP binding and hydrolysis remains controversial, with a major unresolved issue being whether the NBD protomers separate during the catalytic cycle. Here chemical cross-linking data is presented for the bacterial ABC multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter LmrA. These indicate that in the absence of nucleotide or substrate, the NBDs come into contact to a significant extent, even at 4 °C, where ATPase activity is abrogated. The data are clearly not in accord with an inward-closed conformation akin to that observed in a crystal structure of V. cholerae MsbA. Rather, they suggest a head-to-tail configuration 'sandwich' dimer similar to that observed in crystal structures of nucleotide-bound ABC NBDs. We argue the data are more readily reconciled with the notion that the NBDs are in proximity while undergoing intra-domain motions, than with an NBD 'Switch' mechanism in which the NBD monomers separate in between ATP hydrolysis cycles...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Standard {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB) circuits {{with their}} {{large surface area}} and volume contribute to postoperative systemic inflammatory reaction and hemodilution.

The impact of this system on gas exchange capacity, blood elements and hemolysis is {{compared to that of}} a conventional circuit in a model of prolonged perfusion. Methods: Twelve calves (mean body weight: 72. 2 ^ 3. 7 kg) were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass for 6 h with a flow of 5 l/min, and randomly assigned to the CardioVention system (n 6) or a standard CPB circuit (n 6). A standard battery of blood samples was taken before bypass and throughout bypass. Analysis of variance was used for comparison. Results: The hematocrit remained stable throughout the experiment in the CardioVention group, whereas it dropped in the standard group in the early phase of perfusion. When normalized for prebypass values, both profiles differed significantly (P, 0 : 01). Both O 2 and CO 2 transfers were significantly improved in the CardioVention group (P 0 : 04 and P, 0 : 001, respectively). There was a slightly higher pressure drop in the CardioVention group but no single value exceeded 112 mmHg. No hemolysis could be detected in either group with all free plasma Hb values below 15 mg/l. Thrombocyte count, when corrected by hematocrit and normalized by prebypass values, exhibited an increased drop in the standard group (P 0 : 03).

40|$|Article Outline Acknowledgements References The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) by the European Commission is {{the major}} concept for {{achieving}} sustainable management of water in EU Member States. Next to treatment of coastal waters, it requires that all inland waters within defined river basins must reach at least good status by 2015. This also requires a constantly improved understanding of physical, chemical and biological processes of pollutants {{for the assessment of}} current and future quality of surface- and groundwater bodies. As a driving force for concepts such as the WFD, the EU project AquaTerra aims at a better understanding of pollutants in the river–sediment–soil–groundwater systems as a whole. This involves quantification of key pollutants and understanding of their turnover. The work also leads to the development of new numerical models, which are needed to predict adverse trends in soil functioning, water quantity and quality. Scales range from water–solid interactions to transport of dissolved and suspended matter at the river basin scale. This approach provides the foundations for improved river basin management, enhanced soil and groundwater monitoring programs and the early identification and forecasting of impacts on water quantity and quality. AquaTerra is among the largest environmental projects worldwide with a multidisciplinary team of 45 partner organisations. The work integrates across various disciplines that range from Geosciences, Environmental Engineering and Physics, Biology and Chemistry to Socio-Economic sciences. It also involves practitioners and end users such as policy makers, river basin managers and regional as well as urban land planners. This special issue presents a selection of key results of AquaTerra from sites in the river basins of the Ebro, Meuse, Elbe and Danube and from the small French catchment of the Brévilles Spring. The presented papers treat aspects of surface- and groundwater interaction (Rozemeijer and Broers; Petelet-Giraud et al., ms # 1 and # 2) and sediment transport (Klaver et al., ms # 3). Other studies address the mobility and turnover of organic pollutants such as pesticides (Baran et al., ms # 4) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (Morasch et al., ms # 5) and several manuscripts deal with metal behaviour in soils, sediments and floodplains (Joubert et al.; Vanbroekhoven et al.; Barborowski et al.; Poot et al.; Graf et al., ms # 6 to # 10). Further contributions to this special issue focus on field and laboratory techniques such as groundwater dating (Visser et al., ms # 11), <b>integral</b> <b>pumping</b> tests (Kalbus et al., ms # 12), and new aspects of biomonitoring (Hsu et al.; Bleeker and Van Geestel, ms # 13 and # 14). The modelling studies presented here quantify ecotoxicological aspects (Vink and Meeussen, ms # 15) and outline surface- and groundwater hydrology in the context of climate change (Bürger et al.; Kolditz et al., ms # 16 and # 17) and the special issue closes with considerations on challenges to link science with policy (Slob et al., ms # 18). Apart from these selected publications, comparative work between basins included collection and processing of close to 2000 soil, sediment, surface- and groundwater samples. Regional activities included a detailed survey of the Danube that covered a 1147 -km stretch of the river. In the Ebro, sediment and fish samples from selected risk zones were analysed for a variety of emerging pollutants and led to the detection of the flame retardant decabromodiphenylethane that was unknown before in the area. On the other hand, mobilisation and turnover of β-hexachlorohexane was quantified in the Elbe Basin. New laboratory methods included validations of analytical procedures for alachlor, metalochlor, acetochlor and its ethanesulfonic and oxanilic acids and hexabromocyclododecane in aqueous samples. Other laboratory studies in AquaTerra have characterised colloids and dissolved organic matter and associated contaminant transport. New sorption isotherms for compounds including phenanthrene, naphthalene and atrazine were also established for selected reference materials and soils. This was further combined with microbiological degradation tests of compounds including atrazine, nonylphenol, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), vinylchloride, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, methyl tert butylethers (MtBE), chlorobenzene, chloroanilines, brominated flame retardants and PAHs. Other new modelling activities in AquaTerra have generated synthetic rainfall time series that were further processed in hydrological models. In addition, new developments of software for data viewing included implementation of 3 D visualization methods for catchment applications. For modelling entire river basins, data from historical pollution from agriculture, industry and sewage were combined with GIS methods to assess for instance the Ebro River environmental quality. The above summary and this special issue only present selected aspects of AquaTerra, but provide a good insight into its achievements.

40|$|This paper investigates one-third {{harmonic}} generation (OTHG) by analytical methods with a nondepletion approximation {{and with an}} exact solution in continuous wave conditions. The nondepletion method shows that OTHG with a small initial power is confined {{in a very small}} range except that the overlapping <b>integrals</b> of the <b>pump</b> and signal follow a certain relation. The efficiency depends only on the initial conditions. Increasing pump power only shortens the interaction length to reach the maximum conversion. Furthermore, we exactly explore OTHG by the elliptic functions whose expressions depend on the types of roots derived from the integral and the initial power. We find that the output power level is limited by the initial conditions and the structure of the waveguide, while the pump power only determines the period. There is a constant value Gamma that is determined by U[0], theta[0], and the overlap integrals, where U[0] and Gamma[0] are the initial power of the signal and the initial phase difference between pump and signal, respectively. We found that a highly efficient conversion only occurs when Gamma is larger than a specific value Gamma[c], called a critical value. A Gamma[c] provides a relation between U[0] and theta[0]. So a set of critical conditions of U[0] and theta[0] is obtained. A highly efficient conversion may be supported if U[0] is larger than the power in this set. We investigated some typical structure parameters and found the minimum initial power supporting high conversion efficiency. In OTHG, the variation curve has a sharp peak pattern, which means that a variation of the initial phase difference leads to a great change of the conversion. We established a way to get the smallest initial power with a large phase tolerance. Finally, we find a relation among the overlapping integrals and phase mismatching that can support a high conversion efficiency with a small initial power. This study gives valuable suggestions on the experimental design...|$|R

Calcium (Ca 2 +) {{is stored in}} the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. A Ca 2 + induced Ca 2 + release mechanism triggers the ryanodine receptor (RyR) to release Ca 2 + from the SR into the cytoplasm. This Ca 2 + discharge increases the Ca 2 + concentration causing the muscle to contract. RyR is regulated by calmodulin (CaM), a Ca 2 + binding protein that inhibits RyR when the [Ca 2 +] > mM. To relax the muscle, the Sarco-endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Adenosine Triphosphatase (SERCA), an <b>integral</b> membrane enzyme, <b>pumps</b> Ca 2 + back into the SR driven by ATP hydrolysis. In cardiac tissue, SERCA is regulated by phospholamban (PLB), an integral membrane protein that inhibits SERCA at submicromolar [Ca 2 +]. This inhibition is relieved either by addition of micromolar Ca 2 + or by phosphorylation of PLB by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). The goal {{of this research was}} to investigate Ca 2 + regulation during muscle contraction and relaxation. The major findings included: 1) two PLB variants bind tightly to SERCA, thus competing with and displacing wild-type (WT) PLB, 2) SERCA contains a novel nucleotide binding site that is not an artifact of crystallization, and 3) oxidation of specific Met residues in CaM are vital for proteasomal degradation. Using functional co-reconstitution and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we tested the hypothesis that the loss-of-function (LOF) mutants can compete with WT-PLB to relieve SERCA inhibition. We investigated two LOF mutants, S 16 E (phosphorylation mimic) and L 31 A, for their inhibitory potency and their ability to compete with WT-PLB. Our functional studies demonstrate that SERCA co-reconstituted with mixtures of WT-PLB and LOF PLB mutants had a lower inhibitory potency compared to SERCA and WT-PLB mixtures only. FRET experiments added further support by showing that unlabeled LOF mutants lowered the FRET between donor-labeled SERCA and acceptor-labeled WT-PLB. Thus, we have provided a convenient FRET method for screening future PLB mutants for the use in gene therapy to treat heart failure. Similarly, we used another fluorescence technique, time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET), to investigate nucleotide binding in SERCA. Based on biochemistry and crystallography, it has been proposed that SERCA has two distinct modes of nucleotide binding. To extend this observation from the crystal to the functional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, we have performed TR-FRET to measure the distance between donor-labeled SERCA and the fluorescent nucleotide TNP-ADP, in the presence and absence of inhibitors. TR-FRET experiments confirmed a novel binding site in SERCA, bringing the gamma-phosphate of ADP closer to the phosphorylation site, Asp 351, compared to other crystal structures with bound nucleotide. To determine whether these modes of nucleotide binding occur in solution during SERCA enzymatic cycle, we performed transient TR-FRET ([TR] 2 FRET) experiments, in which a complete subnanosecond TR-FRET decay was recorded every 0. 1 ms after rapid mixing of donor-labeled SERCA and TNP-ADP in a stopped-flow instrument. We clearly observed a biphasic reaction with a fast component (260 s- 1) and a slower component (17 s- 1). TR-FRET is a powerful technique for connecting structural dynamics of SERCA with its static crystal structures. The major focus of this research has been muscle relaxation through the interaction of SERCA and PLB utilizing fluorescence spectroscopy. However, another project with implications for muscle contraction concentrated on the signals for proteasomal degradation by using CaM as a model system. CaM variants were designed using site-directed mutagenesis in order to perform site-specific oxidation of Met residues. Utilizing circular dichroism (CD), thermodynamic stability CD experiments, and proteasomal degradation assays, it was demonstrated that oxidation of Met residues 51, 71, and 72 located in the N-terminus of CaM are essential for degradation. Functional data from ryanodine binding assays showed that oxidation of Met residues in the C-terminus of CaM completely abolished CaM's ability to bind and inhibit RyR. Accumulation of these CaM within the cell could be detrimental to CaM regulation of RyR impairing Ca 2 + regulation during muscle contraction...|$|R
