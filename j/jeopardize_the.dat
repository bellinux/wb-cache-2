5|$|Adverse weather {{such as a}} storm or hail could devastate crop {{fields and}} orchards, and thus <b>jeopardize</b> <b>the</b> {{livelihood}} of farmers in the affected area. A role of zduhaći, according to folk tradition, was to lead storms and hail clouds away from their family estates, villages, or regions, to save their crops. A zduhać could take the storms and hail clouds over the territory of another zduhać to destroy its crops. The other zduhać would fly up to confront the bringer of bad weather, {{and there would be}} a fight between the zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wood, the {{engineer}} who {{signed off on}} {{the engineer}}ing report declaring the mall structurally sound just {{a few weeks before the}} roof collapse, was charged with two counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. According to the inquiry, Wood had previously indicated in conversation that he was aware that the roof was at risk of caving in, but altered his final report at Nazarian's request so that the structural issues did not <b>jeopardize</b> <b>the</b> building's refinancing. His trial began in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Aid and Rescue Committee's {{first meeting}} with Eichmann was on 25 April 1944. At {{around the same time}} Kastner is {{believed}} to have received a copy of the Vrba–Wetzler report, possibly in German. Vrba alleged that Kastner failed to distribute the report in order not to <b>jeopardize</b> <b>the</b> Eichmann deal, but acted on it privately by arranging for 1,684 Hungarian Jews to escape to Switzerland on the Kastner train, which left Budapest on 30 June 1944.|$|E

5|$|A third band of crusaders reached Nyitra (Nitra, Slovakia) {{and began}} plundering the region. These were soon routed by the locals. A fourth army came to Moson {{in the middle}} of June. Coloman did not allow them to leave the region, either because he had learnt of their {{troublesome}} behavior during their journey, or he had realized that their movement across Hungary could <b>jeopardize</b> <b>the</b> stability of the local economy. To seize food and wine, the crusaders made frequent pillaging raids against the nearby settlements. Coloman decided to attack them, but the commanders of the army convinced him to persuade the crusaders to surrender their weapons and money, promising them that they would be supplied with food during their journey. After the crusaders were disarmed, Coloman's troops attacked and massacred them near Pannonhalma in early July.|$|E
5|$|Davis is acquitted, but Freamon {{uses the}} threat of federal {{prosecution}} to blackmail him for information. Davis reveals Maurice Levy has a mole in the courthouse from whom he illegally purchases copies of sealed indictments. Herc tells Levy that the Stanfield case was probably based on an illegal wiretap, something which would <b>jeopardize</b> <b>the</b> entire case. After Levy reveals this to Pearlman, she uses Levy's espionage to blackmail him into agreeing to a plea bargain for his defendants. Levy ensures Stanfield's release {{on the condition that}} he permanently retires, while his subordinates will have to accept long sentences. Stanfield sells the connection to The Greeks back to the Co-Op and plans to become a businessman, although he appears unable or unwilling to stay off the corner.|$|E

5|$|Eichmann {{was taken}} to one of several Mossad safe houses {{that had been set}} up by the team. He was held there for nine days, during which time his {{identity}} was double-checked and confirmed. During these days, Harel tried to locate Josef Mengele, the notorious Nazi doctor from Auschwitz, as the Mossad had information that he was also living in Buenos Aires. He was hoping to bring Mengele back to Israel on the same flight. However, Mengele had already left his last known residence in the city, and Harel was unable to get any leads on where he had gone, so the plans for his capture had to be abandoned. Eitan told Haaretz in 2008 that they intentionally made the decision not to pursue Mengele, reasoning that to do so might <b>jeopardize</b> <b>the</b> Eichmann operation.|$|E
5|$|The childless Raymond III of Tripoli {{decided to}} {{bequeath}} his county to his godson, Raymond, who was Bohemond's elder brother. Bohemond III of Antioch sent Bohemond to Tripoli, because {{the union of}} Antioch and Tripoli under one monarch could <b>jeopardize</b> <b>the</b> defence of both crusader states. Raymond III of Tripoli ordered his vassals to do homage to Bohemond. The dying count, {{who was a member}} of the House of Toulouse, also prescribed that should an other member of his family come from Toulouse, Bohemond should cede the County of Tripoli to him. Raymond died in late 1187. Charters issued during the first years of Bohemond's rule imply that his elder brother was regarded a titular count of Tripoli for a while.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} makes choices {{throughout}} the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, {{the outcome of}} entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) can be manipulated {{to a certain extent}} based on player choices. These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can <b>jeopardize</b> <b>the</b> mission by forcing one of the guards to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of Beyond: Two Souls, as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.|$|E

5|$|Kim Possible {{takes place}} {{primarily}} within the fictional United States town of Middleton, {{and focuses on}} the life and adventures of teenager Kim Possible. She is an accomplished high school student and cheerleader who fights crime on a regular basis, assisted by her best friend and sidekick, Ron Stoppable, and Rufus, his pet naked mole rat. Ron's personal fears, insecurities and clumsiness sometimes {{have a tendency to}} <b>jeopardize</b> <b>the</b> success of their own missions. Kim and Ron are aided remotely by Wade, a 10 year-old computer genius who seldom leaves his bedroom and communicates with the duo via device he invented himself known as a Kimmunicator. Together, the foursome is known as Team Possible. The majority of Kim's missions involve her traveling to various destinations around the world to rescue citizens from harm and battle a variety of enemies and villains, the most frequent of whom are Dr. Drakken, a mad scientist constantly plotting world domination, and his superpowered sidekick Shego, who possesses the ability to generate powerful energy blasts and emit them from her hands, making her the heroine's most dangerous opponent. Not yet of age to drive herself to most of her missions, Kim often relies on favors from various people and friends she has assisted in the past for transportation.|$|E
5|$|Plans for an {{ice rink}} in Lillehammer {{started in the}} 1980s with the Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics. In 1985, Lillehammer Municipal Council {{accepted}} {{an agreement with the}} Norwegian Confederation of Sports (NIF), which offered to finance 50 percent of a new multi-use arena in Lillehammer. Combined with the construction of the skiing resort Hafjell, {{it was part of a}} plan to document the construction of new venues in and around Lillehammer to help the town secure the right to host the Olympics. The construction received NOK25 million in state grants. To promote the Olympic bid, the venue was given priority by NIF in their recommendation for use of public grants. In May 1987, the municipal council stated that they did not want to apply to host the B-Group of the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships, because they feared the venue would not be completed by November 1987. NIF President Hans B. Skaset stated that this could <b>jeopardize</b> <b>the</b> entire Olympic bid if Lillehammer withdrew from arranging such a small event. The decision was changed a week later. The venue opened in December 1988 and cost NOK65 million.|$|E

The project's draft environmental impact statement, released in December 1998, {{determined that the}} Capitol Hill tunnel would be feasible and recommended its inclusion in the plan. Sound Transit proposed that Capitol Hill's cut and cover station be located under Broadway south of East John Street, with several entrances to serve nearby Seattle Central Community College and the Broadway business district. From the station, trains would continue south to a station in First Hill before entering the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel; and north under Portage Bay to the western University District. An additional Capitol Hill station, near Broadway and East Roy Street, was proposed by Seattle representatives but {{left out of the}} preferred alternative due to cost concerns. In November 1999, Sound Transit finalized its preferred alternative, adding a crossover north of Capitol Hill station near East Thomas Street.|$|E
