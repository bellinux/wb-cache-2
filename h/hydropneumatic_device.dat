50|$|A {{guideline}} tensioner is a <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>device</b> used on {{an offshore}} drilling rig that keeps a positive pulling force on the guidelines from the platform to a template on the seabed.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>device</b> {{similar in}} {{principle}} to a shock absorber called a 'Water Hammer Arrestor' can be installed between the water pipe and the machine, to absorb the shock and stop the banging.|$|E
50|$|A gravity bong (also {{known as}} a grav, bucket, submarine, geeb, or GB) is a <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>device</b> used for smoking cannabis. One variant {{consists}} of {{a bucket of water}} in which is typically placed a bottle with the bottom cut off, such as a 2-litre PET soft drink bottle. Some kind of cap or screen is rigged over the mouth of the bottle and filled with hash or cannabis. A flame is then held near enough to heat the drug while the bottle is slowly raised out of the water, creating a negative gauge pressure inside the bottle, drawing smoke from the heated cannabis—along with air—into the vacuum. The cap or screen is removed once the bottle is almost full, the user's mouth is placed over the mouth of the bottle and the bottle pushed back down into the water, causing the pressure to rise and forcing the smoke into the lungs. There are many variants on this basic premise, such as using a large water cooler tank in lieu of a soft drink bottle.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} phrases {{imply that the}} shock, the surge, or the water hammer is {{addressed}} {{after it has been}} created.In fact most of those phrased apply to <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>devices</b> that PREVENT a high level of shock, surge, or hammer, from occurring at all. The named devices are rarely designed to respond to a pressure incident in a liquid which must have an approximate typical velocity of 1,440 meters per second.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} motion compensator is {{the anchor}} chain of a ship. Not {{only does the}} anchor prevent the ship from drifting, but the chain itself dampens {{the movement of the}} ship due to undulating motion of the waves. Generally, motion compensators are implemented as springs. For very large forces (dozens to hundreds of tonnes), the springs are implemented as gas springs: <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>devices</b> [...] - [...] a plunger cylinder buffered by a volume of gas.|$|R
50|$|North American, European, {{and other}} {{languages}} refer to <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>devices</b> {{such as a}} hydropneumatic accumulator or pulsation damper using very different words. In many cases this can cause {{a great deal of}} word usage confusion. This article includes information about devices that prevent, but do not absorb, alleviate, arrest, attenuate, or suppress a shock that already exists (these devices prevent the creation of a shock wave at an otherwise higher level). The words frequently used for devices such as pulsation dampeners, hydropneumatic accumulators, water hammer preventers, water hammer arrestors, and others, are included.|$|R
50|$|North American, European, {{and other}} {{languages}} refer to <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>devices</b> {{such as a}} hydropneumatic accumulator or pulsation dampener using very different words. Lack of definition and standardization has caused confusion, and word inference has caused {{a belief in the}} opposite of the truth. This section is for definition of the devices that prevent, and do not either absorb, alleviate, arrest, attenuate, nor suppress a shock that exists (devices which prevent the creation of a shock wave at an otherwise higher level). The words frequently used for devices such as pulsation dampeners, hydropneumatic accumulators, water hammer preventers, water hammer arrestors, and others, are included.|$|R
40|$|Structural {{analysis}} of composite structures subjected to dynamic loads requires detailed {{knowledge of the}} mechanical behavior of component materials under high strain-rates. This paper {{presents the results of}} tests to investigate the tensile dynamic behavior of a pultruded E-glass/polyester composite used in a steel-less blast protection barrier. The described activity is part of the Security of Airport Structures research project, focusing on structural protection of airport infrastructures against disruptive action. Modified Hopkinson bars and <b>hydropneumatic</b> machine <b>devices</b> were used to conduct strain-rate controlled tensile failure tests on glass fiber-reinforced polymer specimens. The results are discussed and then implemented within a viscoplasticity constitutive model and a strain-rate-dependent failure criterion in order to simulate the exhibited mechanical behavior...|$|R
