50|$|The {{strip mill}} {{was a major}} innovation, with the first being erected at Ashland, Kentucky in 1923. This {{provided}} a continuous process, cutting out the need to pass the plates over the rolls and to double them, as in a pack mill. At the end the strip was cut with a <b>guillotine</b> <b>shear</b> or rolled into a coil. Early (hot rolling) strip mills did not produce strip suitable for tinplate, but in 1929 cold rolling began {{to be used to}} reduce the gauge further. The first strip mill in the United Kingdom was opened at Ebbw Vale in 1938 with an annual output of 200,000 tons.|$|E

40|$|As {{dehorning}} or {{removal of}} horn in cattle is rather a cruel but necessary operation, it is advisable {{to prevent the}} horns from growing in young calves rather than removing them after they have grown. However, in certain cases dehorning is required {{to be done in}} adult cattle due to fracture of the horn or horn cancer etc. In adult cattle, dehorning is best performed by a veterinary surgeon. Physical methods of dehorning include the use of embryotomy wire, <b>guillotine</b> <b>shears,</b> or dehorning knives, saws, or high tension rubber bands. The incorrect use of these instruments/tools can cause serious damage and even lead to fatalities. When cattle have large horns they are sometimes "tipped", a procedure that removes the sharp end of the horn but leaves the base. Dehorning of adult cattle is associated with increased risks of sinusitis, bleeding, prolonged wound healing and infection. Therefore, proper care must be taken to prevent these problems as per advice of a vet. To prevent maggot formation apply dressing oil containing linseed oil (100 ml), turpentine oil (10 ml) & eycalpytus oil (10 ml) twice daily Text Message: Dehornig is best done in young calf. To dehorn adult animal, help of vet is required. There is chance of bleeding and infection. Apply dressing oil to prevent fly. Reference...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties, {{namely the}} iron losses {{and the relative}} permeability, of SiFe electrical steel laminations after <b>guillotine</b> <b>shearing</b> and cutting by means of fiber and CO 2 lasers are studied. The magnetic measurements are conducted on the Epstein frame for lamination strips with 1, 2, and 3 additional cutting edges along their length, {{in order to increase}} the cutting effect and the characterization data. The quantified effects of manufacturing (cutting and welding) are presented for three different material grades: M 270 - 50 A, M 400 - 50 A, and a nonoriented electrical steel of gauge 0. 2 mm called NO 20. Usage of the Epstein frame method allows any electrical steel company to reproduce the measurements for any specific grade. Data presented in normalized values facilitate utilization of the presented results and comparison between materials. An original model that incorporates the cutting effect considering homogenously damaged areas is developed and implemented in a finite-element method-based motor design software. Its originality is that it includes dependence on the geometry, included in the material magnetic properties. Simulations made for an industrial low voltage induction motor indicate a more than 15 % increase in the iron losses compared with a model that does not consider the mechanical cutting effect. In the case of laser cutting, this increase reaches 30 % to 50 %, depending on laser settings. These relatively large increases of iron losses justify the implementation of the effect of cutting in industrial finite-element design tools, using a method that does not increase the simulation time...|$|R

Barron, a former curator of American {{history at the}} De Young Museum in San Francisco, designed the plate and bought the brass at a nearby shipyard, where a worker cut the plate from modern brass with a modern <b>guillotine</b> <b>shear.</b> George Clark, an inventor and art critic and appraiser, hammered the letters into the plate with a simple cold chisel. Clark told his wife that the [...] "C.G." [...] - [...] interpreted later to stand for 'Captain General' [...] - [...] before Drake's name was essentially his signature.

40|$|The {{strength}} properties of Secura Hollow Groutable Cable-bolts (HGC) were examined for tensile and shear failures. The 30 mm diameter, nine strand, cable bolt {{consisted of a}} mixture of five 7. 5 mm plain and four 7. 0 mm indented strands wrapped around a central 14 mm steel grouting hole to make a round cable with lay length of 500 mm with bulbs at 500 mm centres of diameter 35 mm. The tensile strength of the cable was tested {{in accordance with the}} British Standard (BS 7861 -part 2 : 2009) using the double embedment pull test. The shear strength of the cable bolt was tested by both the BS 7861 single and UOW double shear methods. The single shear double test used a <b>guillotine</b> <b>shear</b> frame of double embodiment tendon/grout assembly in a steel tube, while the double shear method enabled shear testing of the cable bolt in concrete to simulate rock. It was found that the tensile strength of the cable was in the order of 680 kN, the shear load by single shear test, based on the average of three tests, was around 448 kN. The shear failure load of the cable bolt from double shear testing based on two tests averaged around 786 kN which is significantly higher than achieved from the single shear test. Thus the shear value, obtained from the double shear method was between 13 and 18 % greater than the single shear test method. The use of the <b>guillotine</b> <b>shear</b> frame for the single shear method was considered an unrealistic method of evaluating the shear characteristics of the cable bolts in rock...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMetal {{plates are}} often divided into items in two stages. First a <b>guillotine</b> <b>shear</b> cuts the plate into strips at the {{shearing}} stage, {{and then a}} stamping press punches out the items from the strips at the punching stage. This paper presents an algorithm for generating optimal two-segment cutting patterns of strips at the shearing stage. An orthogonal cut divides the plate into two segments, each of which contains strips of the same direction and length. The algorithm uses dynamic programming techniques to determine the optimal strip layouts on segments of various lengths, and selects two segments {{to appear in the}} optimal pattern. The segments are considered in increasing order of their lengths, so that dominant properties can be used to shorten the computation time. The computational results indicate that the algorithm is efficient in both material utilization and computation time...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} test used to {{evaluate}} the interface bond strength of asphalt pavements is the <b>guillotine</b> direct <b>shear</b> test working in monotonic modality. Under this test configuration the specimen reaches failure in a mode very different from those activated in an actual pavement. In fact, the repetitive loading applied by vehicles is considerably lower than the interface resistance measured by a monotonic test. Moreover, the stress paths imposed to the specimen nowhere are experienced on field, in terms of ratio between shear and normal stresses and their variation during loading time. This study regards the dynamic performance of double-layered cylindrical specimens evaluated by a shear tester where the specimen is inclined so as to obtain contemporarily variations of the applied normal and shear stresses. Various inclinations are used to reproduce several combinations of these two stress components as they actually occur on field in those positions where the vehicle wheels generate a shear stress always in the same direction and proportional to the normal stress. As both normal and shear components influence the interface resistance to repetitive stress, a dynamic failure surface is assessed in the three-dimension space, with the two stress components as independent variables and the number of cycles at failure as dependent variable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{manufacture}} of parts made of metal sheet often includes two successive processes: the cutting process {{at which a}} <b>guillotine</b> <b>shear</b> cuts the sheet into strips, and the punching process at which a stamping press punches out the blanks from the strips. This paper presents an algorithm for generating optimal two-staged cutting patterns of strips for the cutting process. At the first stage the sheet is divided into segments with parallel cuts. Each segment contains strips with the same length and direction. The segments are cut into strips at the second stage. The algorithm calls a recursion function to determine the optimal strip layouts on segments of various lengths, and calls another recursion function to optimally arrange the segments in the sheet, so {{that the value of}} the pattern reaches maximum. The computational results indicate that the algorithm is efficient both in computation time and in material usage...|$|E
40|$|Glass-Reinforced Polymer (GRP) bolts, {{commonly}} known as Fibre Glass (FG) dowels are increasingly applied for strata reinforcement in mines. The most popular dowels used in coal mines are the 22 mm diameter fully threaded type. A series of tests were undertaken to evaluate various strength properties of FG dowels. These include tensile failure tests by the double-embedment method, single and double <b>guillotine</b> <b>shear</b> tests, double shear tests in concrete medium and punch shear tests. Punch shear tests were {{used to evaluate the}} dowel shear strength parallel and perpendicular to the fibre glass strands or elements direction of extrusion. The study found that the tensile strength of the 22 mm diameter fibre glass dowels was in the order of 30 t. In the shear testing, the peak shear load was influence by the encapsulation grout type and the level of fibre glass axial pre-tension. Also, there was a nearly fivefold difference in the shear strength value of fibre glass dowels tested parallel as against perpendicular to the dowel axis...|$|E
40|$|Dilatancy is {{described}} as the shear-induced volume change in granular materials. An inclined shear test {{was used in this}} study to measure dilatancy on double layer asphalt specimens, where, due to the configuration of the device, dilatancy can-not be inhibited. Under monotonic loading conditions, three angles of 30 °- 45 °- 60 ° between the specimen axle and the horizontal were considered, so as to set differ-ent ratios between normal and shear force. A <b>guillotine</b> <b>shear</b> test was used to compare allowed and inhibited dilatancy at different levels of applied normal stress. The dilatancy angle ψ and the dilatancy speed were introduced as useful parameters to characterize the phenomenon. The results proved that, by inhibiting dilatancy, the interface shear strength increases of a constant amount regardless of the applied normal pressure. Moreover, the comparison of the test outcomes between the two devices highlighted the non-contemporaneity between the dila-tancy speed peak and the shear stress peak in the inclined shear test. It can be at-tributed {{to the fact that the}} volumetric expansion of the specimen is countered by the normal stress, which increases proportionally to the shear stress during the test...|$|E

40|$|Glass-Reinforced Polymer (GRP) bolts, {{commonly}} known as Fibre Glass (FG) dowels or plastic dowels are increasingly applied for strata reinforcement in mines {{as well as in}} concrete reinforcement in civil engineering. The most popular dowels used in Australian coal mines are the 22 mm diameter fully threaded type. FG bolts are cuttable, easy to handle, lightweight and corrosion resistant. The tested dowels were all black in colour, which is a favoured colour in coal mines. A series of tests were undertaken to evaluate various strength properties of FG dowels. These tests include the tensile failure test by the double-embedment method, single <b>guillotine</b> <b>shear</b> test, double shear test both in steel frame and in concrete blocks, and finally the punch shear test. The study found that the tensile strength by pull testing of the 22 mm diameter fibre glass dowels was in the order of 27 t. The shear strength testing of dowels in both single guillotine and double shear steel frames were in agreement with each other. In general the shear strength values of dowels tested, using single shear guillotine testing, were around 20 % of the axial strength in comparison with 70 % in the same diameter steel rebar tests. The peak shear load values obtained from double shear tests in concrete blocks was influenced by the encapsulation grout type and the level of fibre glass axial pre-tension. The punch shear tests revealed that there was a more than threefold increase in the punch shear strength value of fibre glass dowels tested perpendicular as against parallel to the dowel axis...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The thermal hydraulic simulation code RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 1. 1 was utilized to model General Electric's Simplified Boiling Water Reactor plant. The model of the plant was subjected to a small break loss of coolant accident occurring from a <b>guillotine</b> <b>shear</b> of the vessel's 2 inch bottom drain line while operating at full power. The accident was compounded by disabling the plant's isolation condenser system and as an initial condition, the loss of site power. The ability of the plant's passive safety systems to respond to this type of accident, and the code's ability to accurately predict the accidents phenomena was investigated. The overall conclusion was that the modeled plant maintained all relevant safety parameters within specifications supplied by General Electric (GE) in their Standard Safety Analysis Report (SAR) for the term of investigation (I 5, 500 real time seconds). While no safety related parameters were exceeded, certain trends appearing {{near the end of the}} calculation suggest the need for further investigation. Both containment temperature and pressure were increasing when the transient was terminated. The RELAP 5 code was able to simulate a representative model of the plant. Calculated steady state parameters for power, flow rates, recirculation ratio, and mass balance were within I% of those specified in the SAR. However the ability of the code to accurately model low flow, condensation heat transfer, in the presence of noncondensable gases should be verified. It is concluded that the simulation's results seem to pass an intuitive engineering inspection. That is to say, flow and heat transfer data calculated by the RELAP 5 code reflect expected values and relational interactions are maintained, but that no quantitative significance could be justified. The uniqueness of the plant's design and the interactive nature of the transient, suggest Additional experimental data from test facilities is needed to validate the calculations...|$|E
