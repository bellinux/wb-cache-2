40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{estimate}} the potential employment and income benefits of the emerging market for <b>gas</b> <b>cooling</b> products. The emphasis here is on exports because that is the major opportunity for the U. S. heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) industry. But domestic markets are also important and considered here because without a significant domestic market, it is unlikely that the plant investments, jobs, and income associated with <b>gas</b> <b>cooling</b> exports would be retained within the United States. The prospects for significant <b>gas</b> <b>cooling</b> exports appear promising for a variety of reasons. There is an expanding need for cooling in the developing world, natural gas is widely available, electric infrastructures are over-stressed in many areas, and the cost of building new gas infrastructure is modest compared to the cost of new electric infrastructure. Global <b>gas</b> <b>cooling</b> competition is currently limited, with Japanese and U. S. companies, and their foreign business partners, the only product sources. U. S. manufacturers of HVAC products are well positioned to compete globally, and are already one of the faster growing goods-exporting sectors of the U. S. economy. Net HVAC exports grew by over 800 percent from 1987 to 1992 and currently exceed $ 2. 6 billion annually (ARI 1994). Net <b>gas</b> <b>cooling</b> job and income creation are estimated using an economic input-output model to compare a reference case to a <b>gas</b> <b>cooling</b> scenario. The reference case reflects current policies, practices, and trends with respect to conventional electric <b>cooling</b> technologies.

40|$|Heat pumps {{working with}} CO 2 as a {{refrigerant}} have low energy consumptions if right application areas and operating conditions are selected. The use of CO 2 in heat pump dryers is feasible if operating temperatures are appropriate. In heat pump dryers working with CO 2 {{according to the}} transcritical cycle, {{one of the most}} important operating conditions is optimum <b>gas</b> <b>cooler</b> inlet pressure, which gives the maximum coefficient of performance (COP). In this study, a model was developed by using MATLAB software for heat pump tumble dryer working with CO 2. The model was validated by experimental data taken from existing literature. Then, COP, moisture extraction rate (MER), and specific moisture extraction rate (SMER) were found by running the model at different <b>gas</b> <b>cooler</b> inlet pressures (80 – 140 bars). All results were calculated in the same geometry for evaporator, <b>gas</b> <b>cooler,</b> and compressor. Thus, effects on the results of variation of the geometrical features were eliminated. Optimum <b>gas</b> <b>cooler</b> inlet pressure was determined as 100 bars for the system with data input to the model.

Effects of various operating parameters (nanofluid inlet temperature and mass flow rate, CO 2 pressure and particle volume fraction) are studied as well. Use of nanofluid as coolant in double-tube <b>gas</b> <b>cooler</b> of CO 2 cycle improves the <b>gas</b> <b>cooler</b> effectiveness, cooling capacity and COP without penalty of pumping power. The CO 2 cycle yields best performance using Al 2 O 3 -H 2 O as a coolant in double-tube <b>gas</b> <b>cooler</b> followed by TiO 2 -H 2 O, CuO-H 2 O and Cu-H 2 O. The maximum cooling COP improvement of transcritical CO 2 cycle for Al 2 O 3 -H 2 O is 25. 4 %, whereas that for TiO 2 -H 2 O is 23. 8 %, for CuO-H 2 O is 20. 2 % and for Cu-H 2 O is 16. 2 % for the given ranges of study.
