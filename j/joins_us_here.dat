There's not a long history of Portuguese video art or a Portuguese women's video art tradition related to feminist issues, like in Northern European countries. However, it's possible to trace features in contemporary Portuguese women video works to the third wave inclusive feminisms, namely the importance of women identities' multiplicity and difference and the complex interrelatedness between codings of gender, race, nationality, language, class, etc...|$|R

[...] "In commercial rooms, sir, as no doubt you must be well aware, seeing that you have done us the honour of <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> the dinner bill is divided equally among all the gentlemen as sit down. It's {{the rule of the}} room, sir. You has what you like, and you calls for what you like, and conwiviality is thereby encouraged.

If it <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> it would make all the {{difference}} in the world; though certainly till the campaign opens it would have to be quartered at Lisbon, for it is as much as the wretched transport can do to feed us. Now the truth is, Portugal is a miserably poor country at the best of times, and does not produce enough for the wants of the people. Of course, it has been terribly impoverished by the war. The fields in most places have been untilled and, in fact, the greater portion of the population, as well as our army, has to be fed from England.|$|R

But, because we are resolved to go beyond you, we have transmitted a bill to England, to be returned here, giving the Government and six of the Council power for three years to imprison whom they please for three months, without any trial or examination: and I expect to be among the first of those upon whom this law will be executed." ...|$|R
50|$|About 1.5 mi into Sheldon, NY 98 {{passes the}} {{southern}} end of Tonawanda Creek, the source of which is located along the west side of NY 98. The route follows the water body along the Sheldon-Orangeville town line to a junction with US 20A just inside of the town of Orangeville. NY 98 <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 20A <b>here,</b> following the latter northwestward to Varysburg, a small creekside hamlet in Sheldon. At the center of Varysburg, NY 98 leaves US 20A to follow Creek Road northward through the towns of Bennington and Attica, following the base of a large valley surrounding Tonawanda Creek. Due to the terrain of the area, the routing of NY 98 is fairly isolated from the remainder of the county until it reaches the outskirts of the village of Attica.|$|R
50|$|Past West Carthage, {{the route}} loosely follows the Black River across rolling {{farmland}} {{in the town}} of Champion to reach the hamlet of Great Bend, located across the Black River from the grounds of Fort Drum. Here, NY 26 meets NY 3 before crossing the river and entering Fort Drum. The route runs northwestward across the military reservation to the town of Le Ray, home to an intersection with US 11 just outside the Evans Mills village limits. NY 26 <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 11 <b>here</b> for the second time, following the Indian River northeast across generally rural areas to reach the village of Philadelphia. The conjoined routes cross the river before splitting {{in the center of the}} community. At this point, NY 26 returns to a northwesterly alignment as it traverses rolling farmland for 6 mi to access the village of Theresa. Named Mill Street, the route crosses the Indian River again before changing names to Commercial Street and gradually curving to the southwest.|$|R
60|$|Another {{thing is}} about you, Mary. Why, when {{we love each}} other so much-- for you can't deny that you love me as much as I do you, and I know how much that is--why must we keep apart just now, when you can so easily get into a train and come to me? To us I should say, for I know how glad Constance would be to have you here. Dear Mary, will you come, if only for a fortnight--if only for a week? You {{remember}} that you {{wanted to go to the}} seaside or somewhere with me. Well, if you will come and <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> we might afterwards all go to Sidmouth for a short (or long) stay; for you and I together would be able to persuade Constance to go with us. My wish is so strong that it has made me believe you will come, and I have even spoken to Constance and Mrs. Churton about it, and they would give you a nice room; and you would be my guest, Mary; and if you should object to that, then you could pay Mrs. Churton for yourself. I have a great many other things to say to you, but shall not write them, in the hope that you will come to hear them from my lips. Only one thing I must mention, because it might vex you, and had therefore best be written. You must not think because I go back to the subject that I have any doubt about Tom being in the wrong in that quarrel you told me about; but I must say again, Mary, that if he was in the wrong, it is for you rather than for him to make the first advance. I would rather people offended me sometimes than not to have the pleasure of forgiving. Forgive me, dearest Mary, for saying this; but I can say it better than another, since no one in the world knows so well as I do how good you are.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the modern}} US 11 {{corridor}} between Cortland and Rouses Point was assigned an unsigned legislative route designation when the New York State Legislature created a statewide legislative route system in 1908. From Cortland north to Syracuse, what is now US 11 was part of Route 10, which continued southeast from Cortland to Afton. Between Syracuse and Colosse, it was designated as Route 33. At Colosse, Route 28 <b>joined</b> current <b>US</b> 11 and followed it to Maple View, where it ended at Route 30 (now NY 104). Route 30 <b>joined</b> modern <b>US</b> 11 <b>here</b> and generally followed it through Watertown to Rouses Point. The most significant deviation from what is now US 11 was between Potsdam and Lawrenceville, where Route 30 used modern NY 11B and County Routes 54 and 55 (CR 54 and CR 55, both formerly NY 195) instead.|$|R

40|$|FOREWORD Welcome to this West Africa Built Environment Research (WABER) conference {{taking place}} here in Ghana. Thank {{you for coming}} and welcome to Accra. The main aims of the WABER conference are: to help young {{researchers}} and early-career scholars in West Africa to develop their research work and skills through constructive face-to-face interaction with experienced academics; to provide a platform for networking and collaborative work among senior built environment academics in West Africa; and {{to serve as a}} vehicle for developing the field of construction management and economics in Africa. Waber 2009 The WABER event in 2009 was held at the British Council in Accra, Ghana on 2 - 3 June. The event was a resounding success. It attracted participation from 32 researchers, from 12 different institutions, who presented their work to an audience of approximately 100 people. Each presenter received immediate and constructive feedback from an international panel. The event was opened by Professor K. K. Adarkwa, Vice Chancellor of KNUST, Kumasi, Ghana, with several senior academics and researchers from universities, polytechnics, and other institutions in Ghana and Nigeria in attendance. There was also a significant level of attendance by senior construction practitioners in Ghana. Thank you to the School of Construction Management and Engineering, University of Reading, UK for funding the inaugural event in 2009. We are also grateful to all of you who helped to make the event a success and to {{those of you who have}} <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> today to build upon the success and legacy of WABER 2009. Waber 2010 This year, we have 60 + peer-reviewed papers and presentations on topics relating to Building services and maintenance, Construction costs, Construction design and technology, Construction education, Construction finance, Construction procurement, Contract administration, Contract management, Contractor development, Decision support systems, Dispute resolution, Economic development, Energy efficiency, Environment and sustainability, Health and safety, Human resources, Information technology, Marketing, Materials science, Organisation strategy and business performance, Productivity, Project management, Quantity surveying, Real estate and planning, Solar energy systems, Supply chain management and Urban development. We hope that these papers will generate interest among delagates and stimulate discussion here and beyond the conference into the wider community of academia and industry. The delegates at this conference come from 10 different countries. This provides a rich international and multicultural blend and a perfect platform for networking and developing collaborations. This year we are blessed to have three high profile keynote speakers in the persons of Professor George Ofori (National University of Singapore), Dr Roine Leiringer (University of Reading, UK) and Professor Will Hughes (University of Reading, UK). We are also thankful to Dr Chris Harty (University of Reading, UK) who is facilitating the Research Skills Workshop on ‘Writing a scientific article’. Thank you to Dr Sena Agyepong of our conference organising team for her capable management of local organising arrangements. And above all, thank you to all of you for coming to this conference. Enjoy and have a safe journey back home. Dr Samuel Laryea School of Construction Management and Engineering University of Reading, July 2010...|$|R
