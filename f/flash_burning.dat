The results thus far indicate that the flashes increase in strength and consist of up to five subcomponents, the mass of the degenerate carbon-oxygen core may determine the interflash period as well as the intershell mass, and that helium <b>flash</b> <b>burning</b> produces mostly C- 12 and a small amount of O- 16...|$|E

40|$|After a hot {{white dwarf}} ceases its nuclear burning, its helium may briefly and explosively reignite.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of a uniquely large excess of 18 O in the hydrogendeficient carbon (HdC) star, HD 137613, based on a spectrum of the first overtone bands of CO at 2. 3 - 2. 4 µm in which three strong absorption bands of 12 C 18 O are clearly present. Bands of 12 C 16 O also are present but no bands of 13 C 16 O or 12 C 17 O are seen. We estimate an isotopic ratio 16 O / 18 O < ∼ 1. The Solar value of this ratio is ∼ 500. Neither He-core burning nor He-shell <b>flash</b> <b>burning</b> can produce the isotopic ratios of oxygen and carbon observed in HD 137613. However, a remarkable similarity exists between the observed abundances and those found in the outer layers of the broad He-shell of early-AGB stars, soon after the end of He-core burning. It is not known how the outer envelope down to the He-shell could be lost but some mechanism of enhanced mass loss must be involved. HD 137613 may be a post-early-AGB star with the outer layers of the former He-burning shell as its photosphere.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present results}} of an {{analysis}} of the bursting behavior of the low mass X-ray binary system SLX 1735 - 269 during INTEGRAL observations of the Galactic Center region in 2003. Six type-I X-ray bursts were detected in total with one being much longer and more powerful then the others. A strong dependence of the burst recurrence time on the mass accretion rate is observed, that is likely caused by a change in the burning regime. The long burst demonstrated a photospheric radius expansion. We discuss possible scenarios of this long burst and show that it is unlikely a carbon <b>burning</b> <b>flash</b> but rather <b>burning</b> of a large pile of hydrogen and helium accelerated by electron capture processes in a dense accumulated layer.

40|$|We study C/O white dwarfs with {{masses of}} 1. 0 to 1. 4 Msun accreting solar-composition {{material}} {{at very high}} accretion rates. We address the secular changes in the WDs, and in particular, the question whether accretion and the thermonuclear runaways result is net accretion or erosion. The present calculation is unique in that it follows {{a large number of}} cycles, thus revealing the secular evolution of the WD system. We find that counter to previous studies, accretion does not give rise to steady state burning. Instead, it produces cyclic thermonuclear runaways of two types. During most of the evolution, many small cycles of hydrogen ignition and burning build a helium layer over the surface of the white dwarf. This He layer gradually thickens and progressively becomes more degenerate. Once a sufficient amount of He has accumulated, several very large helium <b>burning</b> <b>flashes</b> take place and expel the accreted envelope, leaving no net mass accumulation.

40|$|There {{are many}} weapon systems {{in which a}} human {{operator}} acquires a target, tracks it and designates it. Optical countermeasures against this type of systems deny the operator the possibility to fulfill this visual task. We describe the different effects that result from stimulation of the human visual system with high intensity (visible) light, and the associated potential operational impact. Of practical use are flash blindness, where an intense flash of light produces a temporary “blind-spot” in (part of) the visual field, flicker distraction, where strong intensity and/or color changes at a discomfortable frequency are produced, and disability glare where a source of light leads to contrast reduction. Hence there are three possibilities to disrupt the visual task of an operator with optical countermeasures such as flares or lasers {{or a combination of}} these; namely, by an intense flash of light, by an annoying light flicker or by a glare source. A variety of flares for this purpose is now available or under development: high intensity <b>flash</b> flares, continuous <b>burning</b> flares or strobe flares which have an oscillating intensity. The use of flare arrays seems particularly promising as an optical countermeasure. Lasers are particularly suited to interfere with human vision, because they can easily be varied in intensity, color and size, but they have to be directed at the (human) target, and issues like pointing and eye-safety have to be taken into account.

40|$|This {{field study}} {{investigated}} the efficiency of color coding for peripheral identification of vehicle signals. Specifically, the study dealt with identification of stimuli as “yellow” or “red” when presented at intensities corresponding to typical turn signal lamps and side marker lamps. Turn signal lamps were studied both during bright, sunny conditions and at night, while side marker lamps were studied at night only. We used two different yellow stimuli and two different red stimuli. For each color category, one stimulus was relatively far from the contrasting color category while the other stimulus was relatively near. Four viewing angles were used: 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees from visual fixation. A total of 28 subjects participated, ranging from 21 to 78 years old. Nighttime identification of colors was perfect at all viewing angles for stimuli representing turn signal lamps. On the other hand, there were strong effects of viewing angle for turn signals in the daytime and for side marker lamps at night. Although in these two conditions performance deteriorated for stimuli in both color categories, it did so more for the red stimuli. This {{finding is consistent with}} the previously reported finding that peripherally presented red stimuli often appear yellow. The present findings imply that coding signals yellow and red is not sufficient for their peripheral identification under the two most difficult conditions tested (turn signals during bright daytime and side marker lamps during nighttime). To the extent that peripheral discriminability is important in actual driving, efficient signaling should rely on other coding parameters (e. g., intensity, and <b>flashing</b> versus steady <b>burning)</b> ...|$|R
