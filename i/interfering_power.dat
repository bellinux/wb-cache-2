In {{order to}} obtain {{an idea of the}} {{additional}} <b>interfering</b> <b>power</b> of each added platina plate, six voltaic pairs and four intervening platinas were arranged as in fig. 99; a very feeble current then passed (985. 1017.). When one of the platinas was removed so that three intervened, a current somewhat stronger passed. With two intervening platinas a still stronger current passed; and with only one intervening platina a very fair current was obtained. But the effect of the successive plates, taken in the order of their interposition, was very different, as might be expected; for the first retarded the current more powerfully than the second, and the second more than the third.|$|E

30|$|So far, we have {{provided}} the results for outage probability and average delivery rate. In this section, we validate these results via Monte Carlo simulations. The numerical results shown here are obtained by averaging out over 1, 000 realizations. In each realization, the small base station are distributed according to a Poisson point process. The file requests, signal, and <b>interfering</b> <b>powers</b> of the typical user are drawn randomly according to the corresponding probability distributions. The outage probability and average delivery rate are then calculated by considering signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and cache hit statistics. We note that all simulation curves match the theoretical ones. However, a slight mismatch is observed {{due to the fact}} that more precise discretization of continuous variables is avoided for affordable simulation times. As alluded to previously, the target file bitrate as well as average delivery rate are in units of nats/s/Hz. On the other hand, the storage size and file lengths are in units of nats.|$|R

Motivated by such a spectrum-sharing approach, this paper investigates the behavior of capacity under received-power constraints, modeling for example the maximum interference that one system may inflict on another. The insight of the paper is that while in the point-to-point case, transmit and received-power constraints are largely equivalent, they can lead to quite different conclusions in network cases, including relay networks, multiple access channels with dependent sources and feedback, and collaborative communication scenarios. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{interference}} {{detection method}} for multiuser-multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) transmission, which utilizes periodical preamble signals {{in the frequency}} domain {{and the concept of}} full-duplex transmission when assuming idle antennas at the access point (AP) in MU-MIMO. In the propose method, collision detection (CD) of MU-MIMO is achieved by utilizing asynchronous MU-MIMO called random access MU-MIMO. In random access MU-MIMO, several antennas that are not used for the transmission exist, due to asynchronous MU-MIMO. Hence, idle antennas at the AP can receive preamble signals while the transmit antennas at the AP transmit the preamble signals: this procedure is regarded as full-duplex transmission, which cancels the self-interference between AP antennas. The interference can be detected by subtracting the short preamble signal, which is multiplied by the estimated channel response using the received signal after the FFT processing. Moreover, we utilize dual polarization to reduce the mutual coupling between transmit and receive antennas at the AP. Through a computer simulation, it is shown that the proposed method can successfully detect collision from other user terminals (UTs) with OFDM signals when the <b>interfering</b> <b>power</b> from the interfering user terminal (IT) is greater than the noise power. In addition, the <b>interfering</b> <b>power</b> from IT at the AP and the desired user terminal (DT) is measured in an actual indoor environment, and the possibility of using the proposed method at the AP is discussed by using the measurement results...|$|E
