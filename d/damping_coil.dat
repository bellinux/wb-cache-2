40|$|This is a {{continuous}} {{work on the}} project of a doubly-fed permanent magnet (DFPM) generator for wind turbines. The construction of a prototype machine was finally finished and experiments were conducted to verify {{the design of the}} DFPM machine and to establish a basis for designing more powerful machines in industry usage. In the thesis, a finite element model of the machine is established, from which the parameters of the prototype machine are estimated. Then the experiment data are compared with the estimated values to verify the model of the machine. At last a vector control method is proposed with the stability analysis using the parameters developed from the model. Moreover, the damping effect of the permanent magnet (PM) rotor plate is explored.

40|$|A {{simple and}} stable energy-storage {{flywheel}} system with high temperature superconducting levitation is presented. In {{order to have}} stable levitation, a superconductor and a permanent magnet are used, and 3 permanent magnets support {{the top of the}} shaft. In the part of drive system, 8 -poles permanent magnet and 8 coils are used to cancel electromagnetic forces in the radial direction. An electromagnetic damper consisting of permanent magnet for levitation and 4 coils is presented which lies {{at both ends of the}} shaft. When the shaft vibrates in the direction perpendicular to the shaft axis, current flows in the <b>damper</b> <b>coil.</b> It generates the electromagnetic force. The force is in proportion to vibration frequencies of the shaft, so that the force behaves like damping forces. Using this system, a control like the sensorless control is performed. Experimental tests have been carried out for the system as just mentioned. It is clarified that our system has stable levitation, and vibrations are suppressed significantly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The passive {{electromagnetic}} damper has {{the same}} configuration {{as that of the}} electromagnetic bearing, but no sensors and no closed loop control are needed. Its robustness and no-contact structure are its great advantages. When the rotor vibrates, the electromagnetic field intensity in the air gap is altered, then fluctuating currents in the <b>damper</b> <b>coils</b> and eddy currents inside the surface layer of rotor are created. Damping force is caused by the fluctuating currents, while retardation torque is generated by eddy currents. The characteristics of a damper may be improved by adding an additional electrical circuit. Numerical studies showed that damping coefficient increases with increasing static current, but decreases with increasing frequency. And the damping coefficient of the improved damper at higher frequency is more evident than that of the original damper. Experimental results showed that the resonant vibration around the first critical speed was obviously suppressed by both types of passive elec-tromagnetic damper...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Progress 4WDS" [...] was Kyosho's first {{electric}} 4WD off-road racer. The motor {{was mounted}} on the rear overhang, and the forward wheel moves with a chain extending from the rear gearbox. This chain system was also tried on the on-road racer, [...] "Fantom EP." [...] The rear suspension was an orthodox double trailing arm and oil <b>damper</b> with <b>coil</b> springs, but the front suspension featured a double wishbone and mono damper, and substituted a torsion bar for a spring. This unique front suspension was rather difficult to set up, and had a short arm, which prevented it from taking powerful strokes.|$|R
5000|$|Races with {{electric}} off-road cars increased in popularity {{after the release}} of Tamiya's Rough Rider. The 2WD [...] "Scorpion" [...] was released by Kyosho during this period. Kyosho had been promoting its 1/8 scale engine buggy [...] "Circuit 20" [...] in races at the time, and the Scorpion can be described as a miniaturized version of the Circuit 20. The double trailing arm front suspension, semi-streaming rear suspension, aluminum ladder frame, rear-mounted RS540S motor, oil <b>damper</b> and <b>coil</b> springs very much resemble the design for a 1/8 scale racing buggy of the time. The thin body was realized by placing the batteries pointing forward, and its light weight (1680g, with full equipment) gave it a huge advantage over rival models. Its main rivals were Tamiya's Rough Rider and ayk's 556B.|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} of testing deep {{foundation}} piles is proposed, focusing specifically on rapid load testing. The test involves applying a controlled force to a pile by dropping a weight and damper on it. The specific damper provided required modification of the annular gap to accommodate the magneto-rheological fluid, which replaces the hydraulic fluid. Two accelerometers and one K-type thermocouple monitor the damper {{by means of a}} control circuit with a programmable micro-controller. The control circuit bus impedance and board capacitance are evaluated. The control circuit outputs a signal which switches a coil housed inside the <b>damper.</b> This <b>coil</b> generates a field in the annular gap that changes the amount of damping, and consequently alters the applied force. With a control algorithm implemented, it is possible to attain the desired impact on a pile, potentially giving an insight into its load bearing capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Considering coil {{inductance}} and {{the spatial}} distribution of the magnetic field, this paper developed an approximate distributed-parameter model of a hybrid energy harvester (HEH). The analytical solutions were compared with numerical solutions. The effects of load resistances, electromechanical coupling factors, mechanical <b>damping</b> ratio, <b>coil</b> parameters and size scale on performance were investigated. A meso-scale HEH prototype was fabricated, tested and compared with a stand-alone piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) and a stand-alone electromagnetic energy harvester (EMEH). The peak output power is 2. 93 % and 142. 18 % {{higher than that of}} the stand-alone PEH and EMEH, respectively. Moreover, its bandwidth is 108 %- and 122. 7 %-times that of the stand-alone PEH and EMEH, respectively. The experimental results agreed well with the theoretical values. It is indicated that the linearized electromagnetic coupling coefficient is more suitable for low-level excitation acceleration. Hybrid energy harvesting contributes to widening the frequency bandwidth and improving energy conversion efficiency. However, only when the piezoelectric coupling effect is weak or medium can the HEH generate more power than the single-mechanism energy harvester. Hybrid energy harvesting can improve output power even at the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) scale. This study presents a more effective model for the performance evaluation and structure optimization of the HEH...|$|R

The main parts of discharge tube are tube part, coil spring on the tube and resonator cap. The end which is mounted to main body is excitation point.

40|$|A magnetically hybrid damper {{based on}} magnetorheological (MR) fluids, which {{includes}} electro- and permanent magnets, is presented. A demonstrator of this novel MR damper principle was manufactured and its performance {{in terms of}} the damping force under various conditions was studied. With the permanent magnet it is possible to generate a damping force of about 1400 N without a current generated in the coil and without any energy consumption. The maximum achievable force of the novel damper amounts to about 4000 N and the minimum damping force is around 400 N, depending on the polarity of the current in the <b>coil.</b> <b>Damping</b> forces were also calculated using a simple model and the results are in rough accordance with the experimental data. Furthermore, the velocity dependence of the damping force was studied, whereas the frequency of the sinusoidal excitation was varied between 1 and 5 Hz.

40|$|The {{generation}} of electrical power from Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) of a cylinder is investigated numerically. The cylinder {{is free to}} oscillate in the direction transverse to the incoming flow. The cylinder {{is attached to a}} magnet that can move along the axis of a coil made from conducting wire. The magnet and the coil together constitute a basic electrical generator. When the cylinder undergoes VIV, the motion of the magnet creates a voltage across the coil, which is connected to a resistive load. By Lenz's law, induced current in the coil applies a retarding force to the magnet. Effectively, the electrical generator applies a damping force on the cylinder with a spatially varying damping coefficient. For the initial investigation reported here, the Reynolds number is restricted to Re < 200, so that the flow is laminar and two-dimensional (2 D). The incompressible 2 D Navier-Stokes equations are solved using an extensively validated spectral-element based solver. The effects of the electromagnetic (EM) <b>damping</b> constant xi_m, <b>coil</b> dimensions (radius a, length L), and mass ratio on the electrical power extracted are quantified. It is found that there is an optimal value of xi_m (xi_opt) at which maximum electrical power is generated. As the radius or length of the coil is increased, the value of xi_opt is observed to increase. Although the maximum average power remains the same, a larger coil radius or length results in a more robust system in the sense that a relatively large amount of power can be extracted when xi_m is far from xi_opt, unlike the constant damping ratio case. The average power output is also a function of Reynolds number, primarily through the increased maximum oscillation amplitude that occurs with increased Reynolds number at least within the laminar range, although the general qualitative findings seem likely to carry across to high Reynolds number VIV...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{describes}} an impedance measurement device built for investigating flame propagation in a Flame Acceleration Tube, FAT. This tube is 3. 6 m long, {{and has been}} instrumented with thermocouples, pressure sensors and optical measurement probes {{in addition to the}} impedance probe. A control and data acquisition system built around a NI CAD 6259 card were developed and used during the experiments. The impedance is measured by finding <b>damping</b> and resonance <b>coil</b> and an unknown capacitor/impedance. The methodology gave satisfactory results during initial testing in a 20 litre vessel. However, problems with implementation in the FAT limited the qualitative value of the impedance measurements to basic flame arrival information. Experiments with lean fuel-air mixtures gave weaker readings of the flame, making some of the measurements uncertain. Kalvatn (2009) describes optical measurements of the same experiments. A tailor made probe has been developed. The probe contains both the optical and impedance based measurement techniques. This allows simultaneous measurements in the same cross sectional of the flame. The experiments were also filmed with a high speed camera. Results obtained with the methods and analyses of the video are compared. In general the video and optical measurements tend to detect the flame before the impedance measurements. Closed vessel experiments were performed in the FAT with both gas and dust. Three concentrations of propane were tested: 3. 0 %, 4. 5 % and 6. 0 %; as well as two nominal dust concentrations: 250 and 500 g/m 3. The dust used were maize starch. The gas explosions produced much higher flame speeds than the dust explosions. The main drawback of the impedance measurements found is the time resolution. This problem is not easily solved if both the resistance and capacitance of the flame is of interest. However, if one can manage without separating out resistance and capacitance information the principle could offer very high time resolution. The experiments in the 20 litre vessel show that the combined impedance is possible to measure...|$|R

40|$|In the U. S. A Variable Air Volume (VAV) {{system is}} one of most {{commonly}} used air system for multiple-zone commercial buildings due to its capability to meet the varying heating and cooling loads of different building thermal zones. One of key component of VAV system is the terminal VAV box. There are an air damper and a reheat coil in the box. How to effectively and efficiently control the VAV box {{plays a significant role}} to reduce energy consumption and maintain acceptable indoor environment in buildings. Currently, there are two control logics used for controlling VAV box, namely, single maximum and dual maximum control logics. The single maximum logic is the most common, where the room temperature setpoint is maintained by only adjusting the reheat coil valve position in the heating model. The damper position is kept as the minimal to satisfy the ventilation requirement only. On the other hand, the more advanced dual maximum control logic realizes the room air temperature control by adjusting both damper position and reheat coil valve position in the heating model. For the cooling model, both control logics have the same action to maintain room air temperature setpoint through adjusting the damper position. Â In this study, a model-based optimal control is explored to minimize the energy consumption of the VAV box with a hot water reheat coil. Data driven approach based on an Autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model is investigated to represent dynamics of the room thermal response. The similar data-driven approach is used to develop an energy consumption model of the VAV box. Measured data for the VAV box from a real building is used to train and test data-driven model.
