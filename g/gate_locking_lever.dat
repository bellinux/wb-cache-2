5000|$|Jacob Yates and the Pearly <b>Gate</b> <b>Lock</b> Pickers is a {{band from}} Glasgow, Scotland, fronted by Jake Lovatt, former front man with Uncle John & Whitelock.

50|$|The MAG uses ignited powder gases vented {{through a}} port in the barrel to propel a gas piston rod {{connected}} to the locking assembly (it uses a long-stroke piston system). The barrel breech is locked with a vertically tilting, downward <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> mechanism that is {{connected to the}} bolt carrier through an articulated joint. The locking shoulder and camming surfaces that guide the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> are located {{at the base of the}} receiver. The MAG uses a series of proven design concepts from other successful firearms, for example the locking mechanism is modeled on that of the Browning M1918 (BAR) automatic rifle, and the feed and trigger mechanisms are from the WWII-era MG42 universal machine gun.|$|R
5000|$|First {{manufactured}} in 1976, the Benelli B76 is a locked-breech, fixed-barrel pistol, that works {{thanks to a}} unique [...] "inertia lock" [...] system, as explained in [...] In this system, the gun has a bolt provided with ribs extending transversely to the bolt axis and adapted to engage in and disengage from corresponding mating grooves in the receiver, and a <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> that links the bolt with the slide which acts as a bolt carrier. Upon firing, while the pistol recoils in {{the hand of the}} shooter, the inertia of the slide makes it maintain its position relative to the receiver, constraining the bolt ribs' motion in the corresponding grooves via the <b>locking</b> <b>lever,</b> and so keeping the breech positively locked. As soon as the recoil movement of the pistol in the hand of the shooter slows down, the slide tends to continue its rearward movement, so retreating relative to the receiver. At that point, the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> does not force the bolt into its locking recesses any more and the bolt is free to recoil as well, pushed by the residual pressure of the gasses in the barrel with enough force to complete the shooting cycle.|$|R
50|$|The {{stripping}} pin is {{retained in}} the frame when pushed to the side to strip and is separate from the slide lock, as on the Megastar. The slide <b>lock</b> <b>lever,</b> magazine release and other features are reminiscent of the Megastar as well.|$|R

50|$|In railway {{signalling}}, an Annett’s key or Annett key {{is a large}} {{key that}} <b>locks</b> <b>levers</b> or other items of signalling apparatus, thereby serving as a portable form of interlocking. When not in use, the key is normally held in an Annett's lock (or Annett lock) that is fixed to the lever or concerned apparatus.|$|R

50|$|In studies, gate evasion {{rate was}} found to be 1.5% {{unlocked}}, and only 0.8% when <b>locked.</b> Interestingly, unlocked <b>gates</b> also invite more “questionable” entries; rate was 1.8% unlocked, but only 0.9% <b>locked.</b> Keeping <b>gates</b> <b>locked</b> potentially halves gate-related evasions. Following this finding, NYCS reinstructed station supervisors and agents on importance and revenue impacts of keeping <b>gates</b> <b>locked.</b> Questionable <b>gate</b> entries decreased from 1.5% to 0.4% following this change, but illegal gate entries did not show statistically significant decrease when seasonality effects were accounted for. This measure seems to target mostly casual evasions.|$|R

50|$|Railway {{interlocking}} is of British origin, where numerous patents were granted. In June 1856, John Saxby {{received the}} first patent for interlocking switches and signals. In 1868, Saxby (of Saxby & Farmer) {{was awarded a}} patent for what is known today in North America as “preliminary latch locking”. Preliminary latch locking became so successful that by 1873, 13,000 mechanical <b>locking</b> <b>levers</b> were employed on the London and North Western Railway alone.|$|R
50|$|Some {{connector}} housings {{are designed with}} locking mechanisms to prevent inadvertent disconnection or poor environmental sealing. Locking mechanism designs include <b>locking</b> <b>levers</b> of various sorts, screw locking, and toggle or bayonet locking. Depending on application requirements, housings with locking mechanisms may be tested under various environmental simulations that include physical shock and vibration, water spray, dust, etc. to ensure {{the integrity of the}} electrical connection and housing seals.|$|R
50|$|The LPS {{telescopic}} sight propriety mount is adjustable for {{tension on the}} LPS rifle's side rail. This side rail is a Warsaw Pact rail similar in design to the mounting used for Russian SVD rifles and PSO-1 optical sights and positions the {{telescopic sight}} axis {{to the left side}} in relation to the receiver and bore center axis.The Warsaw Pact mount has a castle nut that screws {{into the bottom of the}} <b>locking</b> <b>lever.</b> The spring-loaded portion of the clamp has to be pressed down to tighten or loosen the castle nut as needed.The scope can be easily removed from the receiver of the rifle by swinging the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> open, then sliding the scope mount to the rear. This allows easy access to the receiver cover which needs to be removed for cleaning.Due to the offset to the left and the relative height of the mounting, the PSL iron sights can be used with a LPS scope mounted, though the positioning of the scope’s optical center axis may not be comfortable to all shooters.|$|R

50|$|The Airphibian {{took the}} {{approach}} of converting from an aircraft to a roadable vehicle by a conversion process that left aircraft sections behind during road use. The process consisted of removing a three-bladed propeller and placing it on a hook {{on the side of}} the fuselage, cranking down support casters, and disengaging <b>lock</b> <b>levers</b> connecting the flight unit to the road unit. The wing and aft fuselage are detached for road use.|$|R

50|$|These little pistols were {{intended}} to be a parlor pistol and not a defensive weapon. They are designed for use with a percussion cap and lead shot, without gunpowder. There are two types of breech-pieces, about equal in frequency in existing production guns; all known prototypes have the one-piece design, which provides no cover to enclose the cap, and its <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> is quite short. The two-piece design has a cone to hold the cap, a cover providing protection from the exploding cap, and a longer lever.|$|R

50|$|The MAG's {{receiver}} {{is constructed}} from sheet metal stampings reinforced by steel plates and rivets. The front is reinforced {{to accept the}} barrel nut and gas cylinder which are permanently mounted. Guide rails that support the bolt assembly and piston extension during their reciprocating movement are riveted to the side plates. The bolt's guide rails are shaped downward to drive the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> into engagement with the locking shoulder, which is also riveted to the side plates. The rear of the receiver has been reinforced and slotted to accept the butt-stock.|$|R

25|$|The AAIB {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} locked condition of the aircraft's elevators which prevented the aircraft rotating into a flying attitude. It was thought likely that the elevator gust lock became re-engaged during the pilots' pre-takeoff checks, and that it was not noticed until the takeoff was so far advanced that a successful abandonment within the overrun area could not be made. The re-engagement of the gust lock was made possible by the condition of the gust <b>lock</b> <b>lever</b> <b>gate</b> plate and gate-stop strip, to which non-standard repairs had been made.|$|R
