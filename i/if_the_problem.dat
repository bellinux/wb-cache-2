5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> persists.|$|E
5|$|The {{management}} of {{low back pain}} often includes medications for the duration that they are beneficial. With the first episode of low back pain the hope is a complete cure; however, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> becomes chronic, the goals may change to pain management and the recovery of as much function as possible. As pain medications are only somewhat effective, expectations regarding their benefit may differ from reality, and {{this can lead to}} decreased satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|Numerical {{stability}} {{is an important}} notion in numerical analysis. An algorithm is called numerically stable if an error, whatever its cause, does not grow to be much larger during the calculation. This happens <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is well-conditioned, meaning that the solution changes by {{only a small amount}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> data are changed by a small amount. To the contrary, if a problem is ill-conditioned, then any small error in the data will grow to be a large error.|$|E

25|$|The {{very first}} step which is {{normally}} overlooked {{by the top}} level management is defining the exact problem. Though {{we think that the}} problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem. Hence, {{it is very important that}} the definition of the problem is the same among all group members.

According to the report, authors who reject the notion of nationality, or support anti-Zionist views, get much more exposure in reading lists. In 2010, Im Tirtzu sent Rivka Karmi, {{the head of the}} Ben-Gurion University of the Negev a letter, demanding that the university stop the anti-Zionist bias in its Department of Politics and Government. The letter alleged that 9 out of 11 professors in the department were involved in extreme left-wing activities (among others, attempting to persuade other countries to join the academic boycott of Israel). Im Tirtzu threatened to notify the donors of the university <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> was not rectified.|$|E
25|$|After the bug is reproduced, {{the input}} of the program {{may need to be}} {{simplified}} {{to make it easier to}} debug. For example, a bug in a compiler can make it crash when parsing some large source file. However, after simplification of the test case, only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash. Such simplification can be made manually, using a divide-and-conquer approach. The programmer will try to remove some parts of original test case and check <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> still exists. When debugging the problem in a GUI, the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear.|$|E

25|$|The {{organization}} {{has been criticized}} for its lack of troubleshooting support. Teachers in Peru are told to handle problems in one of two ways. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is a software issue, they are to flash the computer, and if it is a hardware problem, they are to report it. In the classroom environment this black-boxing approach is being criticized for causing the teachers and students to feel disconnected with, and confused by the laptop, which results, in many cases, in the laptops eventually going unused. Several defects in OLPC XO-1 hardware have emerged in the field, and laptop repair is often neglected by students or their families (who are responsible for maintenance) due to the relatively high cost of some components (such as displays).|$|E
25|$|Golaud {{is lying}} in bed with MÃ©lisande at the bedside. He is wounded, having fallen from his horse while hunting. The horse {{suddenly}} bolted for no reason as the clock struck twelve. MÃ©lisande bursts into tears and says she feels ill and unhappy in the castle. She wants to go away with Golaud. He asks her the reason for her unhappiness but she refuses to say. When he asks her <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is PellÃ©as, she replies {{that he is not}} the cause but she does not think he likes her. Golaud tells her not to worry: PellÃ©as can behave oddly and he is still very young. MÃ©lisande complains about the gloominess of the castle, today {{was the first time she}} saw the sky. Golaud says that she is too old to be crying for such reasons and takes her hands to comfort her and notices the wedding ring is missing. Golaud becomes furious, MÃ©lisande claims she dropped it in a cave by the sea where she went to collect shells with little Yniold. Golaud orders her to go and search for it at once before the tide comes in, even though night has fallen. When MÃ©lisande replies that she is afraid to go alone, Golaud tells her to take PellÃ©as along with her.|$|E

The flight director, Christopher Kraft, followed the surgeon's advice to see <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> would settle, and gave the go for a second orbit. Schirra eventually stabilized the problem over time, slowly dialing the suit's control knob to a high cooling setting; he compared the heat to that of [...] "mowing a lawn in Texas".|$|E

If the onset is abrupt, collapse, shock and vomiting may occur. [...] ACTH deficiency is highly similar to primary Addison's disease, which is cortisol deficiency {{as the result of}} direct damage to the adrenal glands; the latter form, however, often leads to hyperpigmentation of the skin, which does not occur in ACTH deficiency.|$|E
500|$|Although {{successful}} in solving Apollonius' problem, van Roomen's method has a drawback. A prized property in classical Euclidean geometry {{is the ability}} to solve problems using only a compass and a straightedge. Many constructions are impossible using only these tools, such as dividing an angle in three equal parts. However, many such [...] "impossible" [...] problems can be solved by intersecting curves such as hyperbolas, ellipses and parabolas (conic sections). For example, doubling the cube (the problem of constructing a cube of twice the volume of a given cube) cannot be done using only a straightedge and compass, but Menaechmus showed that the problem can be solved by using the intersections of two parabolas. Therefore, van Roomen's solutionâ€”which uses the intersection of two hyperbolasâ€”did not determine <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> satisfied the straightedge-and-compass property.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{dogs with}} SM show {{scratching}} behavior. [...] Not all dogs who show scratching behavior appear to suffer pain, though several leading researchers, including Dr Clare Rusbridge in the UK and Drs Curtis Dewey and Dominic Marino in the US, believe scratching in SM cavaliers {{is a sign}} of pain and discomfort and of existing neurological damage to the dorsal horn region of the spine. [...] If onset is at an early age, a first sign may be scratching and/or rapidly appearing scoliosis. [...] <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is severe, there is likely to be poor proprioception (awareness of body position), especially with regard to the forelimbs. [...] Clumsiness and falling results from this problem. Progression is variable though the majority of dogs showing symptoms by age four tend to see progression of the condition.|$|E
