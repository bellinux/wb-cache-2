The implementation of BSE monitoring and eradication programmes led to a dramatic drop in the detected BSE cases within the period. In the case of Rabies, the co-funded oral vaccination programmes have proved very successful as they have led to the steady eradication of Rabies from several Member States. This is unique in the world as the EU has achieved a level of Rabies eradication that has never been experienced anywhere else before. Classical Swine Fever (CSF) in domestic pigs has been eradicated all over Europe. In wild boar, the restricted zones have been lifted due to the proved absence of virus circulation in most of the EU territories. The implementation of Avian Influenza (AI) surveillance programmes has been another success. Surveillance programmes for the disease have proven effective in providing early warning for the timely detection of outbreaks of both high and low pathogenic strains...|$|R
40|$|This chapter assesses {{whether and}} how far the EU adopts an experimentalist {{approach}} in transnational regulation of food safety. Both the EU system of import safety, including regulatory cooperation with third countries, and the EU’s embeddedness within global governance institutions, such as the WTO and the Codex Alimentarius, are analysed. The findings indicate that {{the increasing use of}} international standards as the basis for EU food safety regulation is able to transform the nature of the EU as a unilateral standard-setter. Moreover, the <b>EU</b> Food and <b>Veterinary</b> Office and the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed offer important opportunities for third countries to communicate their needs back into the Union’s regulatory process. However, there are also challenges to fully realizing the EU’s experimentalist potential in transnational food safety regulation.

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of Animal Machines (Harrison, 1964), there has been wide-spread public pressure in Europe—supported by European institutions—to “ban the battery cage. ” The European Union (EU) and national governments (particularly in Northern Europe) funded research on noncage systems for egg production and en-riched cages. In 1986, the EU passed a Directive specifying a minimum size for cages, but public opinion—again particularly in the North—continued to require more. A market sector emerged that would pay more for noncage eggs. Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland passed more stringent legislation {{than the rest of}} Europe. A 1999 Direc-tive with details based on advice from the <b>EU’s</b> Scientific <b>Veterinary</b> Committee will phase out conventional laying cages but allow enriched cages. Implementation de-pends on various factors, including negotiations in the World Trade Organization. In the next 10 years, however, major changes to the housing of most laying hens in Eu-rope almost certainly will occur. Similar changes in other countries will follow. As in Europe, change probably will be piecemeal, affected both by public pressure and by all sectors of society: producers, retailers, consumers, legislators, and the media. On June 15, 1999, the new European Union (EU) Directive on welfare of laying hens was passed, which requires conventional laying cages to be phased out by 2012. Enriched laying cages will still be allowed. In this article, I outline how this came about and the scientific, social, economic, and political issues in-volved. I consider prospects for the future, both within and outside the EU, and implications for animal welfare in other countries...|$|R
40|$|Veterinary {{medicine}} has advanced considerably {{over the past}} 100 years. Nowhere is this {{more evident than in}} companion animal medicine. The extant veterinary literature is replete with therapies and techniques, procedures and protocols, all designed to enhance animal health. These all depend on the assumption that animals displaying signs of ill health will be presented for veterinary care, as no amount of knowledge can be brought to bear on an animal of which the veterinary surgeon is unaware. In a short communication summarised on p 584 of this <b>week's</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Record, Mike Davies (2011) calls this assumption into question by demonstrating that a percentage of owners would not seek veterinary attention for an older dog displaying signs of ill health. This, in turn, means that much veterinary knowledge is rendered immaterial, as it cannot be applied. By identifying this lacuna in our understanding, Davies's short communication makes a considerable contribution, as it causes us to look afresh at how optimal veterinary care might be provided. ...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission {{announced}} {{a ban on}} all imports of bovine fresh meat from Paraguay on February 20 th 2003 {{as a result of}} problems in controlling foot-and-mouth disease. The measure was taken following a visit from the <b>EU's</b> Food and <b>Veterinary</b> Office, which expressed serious concerns about the controls in place between FMD-affected areas and non-FMD-affected areas. The Commission felt it was essential to send a strong message to all third-country meat suppliers of the importance of fully complying with strict EU standards with regard to animal disease control. The decision to ban imports will be reviewed when the Paraguay authorities can guarantee that the deficiencies in the control system identified have been fully addressed and following a further inspection by the FVO to verify this. Comment: The experience of Paraguay should be a warning to all ACP beef suppliers that the EU is tightening up on the enforcement of existing rules and regulations on animal-disease controls in countries supplying the EU market. ACP beef exporters will need to stay alert to this development. The European Commission {{announced a}} ban on all imports of bovine fresh meat [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores how far experimentalist {{features}} of the EU’s internal food safety governance regime are being extended to the Union’s external governance of food safety. Hence, it analyses whether and how far the Union’s engagement with both third countries and global institutions displays {{features of}} experimentalism. Our analysis shows that while the EU constitutes a powerful global standard setter {{in the field of}} food safety, its unilateral role is to some extent mitigated by both its cooperative engagement with third countries at the bilateral level and by its embeddedness within multilateral global governance institutions, such as the WTO and the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Furthermore, our analysis of two crucial institutional mechanisms of EU’s external food safety governance, namely the <b>EU</b> Food and <b>Veterinary</b> Office (FVO) and the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) shows that both are designed, and often function well as reflexive institutions with strong features of de-centralised implementation, reporting and peer review, as well as learning and recursive revision of rules. Both FVO and RASFF provide important opportunities for third countries to participate in the Union’s internal governance and rule-making processes. However, reviewing the performance of both institutions in previous food crisis situations, the analysis also reveals some important shortcomings in their practical functioning as experimentalist tools, which calls for the further improvement of these mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The meat {{obtained}} from trophy hunting, culling and harvesting indigenous game animals {{has been used}} in the past by biltong (traditional dried meat) hunters, local butchers and for export markets. The edible by-products, currently discarded, {{could be used as a}} renewable source of protein in low income communities. Constraints to the utilization of such edible by-products of game meat include lack of recognized food value chains in informal markets, food safety concerns and limited market access to edible by-products from game harvesting operations. METHODS: Participatory risk analysis was used to investigate the feasibility of using edible offal as a source of renewable protein, to address food security issues in poor communities bordering game parks in South Africa. The market outlet for the food value chain selected for investigation, was informal markets in Pongola, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. In order to promote food safety, only edible offal from impala carcasses that had been through primary meat inspection, were considered during the study. Samples were submitted for microbiology, in line with published <b>EU</b> guidelines and <b>Veterinary</b> Procedural Notices to an accredited laboratory. Structured and informal interviews were held with stakeholders, including veterinarians, game harvesters and informal traders. Scenario planning and decision tree analysis was used to develop a practical food marketing chain and estimate critical control points for identified physical, biological and chemical hazards. In addition, environmental risks were considered and a risk mitigation strategy designed, to reduce any possible environmental impacts. It was concluded that the food marketing chain is feasible and that the current practice of leaving the offal for predators...|$|R
40|$|Trichinellosis is an {{important}} parasitic zoonosis that {{is caused by the}} intracellular nematode Trichinella spp [...] Infection of humans occurs through consumption of raw (or undercooked) meat containing infectious larvae. In Europe, meat from pork, horse, and wild boar have been identified as most important sources of Trichinella infections in humans. In Switzerland, both the domestic pig and wild boar population are considered free of Trichinella. Conversely, Swiss foxes, lynxs and recently a wolf were found to be infected, the species identified in these animals was always referred to as Trichinella britovi. Although this species rarely infects pork and, compared to Trichinella spiralis, only causes reduced pathogenic effects in humans, the basic presence of Trichinella in Switzerland cannot be neglegted. This fact has gained increasing importance since the responsible authorities in the European Union (EU) are preparing regulations for the official Trichinella-control in meat in order to improve food safety for consumers. These regulations will be implemented {{as a consequence of the}} recent association of east European countries with the EU. This new legislation particularly takes into account, that in the past by far most cases of human trichinellosis in the EU were due to consumption of imported east European meat. Within the framework of the bilateral agreements of Switzerland with the <b>EU,</b> the Swiss <b>veterinary</b> public health authorities will have to comply with the foreseen EU regulations. Although diagnostic methods for the direct demonstation of Trichinella in pork meat are already routine practice in several Swiss abattoirs, the implementation of a meat control program for Trichinella for the entire slaughter pig population of the country would lead to an enormous increase in costs for the administration and will require an increased infrastructure in veterinary services. In order to find a reduced testing format for monitoring Trichinella infections in Swiss pork, an infection risk-oriented survey strategy is currently evaluated. In the present article, this minimized survey strategy is discussed regarding its compatibility with the EU regulations laying down rules for the official control of meat for Trichinella...|$|R
40|$|An {{alarming}} {{decline of}} vulture populations (up to 95 %) in Pakistan {{in the late}} 1990 ’s has recently been attributed {{to the use of}} the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac in cattle. Several species are now threatened with extinction, a tragedy that demonstrates that an environmental risk assessment of veterinary medicines is legitimate. The fate and behaviour of pharmaceuticals in the environment has been studied incidentally since the second half of the 20 th century. The possible effect of residues on the quality of the environment was a concern that had been recognised since shortly after medicines were actually found in the environment towards the end of the 1960 s. About a decade or two later, these concerns about pollution and effects had reached the regulatory agenda and were addressed in the European legislation on veterinary medicines. Notably from 1994 onwards, when the <b>EU</b> Committee for <b>Veterinary</b> Medicinal Products (CVMP) initiated the drafting of a guidance document for the risk assessment of veterinary medicines, an increasing number of publications on use, emission, fate, occurrence, effect, and risk of pharmaceuticals has been published. In this thesis, the representation of the environment in the risk model and the consequences of the choices regarding variables and relationships in the natural system were addressed in light of existing legislation and policy on environmental quality. Where possible, empirical validation of individual exposure models was performed, demonstrating the accuracy of the model for a specified use. I have outlined and discussed several technical and conceptual flaws in the use of risk assessment in the registration process. The formalisation of the protection goals by the Note for Guidance has no legal status, the guidance does not contain all European environmental quality criteria and includes a soil exposure trigger for the full risk assessment that was not well founded. Particularly the variability in possible outcomes for the soil exposure trigger is troublesome, since it gives the impression that science may produce information that will not lead to better judgement. Screening level exposure models are not always protective and lack standardised scenarios for uniform assessment. Risk mitigation measures are not validated, and give a false impression that the risk to the environment is reduced to acceptable levels. Products that pose a threat to environmental quality at or after use may now be registered and be used. Authorities responsible for water and land quality cannot infer from the registration of a veterinary medicine that the use complies with the quality standards set by environmental legislation. This legislation now obliges these authorities to regulate and enforce product use and slurry use on a case by case basis through permits. All of the shortcomings identified undermine, to a greater or to a lesser extent, the legitimacy of the registration process and the use of scientific opinions. Policy makers, regulators, and scientists should engage in a reconnaissance of regulatory goals, assessment scales, model approaches, and uncertainty and variability of data associated with the assessment. Only then, a risk model (with or without triggers) can be applicable to the situation of interest and provide a solid framework for making risk-benefit decisions to the satisfaction of producers, decision-makers and consumers.

40|$|Agriculture {{has been}} Macedonia’s {{backbone}} for centuries {{and has always}} {{played an important role}} in Macedonian society. By maintaining landscape and biodiversity through the ages, Macedonian farmers have been the true guardians of an important national treasure – biodiversity. They have been the invisible hand managing landscapes, agricultural habitats and enabling farm-linked biodiversity to provide a range of ecosystem services. Pollination; pest, disease, flood and fire regulation; preservation of genetic resources; and the provision of food, fibre, natural medicine, pharmaceuticals and appealing landscapes are only a few of these services. Agricultural biodiversity under threat Many of the Macedonian landscapes and habitats that are important for conservation have been created by centuries-old practices of extensive grazing and low-input small-scale cropping practices. There is a very strong inter-linkage between farming, biodiversity and maintenance of traditional agricultural landscapes. However, depopulation of farming communities and their ageing, together with the introduction of agricultural machinery and intensive animal husbandry in fertile plains has drastically decreased the number of livestock in marginal areas. Most of these are mountainous regions with poor soils, but with species-rich grassland and other valuable ecosystems. Macedonian agriculture has also become “less mobile”. Traditional pastoral grazing systems, flocks and shepherds are nowadays more a tourist attraction than a common sight. A reduction of livestock density results in less moving and grazing, leading to land abandonment and changes in land use. The area of farmland of high natural value and the mosaic of habitats for wildlife in Macedonia has been shrinking due to an invasion by shrubs and other pioneering vegetation. This process results in the growth of coarse vegetation, leads to the development of semi-woody species and eventually closed canopy forests. Such ecosystems have substantially lower biodiversity value than fragmented agricultural landscapes, notably natural grassland. They harbour less bird, butterfly and plant species than managed grassland. Enhanced natural succession also causes a higher risk of fire because the excess biomass is not subject to grazing pressure. If not adequately addressed, the problem of land abandonment and natural succession in Macedonia will cause irreversible damage. The expansion of intensive agriculture in the lowlands is another threat to agricultural biodiversity. Land drainage, removal of hedges and other field margins, usage of pesticides and fertilisers are leading to a decline in agricultural biodiversity and provision of related ecosystem services. Agri-environment programmes promise vs. farmers’ reality The EU has introduced agri-environment programmes and payments to stop and to reverse these kinds of negative trends. In the accession process, Macedonia is required to design its own agri-environment programmes, compatible with the Common Agricultural Policy. These programmes encourage farmers to continue practising environmentally friendly measures or introduce those that are not economically attractive, but essential from the environmental and biodiversity point of view. Agri-environment payments are an instrument through which society rewards farmers for the public goods and services they provide, as the market does not recognise their values. However, Macedonian farmers have to be aware of this opportunity and to be prepared for benefiting from agri-environment programmes. For various historical, socio-economic, administrative, and other reasons, in Macedonia – as in some other countries – the human and social capital for administering and implementing agri-environment programmes is limited. The uptake in these programmes in Macedonia is likely to be slow and on a limited scale due to the following obstacles: 1. 	Farming in Macedonia, notably in high-nature-value areas is practiced predominantly by small-scale, (semi) -subsistence, elderly and poorly educated farmers. They have limited entrepreneurial skills, financial power and technical know-how. Besides, many operate in the most marginal areas (from an agriculturalist perspective) and under difficult weather conditions and socio-economic realities. 2. 	The majority of such farmers are outside of the mainstream economic and administrative systems. They produce mostly for themselves and their extended families, selling their surplus products locally for cash, without any receipts or VAT charged. They are not obliged to practice bookkeeping and are not subject to income tax. The farmland they use, especially grasslands – as well as their livestock is rarely included in the Land and other Registers. These farmers are the “outlaws” of the official systems and as such are not eligible for EU area-based support schemes such as agri-environment payments. Those few such farmers who would like to become a part of the official systems and register their land and livestock, face complicated, unresolved land ownership and land use issues – sometimes going back several generations. 3. 	Products (cheese, milk, “kashkaval”, salami, etc.) that are produced in a traditional way do not necessarily meet the respective national or newly harmonised <b>EU</b> sanitary, <b>veterinary</b> or hygiene standards, making their sale through mainstream marketing channels virtually impossible. 4. 	Agri-environment payments compensate for additional costs and/or income foregone associated with the implementation of the respective measures. But they do not fully take into account negative agricultural externalities and reward farmers for positive externalities by providing them an additional incentive – an extra, above the costs occurred and/or income foregone. 5. 	Very few Macedonian farmers have agricultural or education in nature conservation. A vast majority relies only on practical experience and tradition; and they are not sufficiently aware of the ecosystem services they provide and their value for society as a whole. For most of them farming is not their deliberate choice but an inevitable job – a survival strategy. Many of them are likely to perceive agri-environment as an externally imposed concept that has little to do with their harsh reality and their priorities. Environmental NGOs can help to remove barriers preventing a better uptake of agri-environment programmes The above-mentioned issues are serious obstacles for the enrolment in agri-environment programmes. However, examples from EU Member States facing similar problems, notably Romania, Bulgaria and some Mediterranean countries show that barriers preventing uptake in agri-environment schemes can be removed if a creative approach is applied and social consensus reached. Building farmers’ capacities by providing them various forms of technical and administrative assistance and by setting up an appropriate legislative framework, social/institutional structures and facilities can increase farmers’ participation in agri-environment programmes. The feasibility of establishing various forms and institutional settings for collective agri-environment schemes can be explored. In this case a group of small-scale farmers can jointly apply for agri-environment payments (e. g. by setting up a co-operative or through the help of the municipality, etc). Taking part in a collective agri-environment scheme would not only relieve individual farmers from administrative burdens. It is also likely to be more effective and more profitable. Moreover, in many cases, this might be the only way for small-scale farmers to benefit from agri-environment payments. Environmental NGOs can play a vital role in assisting both farmers and society to understand high-nature value farming and agri-environment programmes. Their members are often well educated, enthusiastic young experts who will potentially over time evolve into opinion leaders and/or decision makers. Environmental NGOs can act as catalysts between farmers, policy makers and society. By increasing understanding, informing and educating various stakeholders they can reinforce farmers’ position and create a win-win situation for all social groups. Environmental NGOs can work on informing both farmers and citizens why it is important to protect biodiversity and how this can benefit them. Protection of biodiversity can only succeed if all stakeholders actively understand and support the conservation vision and objectives set by agri-environment programmes. Policy makers should create an enabling environment for this to happen and NGOs can significantly influence them. However, as policy makers often tend to neglect the needs of small farmers – at the expense of “big producers” – environmental NGOs can act as their guardians and make policy makers and civil society more aware about the "hidden" values they provide. Society often tends to develop an attitude of underestimation towards people living in marginal rural areas. Many people – not only in Macedonia – still think that only “losers” choose to live in these areas, i. e. only those who are not “good” or “competent” enough to find their place elsewhere. The attitude that farming is an occupation chosen by those who are not capable or who are not able to do anything else still prevails today. However, those who have that kind of attitude tend to forget that their economic prosperity and welfare is also due to the hard work of those living in remote rural areas and providing the ecosystem services mentioned in the beginning of this Chapter. Environmental NGOs can lobby to put these kinds of issues higher on the political agenda. Through information dissemination, awareness raising, education, demonstration projects, campaigns, etc., they can enlighten citizens and policy makers about the importance of (agricultural) biodiversity and the ecosystem services provided by marginalised farmers. Besides, NGOs can also serve as watchdogs securing that legislation aiming at protecting agricultural biodiversity is put in place and enforced. Further, NGOs can build networks, coalitions and alliances of like-minded individuals and organizations. They can establish a forum of different yet commonly concerned actors and initiate dialogues across differing perspectives and players. The strengthening of social and human capital in order to ensure a smooth and large-scale uptake of agri-environment measures in Macedonia is a long-term and complex process. It requires understanding and co-operation between relevant stakeholders, a constant exchange of information and capacity building. (Small-scale) Macedonian farmers can continue providing the ecosystem services that are so vital to society only if society is willing to reward them for their hard and honest work. Environmental NGOs are there to help and facilitate that process. This very project has paved the road to a long-lasting partnership between Macedonian farmers, environmental NGOs and policy makers. ...|$|R
