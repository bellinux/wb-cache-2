6000|$|... "I am sorry, Leonard," [...] she said, [...] "but I think I must go and fetch father now. You {{can walk}} with me there, if you will. It has been very <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>again.</b> For the rest I don't {{know what to say}} to you.

6000|$|... "Oh, Diana, it's {{so good to}} be back again. It's so good to {{see those}} pointed firs coming out against the pink sky--and that white orchard and the old Snow Queen.

6000|$|... "It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> Dick," [...] he declared, [...] "like {{coming back}} to the {{primitive}} forces of nature, unchanged, unchanging. The sight of you's enough to stop a revolution." ...|$|R

5000|$|During the Billion Dollar Babies {{tour in the}} 1970s, Alice Cooper {{occasionally}} {{changed a}} line in his song [...] "Dead Babies", which concerns a child overdosing on aspirin to [...] "Little Betty ate a pound of Quaaludes". An instance of this is most readily found in the concert film <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Again,</b> Alice Cooper (1974).|$|E
50|$|A full-length, {{feature film}} of the {{original}} group was also released to the American cinema in 1974: <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Again,</b> Alice Cooper. The concert footage was shot on the Billion Dollar Babies Tour in 1973 and included a fictional story about an angry director seeking revenge against the band shot at Universal Studios in Los Angeles (a scene in the Welcome to My Nightmare concert film, where Alice smashes the neon headstone with a shovel, was also shot during this time). The live concert portion was filmed mostly in Texas (a good deal of which was shot at the Sam Houston Coliseum in Houston, Texas), between the Dallas-Fort Worth Area and Houston. Also appearing in <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Again,</b> Alice Cooper were Bob Dolin, Mick Mashbir and The Amazing Randi; Dolan performed on keyboards, Mashbir on guitar and Randi as the dentist and Alice's executioner.|$|E
50|$|Expanding upon {{creative}} {{input from}} Alice Cooper and Shep Gordon, Gannon {{was responsible for}} turning Cooper's vision into a tangible, three-dimensional nightmare reality of magic and wonderment. These set designs resulted {{in some of the}} most elaborate stage and light presentations of any rock show, setting a new standard in terms of sheer massive size. In 1974, Gannon directed the documentary film, <b>Good</b> <b>To</b> <b>See</b> <b>you</b> <b>Again,</b> Alice Cooper, which was re-released in 2005.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> {{pulling out}} all right," [...] {{answered}} Alfred. [...] "I tell you, I feared {{you were in}} a bad way when I got you out of the water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nell here?' he said cheerfully, as {{he closed}} his book. 'It does me <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> {{in the air and}} light. I feared you were again in the church, where you so often are.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My, Uncle Ebe, but it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again!" [...] she exclaimed, taking {{both his}} dusky {{hands in her}} own and shaking them cordially. [...] "How is Aunt Polly, and how is your 'rheum'tics'?" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Again,</b> Alice Cooper is a 1974 {{feature film}} {{starring}} Alice Cooper. The movie primarily features live concert {{footage of the}} Alice Cooper band on their record-breaking Billion Dollar Babies tour, filmed in Texas (mostly at the Sam Houston Coliseum) in April 1973, with some footage from other tour stops, including the Memorial Coliseum, Portland, Oregon, intercut with 'comedy' scenes of a German film director chasing the [...] "Cooper gang" [...] for revenge after they abandoned his would-be masterpiece movie.|$|E
5000|$|In 1975, Alice Cooper {{released}} his first solo album, Welcome to My Nightmare, {{and a huge}} theatrical stage show was created and put together by Winters to 'tour the album'. Whilst {{in the past the}} Alice Cooper stage show was semi-improvisatory, with confrontational elements of violence and satire (see <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Again,</b> Alice Cooper), the new production was purely horror-themed and professionally choreographed and performed to the split second (Winters had a long history of choreographing and directing big celebrity films, stage and TV shows starring in the cast of West Side Story and choreographing 4 films with Elvis Presley and 5 films with Ann-Margret). With the edginess removed (gone were the bloody guillotine, the spit and the skewered baby dolls, although [...] "Only Women Bleed" [...] presented a drunken, physically abusive side to the character), the Welcome to My Nightmare show was part a carefully planned move toward a more mainstream-friendly 'Alice'.|$|E
5000|$|During this time, Cooper {{relocated}} back to Los Angeles {{and started}} appearing regularly on television {{shows such as}} The Hollywood Squares, and Warner Bros. released the Alice Cooper's Greatest Hits compilation album. It featured classic-style artwork and reached the US Top 10, performing better than Muscle of Love. However, the band's 1974 feature film <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>Again,</b> Alice Cooper (consisting mainly of 1973 concert footage with 'comedic' sketches woven throughout to a faint storyline), released on a minor cinematic run mostly to drive-in theaters, saw little box-office success. On March 5, 1974, Cooper appeared on episode 3 of [...] The Snoop Sisters playing a Satanic cult singer. The final shows by Alice Cooper as a group were in Brazil in March and April 1974, including the record indoor attendance estimated as high as 158,000 fans in São Paulo on March 30, at the Anhembi Exposition Hall {{at the start of}} the first ever South American rock tour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very much indeed, sir. I {{happened}} to remark only {{the other day}} that the place didn't seem the same without your happy laugh. It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> back once more, looking so well and merry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now eat {{every one}} of them," [...] she said, as she handed them to Toby, [...] "an' it will do me <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> for you always used {{to be such a}} hungry little fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{economic}} agent swept {{her up and}} down. [...] "It's a pleasure to look at you. You've got quite a colour, for you. After all, I believe it MIGHT do her <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> Come in!" ...|$|R
