This was done to decrease the fire rate slightly, but not significantly enough to lower it any less than 600 rounds per minute (RPM). The U-shaped receiver is stamped from a smooth 1.5 mm sheet of steel (compared to the 1.0 mm sheet metal receiver used on the standard AKM rifles. It uses a modified AKM recoil spring assembly, that consists of a rear spring guide rod from the AK and a new forward <b>flat</b> <b>guide</b> rod and coil spring. It features a thick laminated wood foregrip, and a fixed laminated wood [...] "club-foot" [...] buttstock, similar to the stock used on the RPD, {{which is designed to}} allow the user to fire from the prone position more comfortably. It uses a standard AKM pistol grip and can also use standard AKM detachable box magazines, but it is most commonly used with a 40-round box magazine or a 75-round drum magazine. Interchangeability of parts between the RPK and AKM are moderate.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} concept of a {{near-field}} lens capable of reliably imaging deep-subwavelength objects {{at a distance of}} several times the thickness of the lens. Nearly <b>flat</b> <b>guided</b> modes in a high-index dielectric slab are shown to propagate information of evanescent waves emanating from the imaged object, thus providing the degree of detail needed to map fine spatial variations. A practical way of implementing the proposed flat lens is theoretically demonstrated using closely packed metal nanoparticles giving rise to large effective permittivities in the spectral region right to the red of the plasma frequency. We perform rigorous electromagnetic simulations showing that realistic absorption levels in the metal are still compatible with deep-subwavelength spatial resolution. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

40|$|Thermal-hydraulic {{analysis}} of the active part of the MEGAPIE target has been performed using the CFX 4. 3 code. Three types of geometric configurations, i. e. with a <b>flat</b> <b>guide</b> tube, with a slanted guide tube and with an injection bypass are investigated with the main emphasis on the coolability of the beam window and the heat removal from the active part of the target. In the target with a <b>flat</b> <b>guide</b> tube flow stagnation occurs in the region near the window center. This leads to an excessive hot spot on the window surface. To improve the coolability of the window, two methods are proposed. By the first method {{the lower end of}} the inner cylinder is cut with an inclined cross section. In this way, the axis-symmetry of the flow is destroyed and the flow stagnation zone near the window center is reduced. However, the improvement of heat transfer is insufficient to keep the window temperature below the design value. The second method is to introduce a bypass injection to remove the flow stagnation zone from the window center region. Two different kinds of bypass tubes are considered, i. e. a rectangular tube and a circular tube. A systematic parameter study has been performed for the configuration with a rectangular bypass tube. Based on the numerical results, optimum values of some geometric parameters (i. e. position and size of the bypass tube) as well as of flow rate can be obtained. Preliminary calculations for the target with a circular bypass tube show very promising results. With a simple circular bypass tube, the beam window can be cooled sufficiently. Nevertheless, further detailed numerical studies are necessary to optimize the design parameters. The numerical calculations have to be backed up by model experiments, using both water and lead-bismuth as fluids. (orig.)

40|$|Vertical axial {{cross flow}} type of wind {{turbines}} {{are considered to}} have superior characters {{in comparison with the}} conventional propeller type of HAWT, especially in combined with outer static guide vanes. One benefit is to operate for all directions of the wind without the mechanism of yaw drive systems, which lead to simple structures and low costs. Others are the safety against the dangerous rotating body and the considerable increasing the output because of having the outer static guide vanes installed, subsequently be suitable for setting to the park/street for small units. In this paper, aerodynamic performance characteristics of the cross flow type of wind turbine combined with outer static guide vanes were studied experimentally by small scale model under the condition of open-type wind tunnel restricted with max wind stream velocity 4. 5 m/s and outlet duct 2 ̆ 7 s dia. 0. 88 mφ. The free stream velocity at the outlet of the wind tunnel was regulated from 0. 8 ∿ 4. 5 m/s by a 1200 mm dia. propeller driven by a 400 W inverter controlled induction motor. The mechanism of the cross flow model employed in this experiment are involved the rotor with 0. 32 mφ dia. and 0. 3 m wide comprised of flat and curved plate blades with pitch angle 60 degree and the number Z= 8 / 16 and the length 1 = 40 ∿ 80 mm, and static <b>flat</b> <b>guide</b> vanes with outer and inner dia. 0. 64 mφ and 0. 32 mφ, setting angle 30 degree and the number Z= 8.

40|$|A {{development}} project {{was carried out}} at DESY, aimed at reducing secondary electron emission and multipactor effects in TESLA couplers by TiN layers generation on surfaces which were not protected in this way previously. Thin TiN films on ceramic or metallic surfaces were produced by deposition from Ti vapor in low pressure ammonia. Selection of processing parameters and their effect on multipactor suppression in RF field have been studied using a multipactor test resonator at DESY. Appropriate values of deposition rate, substrate temperature, final layer thickness and chemical conversion procedure were selected. A significant reduction of multipactor time during RF tests was reached due to surface coating. Chemical analysis of TiN layers on both ceramic and metallic substrates has been performed using SIMS method. TiN coating of more than 80 wave guide and cylindrical RF windows were performed for TTF 2, TTF 3 and TTF 4 versions of TESLA couplers. Surface processing of <b>flat</b> wave <b>guide</b> windows for TTF 2 resulted in significant reduction of multipactor effects and improvement of power transmission. Their good performance remained unchanged after 24 -hour exposition to air. TiN coating of all vacuum-facing surfaces of TTF 2 coupler led to reduction of the indispensable RF conditioning time from typically 3 days down to 4 - 6 hours. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Flat {{conveyor}} belts supported and driven by cylindrical drums {{run in a}} state of instability because of lack of guiding forces. Faults such as asymmetry in the position or shape of pulleys and idlers, uneven load distribution or acting transverse forces such as those induced by friction will make the belt run out of true.

This paper deals with the guiding effects of two significant features; the skewed cylindrical pulley and the conical pulley. In the first part the implemented measurements are described and in the second part a mechanical model is established for both features.

40|$|Light {{has always}} {{been used as a}} means of communication. As early as in the 4 th century B. C. a {{hydraulic}} telegraph that was used in combination with fires has been developed by the Greeks. In 1821 Carl Friedrich Gauss invented heliotrope – an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight over great distances. Nowadays, light impulses travel on the principle of total reflection between materials of different density, inside round cross-section acrylic fibers—light guides—and are protected from inclement weather conditions and other disturbances from the surroundings.  The result of such light transportation can be indirect – a transmission of data, or direct – a transmission of light with the purpose of illumination. Light that exits {{at the end of an}} optic fiber is usually formed as a point, as a line or, in our case, as a luminous surface. Light can also be intercepted on its way through a <b>flat</b> light <b>guide,</b> through a special surface treatment. Textures on the surface of sheets of acrylic glass form panels of either uniform or various brightness. Such panels can assume the role of the elements of an architectural luminous ambience.  Transmission and reflectivity is also investigated, theoretical and practical, using light measurements on a physical model in order to show that luminous panels can also be used as floors/ceilings in multi-storey buildings in order to improve natural illumination and thus to reduce the cost of electrical lighting. Findings in the paper can bring useful information for architects, lighting designers and structural engineers...|$|R
