25|$|The Challenger 1 {{accelerated}} {{its course}} {{in an attempt}} to allow journalists on board to broadcast their photos of the ongoing raid. The ship was intercepted by two Israeli speedboats and a helicopter, and carried out evasion tactics, forcing the Israelis to pursue it for a considerable distance. According to passengers, at least one stun grenade was launched at the Challenger 1 before it was boarded. Passengers on the decks formed a human chain to block the path of the troops. Soldiers opened fire with paintball guns and rubber and plastic bullets as they boarded the vessel, lightly injuring two female demonstrators. Once on board, the Israelis moved towards the fly bridge. The soldiers encountered verbal abuse, and attempts were made to shove soldiers. Some activists barricaded themselves in cabins. Activist Huwaida Arraf reported that Israeli soldiers attacked those who tried to block them with kicks, tasers, and concussion grenades, and that some people were beaten so severely that they had to be hospitalized. Arraf said that the Israelis smashed <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> the ground and stepped on it, and that they later handcuffed her and put a bag over her head. Another woman similarly had a bag placed over her head. First mate Shane Dillon reported that Israeli troops broke the nose of a Belgian woman and beat another passenger. Australian photojournalist Kate Geraghty was tasered while attempting to photograph the raid. Upon entering the bridge, the troops were met with no resistance.|$|E
60|$|His wife gave {{a little}} groan and sank <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> his leg.|$|E
60|$|With {{that she}} turned <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> {{the wall and}} Finnward left her.|$|E
60|$|Margaret's hand clenched and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> sank <b>against</b> the window-pane.|$|R

6000|$|Then Nan, {{as simple}} in her love as in her life, laid her arms about his neck, <b>her</b> happy <b>face</b> <b>against</b> his own, and {{answered}} softly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|She {{drew the}} hand {{up as she}} spoke, and laid <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> it.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly she hid <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> his {{shoulder}} with perplexity and shyness. He lay so untrammelled.|$|E
60|$|This was her {{moment to}} protest; {{but she was}} silent, with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|And {{with this}} Parthian shot she {{returned}} to Mistress Thankful, who, with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> pressed <b>against</b> the window, was looking out on the moonlit slope beside the Whippany River.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{reason for}} my loving you, Dick," [...] she said softly, with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> close <b>against</b> his, [...] "is {{that you are}} brave enough to take this generous part!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{always said}} you had Annette Kellerman beat a mile," [...] Billy said; and so proud was his air of {{possession}} that Saxon blushed and trembled, and hid <b>her</b> hot <b>face</b> <b>against</b> his breast.|$|R
60|$|And in {{the same}} moment she was in his arms, and sobbing with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> his.|$|E
60|$|She hid <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> {{his breast}} for an instant, {{and then looked}} at him again, gladly radiant.|$|E
60|$|She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, {{flattening}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> the pane in {{a halo of}} hurried breath.|$|E
60|$|At last, {{when her}} broken voice had trailed away into gentle catchings of the breath, the older woman, {{knowing that the}} time come for comfort, took her in her strong arms, holding <b>her</b> <b>face</b> wet <b>against</b> <b>her</b> own, their tears mingling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{how good}} you are!" [...] The fingers folded themselves, and her arms {{weakened}} {{so that there was}} nothing to keep him from drawing her to him. [...] "What--what are you doing?" [...] she asked, with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> smothered <b>against</b> his.|$|R
60|$|Five minutes later, Mrs. Weber reÃ«ntered the room, {{bringing}} the princess clad {{in her own}} garments, and the little maid ran with outstretched arms to Joe, pressing <b>her</b> tear-stained <b>face</b> <b>against</b> his cheek {{in such a manner}} as went straight to his heart.|$|R
6000|$|He {{remained}} in silence; and seeing how discomfited he was she put <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> his cheek, murmuring, [...] "Don't be vexed, dear!" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{she slipped}} across to him, {{put her arms}} round him, sank on her knees at his side, and sank <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> his thigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish they}} all {{would not go}} so very fast," [...] said little Lena, hiding <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> him from the whirl of cabs and omnibuses.|$|E
60|$|Intuition had not deceived her. Ruth {{had gone}} over to the enemy. She was in Kirk's arms, holding him to <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> hidden <b>against</b> his shoulder, {{for all the world}} as if Lora Delane Porter, her guiding force, had ceased to exist.|$|R
6000|$|Her {{eyes closed}} on her hot tears, her head drooped, and Ben, putting his arm about {{her neck and}} {{pressing}} <b>her</b> quivering <b>face</b> <b>against</b> his breast, reproached her very tenderly: [...] "I won't let you say such things, dearest--you must not! You're not yourself to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sidney {{turned away}} and hid <b>her</b> burning <b>face</b> <b>against</b> the cool white bark of the birch tree behind her. It was worse than she had even thought it would be. He was so handsome, so manly, so earnest-eyed! Oh, what a friend to lose! ...|$|R
6000|$|When, {{with only}} Annis following, the {{chambers}} had been reached, Eleanor let herself sink on a cushion, hiding <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> her friend, and sobbing hysterically-- ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{lifted her}} face, and looked with eyes of {{laughing}} malice into Annie's, and Annie pushed <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> Idella's neck and cried, [...] "You're a rogue!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said he couldn't stand it; {{he told me}} that. But I never thought--Oh! Poor man!" [...] And, burying <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> his arm, {{she gave}} way.|$|E
60|$|Lane watched her. How the shapely hands trembled. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> shone white <b>against</b> <b>her</b> dark furs. Lane {{helped her}} {{put on the}} overshoes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] he said, {{pressing}} <b>her</b> little <b>face</b> <b>against</b> {{his breast}} {{as if she}} were an infant. [...] "It is bereavement that has brought you to this! Such remorse is not for you, my sensitive plant, but for the wicked ones of the earth--who never feel it!" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was a great}} shout {{from the}} other side of the cabin, and in the gloom she saw {{something}} spring up and come towards her. Something which caught her in a mighty grasp and crushed <b>her</b> soft <b>face</b> <b>against</b> a long, stiff beard. Laughing and crying together she put her arms about its neck and clung to it convulsively.|$|R
60|$|Meantime Aylward {{had found}} his own rough means of consoling {{the woman in the}} road, who stood sobbing with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> the side of Pommers' saddle.|$|E
6000|$|Poor fellow! Jaquetta flung {{herself on}} him, hiding <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> him, while the {{servants}} went, and before any {{one else could}} speak, Hester stood forth, and said, to our amazement-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{was white}} as the snow, but well, my father. They passed quite close to me, and looking up from where I lay hid I saw <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>against</b> the sky.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He moved a {{step towards}} her, and she stepped back, <b>her</b> white <b>face</b> {{struggled}} <b>against</b> him and resisted him. [...] "No," [...] she gasped. [...] "I cannot bear--. Go now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've a {{deep voice}} for my age and size,' she explained. 'Contralto, you know, but {{it ought to be}} stronger,' and she began, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> all dark <b>against</b> the last of the soft pink sunset: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now I'm safe; {{thank you}} very much. Won't you come in, and stay all night? My mother {{will be glad to}} see you,' said the kit rubbing <b>her</b> soft white <b>face</b> <b>against</b> Blot's little black breast.|$|R
