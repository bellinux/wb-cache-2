Generally, the order that the <b>distributor</b> places at the manufacturer is larger than that the retailer places at the <b>distributor.</b> In order to afford this large order, there should exist a long-term supply contract between the manufacturer and <b>distributor</b> that can guarantee a stationary supply to the <b>distributor.</b> This paper discusses this case, and derives the optimal stationary supply, that is, the optimal ordering policy of the <b>distributor.</b> Also computational results are presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of the <b>distributor</b> configuration on interphase mass transfer, gas axial dispersion and bubble size was studied in a 2 -D fluidised bed reactor for two types of <b>distributor</b> configurations; a novel multi-vortex (MV) <b>distributor</b> with tuyéres directed vertically and horizontally at different heights and a standard perforated plate <b>distributor</b> (baseline). The linear inlet velocity (U 0) ranged between 0. 1 m/s and 0. 35 m/s, with air as fluidising medium at ambient conditions.
