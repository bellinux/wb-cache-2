6000|$|There {{is in the}} {{interior}} of the turtle a quantity <b>of</b> yellow <b>fat,</b> which is said to be superior in delicacy to the <b>fat</b> <b>of</b> the <b>goose,</b> and from which is obtained a fine oil, highly prized as an article of commerce. To secure this fat, the animals which had been [...] "turned" [...] were killed at daylight the following morning. The axes of the Indians caused the shells to fly in splinters; the intestines were then torn out and handed to the Indian women, whose duty it was to remove from them the precious fat, after which the carcasses were left to the vultures and fisher-eagles, which flocked from afar to the scene of carnage with that unerring instinct which has so often been commented on by travellers, but which no one can understand.|$|R

25|$|The Swedish word smörgåsbord {{consists}} of the words smörgås (sandwich, usually open-faced) and bord (table). Smörgås in turn {{consists of}} the words smör (butter, cognate with English smear) and gås. Gås literally means goose, but later referred to the small pieces of butter that formed and floated {{to the surface of}} cream while it was churned. These pieces reminded the old Swedish peasants <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> <b>geese</b> swimming to the surface. The small butter pieces were just the right size to be placed and flattened out on bread, so smörgås came to mean buttered bread. In Sweden, the term att breda smörgåsar (to spread butter on open-faced sandwiches) has been used since at least the 16th century.|$|R
60|$|It was a warm, {{sunny day}} in the fall, as I said; yet as we drew near the Ghetto, we noticed in the air many white, {{floating}} particles, like lazy, straggling flakes of snow. These we afterward {{found to be the}} down <b>of</b> multitudes <b>of</b> <b>geese,</b> which are forever plucked by the whole apparent force <b>of</b> the populace,--the <b>fat</b> <b>of</b> the devoted birds being substituted for lard in the kitchens of the Ghetto, and their flesh for pork. As we approached the obscene little riva at which we landed, a blond young Israelite, lavishly adorned with feathers, came running to know if we wished to see the church--by which name he put the synagogue to the Gentile comprehension. The street through which we passed had shops on either hand, and at the doors groups of jocular Hebrew youth sat plucking geese; while within, long files of all that was mortal <b>of</b> <b>geese</b> hung from the rafters and the walls. The ground was webbed with the feet <b>of</b> <b>geese,</b> and certain loutish boys, who paused to look at us, had each a goose dragging at his heels, in the forlorn and elongated manner peculiar to dead poultry. The ground was stained with the blood <b>of</b> <b>geese,</b> and the smell <b>of</b> roasting <b>geese</b> came out <b>of</b> the windows of the grim and lofty houses.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{histological}} and histochemical analyze of musculus pectoralis major (MPM) and musculus biceps femoris (MBF) of 12 -weeks old Landes geese husbandry by sex from Hruboňovo (Czech Republic). The geese had live weight of 3979. 0 [*]g and the ganders had live weight of 4779. 0 [*]g. Higher α White fiber percentage representation of musculus pectoralis major and musculus biceps femoris of 12 -weeks old Landes geese histological analyses we followed. Representation of sex identical MBF was 60. 0 % (gander) and 64. 1 % (geese) and MPM was 47. 6 % (ganders) and 51. 1 % (geese). The lowest α Red fibre percentage content in MPM was 6. 7 % (ganders) and 4. 7 % (geese) and β Red fiber in MBF was 10. 7 % (ganders) and 9. 5 % (geese). No statistically significant differences (P ≥ 0, 05) among sex in the <b>fat</b> cells thickness <b>of</b> <b>geese</b> were found, but significant differences (P ≤ 0, 01) was found in MBF fat cells between ganders (26. 3 [*]μm) and geese (21. 9 μm). Highest thickness of α White fibre in muscles breast and femoral were found in both sex and lowest was found in β Red fibre. Muscles fibres thickness was higher femoral muscles in average (59. 9 [*]μm – ganders; 58. 3 [*]μm – geese) opposite breast muscles (47. 7 [*]μm – ganders, 44. 9 [*]μm – geese), what is the mean higher consistence of femoral muscles for consumer. In term of lowest musculus fiber thickness <b>of</b> Landes <b>geese</b> in average were 44. 9 [*]μm – MPM, 58. 3 [*]μm – MBF opposite of ganders 47. 7 [*]μm – MPM, 59. 9 [*]μm – MBF. Higher α White fibre representation was both muscles (51. 1 % – MPM, 64. 1 % – MBF). We recommended for experience used in­di­vi­dual rearing of male...|$|R

40|$|Interferon γ {{receptor}} 1 (IFNGR 1) and IFNGR 2 are two {{cell membrane}} molecules belonging to class II cytokines, which play {{important roles in}} the IFN-mediated antiviral signaling pathway. Here, goose IFNGR 1 and IFNGR 2 were cloned and identified for the first time. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that relatively high levels <b>of</b> <b>goose</b> IFNγ mRNA transcripts were detected in immune tissues, including the harderian gland, cecal tonsil, cecum, and thymus. Relatively high expression levels of both IFNGR 1 and IFNGR 2 were detected in the cecal tonsil, which implicated an important role of IFNγ in the secondary immune system <b>of</b> <b>geese.</b> No specific correlation between IFNγ, IFNGR 1, and IFNGR 2 expression levels was observed in the same tissues <b>of</b> healthy <b>geese.</b> IFNγ and its cognate receptors showed different expression profiles, although they appeared to maintain a relatively balanced state. Furthermore, the agonist R 848 led to the upregulation <b>of</b> <b>goose</b> IFNγ but {{did not affect the}} expression <b>of</b> <b>goose</b> IFNGR 1 or IFNGR 2. In summary, trends in expression <b>of</b> <b>goose</b> IFNγ and its cognate receptors showed tissue specificity, as well as an age-related dependency.
