2500|$|All Gibson P-90 pickups (vintage and otherwise) were machine {{wound on}} Leesona coil winding machines, {{although}} their <b>electrical</b> <b>specifications</b> may vary slightly due to operator error. In common {{with many other}} modern pickup types, there are two versions of modern P-90: neck and bridge version. Their DC resistance tends to be around 7-8 kΩ for neck pickups and 8-9 kΩ for bridge pickups. Early P-90 pickups made before approx. 1974 were manufactured with {{no difference in the}} bridge and neck position and were interchangeable. After winding, pickups were hung on a rack holding 20 pickups and assembled according to the model of guitar they were to be used on (Soap-Bar or Dog Ear). [...] Earlier pickups (around 1952) had Alnico 3 magnets, but in 1957 Gibson switched to Alnico 5.|$|E

40|$|There are {{virtually}} no electronic products today that can {{comply with the}} conducted emission regulatory requirements {{without the use of}} some form of power supply filter being inserted where the power cord exits the product. Sometimes, properly designed transformers can provide inherent filtering, and so can obviate the need for an intentional filter. Mains EMI (electromagnetic interference) filters carry potentially high currents at dangerously high voltages, so care is essential in their choice. The working voltage and current rating of components can be decided once the specification is known. The basic specification should also include mechanical details such as the enclosure size, and the limit of weight. The <b>electrical</b> <b>specification</b> should include the voltage and current rating. In addition the EMC performance and the allowable leakage current should be specified. The <b>electrical</b> <b>specification</b> must also comply with national safety standards.

50|$|The {{electrical}} characteristics of DMX512 cable are specified {{in terms of}} impedance and capacitance, although there are often mechanical and other considerations that must be considered as well. Cable types that are appropriate for DMX512 usage will have a nominal characteristic impedance of 120 ohms. Cat5 cable, commonly used for networking and telecommunications, has been tested by ESTA for use with DMX512A. Also, cables designed for EIA485 typically meet the DMX512 <b>electrical</b> <b>specifications.</b> Conversely, microphone and line level audio cables lack the requisite {{electrical characteristics}} and thus are not suitable for DMX512 cabling. The significantly lower impedance and higher capacitance of these cables distort the DMX512 digital waveforms, which in turn can cause irregular operation or intermittent errors {{that are difficult to}} identify and correct.|$|E

40|$|In an {{electro-mechanical}} integration {{system where}} loads {{consist of a}} mechanical system, the <b>electrical</b> system <b>specification</b> and configuration {{will depend on the}} mechanical system. Therefore, inaccurate parameters of the mechanical system will make difficult the selection of <b>electrical</b> system <b>specification</b> and the effective controller design. Of these, the controller design often adopts an experimental method [12] or a method using numerical analysis [13]. With such methods, however, it is difficult to predict the actual system in advance followed by specification selection and controller design. Hence, to perform a faster and more accurate modeling of the system, a collaborative analysis is required for two physically different systems in a virtual space. In the present article, a method of an electro-mechanical collaborative analysis is proposed for an elevator door drive system. From mechanical load modeling using simulation, an <b>electrical</b> requirement <b>specification</b> has been derived. In addition, a C++-based collaboration program has been developed that can connect mutually different physical domains according to the proposed collaborative analysis procedures.
