50|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>treadle</b> {{uses the}} {{disruption}} of an electromagnetic field to detect an axle, rather than a depression bar. Hence, it can count individual axles. Electronic count heads are used in axle counter circuits that can replace track circuits completely.|$|E
50|$|Vehicle {{detection}} loops, called inductive-loop traffic detectors, {{can detect}} vehicles passing or {{arriving at a}} certain point, for instance approaching a traffic light or in motorway traffic. An insulated, electrically conducting loop is installed in the pavement. The electronics unit transmits energy into the wire loops at frequencies between 10 kHz to 200 kHz, depending on the model. The inductive-loop system behaves as a tuned electrical circuit in which the loop wire and lead-in cable are the inductive elements. When a vehicle passes over the loop or is stopped within the loop, the vehicle induces eddy currents in the wire loops, which decrease their inductance. The decreased inductance actuates the electronics unit output relay or solid-state optically isolated output, which sends a pulse to the traffic signal controller signifying the passage or presence of a vehicle. Parking structures for automobiles may use inductive loops to track traffic (occupancy) in and out or may be used by access gates or ticketing systems to detect vehicles while others use Parking guidance and information systems. Railways may use an induction loop to detect the passage of trains past a given point, as an <b>electronic</b> <b>treadle.</b>|$|E
