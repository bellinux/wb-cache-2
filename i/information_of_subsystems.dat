40|$|Abstract â€” For {{interconnected}} systems and systems of large size, aggregating <b>information</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsystems</b> studied individually {{is useful for}} addressing the overall stability. In the Lyapunov-based analysis, summation and maximization of separately constructed functions are two typical approaches in such a philosophy. This paper focuses on monotone systems which are common in control applications and elucidates some fun-damental limitations of max-separable Lyapunov functions in estimating domains of attractions. This paper presents several methods of constructing sum- and max-separable Lyapunov functions for second order monotone systems, and some com-parative discussions are given through illustrative examples.

40|$|We {{consider}} the Shannon mutual <b>information</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsystems</b> of critical quantum chains in their ground states. Our results indicate a universal leading behavior for large subsystem sizes. Moreover, as {{happens with the}} entanglement entropy, its finite-size behavior yields the conformal anomaly $c$ of the underlying conformal field theory governing the long distance physics of the quantum chain. We studied analytically a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators and numerically the Q-state Potts models ($Q = 2 $; 3 and 4), the XXZ quantum chain and the spin- 1 Fateev-Zamolodchikov model. The Shannon mutual information is a quantity easily computed, and our results indicate that for relatively small lattice sizes its finite-size behavior already detects the universality class of quantum critical behavior.

40|$|G. Edelman, O. Sporns, and G. Tononi {{introduced}} in theoretical biology the neural complexity {{of a family}} of random variables. This functional is a special case of intricacy, i. e., an average of the mutual <b>information</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsystems</b> whose weights have good mathematical properties. Moreover, its maximum value grows at a definite speed with the size of the system. In this work, we compute exactly this speed of growth by building "approximate maximizers" subject to an entropy condition. These approximate maximizers work simultaneously for all intricacies. We also establish some properties of arbitrary approximate maximizers, in particular the existence of a threshold in the size of subsystems of approximate maximizers: most smaller subsystems are almost equidistributed, most larger subsystems determine the full system. The main ideas are a random construction of almost maximizers with a high statistical symmetry and the consideration of entropy profiles, i. e., the average entropies of sub-systems of a given size. The latter gives rise to interesting questions of probability and information theory...|$|E

40|$|Today, we are {{witnessing}} more distributed systems on enterprise networks and on the Internet.

40|$|A new {{decentralized}} {{learning control}} scheme for tracking control of robot manipulators {{is presented in}} this paper. In this scheme, each joint is considered as a subsystem and controlled independently. The interactions from other subsystems are treated as deterministic uncertainties. The desired trajectory and the output <b>of</b> each <b>subsystem</b> are reparametrized by Fourier series (FS). A learning controller designed in Fourier space regulates each harmonic component individually by forcing Fourier coefficients (FCs) of the actual output approach to the corresponding FCs of the desired trajectory which are known constants. Since the <b>information</b> <b>of</b> the system phase-delay is included in FCs, the time-delay of the system can be easily compensated. The learning controller only uses the input and output <b>information</b> <b>of</b> the <b>subsystem,</b> no a priori knowledge about the system models is required. The asymptotic convergence of the tracking is proved in the paper. The experimental results on 3 -DOF direct-drive robot show that convergent rate is faster compared with many other learning controllers {{and the performance of}} the closed-loop system is dramatically improved...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the functional requirement for an In-Vehicle Information System (IVIS), which will manage and display all driving-related information from many sources. There are numerous information systems currently being fielded or developed (e. g., routing and navigation, collision avoidance). However, without a logical integration {{of all of}} the possible on-board information, there is a potential for overwhelming the driver. The system described in this paper will filter and prioritize information across all sources, and present it to the driver in a timely manner, within a unified interface. To do this, IVIS will perform three general functions: (1) interact with other, on-board information subsystems and the vehicle; (2) manage the information by filtering, prioritizing, and integrating it; and (3) interact with the driver, both in terms <b>of</b> displaying <b>information</b> to the driver and allowing the driver to input requests, goals and preferences.

40|$|Large {{systems are}} often {{constructed}} using small subsystems which are connected. These interconnections {{can lead to}} complex behavior; for example, the entire system may become unstable even if each <b>of</b> the individual <b>subsystems</b> are stable by themselves. The unstable systems can be stabilized {{with the use of}} a shared feedback controller. The effects <b>of</b> one <b>subsystem</b> on the state <b>of</b> other <b>subsystems</b> (coupling) can be reduced if each subsystem has access to the state <b>information</b> <b>of</b> the <b>subsystems</b> that are affecting its state. However, this solution requires communication between the controller and the subsystems and between subsystems. If there are limited communication resources, management of this resource is also required. Hence there is a need for a scheduling policy that specifies which subsystem should use the communication resource at any given time. We start our formulation by first investigating systems that contain only stable subsystems. If the connected system is unstable due to coupling, the system cannot be scheduled. Therefore, we first proceed to extend previous work on stability of connected systems in order to formulate computationally efficient schedulability checks for these systems. We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for certain topologies and results for scalar systems that are dependent on the number <b>of</b> <b>subsystems.</b> Then we proceed to formulate a centralized scheduling policy based on results of connective stability. Here we constrain ourselves to first studying systems with only a single communication resource that restricts only one subsystem to transmit its state in a given time slot. We study the best input a subsystem may apply once it has knowledge of the state <b>of</b> another <b>subsystem</b> that is affecting its state. We also provide evidence from simulations to support the performance increase in using the proposed algorithm. Finally, we extend these results to formulate a decentralized scheduling policy that supports multiple communication resources. We also analyze a possible way of improving the scheduling policy using similarity transformations and show that such a methodology does not guarantee performance improvement and in-fact may lead to worse performance...|$|R
40|$|Power {{is one of}} the todayâ€™s major {{constraints}} {{for both}} hardware and software design. Thus the need to understand the statistics and distribution of power consumption from a hardware and software perspective is high. Power models satisfy this requirement to a certain extent, by estimating the power consumption for a subset of applications, or by providing a detailed power consumption distribution of a system. Till date, many power models have been proposed for the desktop and mobile platforms. However, most of these models were created based on power measurements performed on the entire system when different microbenchmarks stressing different blocks of the system were run. Then the measured power and the profiled <b>information</b> <b>of</b> the <b>subsystem</b> stressing benchmarks were used to create a regression analysis based model. Here, the power/energy prediction accuracy of the models created in this way, depend on both the method and accuracy of the power measurements and the type of regression used in generating the model. This work tries to eliminate the dependency of the accuracy of the power models on the type of regression analysis used, by performing power measurements at a subsystem granularity. When the power measurement <b>of</b> a single <b>subsystem</b> is obtained while stressing it, one can know the exact power it is consuming, instead of obtaining the power consumption of the entire system - without knowing the power consumption <b>of</b> the <b>subsystem</b> <b>of</b> interest - and depending on the regression analysis to provide the answer.

40|$|There are two {{complementary}} {{approaches to}} realizing quantum information {{so that it}} is protected from a given set of error operators. Both involve encoding <b>information</b> by means <b>of</b> <b>subsystems.</b> One is initialization-based error protection, which involves a quantum operation that is applied before error events occur. The other is operator quantum error correction, which uses a recovery operation applied after the errors. Together, the two approaches make it clear how quantum information can be stored at all stages of a process involving alternating error and quantum operations. In particular, there is always a subsystem that faithfully represents the desired quantum information. We give a definition of faithful realization <b>of</b> quantum <b>information</b> and show that it always involves subsystems. This justifies the "subsystems principle" for realizing quantum information. In the presence of errors, one can make use of noiseless, (initialization) protectable, or error-correcting subsystems. We give an explicit algorithm for finding optimal noiseless subsystems. Finding optimal protectable or error-correcting subsystems is in general difficult. Verifying that a subsystem is error-correcting involves only linear algebra. We discuss the verification problem for protectable subsystems and reduce it to a simpler version of the problem of finding error-detecting codes. Comment: 17 page...|$|R
