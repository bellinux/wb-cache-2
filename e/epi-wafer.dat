40|$|Abstract. The {{epitaxial}} growth of thick multi-layer 4 H-SiC to fabricate very high-voltage C-face n-channel IGBTs is demonstrated using 3 -inch diameter wafers. We employ an inverted-growth process, which enables the on-state voltage of resultant IGBTs to be reduced. Furthermore a long minority carrier lifetime (> 10 µs) and a low-resistance p+ epilayer {{can reduce the}} forward {{voltage drop of the}} IGBTs. The small forward voltage drop is demonstrated particularly at high temperatures by fabricating and characterizing simple pin diodes using the <b>epi-wafer...</b>|$|E

30|$|The <b>epi-wafers</b> of InGaN/GaN blue LEDs {{were grown}} on a c-face (0001) {{sapphire}} substrate {{by using a}} metal-organic chemical vapor deposition system. The device structure consists of a GaN buffer layer grown at a low temperature, a highly Si-doped n-type GaN layer, an InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) active region, and an Mg-doped p-type GaN layer. The ITO was deposited on the p-type GaN layer as a transparent conductive layer to spread the injection current. The wafer was then patterned using the standard photolithographic process to define square mesas as the emitting regions by partially etching the exposed ITO/p-GaN/InGaN/GaN MQWs/n-GaN. A Ti/Pt/Au alloy {{was used as the}} ohmic contact metal on the p- and n-GaN contact regions, and the wafer was then alloyed in an N 2 atmosphere for 5  min at 450  °C. The size of the emission window for the InGaN/GaN LEDs with ITO was 300  ×  300  μm 2. The finished wafer was placed in the PS NSs suspension to deposit the compact PS NS array on ITO layer.|$|R

40|$|Manga (Manufacturable GaN: SiC {{substrates}} and GaN {{epi wafers}} supply chain) is a five nations (Germany, France, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom) program performed {{under the umbrella}} of the European Defense Agency (EDA).

30|$|In this study, we {{have grown}} 380 -nm {{ultraviolet}} light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) based on InGaN/AlInGaN multiple quantum well (MQW) structures on free-standing GaN (FS-GaN) substrate by atmospheric pressure metal-organic {{chemical vapor deposition}} (AP-MOCVD), and investigated the relationship between carrier localization degree and FS-GaN. The micro-Raman shift peak mapping image shows low standard deviation (STD), indicating that the UV-LED <b>epi-wafer</b> of low curvature and MQWs of weak quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) were grown. High-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) analyses demonstrated high-order satellite peaks and clear fringes between them for the UV-LEDs grown on the FS-GaN substrate, from which the interface roughness (IRN) was estimated. The temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurement confirmed that the UV-LEDs grown on the FS-GaN substrate exhibited better carrier confinement. Besides, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping images verified that the UV-LEDs on FS-GaN have fairly uniform distribution of indium and more ordered InGaN/AlInGaN MQW structure. Clearly, the FS-GaN can not only improve the light output power but also reduce the efficiency droop phenomenon at high injection current. Based on the results mentioned above, the FS-GaN can offer UV-LEDs based on InGaN/AlInGaN MQW structures with benefits, such as high crystal quality and small carrier localization degree, compared with the UV-LEDs on sapphire.|$|E
40|$|Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) is a {{versatile}} technique for growing epitaxial thin films of semiconductors and metals by impinging molecular beams of atoms onto a heated substrate under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Growth conditions can be monitored in real-time {{with the help}} of Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) technique. The period of one RHEED oscillation corresponds exactly to the growth of one monolayer of atoms of the semiconductor material. Therefore it is crucial to dynamically monitor the oscillation rate in order to precisely control the epitaxial thin film growth to the monolayer accuracy. In this paper, a LabVIEW program is developed that would form the basis of a real-time control system that would transform MBE into a true-production technology. The PCI- 1409 frame grabber card supplied by National Instruments is used in conjunction with the LabVIEW software to capture the RHEED images and capture the intensity of RHEED oscillations. The intensity values are written to a text file and plotted {{in the form of a}} graph. A Fast Fourier Transform of these oscillations gives the growth rate of the <b>epi-wafer</b> being grown.

40|$|The gamma-Al 2 O 3 {{films were}} grown on Si (100) {{substrates}} using {{the sources of}} TMA (Al (CH 3) (3)) and O- 2 by very low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (VLP-CVD). It {{has been found that}} the gamma-Al 2 O 3 film has a mirror-like surface and the RMS was about 2. 5 nm. And the orientation relationship was gamma-Al 2 O 3 (100) /Si(100). The thickness uniformity of gamma-Al 2 O 3 films for 2 -inch <b>epi-wafer</b> was less than 5 %. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) results show that the crystalline quality of the film was improved after the film was annealed at 1000 degreesC in O- 2 atmosphere. The high-frequency C-V and leakage current of Al/gamma-Al 2 O 3 /Si capacitor were also measured to verify the annealing effect of the film.

30|$|Following {{implementation}} of the grating pattern and regrowth, the <b>epi-wafer</b> was etched into 10 -μm-wide ridges, and then, the waveguides were reintroduced into the MOVPE system and buried in semi-insulating InP (Fe). A 450 -nm-thick SiO 2 layer was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) for insulation around the ridge, and electrical contact was provided by a Ti/Au layer. An additional 5 -μm-thick gold layer was subsequently electroplated to further improve heat dissipation. The waveguides were cleaved into 2 -mm-long bars, and the testing was performed on devices with optimized reflectivity facet coatings. Both rear facet HR coating consisting of Al 2 O 3 /Ti/Au/Ti/Al 2 O 3 (400 / 5 / 100 / 10 / 200  nm) and the front facet AR coating consisting of Al 2 O 3 /Ge (380 / 33  nm) are deposited by e-beam evaporation. The calculated reflectivity of front facet is 3.4 % for 4.76 -μm wavelength, and the detailed relation between the fluctuation of coating thickness and reflectivity has been discussed in our  previously published paper [19]. The lasers were mounted epilayer side down on SiC heat sinks with indium solder and then wire bonded to an external contact pad. For spectral and electrical characterization, the lasers are mounted on a Peltier element and the temperature was monitored on the heat sink with a thermistor.|$|E
40|$|Over {{recent years}} the {{discipline}} of surface metrology has advanced greatly {{both in terms of}} instrumentation and in terms of techniques for surface characterisation. The advances in instrumentation have entailed the introduction, as an industrial tool, of the atomic force microscope and the widespread use of optical interferometry. Both of these techniques have allowed visualisation of the 3 D surface texture of epi-wafers at the micro and nanometer scale. The clear advantage of interferometry is that it is contactless and fast whereas the AFM technique, although it has a better measurement resolution, is still contacting the surface even in tapping mode and could potentially damage or contaminate the surface. A drawback common to both of these instrument types is that despite the richness of the data collected it is usually only the average roughness Ra, root mean square roughness Rq or maximum peak to valley roughness Rt, values of the surface texture that are quoted. True surface areal texture information cannot be described by such parameters. Consequently these simple amplitude based roughness parameters are inadequate for describing anything more than very simple epi-structures and as a result differing textures can often yield similar roughness values. This paper outlines the recent advances in 3 D surface characterisation and applies this to <b>epi-wafer</b> surface topography. (© 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|E
