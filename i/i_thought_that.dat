5|$|We {{need people}} like , he fights the fight... He {{refused to take}} his anti-retroviral {{medication}} unless it was made affordable and available to everyone—a hugely courageous thing to do. Before then, I'd been frustrated because I wanted to be more hands-on. I just feel that TAC are doing it where it needs to happen. It really needed to be given support, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> perhaps I might be well-placed to do it.|$|E
5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

Sometimes since Lizzie {{was left}} free by father's death, <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{such a young}} woman might soon acquire {{more than enough to}} pass muster.

I own <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> you would. <b>I</b> used to {{consider}} your sketches very pretty, but <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> you would come {{to be a great}} artist." ...|$|R

25|$|Soon I {{found myself}} on the main bandstand before this {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the people didn't like me.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about it and I wanted to be one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri. We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was rather discouraging.|$|E
25|$|I {{was very}} much {{surprised}} when Mill informed {{me that he had}} not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with the opinion of the man at the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, Hans Brochner, who knew, so to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I {{came to the conclusion that}} here was a task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually understand one another. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> in philosophy, too, I knew what I wanted, and saw a road open in front of me.|$|E

6000|$|Suddenly it {{occurred}} to Lucy that one significance of this idea of Creech's had not dawned upon him. [...] "You forget that soon my father will no longer own Sage King or Sarchedon or Dusty Ben--or any racer.

25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was pretty stupid right there.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that,</b> by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
60|$|MRS. JUNO. No: {{of course}} I shouldn't {{have spoken to}} you if <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you liked me, but that you knew, and would be good.|$|R
5000|$|Crow {{states the}} {{inspiration}} for the song came from one of her father's sayings: [...] "My dad always said, ‘Drive it like it’s stolen, and park it like it’s rented.’ And <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>that’s</b> how you have to live life. So I’ve always wanted to write a song with that idea in it".|$|R

500|$|The song's {{original}} title was [...] "Hey Jules", {{and it was}} intended to comfort Julian Lennon from the stress of his parents' separation. McCartney later said, [...] "I knew it {{was not going to be}} easy for him", and that he changed the name to [...] "Jude" [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> sounded a bit better".|$|E
500|$|Warren voted as a Republican {{for many}} years, saying, [...] "I was a Republican because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{those were the}} people who best {{supported}} markets". According to Warren, she began to vote Democratic in 1995 because she no longer believed that to be true, but she states that she has voted for both parties because she believed that neither party should dominate.|$|E
500|$|Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry {{liked the}} cast's scenes with the sumo suits, but saved {{most of her}} praise for Pam's speech. She {{declared}} that it [...] "was AMAZING. Jenna Fischer blew me away with that speech. It’s what I have been hoping for since the first episode of this season. It didn’t end with Jim swooping in and kissing Pam but there’s still one episode left in the season. So that’s {{what we have to}} ponder over the next week." [...] Jay Black of AOLTV also enjoyed the episode. He wrote, [...] "I thought that it was a bit more low key than some of the previous episodes (hilarious sumo outfits not withstanding) and that suited me just fine. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Michael's ridiculousness, always a difficult balancing act, was reigned-in to just this side of believable where it belongs. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it was filled with a great assortment of gags, both character-based and farcical." [...] However, Black was critical of Pam's speech because it felt both [...] "forced" [...] and out of character for Pam to publicly state her feelings.|$|E
5000|$|A 2002 Barker {{telefilm}} titled Saint Sinner bore {{no relation}} to the comic. [...] "I was always disappointed with the way that Marvel handled that entire line of comics, particularly Saint Sinner. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that's</b> a waste of a good title. It was something that called for finding a new life in some way or another".|$|R

500|$|Ecuadorian President Gabriel Garcia Moreno said, [...] "Never should <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{the noble}} country of Washington would be humiliated {{by such a}} black and horrible crime; nor should <b>I</b> ever have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Lincoln would come to such a horrible end, after having served his country which such wisdom and glory under so {{critical}} circumstances." ...|$|R
500|$|On March 21, 1981, new {{president}} Ronald Reagan {{and his wife}} Nancy visited Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. for a fundraising event. Reagan recalled, [...] "I {{looked up at the}} presidential box above the stage where Abe Lincoln had been sitting the night he was shot and felt a curious sensation... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> even with all the Secret Service protection we now had, it was probably still possible for someone who had enough determination to get close enough to the president to shoot him." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1960 Leigh {{recalled}} her ambivalence {{towards her}} first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, [...] "that some critics saw {{fit to be}} as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>that</b> was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides his {{increasing}} {{influence in}} Washington, {{by the late}} 1970s Rangel was New York City's leading black political figure. [...] After initially endorsing Percy Sutton in the 1977 mayoral election, he subsequently endorsed Ed Koch over Mario Cuomo in the Democratic primary run-off. [...] He then attempted to mediate between Mayor Koch and some minority groups who thought the Koch administration racially insensitive. [...] As Koch related, [...] "He has told some blacks angry with me: 'You say Ed Koch is nasty to you? I {{want you to know}} he's nasty to everybody.' <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was rather nice." ...|$|E

500|$|Vandernoot and Paul {{created a}} strong {{on-screen}} relationship between their characters. David Abramowitz, creative consultant {{from the second}} season onwards, said, [...] "When I saw her and Adrian together, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> if I died, {{and there was a}} Mount Olympus, {{that the two of them}} would be standing together with thunderbolts around them. They were god-like. They were so beautiful and had such presence." [...] Paul said that he was [...] "detached" [...] from the fictional relationship between Tessa and MacLeod, but that [...] "...it was a good relationship". Later, he said he [...] "...was sad to see it go." ...|$|E
500|$|Teles {{said she}} {{would be open to}} {{returning}} for a sequel; she feels the film was [...] "set [...] up very nicely for" [...] one, and claims [...] "verybody's wondering" [...] if there will be a follow-up. On the possibility of a sequel, Lundgren said: [...] "I didn't consider [...] as a franchise, but when I was over there , I started thinking, 'How would I do this different? How would I stay close to the subject matter?' Organ trafficking is quite big as well, so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> could be interesting. We could follow up with some kind of other trade." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1983, on her {{way back}} from Paris, Steinberg began dancing in the studio of Moses Pendleton, who had founded the modern dance company Pilobolus. She had been {{attracted}} to Pilobolus growing up: [...] "I was taller than most girls my age, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was a company I could be with because the women were always lifting the men." [...] There she joined up with Daniel Ezralow, Jamey Hampton, and Ashley Roland, and the four created the Connecticut-based, dancer-illusionist company MOMIX. From 1983 to 1986, Steinberg toured nationally with MOMIX. The group became known for their visual humour, contorted positions, and Trompe-l'œil effects.|$|E
