5000|$|The ship {{proceeded}} in a {{sharp turn}} to approach for its landing. That generates <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> in the after part of the ship, {{and especially in the}} center sections close to the stabilizing fins which are braced by shear wires. I can imagine that one of these shear wires parted and caused a rent in a gas cell. If we will assume this further, then what happened subsequently can be fitted in to what observers have testified to here: Gas escaped from the torn cell upwards and filled up the space between the outer cover and the cells in the rear part of the ship, and then this quantity of gas which we have assumed in the hypothesis was ignited by a static spark.Under these conditions, naturally, the gas accumulated between the gas cells and the outer cover must have been a very rich gas. That means it was not an explosive mixture of hydrogen, but more of a pure hydrogen. The loss of gas must have been appreciable.I would like to insert here, because the necessary trimming moments to keep the ship on an even keel were appreciable, and everything apparently happened in the last five or six minutes, that is, during the sharp turn preceding the landing maneuver, that therefore {{there must have been a}} rich gas mixture up there, or possibly pure gas, and such gas does not burn in the form of an explosion. It burns off slowly, particularly because it was in an enclosed space between outer cover and gas cells, and only in the moment when gas cells are burned by the burning off of this gas, then the gas escapes in greater volume, and then the explosions can occur, which have been reported to us at a later stage of the accident by so many witnesses.The rest it is not necessary for me to explain, and in conclusion, I would like to state this appears to me to be a possible explanation, based on weighing all of the testimony that I have heard so far.|$|E
40|$|The White Beam Synchrotron X-Ray Topography (WBSXRT) {{technique}} {{was used to}} assess sapphire wafer quality. The dislocation distribution, dislocation density, Burgers vectors of selected dislocations and stacking faults in the sapphire wafers were studied. A correlation between the sapphire quality and its performance as an X-ray backscattering mirror was established in this study. The results reveal the high quality of the inspected Heat-Exchanger Method produced sapphire wafers and their subsequent improved performance as Bragg backscattering mirrors. Wing tilts in the epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) of GaN on sapphire substrates using a Si 02 mask were observed and measured with the WBSXT method. The wing tilt increases as the fill factor (ratio of stripe opening width to stripe period) increases and asymmetric wing tilts are observed in all samples with different fill factors. The crystal misorientation in the window regions and beneath the seed layer is approximately an order of magnitude less than the wing tilt. A regular wave-like two dimensional stress distribution was observed in the ELO GaN epilayer by using high resolution micro-Raman spectroscopy (p. RS). The average compressive stress in the ELO GaN was around 450 - 460 MPa, and the coalesced region between two ELO wings usually exhibits a lower compressive stress by about 60 MPa compared to the average stress in the epilayer. The ELO process increases the residual compressive stress in the GaN epilayer. The stress in both device silicon cap layers and the underlying Sii_xGex virtual substrates was characterized with fiRS using both the 488 nm Ar+ visible laser and 325 nm HeCd UV laser sources. The Si 0. 70 Ge 0. 30 capping layer at the virtual substrate is fully unstrained as the result of formation two perpendicular misfit crosshatches, while the top silicon cap layer is in <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> with a measured tensile stress of 2. 4 GPa...|$|E

The planet is populated by the Bezzarians, who are sentient 6.5-foot amoebae, the only known sentient single-celled organisms in the galaxy. The Bezzarians are quite advanced in the fields of biotechnology and space travel (their ships don't physically move through space; they simply shift their spatial coordinates). They also have a very low temperature tolerance. Humans can only survive on Bezzar for no more than twenty-four hours due to the planet's unique properties.|$|R
5000|$|Each tom-tom {{had only}} one drumhead, which gave the drums a dry sound that was ideal for the close-miked {{environment}} of the recording studio. However, it was Carlton's snare drum which was perhaps the biggest part of his signature sound. Carlton used Ludwig drums, and his snare was the popular Supraphonic model, which is made of [...] "ludalloy", an aluminium alloy. The metal construction of the drum, {{in combination with the}} <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> head <b>tension</b> that Carlton preferred, produced a loud, cutting [...] "crack" [...] sound that was a very prominent element of the Wailers' recordings. Carlton almost always left the snare wires of the drum disengaged, making the drum sound very similar to a timbale.|$|R

The United States took a tough stand on Pakistan's nuclear development, passing the Pressler amendment, while significantly improving the relations with India. Both Benazir and Nawaz Sharif also asked the United States {{to take steps to}} stop the Indian nuclear program, feeling that United States was not doing enough to address what Pakistan saw as an existential threat. Pakistan found itself in a state of <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> insecurity as <b>tensions</b> mounted with India and Afghanistan’s infighting continued.

The sample consisted of eight patients with different stages of <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma (3 females aged 41 – 65 and 5 males aged 40 – 73 years) and eight patients, also with different stages of normal tension glaucoma (6 females aged 53 – 70 and 2 males aged 40 – 52 years). The control group consisted of eight healthy subjects (3 females aged 23 – 46 and 5 males aged 23 – 65 years). All underwent complete ophthalmological examination, including visual field, colour vision, and electrophysiological functions. The results were compared with fMRI images after stimulation with black/white (BW) and blue/yellow (BY) checkerboard and then statistically processed. Results. The authors analyzed the results of published studies on <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> versus normal tension glaucoma in the images obtained by fMRI. They concluded on the basis of electrophysiological examinations that in <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma, damage of the whole visual pathway occurs, starting from retinal ganglion cells up to the visual cortex. In normal tension glaucoma the response of ganglion cells is relatively normal. The pathology is found mainly in the visual pathway.
