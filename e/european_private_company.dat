50|$|A <b>European</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Company</b> (societas privata Europaea, SPE) is a {{legal form}} for a limited {{liability}} company that is being proposed by the European Commission to be introduced across the European Union. It forms a company of limited liability, similar to the English limited company, the Austrian or the German GmbH, the Dutch BV, the Belgian BVBA or the French SARL. The aim of the proposal is to remove the current need for limited companies to reincorporate themselves in the corresponding legal form in all the EU member countries in which they want to trade, which represents a substantial administrative burden for small and medium enterprises. It was proposed that the SPE company form be introduced across the EU and EEA area from July 2010. The SPE was finally set to arrive in 2011 and is being slowed down by the current ruling parties of Germany (CDU) to allow their own national alternative (the mini-GmbH) to grow first. The SPE could facilitate starting new businesses and European Integration and would thus help small businesses and entrepreneurs due to manageable capital requirements not too dissimilar to the British limited company (Ltd).|$|E

The proposal for a Regulation regarding the <b>European</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Company</b> Statute (hereinafter: Regulation) presented by the European Commission aims at improving conditions for small and medium enterprises (hereinafter: SME's) in the European Single Market by providing them with the same, flexible and uniform set of company law rules across European Union.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{relationship}} between institutional investors and funds managers, a relatively little studied field in private equity. We study this relationship {{within the context of}} international investment flows. We address the following question: When building risk-return exposure to <b>European</b> <b>private</b> <b>companies,</b> which US limited partners (LPs) are more likely to invest in US funds investing in European targets as opposed to in European funds investing locally? We build our research using two-level analysis. We first look at which US LPs are more likely to invest in funds focusing on Europe (regardless of whether a US or European fund) to identify the active global players. And second, using only the subsample of LPs investing in Europe-focused funds, we study which types of LPs are more likely to provide capital to European funds investing locally as opposed to US funds with a European focus. We find that LPs affiliated to institutions with facilities in Europe, such as banks and insurance companies, are more prone to invest directly in European funds. This is consistent with the transaction cost hypothesis whereby LPs may benefit from lower costs to access valuable information to screen European funds. We also find that pension funds often invest directly in European funds although those funds do not possess local facilities in Europe. This may be due to their privileged access to more established <b>European</b> <b>private</b> equit...|$|R

The town of Gwadar was at the same time: a dominion of the Sultans of Oman, a place of interest for the Gichki from Ketch, a strategic observatory for the British government {{along the coast of}} Makran in the Persian direction and a station of the Indo-European telegraph line. Large quantities of rifles were imported from Europe and from Russia through Afghanistan destined to enforce the leaderships of Central Asia, the Gulf, the Arabian Peninsula, and East Africa; while secretly arms were imported from <b>European</b> <b>private</b> <b>companies.</b> The trading ports of Bander Abbas, Bushire, and Muscat were the most important markets for arms. Between 1890 and {{the first decades of the}} twentieth century, Muscat became the centre of arms trade for the Gulf and the Indian Ocean area. And the presence of Asian merchant communities did play a significant role both on the Gulf shores and in East Africa...|$|R

40|$|The Swedish {{companies}} act of 2005 regulates {{public and private}} limited companies. With these two classification shortages of rights prosper to different kinds of company structures that exist in today’s business environment. The Swedish {{companies act}} focuses on larger companies and therefore smaller companies are often neglected. Specific problems that may occur in a small- and medium sized enterprise are not solved. The problems that occur in small- and medium sized companies have rather a relation to the bargaining ex post. This is because small- and medium sized companies are close kept companies. Hence, the shareholders have a closer relation {{to each other and}} are often personally and financially deeply involved in the company, make it more likely for conflicts to occur. When these conflicts ensue, the interaction falls. The trust, loyalty and the long running band to each other weakens. Two options are then available; to try to repair the relation or to leave the company. The author’s opinion is that the proposal brought by the European Commission regarding <b>European</b> <b>private</b> <b>company</b> is sufficiently more minority-friendly in regulating these options. The insight provisions are for instance, more far reaching than in the Swedish companies act. Furthermore, the clearest difference is the right of withdrawal, which is found in the proposal for a <b>European</b> <b>private</b> <b>company</b> but not in the Swedish companies act. This provision is however limited. Despite this, a limited provision than no provision is a better option. Therefore the author states a registration to the <b>European</b> <b>private</b> <b>company</b> a better option for these companies. The author believes that if the proposal for the <b>European</b> <b>private</b> <b>company</b> is approved, this potential regulation could compete with the Swedish companies act since it is more beneficial, in not only a minority shareholder aspect but also the corporation structure as such...|$|E

40|$|This study uses {{a social}} constructivist {{epistemology}} and a compatible methodology {{to look at}} models of HR in three disparate organisational contexts: a British public sector organisation, an entrepreneurial <b>European</b> <b>private</b> sector <b>company</b> in high growth mode, and the Asian operation of the same company in the lead up to a major acquisition, providing an opportunity to examine an organisation {{in a time of}} considerable change and upheaval. The study originated in a dissatisfaction with the ability of current models of HR to explain the diversity of approaches to HR found in organisations, most notably theories of SHRM, best practice and best fit approaches and contextually based HR. It attempts to develop a new descriptive research model of HR which incorporates the discrete RBV and neo-institutional frameworks of HR into a flexible model which can explain the operation of HR in a variety of organisations. The social constructivist perspective allows the model to take a view of strategy formulation and implementation which gives weight to the profound influence of the actors on HR strategy and its deployment. The conclusion {{of this study is that}} a viable descriptive research model can be produced, which utilises contextually based HR as a diagnostic, but gives substantial weight to the influence of the organisational actors. Further research is, however, required in order to fully test the model and resolve several areas about which the projects in this study raised questions.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European contract CRAFT- 1999 - 70420 ‘ISO-BRICK’, several <b>European</b> institutions and <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> developed a semi-prefabricated solution for short and medium span shell roofs, inspired by the innovative curved masonry shells for roofs and walls designed by the well-known Uruguayan architect and engineer Eladio Dieste. The main aim of the research was that of finding an industrialized solution for the construction of those elements and to prove their structural reliability. As part of the research, two prototype buildings were built in Italy. To get all the necessary data for design, as assumed in prEN 1990 (1990), a series of tests to obtain specific material properties and to reduce uncertainties in resistance models were carried out at the University of Padua. A full size model of the curved shell was built and tested in order to evaluate the ultimate resistance. Dynamic tests were carried out at different levels of damage during the static loading tests. Test on small specimens were carried out to evaluate the feasibility of construction and properties related to the durability of the construction. On the basis of the gained knowledge, the two buildings were designed and built, and subsequently control tests to check the behaviour of the actual structures were carried out...|$|R
40|$|In 2008, the European Commission {{proposed}} a regulation {{for a new}} <b>European</b> <b>private</b> <b>company,</b> called the Societas Privata Europeaea. This proposal did not get unanimous approval and was therefore withdrawn {{after five years of}} attempt to find a compromise. In 2014, the European Commission {{proposed a}} directive on single-member private limited liability companies, called the Societas Unius Personae. The aims of the new proposal have a few similarities as the <b>European</b> <b>private</b> <b>company,</b> as will be mentioned in the introduction. However, the proposed directive introduces a few changes, which the European Commission hopes will make this proposal successful. The purpose with this thesis is mainly to examine whether there is a need of a new European company form on the market today. The conclusion is taken by examining who would benefit the most with this company form. This thesis contains an explanation of the proposed directive, a comparison between this new company form and the corresponding Swedish company, as well as opinions on this directive. In the end there is a discussion regarding this subject and lastly my conclusions. The result has shown that there are still great amount of uncertainties that are in need of further discussion in order for this proposal to eventually pass unanimous consent. My conclusions are that there is not an urgent need of a new European company form on the market right now. However, it is a work in progress, and I believe a European company form like this one is a good way towards the aim of uniting the Member States of the European Union...|$|E

Subsequent proposals for the <b>European</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Company</b> (SPE) in 2003 (and finally tabled in 2008) and the European Foundation in 2012 have run into similar controversies, showing very clearly the ‘red thread’ of concern that appears again and again with regard to impacts on national business and industrial relations systems and a lack of clear business need...|$|E

However, so far only a rather small number participates in international business activities. The <b>European</b> <b>private</b> <b>company</b> is intended to support SMEs’ internationalization. In this paper we analyse whether such an additional supranational legal form is necessary.

In a next step we ask from a positive point of view whether it is nevertheless necessary at all. We discuss to what extent horizontal competition on legal forms is already working within the EU.

A typical CDM project today mitigates a gas other than CO 2 in Asia, with carbon credits purchased by a <b>European</b> <b>private</b> <b>company.</b> Despite significant limitations, the CDM provides an example of how financing for global public goods can support sustainable development. Looking forward, the CDM is not adapted to support the large-scale mitigation efforts that are required in large countries to meaningfully curb GHG emissions in the future. However, (an improved) CDM could still play a very important role in channeling international carbon finance to small- and medium-sized developing countries...|$|E

Designed as an instrument to do business in the Single Market the SPE aims to be transparent, flexible and offer a strong label everywhere. As with the Societas Europea, there are certain gaps in the SPE Statute, which prompt for the application of national laws. This could result in 27 different SPE forms in the EU, which leads to financial implications regarding the formation and day-to-day operations of the company.

In this article, we analyse how creditors of future SPEs will be protected. In the first part, we identify on a general level how creditors can be protected. Then we turn to the tools used in the different draft versions of an SPE statute (Commission Draft, EP Draft and Presidency Compromise). As these do not cover all aspects of creditor protection, the next part examines how these gaps ought to be filled. Subsequently, we discuss whether, from a normative perspective, creditor protection in the EU should be further harmonised. Overall, we conclude that what emerges is a mixed picture between various levels of European and national rules.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the Proposal for a Council Regulation on the Statute for a <b>European</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Company</b> (Societas Privata Europaea, SPE) as put forward by the European Commission in 2008 {{as well as with}} the {{amendments}} proposed by the European Parliament in 2009. The SPE will be a new legal form for small and medium-sized companies, allowing them to set up the same European legal entity across the Member States. In this paper the focus is on the question whether we need the SPE and whether the SPE Proposal provides for adequate protection for shareholders and creditors. It will be concluded that due to the uncertainty about the role of the applicable national law, the form and shape of the SPE remains too vague for a positive answer to the question whether we need the SPE. With regard to the protection of shareholders and creditors the conclusion will be that because of the lack of a general buy-out remedy in the proposed Regulation, the protection of shareholders does not deserve the designation ‘adequate’...|$|E
40|$|Legal European Company Forms to Realize Cross Border FOCJ - Functional Overlapping Competing Jurisdictions Peter Friedrich Since {{several years}} Bruno Frey, Eichenberger and other authors {{launched}} {{the idea of}} a FOCJ "Functional Overlapping Competing Jurisdiction". In Switzerland and USA school jurisdictions of FOCJ-type exist. The authors mentioned expect that this form of service offering competing jurisdiction would improve the efficiency of the public sector in Europe. To contribute to this discussion one has to check whether suitable institutional legal forms are available, and one has to formulate some theory of FOCJ formation and operation. With developing European integration also cross border activities should become more efficient. This caused during the past 30 years severe difficulties as legal public cross border activities had to be based on contracts between Member States of the European Union. Meanwhile four European legal forms of company laws have been developed to promote cross border cooperation. They comprise the European Company SE, the European Economic Interest Grouping EEIG, the European Cooperative SCE, and the European Territorial Cooperation Grouping ECTG. Four others are in the legislation process. They are the <b>European</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Company</b> SPE, the European Mutual Society ME, The European Association EA and the European Foundation EFS. To tackle the efficiency question for cross border FOCJ we discuss which kind of FOCJ seems appropriate for which cross border activities and whether the European legal forms of companies can be applied. Moreover, we show a model for establishment of a FOCJ, the finance and operation of a FOCJ. We conclude that a European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation in the framework of a Public Private Partnership might be a promising tool to realize a cross border FOCJ...|$|E
