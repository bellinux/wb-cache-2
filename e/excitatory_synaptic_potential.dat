It is shown that (a) under certain conditions, maximal nonlinearity in the summation of postsynaptic potentials is obtained with asynchronous {{activation of the}} two synaptic inputs rather than with simultaneous activation; (b) the time integral of the voltage is {{more sensitive to the}} timing of the synaptic inputs than is the voltage amplitude; (c) an input, which by the classical definition is inhibitory, under defined conditions can and does increase the amplitude (and area) of an <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potential,</b> and thus acts as an excitatory input...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular {{injection}} of the fluorescent dye, Lucifer Yellow CH, revealed {{the shapes of}} neurones in the myenteric plexus of the guinea-pig ileum, and these shapes were correlated with the electrophysiological properties and enkephalin immunoreactivity of the neurones. A total of eighty-three neurones were filled using electrodes containing a 5 % solution of the dye. Forty-six cells had many short processes and a single long process (Dogiel type 1) and twenty-four cells had essentially smooth somas and one to eight long processes (Dogiel type II). Thirteen cells could not be put into either group. Enkephalin-like immunoreactivity was detected in twenty-two of the forty-six Dogiel type I cells. Eighteen of these had club-like short processes. No other cells of the eighty-three showed enkephalin-like immunoreactivity. Electrodes filled with a 0. 5 % solution of Lucifer Yellow in 0. 5 M-KCl were used to record from and simultaneously to inject dye into 240 neurones. Eighty-six nerve cells had a slow after-hyperpolarization following the action potential (AH cells) and forty-six nerve cells had no after-hyperpolarization but exhibited a fast <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potential</b> (S cells). The other cells could not be unequivocally identified by their observed electrophysiological characteristics. Almost all S cells (forty-two of forty-six) were Dogiel type I, while eighty-two of the eighty-six AH cells were Dogiel type II. Fifty S cells (eight located geometrically, forty-two by dye injection) and ninety-one AH cells (twenty-six located geometrically, sixty-five by dye injection) were examined for enkephalin immunoreactivity. Fifteen of the S cells were reactive, whereas all of the AH cells were unreactive. It appears that prolonged impalements reduce immunoreactivity so {{that the proportion of}} reactive neurones in this series is an underestimate of the true proportion of S cells with enkephalin-like immunoreactivity. The results suggest that a substantial proportion of the S cells in myenteric ganglia contain enkephalin immunoreactivity while none of the AH cells do. The enkephalin neurones have a distinctive shape and are all Dogiel type I cells. AH cells are nearly always Dogiel type II...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{electrophysiological}} {{studies of}} the properties of intestinal reflexes and the neurons that mediate them indicate that the intrinsic sensory neurons may transmit to second order neurons via either fast (30 - 50 ms duration) or slow (10 - 60 s duration) excitatory synaptic potentials or both. Which of these possible modes of transmission {{is involved in the}} initiation of motility reflexes has not been determined and {{it is not clear what}} the consequences of the different forms of synaptic transmission would be for the properties of the reflex pathways. In the present study, this question has been addressed by the use of a suite of computer programs, Plexus©, which was written to simulate the activity of the neurons of the enteric nervous system during intestinal reflexes. The programs construct a simulated enteric nerve circuit based on anatomical and physiological data about the number, functions and interconnections of neurons involved in the control of motility. The membrane potentials of neurons are calculated individually from physiological data about the reversal potentials and membrane conductances for Na+, K+ and Cl−. Synaptic potentials are simulated by changes in specific conductances based on physiological data. The results of each simulation are monitored by recording the membrane potentials of up to 16 separate defined neurons and by recording the summed activity of whole classes of neurons as a function of time and location in the simulated network. The present series of experiments simulated the behaviour of a network consisting of 18 898 sensory neurons and 3708 ascending interneurons after 75 % of the sensory neurons lying in the anal 10 mm of a 30 mm long segment of small intestine were stimulated once. The results were compared with electrophysiological data recorded from myenteric neurons during ascending reflexes evoked either by distension or mechanical stimulation of the mucosa. When transmission from sensory neurons to ascending interneurons was via fast excitatory synaptic potentials, the latencies and durations of the simulated responses were too brief to match the electrophysiologically recorded responses. When transmission from sensory neurons was via slow excitatory synaptic potentials, the latencies were very similar to those recorded physiologically, but the durations of the simulated responses were much longer than seen in physiological experiments. The latencies and durations of simulated and physiologically recorded responses matched only when the firing of ascending interneurons was limited to the beginning of a slow <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potential</b> (in this study by limiting the duration of the decrease in K+ conductance). The simulation provided several physiologically testable predictions, indicating that Plexus© is an important tool for the investigation of the properties and behaviour of the enteric nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{made from}} neurones of guinea-pig submucous plexus revealed {{three types of}} <b>synaptic</b> input: cholinergic <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (fast e. p. s. p. s) of 50 - 80 ms duration, inhibitory <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (i. p. s. p. s) of 1 s duration, and non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic slow e. p. s. p. s which lasted for 15 - 20 s. A single stimulus was sufficient to elicit the slow e. p. s. p. in all neurones in which this synaptic input was present. Slow e. p. s. p. s were recorded in those neurones which also displayed i. p. s. p. s. Both the i. p. s. p. and the slow e. p. s. p. appeared in an all-or-none fashion and were not affected by alterations in the stimulus strength. The inhibitory {{as well as the}} slow <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> reversed close to the K+ equilibrium potential, indicating that the i. p. s. p. is due to an activation of K+ conductance while the slow e. p. s. p. is due to its inactivation. Evidence is presented which suggests the slow e. p. s. p. may be generated at a synapse located some distance from the soma, presumably at a dendritic location.

Intracellular recordings from CA 3 pyramidal cells revealed a decrease in the amplitude of evoked <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials.</b> gamma-Aminobutyric acid-releasing interneurons and inhibitory <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> were unaffected. Seven days after withdrawal of convulsants, remaining cells possessed a normal number of dendritic spines, thus demonstrating a considerable capacity for recovery.

40|$|N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are {{critically}} {{involved in}} synaptic transmission, neural development and {{various forms of}} neuronal plasticity including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). They are also involved {{in the production of}} neuronal damage following excessive activation by glutamate released as a result of hypoxia or ischaemia. Each heteromeric receptor includes one or two NRl subunits, {{at least two of the}} four NR 2 A-D subunits and less usually the NR 3 AJB subunits. This study demonstrates that the putative NR 2 B subunit-containing NMDA receptor antagonist Ro 25 - 6981 potentiates the effects ofNMDA on rat hippocampal slices. The NR 2 A subunit antagonist PEAQX blocks the effects of NMDA alone and the potentiated response following Ro 25 - 6981 application. Furthermore, Ro 25 - 6981 was not neuroprotective as reported previously but unexpectedly precipitated excitotoxicity. The potentiating effect of Ro 25 - 6981 required around 20 minutes to become apparent, took a further 30 minutes to reach its maximum effect and was irreversible. It was not prevented by staurosporine (a broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor), okadaic acid (a potent inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein phosphatases types 1 and 2 A) or anisomycin (a protein synthesis inhibitor). However, the potentiation was prevented by cyclosporin A (an inhibitor of Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase 2 B [calcineurin]). The results indicate that in an intact neuronal network, NR 2 B subunits tonically gate NR 2 A subunit-containing receptor function by a negative coupling mechanism involving ca 1 cineurin activation. NMDA receptor-dependent LTP induced by high frequency stimulation was prevented by PEAQX, an NR 2 A antagonist. Ro 25 - 6981 was unable to prevent L TP induction but was associated with a marginal reduction in the magnitude of LTP induced. There is evidence for the binding of homoquinolinic acid to an NMDAinsensitive novel binding site in the brain. This study investigated the pharmacology of homoquinolinate on the evoked field <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potential</b> (fEPSP) recorded from the CAl area of rat hippocampal slices. Two NMDA receptor agonists, quinolinic acid 150 /lM and homoquinolinic acid 2. 5 /lM, caused an approximately 50 % inhibition of fEPSP slope. Paired-pulse studies suggested there might be a presynaptic component to this action that is independent of presynaptic adenosine Al receptor activation. The broad-spectrum EAA antagonist kynurenic acid and the NMDA receptor blockers 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic acid and dizocilpine could prevent the inhibition of fEPSP slope. None of these antagonists revealed any other NMDA-insensitive activity of homoquinolinic acid. The use of 2 -carboxy- 3 -carboxymethylquinoline (CCMQ) to displace the reported NMDA-insensitive binding had no effect on either baseline fEPSP slope or the depression caused by homoquinolinic acid. It was also apparent that responses to homoquinolinic acid were blocked completely by the NR 2 A subunit-selective antagonist PEAQX, but not by the NR 2 B subunit-selective blocker Ro 25 - 6981. It was concluded that the novel binding site for homoquinolinic acid does not affect synaptic potentials in the hippocampus and that homoquinolinic acid appears to be a selective agonist at NMDA receptors that include the NR 2 A subunit. Although the NR 2 B agonist site may be maximally activated under normal conditions and therefore it is not possible to observe any additional effects upon fEPSP slope. This study next investigated the negative coupling between NR 2 B and NR 2 A subunit-containing receptors, combining the NR 2 A 1 B subunit selective agonist HQA with the NR 2 B and NR 2 A selective antagonists Ro 25 - 6981 and PEAQX. The negative coupling observed previously with applications of NMDA was also seen using HQA and QA. The potentiation of responses to HQA by Ro 25 - 6981 application was also associated with an enhancement of paired-pulse interactions. The subsequent application of PEAQX was able to block both the depression of fEPSP slope and the associated enhancement of paired-pulse interactions. The presence of a presynaptic element during applications of HQA alone and potentiated responses alike and the blockade of these effects by PEAQX suggests the NR 2 A subunit-containing NMDA receptor is responsible for the presynaptic effects acting either directly at presynaptic sites or indirectly at postsynaptic sites leading to the raising of a retrograde signal. The NR 2 B subunit in both its activated and antagonised state was associated with enhancements in paired-pulse interactions which suggest that it is not able to modulate directly the presynaptic element. However, whilst paired-pulse interactions are generally accepted to he presynaptic phenomena, it does not follow that postsynaptic effects cannot influence the appearance of changes in these interactions in field recordings. The absence of any observable difference between HQA, QA and NMDA results suggests that the NR 2 D subunit is not obviously involved in these processes.

In contrast, SNHL neurons displayed only LTD after the conditioning stimulation of L 6.

Synaptic currents were evoked by stimulating in either the external capsule (ec), internal capsule (ic) or basolateral nucleus (BLA). Stimulation of either the ic, ec or BLA evoked a glutamatergic <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> current (EPSC) which was mediated by both non-NMDA and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) receptors, The ratio of the amplitude of the NMDA receptor-mediated component measured at + 40 mV to the amplitude of the alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) component measured at - 60 mV was similar regardless of whether EPSCs were evoked in the ec, ic or BLA.

Spontaneous glutamatergic currents had two components to their decay phase.

These studies have identified the mushroom body as essential for the formation and retrieval of olfactory memories. We investigated odor responses of the principal neurons of the mushroom body, the Kenyon cells (KCs), in Drosophila, using whole-cell recordings in vivo. KC responses to odors were highly selective, and thus sparse, compared to those of their direct inputs, the antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs). We examined the mechanisms that might underlie this transformation and identified at least three contributing factors: (i) <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (from PNs) decay rapidly, curtailing temporal integration; (ii) PN convergence onto individual KCs is low (~ 10 PNs per KC on average), and (iii) KC firing thresholds are high.

Opioid agonists and antagonists selective for fi-, 6 -, and K-receptors were applied by superfusion. Two main actions of opioids were observed. First, F- and &selective opioids presynaptically inhibited the excitatory postsynaptic potential, whereas only a-selective opioids decreased the inhibitory <b>synaptic</b> <b>potential.</b> Second, a small subpopulation of cells (not medium spiny neurons) were hyperpolarized by L-selective agonists. The {{results indicate that}} the main action of opioids on striatal neurons is presynaptic inhibition of the corticostriate <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> input. The opioid peptides enkephalin and dynorphin are abundant within the rat neostriatum, and opioid receptors are expressed at relatively high levels. Enkephalin immunoreactivity is particularly marked in the AChE-poor patch compartment (Graybiel et al., 198 l), and enkephalin coexists with GABA in a subset of medium spiny neurons, which provide a major output of the striatum to the globus pallidus (Cue 110 and Paxinos, 1978; Graybiel and Ragsdale, 1983). Dynorphin, on the other hand, is colocalized with GABA in the neurons that project to the substantia nigra (Anderson and Reiner, 1990). The medium spiny neurons provide recurrent collaterals (Park et al., 1980), suggesting that opioids might be involved in synaptic feedback within the striatum. Receptors for both p- and b-selective opioids are found in the rat striatum. P-Receptors are concentrated in striatal patches, whereas b-receptors are more diffusely distributed through patch and matrix, particularly in the ventrolateral striatum (Herkenha...|$|R

Ganglion cells from the youngest animals studied (3 days post-natal) which received a synaptic input generated action potentials that were abolished by tetrodotoxin (TTX). In neurones from animals aged 7 - 14 days, a TTX-resistant component of the action potential was revealed which persisted in cells from older animals. Voltage-clamp studies suggested that the TTX-resistant component of the action potential resulted from calcium entry at a point that was electrically close to the somatic voltage clamp at early ages, but became electrically distant in older neurones. The site of the inward calcium current appeared to be restricted to specialized areas on one, or occasionally two, dendrites.

Thirty percent of the neurones within left coeliac ganglia were identified as efferent neurones.

Neurones within left coeliac ganglia were characterized as either phasic (fast adapting) neurones or tonic (slowly adapting) neurones depending upon their prolonged firing behaviour. Electrophysiological properties of neurones varied considerably. The wide range of values obtained for both input resistance and input capacitance suggest that sizeable differences in either specific membrane resistance or cell geometry exist within the over-all neurone population.

Models based on the cable equation predict that silent shunting inhibition can strongly veto the effect of an excitatory input.

We present here an analysis and computer simulations to show that for large Cl- conductance changes, the more general Nernst-Planck electrodiffusion model predicts that shunting inhibition on spines should be much less effective than that predicted by the cable model. This is a consequence of the large changes in the intracellular ionic concentration of Cl- that can occur in small structures, which would alter the reversal potential and reduce the driving force for Cl-. Shunting inhibition should therefore not be effective on spines, but it could be significantly more effective on the dendritic shaft {{at the base of the}} spine.

Alterations of the release of glutamate from corticostriatal terminals have been implicated in disorders of the basal ganglia such as Parkinsons's disease and Huntington's chorea. The long-term regulation of corticostriatal transmission. might require the participation of different forms of striatal synaptic plasticity. In physiological condition (1. 2 mM external magnesium) the tetanic stimulation of cortical afferents produces a LTD of <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> recorded in. the striatum. When the external magnesium is omitted, this tetanus induces LTP. NMDA receptor antagonists prevent the induction of LTP, but not the generation of LTD. LTD is blocked either by BAPTA and EGTA or by thapsigargin suggesting that a rise of intracellular Ca 2 + is required for this form of synaptic plasticity. Nifedipine is also able to prevent LTD indicating that high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca 2 + channels of the L-type are implicated {{in the formation of}} LTD. Moreover, LTD is blocked by inhibitors of Ca 2 +-dependent kinases suggesting that a rise in internal Ca 2 + is a crucial step for the subsequent activation of a second messenger cascade. Although both striatal LTD and LTP seem to require an increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration, this change is probably arising from different sources...|$|R
40|$|Responses from motoneurons were {{recorded}} with microelectrodes, from the spinal cords of kitten fetuses and newborn kittens between 40 days' gestation {{and a few}} days after birth. As in the adult animal, intracellularly recorded action potentials by either ortho- or antidromic shocks have two components, "A" and "B" or IS and SD. The action potentials of the adult and immature motoneuron differ mainly in the afterpotentials which are absent in the fetal cell in "good" condition. Repeated stimulation or deterioration of the cell resulted, however, in the appearance of depolarizing and hyperpolarizing afterpotentials. No major differences were found in the mode of anti- or orthodromic invasion of the adult and fetal motoneuron, but the degree of invasion of the soma-dendritic complex may be somewhat less in the fetal cells. The ventral root discharge by dorsal root stimulation could be obtained in the fetus 3 weeks before birth. This reflex discharge was concluded to be monosynaptic. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials, probably monosynaptically activated, could be recorded from inside motoneurons by stimulation of dorsal root or peripheral nerves.

Intrinsic sensory neurons have a characteristic after-hyperpolarization (AHP), but this is depressed during slow EPSPs. To test whether AHPs can provide the inhibition necessary for stability, AHPs, slow EPSPs and their interactions were included in a computer simulation of realistic sensory neuron networks.

Recordings were made from neurons with the characteristic IPSPs of non-cholinergic secretomotor neurons. SNP (100 μM) markedly enhanced IPSPs evoked by single stimuli applied to intermodal strands and IPSPs evoked by trains of 2 – 10 pulses (30 Hz). Both noradrenergic (idazoxan-sensitive) and non-adrenergic (idazoxan-insensitive) IPSPs were affected. SNP enhanced hyperpolarizations evoked by locally applied noradrenaline or somatostatin. SNP did not affect slow EPSPs evoked by single stimuli, but depressed slow EPSPs evoked by stimulus trains. NOLA (100 μM) depressed IPSPs evoked by 1 - 3 stimulus pulses and enhanced slow EPSPs evoked by trains of 2 – 3 stimuli (30 Hz). SNP also {{increased the number of}} action potentials and the duration of firing evoked by prolonged (500 or 1000 ms) depolarizing current pulses, but NOLA had no consistent effect on action potential firing. We conclude that neurally released NO acts post-synaptically to enhance IPSPs and depress slow EPSPs, but may enhance the intrinsic excitability of these neurons. Thus, NOS neurons may locally regulate several secretomotor pathways ending on common neurons...|$|R

We found that the intrinsic and synaptic properties of L 5 pyramidal neurons develop in parallel. Before postnatal day 15 (P 15), intrinsic electrophysiological properties were tuned to low-frequency operation, characterized by high apparent input resistance, a long membrane time constant, and prolonged somatic action <b>potentials.</b> Unitary <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> were of large amplitude (P 11 -P 15; median, 514 mu V), but showed pronounced use-dependent depression during prolonged regular and physiologically relevant presynaptic action potential firing patterns.

Notably, <b>synaptic</b> signaling of complex action potential firing patterns was also transformed, with P 25 -P 29 connections faithfully signaling action potential trains at frequencies up to 40 Hz (1 st to 50 th action potential ratio, 0. 91 +/- 0. 12).

40|$|Background: The {{nature of}} {{synaptic}} transmission at functionally distinct synapses in intestinal reflex pathways {{has not been}} fully identified. In this study, we investigated whether transmission between interneurons in the descending inhibitory pathway is mediated by a purine acting at P 2 Y receptors to produce slow <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (EPSPs). Methodology/Principal findings: Myenteric neurons from guinea-pig ileum in vitro were impaled with intracellular microelectrodes. Responses to distension 15 mm oral to the recording site, in a separately perfused stimulation chamber and to electrical stimulation of local nerve trunks were recorded. A subset of neurons, previously identified as nitric oxide synthase immunoreactive descending interneurons, responded to both stimuli with slow EPSPs that were reversibly abolished by {{a high concentration of}} PPADS (30 mM, P 2 receptor antagonist). When added to the central chamber of a three chambered organ bath, PPADS concentration-dependently depressed transmission through that chamber of descending inhibitory reflexes, measured as inhibitory junction potentials in the circular muscle of the anal chamber. Reflexes evoked by distension in the central chamber were unaffected. A similar depression of transmission was seen when the specific P 2 Y 1 receptor antagonist MRS 2179 (10 mM) was in the central chamber. Blocking either nicotinic receptors (hexamethonium 200 mM) or 5 -HT 3 receptors (granisetron 1 mM) together with P 2 receptors had no greater effect than blocking P 2 receptors alone...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and specificity of monosynaptic sensory-motor synapses were {{studied in the}} brachial spinal cord of bullfrog tadpoles. Intracellular and extracellular recordings were made from motoneurones innervating several different muscles of the forelimb. <b>Excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (e. p. s. p. s) were elicited by stimulation of various peripheral muscle nerves. Sensory and motor axons in the triceps brachii muscle nerves were electrically excitable at stage XIII, the earliest stage studied. Their conduction velocities were 0. 2 - 0. 4 m/s. These velocities increased during subsequent development so that by stage XXII they were approximately 5 m/s. Before stage XVII, <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> evoked in motoneurones by stimulation of the triceps sensory fibres had a long central latency and fatigued easily. These potentials were probably mediated polysynaptically. At stage XVII, the first short-latency triceps <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> appeared. They had central latencies of less than 3 ms and represented the direct, monosynaptic input from muscle sensory cells on to motoneurones. During subsequent development the percentage of triceps motoneurones innervated by triceps sensory fibres increased, {{while the number of}} long-latency polysynaptic inputs decreased. Both the electrical and chemical components, characteristic of these monosynaptic e. p. s. p. s in adult frogs, were prominent from the time the e. p. s. p. s first appeared. The pattern of innervation of brachial motoneurones by triceps sensory afferents was specific from the beginning. Triceps sensory fibres innervated most triceps motoneurones but very few subscapular or pectoralis motoneurones, just as in adult frogs. At no time were there appreciable numbers of 'aberrant' connexions. The developmental time course of several different classes of sensory-motor connexions was similar. Thus the synaptic specificity of this system cannot be explained by a differential timing of synaptogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The serine {{protease}} subtilisin-A produces a long-term depression (LTD) of <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> in hippocampal slices which differs mechanistically from classical LTD. Since caspases have {{been implicated in}} hippocampal plasticity, this study examined a possible role for these enzymes in subtilisin-induced LTD. Subtilisin produced a concentration-dependent decrease {{in the size of}} field <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (fEPSPs), which was not prevented or modified by the caspase inhibitors Z-VAD(OMe) -fmk and Z-DEVD-fmk. Similarly Z-VAD(OMe) -fmk did not modify the selective loss of protein expression produced by subtilisin. Subtilisin reduced the expression of procaspase- 3 and caspase- 9 but, while caspase- 9 was converted to its conventionally activated form (39  kDa), caspase- 3 was metabolised along a non-canonical pathway to a 29 / 30  kDa protein rather than the classical 17 / 19  kDa fragments. Both Z-VAD(OMe) -fmk and Z-DEVD-fmk were unable to prevent the reduced expression of Postsynaptic Density Protein- 95, Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein- 1 and Unco-ordinated 5 H 3 proteins produced by subtilisin, although MG 132 did produce partial recovery from subtilisin-induced depression of fEPSPs. When tested on long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta stimulation in the stratum radiatum, MG 132 inhibited the immediate increase in fEPSP size but generated a higher plateau LTP. Twin LTP stimulation generated a further increase in LTP amplitude in control slices but not in slices exposed to MG 132. The results indicate that subtilisin does produce caspase activation but that this does not contribute to its induction of LTD. However, activation of the proteasome does contribute to subtilisin-induced LTD and may also play a modulatory role in electrically induced LTP...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} {{significance of}} the slow <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (EPSPs) in myenteric neurones is unknown. We investigated this using intracellular recording from myenteric neurones in guinea-pig ileum, in vitro. In all, 121 neurones responded with fast EPSPs to distension of the intestine oral to the recording site. In 28 of these neurones, distension also evoked depolarizations similar to the slow EPSPs evoked by electrical stimulation in the same neurones. Intracellular injection of biocytin and immunohistochemistry revealed that neurones responding to distension with slow EPSPs were descending interneurones, which were immunoreactive for nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Other neurones, including inhibitory motor neurones and interneurones lacking NOS, {{did not respond to}} distension with slow EPSPs, but many had slow EPSPs evoked electrically. Slow EPSPs evoked electrically or by distension in NOS-immunoreactive descending interneurones were resistant to blockade of NK 1 or NK 3 tachykinin receptors (SR 140333, 100 nm; SR 142801, 100 nm, respectively) and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (PHCCC, 10 – 30 μm), when the antagonists were applied in the recording chamber of a two-chambered organ bath. However, slow EPSPs evoked electrically in inhibitory motor neurones were substantially depressed by SR 140333 (100 nm). Blockade of synaptic transmission in the stimulation chamber of the organ bath abolished slow EPSPs evoked by distension, indicating that they arose from activity in interneurones, and not from anally directed, intrinsic sensory neurones. Thus, distension evokes slow EPSPs in a subset of myenteric neurones, which may be important for intestinal motility...|$|R

With the “in vivo patch-clamp” technique we investigated the contribution of membrane properties and <b>synaptic</b> integration of <b>excitatory</b> and inhibitory inputs to sound processing in an intact auditory system. We describe how biocytin cell injections and vesicular glutamate transporter - 1 and - 2 stainings {{can be used to}} confirm localization of measured cells and to identify the central nucleus of the IC. Next, constant current injections were used to characterize the firing patterns and basic membrane properties of IC neurons. New findings include the presence of electrical synapses (spikelets), the absence of onset firing, the absence of a classic pause in buildup neurons and a description of accelerating cells. In addition, spontaneous <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> contributed to the irregularity of spike patterns!. The clearest mechanism in duration tuning seems to be <b>synaptic</b> integration of <b>excitatory</b> and inhibitory inputs and synaptic adaptation, while AM tuning seems to be more influenced by the presence of calcium-dependent potassium channels and the absence of adaptation. Hyperpolarization-activated voltage-dependent sodium/potassium channel Ih can additionally shape the incoming auditory signal. FM tuning is largely determined by the <b>synaptic</b> integration of <b>excitatory</b> and inhibitory inputs, while membrane properties and ion-channels play a lesser role. By showing how the diversity in membrane properties and synaptic inputs can lead to specific tuning for complex sounds, we provide a cellular explanation for the contribution of the IC to central auditory processing...|$|R
40|$|By the frequency-dependent {{release of}} serotonin, Retzius neurons in the leech {{modulate}} diverse behavioral {{responses of the}} animal. However, {{little is known about}} how their firing pattern is produced. Here we have analyzed the effects of mechanical stimulation of the skin and intracellular stimulation of mechanosensory neurons on the electrical activity of Retzius neurons. We recorded the electrical activity of neurons in ganglia attached to their corresponding skin segment by segmental nerve roots, or in isolated ganglia. Mechanosensory stimulation of the skin induced <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (EPSPs) and action potentials in both Retzius neurons in a ganglion. The frequency and duration of responses depended on the strength and duration of the skin stimulation. Retzius cells responded after T and P cells, but before N cells, and their sustained responses correlated with the activity of P cells. Trains of five impulses at 10 Hz in every individual T, P, or N cell in isolated ganglia produced EPSPs and action potentials in Retzius neurons. Responses to T cell stimulation appeared after the first impulse. In contrast, the responses to P or N cell stimulation appeared after two or more presynaptic impulses and facilitated afterward. The polysynaptic nature of all the synaptic inputs was shown by blocking them with a high calcium/magnesium external solution. The rise time distribution of EPSPs produced by the different mechanosensory neurons suggested that several interneurons participate in this pathway. Our results suggest that sensory stimulation provides a mechanism for regulating serotonin-mediated modulation in the leech. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism includes an agonist (quinolinic acid) and an antagonist (kynurenic acid) at these receptors. Rats were treated in late gestation with 3, 4 -dimethoxy-N-[4 -(3 -nitrophenyl) thiazol- 2 -yl]-benzene-sulphonamide (Ro 61 - 8048), an inhibitor of kynurenine- 3 -monoxygenase which diverts kynurenine metabolism to kynurenic acid. Within 5  h of drug administration, {{there was a significant}} decrease in GluN 2 A expression and increased GluN 2 B in the embryo brains, with changes in sonic hedgehog at 24  h. When injected dams were allowed to litter normally, the brains of offspring were removed at postnatal day 21 (P 21). Recordings of hippocampal field <b>excitatory</b> <b>synaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (fEPSPs) showed that prenatal exposure to Ro 61 - 8048 increased neuronal excitability and paired-pulse facilitation. Long-term potentiation was also increased, with no change in long-term depression. At this time, levels of GluN 2 A, GluN 2 B and postsynaptic density protein PSD- 95 were all increased. Among several neurodevelopmental proteins, the expression of sonic hedgehog was increased, but DISC 1 and dependence receptors were unaffected, while raised levels of doublecortin and Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) suggested increased neurogenesis. The results reveal that inhibiting the kynurenine pathway in utero leads to molecular and functional synaptic changes in the embryos and offspring, indicating that the pathway is active during gestation and plays {{a significant role in the}} normal early development of the embryonic and neonatal nervous system...|$|R
