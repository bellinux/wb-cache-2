5000|$|In spark plasma {{sintering}} (SPS), {{external pressure}} and an electric field are applied simultaneously {{to enhance the}} densification of the metallic/ceramic powder compacts. However, after commercialization it was determined there is no plasma, so the proper name is spark sintering as coined by Lenel. The electric <b>field</b> <b>driven</b> densification supplements sintering with a form of hot pressing, to enable lower temperatures and shorter amount of time than typical sintering. For a number of years, it was speculated {{that the existence of}} sparks or plasma between particles could aid sintering; however, Hulbert and coworkers systematically proved that the electric parameters used during spark plasma sintering make it (highly) unlikely. [...] In light of this, the name [...] "spark plasma sintering" [...] has been rendered obsolete. Terms such as [...] "Field Assisted Sintering Technique" [...] (FAST), [...] "Electric Field Assisted Sintering" [...] (EFAS), and Direct Current Sintering (DCS) have been implemented by the sintering community. [...] Using a DC pulse as the electric current, spark plasma, spark impact pressure, joule heating, and an electrical field diffusion effect would be created.|$|E
50|$|The field {{encompasses}} drug {{composition and}} properties, synthesis and drug design, molecular and cellular mechanisms, organ/systems mechanisms, signal transduction/cellular communication, molecular diagnostics, interactions, toxicology, chemical biology, therapy, and medical applications and antipathogenic capabilities. The two main areas of pharmacology are pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamics studies {{the effects of}} a drug on biological systems, and Pharmacokinetics studies the effects of biological systems on a drug. In broad terms, pharmacodynamics discusses the chemicals with biological receptors, and pharmacokinetics discusses the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of chemicals from the biological systems. Pharmacology is not synonymous with pharmacy and the two terms are frequently confused. Pharmacology, a biomedical science, deals with the research, discovery, and characterization of chemicals which show biological effects and the elucidation of cellular and organismal function in relation to these chemicals. In contrast, pharmacy, a health services profession, is concerned with application of the principles learned from pharmacology in its clinical settings; whether it be in a dispensing or clinical care role. In either field, the primary contrast between the two are their distinctions between direct-patient care, for pharmacy practice, and the science-oriented research <b>field,</b> <b>driven</b> by pharmacology.|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{competition}} between different ordered states in bilayer graphene (BLG). Combining arguments based on SU(4) spin-valley flavor symmetry {{with a mean}} field analysis, we identify the lowest energy state with the anomalous Hall insulator (AHI). This state is an SU(4) singlet excitonic insulator with broken time reversal symmetry, exhibiting quantized Hall effect {{in the absence of}} external magnetic field. Applied electric <b>field</b> <b>drives</b> an Ising-type phase transition, restoring time reversal symmetry. Applied magnetic <b>field</b> <b>drives</b> a transition from the AHI state to a quantum Hall ferromagnet state.

40|$|The {{model of}} RH {{neutrino}} fields coupled to the MSSM {{is shown to}} yield a large parameter regime of warm inflation. In the strong dissipative regime, it is shown that inflation, driven by a single sneutrino field, occurs with all field amplitudes below the Planck scale. Analysis is also made of leptogenesis, neutrino mass generation and gravitino constraints. A new warm inflation scenario is purposed in which one scalar <b>field</b> <b>drives</b> a period of warm inflation and a second <b>field</b> <b>drives</b> a subsequent phase of reheating. Such a model is able to reduce the final temperature after inflation, thus helping to mitigate gravitino constraints. Comment: 10 pages, 1 eps figure, revtex...|$|R
40|$|We have {{observed}} multiple magnetic <b>field</b> <b>driven</b> superconductor to insulator transitions (SIT) in amorphous Bi films perforated with a nano-honeycomb (NHC) array of holes. The {{period of the}} magneto-resistance, H=H_M=h/ 2 eS where S is the area of a unit cell of holes, indicates the <b>field</b> <b>driven</b> transitions are boson dominated. The field-dependent resistance follows R(T) =R_ 0 (H) exp(T_ 0 (H) /T) {{on both sides of}} the transition so that the evolution between these states is controlled by the vanishing of T_ 0 to 0. We compare our results to the thickness driven transition in NHC films and the <b>field</b> <b>driven</b> transitions in unpatterned Bi films, other materials, and Josephson junction arrays. Our results suggest a structural source for similar behavior found in some materials and that despite the clear bosonic nature of the SITs, quasiparticle degrees of freedom likely also play an important part in the evolution of the SIT.

The two data sets with appropriate spatial phasing and averaging determine the vector wind along the track of the polar orbiting spacecraft. A study of fifty-eight passes over the Southern (sunlit) pole has enabled the average Universal Time dependence of the wind field to be determined for essentially a single solar local time cut.

The origin of observed two ferroelectric phase co-existence in a narrow temperature range between 180 °C– 200 °C is due to the local structural distortion in the TiO bond coupled through TiO 6 octahedral tilt transition. The observed antiferroelectric (AFE) phase coexistence above 200 °C is strongly driven by the A-O phonon vibrations as a consequence of a change in A-site symmetry i. e., antiparallel A-site cation displacements...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 55 - 59). Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) {{is a novel}} medical imaging modality, based on the magnetization of the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. In MPI, an external magnetic <b>field</b> called the <b>drive</b> <b>field</b> is applied to excite the nanoparticles. The link between the image quality and the <b>drive</b> <b>field</b> parameters is complex, as nanoparticle behavior changes with the <b>drive</b> <b>field</b> parameters. In addition, the maximum applicable <b>drive</b> <b>field</b> strength is limited by human safety restrictions. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the resolution improves at low <b>drive</b> <b>field</b> amplitudes and SNR enhances as <b>drive</b> <b>field</b> frequency increases. Other studies have confirmed that scanning at frequencies as high as 150 kHz is feasible for human-size MPI scanners. However, how the image quality is affected by <b>drive</b> <b>field</b> parameters, especially for high frequencies around 150 kHz, was not investigated. This thesis investigates the effects of the <b>drive</b> <b>field</b> parameters on the image quality in MPI with relaxometer experiments. The effects of the safety limits are also explored across different <b>drive</b> <b>field</b> frequencies via simulations. The results provide important insight in determining the optimal <b>drive</b> <b>field</b> parameters for safe MPI scanners. This thesis also introduces a new method for improving the image quality in MPI. MPI images can suffer from asymmetric hazing and irregular trending artifacts when nanoparticle response is delayed due to relaxation effects. This thesis proposes a new method based on averaging of relaxation effects from negative and positive half-cycles of the MPI signal, combined with a Savitzky-Golay detrending filter. Both experimental and simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement in image quality. by Ecem Bozkurt. M. S...|$|R
