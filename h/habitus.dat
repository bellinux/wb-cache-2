Sed et illud, quod ad Mammeam, matrem Alexandri imperatoris, religiosam feminam, rogatus venit Antiochiam, et summo honore <b>habitus</b> est: quodque ad Philippum imperatorem, qui primus de regibus Romanis Christianus fuit, et ad matrem ejus litteras fecit, quae usque hodie exstant.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>habitus</b> and field is two-way. The field exists {{only insofar as}} social agents possess the dispositions and set of perceptual schemata {{that are necessary to}} constitute that field and imbue it with meaning. Concomitantly, by participating in the field, agents incorporate into their <b>habitus</b> the proper know-how {{that will allow them to}} constitute the field. <b>Habitus</b> manifests the structures of the field, and the field mediates between <b>habitus</b> and practice.|$|E
25|$|For Bourdieu, <b>habitus</b> {{and field}} can only exist in {{relation}} to each other. Although a field is constituted by the various social agents participating in it (and thus their <b>habitus),</b> a <b>habitus,</b> in effect, represents the transposition of objective structures of the field into the subjective structures of action and thought of the agent.|$|E
25|$|The <b>habitus</b> of {{a person}} is {{composed}} of the intellectual dispositions inculcated {{to him or her}} by family and the familial environment, and are manifested according {{to the nature of the}} person. As such, the social formation {{of a person}}'s <b>habitus</b> is influenced by family, by objective changes in social class, and by social interactions with other people in daily life; moreover, the <b>habitus</b> of a person also changes when he or she changes social positions within the field.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Bourdieu {{used the}} methodological and theoretical concepts of <b>habitus</b> and field {{in order to}} make an epistemological break with the prominent objective-subjective antinomy of the social sciences. He wanted to effectively unite social phenomenology and structuralism. <b>Habitus</b> and field are proposed to do so.|$|E
25|$|<b>Habitus</b> is {{somewhat}} reminiscent of preexisting sociological {{concepts such as}} socialization, but <b>habitus</b> also differs from the more classic concepts in several important ways. Firstly, a central aspect of the <b>habitus</b> is its embodiment: <b>Habitus</b> does not only, or even primarily, function {{at the level of}} explicit, discursive consciousness. The internal structures become embodied and work in a deeper, practical and often pre-reflexive way. An illustrative example might be the 'muscle memory' cultivated in many areas of physical education. Consider the way we catch a ball - the complex geometric trajectories are not calculated; it is not an intellectual process. Although it is a skill that requires learning, it is more a physical than a mental process and has to be performed physically to be learned. In this sense, the concept has something in common with Anthony Giddens' concept of practical consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Bourdieu builds {{his theory}} of {{cultural}} production using his own characteristic theoretical vocabulary of <b>habitus,</b> capital and field.|$|E
25|$|Though not deterministic, the inculcation of the {{subjective}} {{structures of the}} <b>habitus</b> can be observed through statistical data, for example, while its selective affinity with the objective structures of the social world explains {{the continuity of the}} social order through time. As the individual <b>habitus</b> is always a mix of multiple engagements in the social world through the person's life, while the social fields are put into practice through the agency of the individuals, no social field or order can be completely stable. In other words, if the relation between individual predisposition and social structure is far stronger than common sense tends to believe, it is not a perfect match.|$|E
25|$|Maurice Merleau-Ponty and, through him, the {{phenomenology}} of Edmund Husserl {{played an}} essential part {{in the formulation of}} Bourdieu's focus on the body, action, and practical dispositions (which found their primary manifestation in Bourdieu's theory of <b>habitus).</b>|$|E
25|$|Bourdieu's work {{is built}} upon {{an attempt to}} transcend a series of oppositions which he thought {{characterized}} the social sciences (subjectivism/objectivism, micro/macro, freedom/determinism) of his time. His concepts of <b>habitus,</b> capital, and field were conceived {{with the intention of}} overcoming such oppositions.|$|E
25|$|Doxa {{refers to}} the learned, fundamental, deep-founded, {{unconscious}} beliefs, and values, taken as self-evident universals, that inform an agent's actions and thoughts within a particular field. Doxa tends to favor the particular social arrangement of the field, thus privileging the dominant and taking their position of dominance as self-evident and universally favorable. Therefore, the categories of understanding and perception that constitute a <b>habitus,</b> being congruous with the objective organization of the field, tend to reproduce the very structures of the field. A doxic situation may {{be thought of as}} a situation characterized by a harmony between the objective, external structures and the 'subjective', internal structures of the <b>habitus.</b> In the doxic state, the social world is perceived as natural, taken-for-granted and even commonsensical.|$|E
25|$|Bourdieu's {{ambition}} to unite these sociological traditions, {{which had been}} widely thought to be incompatible, was and remains controversial. The most important concept to grasp is <b>habitus.</b> Crudely put, the <b>habitus</b> is the system of dispositions which individuals have. Sociologists very often look at either social laws (structure) or the individual minds (agency) in which these laws are inscribed. Great sociological arguments have raged between {{those who argue that}} the former should be sociology's principal interest (structuralists) and those who argue the same for the latter (phenomenologists). When Bourdieu instead asks us to consider dispositions, he is making a very subtle intervention in sociology. He has found a middle ground where social laws and individual minds meet and is arguing that our proper object of analysis should be this middle ground: dispositions.|$|E
25|$|Pierre Bourdieu {{developed}} {{a theory of}} the action, around the concept of <b>habitus,</b> which exerted a considerable influence in the social sciences. This theory seeks to show that social agents develop strategies which are adapted {{to the needs of}} the social worlds that they inhabit. These strategies are unconscious and act on the level of a bodily logic.|$|E
25|$|Forbearance: knights' {{self-control}} towards other {{warriors and}} at the courts of their lords {{was a part of}} the early noble <b>habitus</b> as shown in the Conventum of Hugh de Lusignan in the 1020s. The nobility of mercy and forbearance was well established by the second half of the 12th century long before there was any code of chivalry.|$|E
25|$|A {{field is}} a {{setting in which}} agents and their social {{positions}} are located. The position of each particular agent {{in the field is}} a result of interaction between the specific rules of the field, agent's <b>habitus</b> and agent's capital (social, economic and cultural). Fields interact with each other, and are hierarchical: Most are subordinate to the larger field of power and class relations.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, each {{relatively}} autonomous {{field of}} modern life, such as economy, politics, arts, journalism, bureaucracy, science or education engenders a specific complex {{of social relations}} where the agents will engage their everyday practice. Through this practice, they develop a certain disposition for social action that is conditioned by their position on the field (dominant/dominated and orthodox/heterodox are only two possible ways of positioning the agents on the field; these basic binary distinctions are always further analysed considering the specificities of each field). This disposition, combined with every other disposition the individual develops through his engagement with other fields operating within the social world, will eventually come to constitute a system of dispositions, known in Bourdieu's lexicon as a <b>habitus.</b> Dispositions - a key concept in Bourdieu's work - can be conceived as {{a sense of the}} game, a partly rational but partly intuitive understanding of fields and of social order in general, a practical sense, a practical reason, giving rise to opinions, tastes, tone of voice, typical body movements and mannerisms and so on. The dispositions constitutive of <b>habitus</b> are therefore conditioned responses to the social world, becoming so ingrained that they come to occur spontaneously, rather like 'kneejerk' opinions. It follows that the <b>habitus</b> developed by an individual will typify his position in the social space. By doing so, social agents will often acknowledge, legitimate and reproduce the social forms of domination (including prejudices) and the common opinions of each field as self-evident, clouding from conscience and practice even the acknowledgment of other possible means of production (including symbolic production) and power relations.|$|E
25|$|This species {{could be}} close to the white-tailed hawk (Buteo albicaudatus), and perhaps to the grey-backed (Leucopternis occidentalis), white (L. albicollis), and mantled hawks (L. polionotus) which it resembles in <b>habitus</b> except for being larger. Its closest living {{relatives}} may well be the red-backed (B. polyosoma) and Puna hawks (B. poecilochrous). Particularly some populations of the former look like small black-chested buzzard-eagles. The barred hawk (L. princeps) looks similar to the black-chested buzzard-eagle in general color pattern, though the tail differs much in shape, size, and the bright white central band stands out.|$|E
25|$|Genetically male {{individuals}} {{affected by}} CAIS, however, {{will develop a}} normal external female <b>habitus,</b> {{despite the presence of}} a Y chromosome, but internally, they will lack a uterus, and the vaginal cavity will be shallow, while the gonads, having been turned into testicles rather than ovaries in the earlier separate process also triggered by their Y chromosome, will remain undescended in the place where the ovaries would have been. This results not only in infertility for a genetic male with CAIS, but also presents a high risk of testicular cancer later on in life.|$|E
25|$|Embodied {{cultural}} capital comprises {{the knowledge that}} is consciously acquired and the passively inherited, by socialization to culture and tradition. Unlike property, {{cultural capital}} is not transmissible, but is acquired over time, as it is impressed upon the person's <b>habitus</b> (character and way of thinking), which, in turn, becomes more receptive to similar cultural influences. Linguistic cultural capital is the mastery of language and its relations; the embodied cultural capital, which is a person's means of communication and self-presentation, acquired from the national culture.|$|E
25|$|The {{cultural}} capital {{of a person}} is linked {{to his or her}} <b>habitus</b> (embodied disposition and tendencies) and field (social positions), which are configured as a social-relation structure. The field is the place of social position that is constituted by the conflicts that occur when social groups endeavour to establish and define what is {{cultural capital}}, within a given social space; therefore, depending upon the social field, one type of cultural capital can simultaneously be legitimate and illegitimate. In that way, the legitimization (societal recognition) of a type of cultural capital can be arbitrary and derived from symbolic capital.|$|E
25|$|Mild {{androgen}} insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) is {{a condition}} that results in a mild impairment of the cell's {{ability to respond to}} androgens. The degree of impairment is sufficient to impair spermatogenesis and / or the development of secondary sexual characteristics at puberty in males, but does not affect genital differentiation or development. Female genital and sexual development is not significantly affected by the insensitivity to androgens; as such, MAIS is only diagnosed in males. The clinical phenotype associated with MAIS is a normal male <b>habitus</b> with mild spermatogenic defect and / or reduced secondary terminal hair.|$|E
25|$|Surgically, {{the breast}} is an apocrine gland {{overlaying}} the chest — attached at the nipple and suspended with ligaments from the chest — which {{is integral to}} the skin, the body integument of the woman. The dimensions and weight of the breasts vary with her age and <b>habitus</b> (body build and physical constitution); hence small-to-medium-sized breasts weigh approximately 500 gm, or less, and large breasts weigh approximately 750–1,000 gm. Anatomically, the breast topography and the hemispheric locale of the nipple-areola complex (NAC) are particular to each woman; thus, the desirable, average measurements are a 21–23cm sternal distance (nipple to sternum-bone notch), and a 5–7cm inferior-limb distance (NAC to IMF).|$|E

Hence, small-to-medium-sized breasts weigh approximately 500 gm or less, and large breasts weigh approximately 750–1,000 gm. Anatomically, the breast topography and the locale of the nipple-areola complex (NAC) on the breast hemisphere are particular to each woman; thus, the statistically desirable (mean average) measurements are a 21–23cm sternal distance (nipple to sternum-bone notch), and a 5–7cm inferior-limb distance, from the nipple to the inframammary fold, where the breast joins the chest.|$|E
25|$|Social philosopher Jürgen Habermas {{disagrees with}} Luhmann {{and argues that}} the law {{can do a better}} job as a 'system' institution' by {{representing}} more faithfully the interests of everyday people in the 'lifeworld'. Yet another sociological theory of law and lawyers is that of Pierre Bourdieu and his followers, who see law as a social field in which actors struggle for cultural, symbolic and economic capital and in so doing develop the reproductive professional <b>habitus</b> of the lawyer. In several continental European countries empirical research in sociology of law developed strongly from the 1960s and 1970s. In Poland the work of Adam Podgórecki and his associates (often influenced by Petrazycki's ideas) was especially notable; in Sweden empirical research in sociology of law in this period was pioneered especially by Per Stjernquist, and in Norway by Vilhelm Aubert.|$|E

500|$|It bears {{superficial}} {{resemblance to}} some extant genera (Strumigenys, Ishakidris, Pilotrochus, and Phalacromyrmex) but these similarities {{are considered to}} be due to convergent evolution. Due to similarities in the <b>habitus,</b> Brown & Kempf (1968) linked Tatuidris to the Dacetini genus Glamyromyrmex (currently a junior synonym of Strumigenys) and Phalacromyrmex. However they concluded: [...] "analysis of these similarities indicates [...] that they are mostly convergent and not based on close phylogenetic relationship". Further work explored the similarities of Tatuidris with Ishakidris (Bolton 1984) and Pilotrochus (Brown 1977). While these taxa share some characteristics, including an expanded head vertex, deep antennal scrobes and a compact mesosoma, the similarities were again deemed convergent.|$|E
500|$|When Italian {{botanist}} Achille Forti (1878–1937) {{worked on}} the specimens in 1926, they were reinterpreted as close relatives of Postelsia, now {{known to be a}} brown algae, which had lived in the coastal waters of the Eocene sea. Forti renamed the species Postelsiopsis caput-medusae commemorating the fossils' extreme similarity to the extant Postelsia palmaeformis. [...] The appearance of the plant fossil is a holdfast on the bottom, with a stem-like stipe between there and the fronds which are about [...] to [...] In life, the fronds would have hung vertically whenever the plant was submerged during high tide, and would have flopped over the stipe when the plant was exposed during low tide in a <b>habitus</b> {{similar to that of the}} living sea palm.|$|E
2500|$|He {{developed}} {{the principle of}} <b>habitus</b> and heritage [...] theorizing that animals evolved with two sets of characteristics: the heritage features which derived from a long evolutionary history and the <b>habitus</b> characteristics which were adaptations to {{the environment in which}} the species existed. He later expanded this to his palimpsest theory which proposed that the <b>habitus</b> features often overlaid and obscured the heritage features. A similar theory, mosaic evolution has appeared since King Gregory's death.|$|E
2500|$|Bourdieu's {{concept of}} <b>habitus</b> was {{inspired}} by Marcel Mauss's notion of body technique and hexis. The word itself {{can be found in}} the works of Norbert Elias, Max Weber, Edmund Husserl and Erwin Panofsky as re-workings of the concept as it emerged in Aristotle's notion of Hexis. [...] For Bourdieu, <b>habitus</b> was essential in resolving a prominent antinomy of the human sciences: objectivism and subjectivism. <b>Habitus</b> can be defined as a system of dispositions (lasting, acquired schemes of perception, thought and action).|$|E

2500|$|According to Crouch, {{prior to}} codified chivalry {{there was the}} uncodified code of noble conduct {{that focused on the}} preudomme. This uncodified code - {{referred}} to as the noble <b>habitus</b> - is a term for the environment of behavioural and material expectations generated by all societies and classes. As a modern idea, it was pioneered by the French philosopher/sociologists Pierre Bourdieu and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, even though a precedent exists for the concept {{as far back as the}} works of Aristotle. Crouch argues that the <b>habitus</b> on which [...] "the superstructure of chivalry" [...] was built and the preudomme was a part, had existed long before 1100, while the codified medieval noble conduct only began between 1170 and 1220.|$|E
2500|$|Androgen {{insensitivity}} syndrome (AIS) is an intersex {{condition in}} which there is a partial or complete inability of many cells in the affected genetic male to respond to androgenic hormones. [...] This can prevent or impair the masculinization of male genitalia in the developing genetic male (chromosomal XY) fetus, as well as the development of male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty. Clinical phenotypes range from a normal male <b>habitus</b> with mild spermatogenic defect or reduced secondary terminal hair; to a full female <b>habitus</b> despite the presence of a Y-chromosome. Women (chromosomal XX) who are heterozygous for the AR gene have normal primary and secondary sexual characteristics; this female carrier will pass the affected AR gene to any child she has with 50% likelihood. AIS is the largest single entity that leads to 46,XY undermasculinized genitalia.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that Bourdieu's theory, and in particular his notion of <b>habitus,</b> is entirely deterministic, leaving no place for individual agency or even individual consciousness. Although Bourdieu claimed to have transcended the dichotomy of structure and agency, {{this is not necessarily}} convincing. For example, the Oxford academic John Goldthorpe has long argued that: ...|$|E
2500|$|Bourdieu {{routinely}} {{sought to}} connect his theoretical ideas with empirical research {{and his work}} {{can be seen as}} sociology of culture or, as he described it, a [...] "Theory of Practice". His contributions to sociology were both evidential and theoretical (that is, calculated through both systems). His key terms were <b>habitus,</b> capital and field.|$|E
