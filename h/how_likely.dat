5|$|The {{first factor}} {{determining}} optimal defense is risk: <b>how</b> <b>likely</b> {{is it that}} a plant or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is also related to the plant apparency hypothesis, which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores. Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses. Unapparent plants, such as short-lived plants of early successional stages, on the other hand, preferentially invest in small amounts of qualitative toxins that are effective against {{all but the most}} specialized herbivores.|$|E

25|$|Very recently, {{there has}} been a rise in {{scientific}} investigations into stereopsis recovery in adults and youths who have had no stereo vision before.

25|$|The {{energy and}} the type of the {{ionizing}} radiation emitted by a radioactive substance are also important factors in determining its threat to humans. The chemical properties of the radioactive element will determine how mobile the substance is and <b>how</b> <b>likely</b> it is to spread into the environment and contaminate humans.

25|$|The p-value was {{introduced}} by Karl Pearson in the Pearson's chi-squared test, where he defined P (original notation) as {{the probability that the}} statistic would be at or above a given level. This is a one-tailed definition, and the chi-squared distribution is asymmetric, only assuming positive or zero values, and has only one tail, the upper one. It measures goodness of fit of data with a theoretical distribution, with zero corresponding to exact agreement with the theoretical distribution; the p-value thus measures <b>how</b> <b>likely</b> the fit would be this bad or worse.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, {{the best}} batting {{strategy}} for Team 1 {{ahead of a}} coming interruption {{is not always the}} same, but varies with the facts of the match situation to date (runs scored, wickets lost, overs used, and whether there have been interruptions), and also with the opinions about what will happen with each strategy (how many further runs will be scored, further wickets will be lost, and further overs will be used? <b>How</b> <b>likely</b> are the coming interruptions, when will they happen, and how long will they last â€“ will Team 1's innings be re-started?).|$|E
25|$|One major {{drawback}} of the Levins {{model is}} that it is deterministic, whereas the fundamental metapopulation processes are stochastic. Metapopulations are particularly useful when discussing species in disturbed habitats, and the viability of their populations, i.e., <b>how</b> <b>likely</b> they are to become extinct in a given time interval. The Levins model cannot address this issue. A simple way to extend the Levins' model to incorporate space and stochastic considerations is by using the contact process. Simple modifications to this model can also incorporate for patch dynamics. At a given percolation threshold, habitat fragmentation effects take place in these configurations predicting more drastic extinction thresholds.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{hypothesis}} testing {{is a key}} technique of both frequentist inference and Bayesian inference, although {{the two types of}} inference have notable differences. Statistical hypothesis tests define a procedure that controls (fixes) the probability of incorrectly deciding that a default position (null hypothesis) is incorrect. The procedure is based on <b>how</b> <b>likely</b> it would be for a set of observations to occur if the null hypothesis were true. Note that this probability of making an incorrect decision is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true, nor whether any specific alternative hypothesis is true. This contrasts with other possible techniques of decision theory in which the null and alternative hypothesis are treated on a more equal basis.|$|E

25|$|Pregnancy {{detection}} can {{be accomplished}} using one or more various pregnancy tests, which detect hormones generated by the newly formed placenta, serving as biomarkers of pregnancy. Blood and urine tests can detect pregnancy 12 days after implantation. Blood pregnancy tests are more sensitive than urine tests (giving fewer false negatives). Home pregnancy tests are urine tests, and normally detect a pregnancy 12 to 15 days after fertilization. A quantitative blood test can determine approximately the date the embryo was conceived because HCG doubles every 36 to 48 hours. A single test of progesterone levels can also help determine <b>how</b> <b>likely</b> a fetus will survive in those with a threatened miscarriage (bleeding in early pregnancy).|$|E
25|$|The fuzzy logical {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} developed by Dominic Massaro proposes that people remember speech sounds in a probabilistic, or graded, way. It suggests that people remember {{descriptions of the}} perceptual units of language, called prototypes. Within each prototype various features may combine. However, features are not just binary (true or false), there is a fuzzy value corresponding to <b>how</b> <b>likely</b> it is that a sound belongs to a particular speech category. Thus, when perceiving a speech signal our decision about what we actually hear {{is based on the}} relative goodness of the match between the stimulus information and values of particular prototypes. The final decision is based on multiple features or sources of information, even visual information (this explains the McGurk effect). Computer models of the fuzzy logical theory have been used to demonstrate that the theory's predictions of how speech sounds are categorized correspond to the behavior of human listeners.|$|E
25|$|The {{most direct}} evidence, {{according}} to Kahneman, is a 1973 experiment that used a psychological profile of TomW., a fictional graduate student. One group of subjects had to rate Tom's similarity to a typical student {{in each of}} nine academic areas (Law, Engineering, Library Science etc.). Another group had to rate <b>how</b> <b>likely</b> it is that Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by probability, then they should resemble the base rates, i.e., the proportion of students {{in each of the}} nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). A probabilistic judgment would say that Tom {{is more likely to be}} a Humanities student than Library Science, because many more students study Humanities, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} find out what the chances are of a patient with a {{positive}} or negative test result having or not having the disease, the likelihood ratios (LRs) need to be calculated. The LR incorporates both the sensitivity and specificity of the test and provides an estimate of how much a positive or negative test result changes the chances of having or not having the disease. So a positive LR tells you <b>how</b> much more <b>likely</b> patients are to have the disease when the test is positive. The negative LR tells you <b>how</b> much less <b>likely</b> patients are to have the disease when the test is negative.|$|R

25|$|As an example, {{consider}} {{determining whether}} a suitcase contains some radioactive material. Placed under a Geiger counter, it produces 10 counts per minute. The null hypothesis is that no radioactive material is in the suitcase and that all measured counts are due to ambient radioactivity typical of the surrounding air and harmless objects. We can then calculate <b>how</b> <b>likely</b> {{it is that we}} would observe 10 counts per minute if the null hypothesis were true. If the null hypothesis predicts (say) on average 9 counts per minute, then according to the Poisson distribution typical for radioactive decay there is about 41% chance of recording 10 or more counts. Thus we can say that the suitcase is compatible with the null hypothesis (this does not guarantee that there is no radioactive material, just that we don't have enough evidence to suggest there is). On the other hand, if the null hypothesis predicts 3 counts per minute (for which the Poisson distribution predicts only 0.1% chance of recording 10 or more counts) then the suitcase is not compatible with the null hypothesis, and there are likely other factors responsible to produce the measurements.|$|E

[...] Ensemble forecasts are increasingly being used for operational weather forecasting (for example at European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and the Canadian forecasting center).
