Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, <b>gametic</b> selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E

2500|$|Translocation Down {{syndrome}} can be de novo; that is, not inherited but {{occurring at}} the time of an individual's conception, or may be inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation. The balanced translocation figure shows a 14/21 translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 14 and 21, where the other chromosomes are not shown. The individual has two copies of everything on chromosome 14, and two copies of all of the material on the long arm of chromosome 21 (21q). The derivative chromosome 21, which contains only heterochromatin, is lost; thus, the individual only has one copy of the material on the short arm of chromosome 21 (21p), but this appears to have no discernible effect. Individuals with this chromosomal arrangement have 45 chromosomes and are phenotypically normal. During meiosis, the chromosomal arrangement interferes with normal separation of chromosomes. Possible <b>gametic</b> arrangements are (see translocation karyotype figure): ...|$|E
50|$|In a diploid individual, the <b>gametic</b> phase {{represents}} the original allelic combinations {{that an individual}} received from its parents.

50|$|The cycles {{differ in}} when mitosis (growth) occurs. Zygotic meiosis and <b>gametic</b> meiosis have one mitotic stage: mitosis occurs during the n phase in zygotic meiosis {{and during the}} 2n phase in <b>gametic</b> meiosis. Therefore, zygotic and <b>gametic</b> meiosis are collectively termed haplobiontic (single mitotic phase, not to be {{confused}} with haplontic). Sporic meiosis, on the other hand, has mitosis in two stages, both the diploid and haploid stages, termed diplobiontic ({{not to be confused}} with diplontic).|$|E

50|$|All ciliates, {{including}} karyorelicteans, possess {{two different}} kinds of nucleus, which separate the functions of gene expression and sexual recombination. The macronuclei, or somatic nuclei, are the site of transcription, while the smaller micronuclei, or germline nuclei, are only active during sexual reproduction, where they first undergo meiosis to form <b>gametic</b> nuclei, which are exchanged when two mating cells conjugate. Two <b>gametic</b> nuclei fuse to form a zygotic nucleus, which divides by mitosis into two daughter nuclei, one of which develops into a new micronucleus and the other into a macronucleus; the old macronucleus typically disintegrates (see main article).|$|E

5000|$|Paramecium aurelia is {{the most}} {{commonly}} studied protozoan for autogamy. Similar to other unicellular organisms, Paramecium aurelia typically reproduce asexually via binary fission or sexually via cross-fertilization. However, {{studies have shown that}} when put under nutritional stress, Paramecium aurelia will undergo meiosis and subsequent fusion of gametic-like nuclei. This process, defined as hemixis, a chromosomal rearrangement process, takes place in a number of steps. First, the two micronuclei of Paramecium aurelia enlarge and divide two times to form eight nuclei. Some of these daughter nuclei will continue to divide to create potential future <b>gametic</b> nuclei. Of these potential <b>gametic</b> nuclei, one will divide two more times. Of the four daughter nuclei arising from this step, two of them become anlagen, or cells that will form part of the new organism. The other two daughter nuclei become the <b>gametic</b> micronuclei that will undergo autogamous self-fertilization. [...] These nuclear divisions are observed mainly when the Paramecium aurelia is put under nutritional stress. Research shows that Paramecium aurelia undergo autogamy synchronously with other individuals of the same species.|$|E

50|$|Goodenough {{and colleagues}} {{have studied the}} {{molecular}} basis and evolution of life-cycle transitions in the flagellated green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. They have identified genes in the mating-type (mt) locus and genes regulated by mt that control the transition between vegetative growth and <b>gametic</b> differentiation and zygote development. These include genes responsible for mate recognition, uniparental inheritance of chloroplast DNA, and <b>gametic</b> differentiation, allowing them to study their function and their evolution during speciation. Recently they have explored the potential for producing algal biodiesel as a transportation fuel. Dr. Ursula Goodenough was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2009 to Section 2 - Cellular and Development Biology, Microbiology and Immunology (including Genetics).|$|E

50|$|The elkhorn sculpin (Alcichthys elongatus) is {{a marine}} teleost {{with a unique}} {{reproductive}} mode called “internal <b>gametic</b> association”. Sperm are introduced into the ovary by copulation and then enter the micropylar canal of ovulated eggs in the ovarian cavity. However, actual sperm-egg fusion does not occur until the eggs have been released into sea water.|$|E
50|$|The lack of {{geographic}} constraint in isolating sympatric populations {{implies that the}} emerging species avoid interbreeding via other mechanisms. Before speciation is complete, two diverging populations may still produce viable offspring. As speciation progresses, isolating mechanisms - such as <b>gametic</b> incompatibility that renders fertilization of the egg impossible - are selected for {{in order to increase}} the reproductive divide between the two populations.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} its name, linkage disequilibrium may exist between alleles at {{different}} loci without any genetic linkage between them and independently {{of whether or not}} allele frequencies are in equilibrium (not changing with time). Furthermore, linkage disequilibrium is sometimes referred to as <b>gametic</b> phase disequilibrium; however, the concept also applies to asexual organisms and therefore does not depend on the presence of gametes.|$|E
50|$|The sex {{change in}} parrotfishes is {{accompanied}} by changes in circulating steroids. Females {{have high levels of}} estradiol, moderate levels of T and undetectable levels of the major fish androgen 11-ketotestosterone. During the transition from initial to terminal coloration phases, concentrations of 11-ketotestosterone rise dramatically and estrogen levels decline. If a female is injected with 11-ketotestosterone, it will cause a precocious change in gonadal, <b>gametic</b> and behavioural sex.|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>gametic</b> {{life cycle}} or [...] " [...] diplontic life cycle", of which humans are a part, the {{organism}} is diploid, {{grown from a}} diploid cell called the zygote. The organism's diploid germ-line stem cells undergo meiosis to create haploid gametes (the spermatozoa for males and ova for females), which fertilize to form the zygote. The diploid zygote undergoes repeated cellular division by mitosis to grow into the organism.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scientific}} term of meiosis {{was first}} developed by J. B. Farmer and J. E. Moore in 1905 to describe <b>gametic</b> cell division—concepts researched extensively by German biologist Theodor Boveri. The process involves {{a reduction of}} chromosome number in the resulting germ cells. However, {{it was not until}} a few years later that maiosis was renamed [...] "meiosis" [...] to better embody the Greek definition, [...] "to reduce" [...] or [...] "diminish".|$|E
50|$|MHC-mediated mate choice {{may also}} occur after {{copulation}} at the <b>gametic</b> level, through sperm competition or female cryptic choice. The Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, is one species in which sperm competition {{is influenced by}} the variation in the major histocompatibility complex, specifically that of the Class I alleles. Atlantic salmon males were found to have higher rates of successful fertilization when competing for eggs from females genetically similar at the class I genes of the MHC.|$|E
50|$|Finally, in the sporic life cycle, {{the living}} {{organism}} alternates between haploid and diploid states. Consequently, this cycle {{is also known}} as the alternation of generations. The diploid organism's germ-line cells undergo meiosis to produce spores. The spores proliferate by mitosis, growing into a haploid organism. The haploid organism's gamete then combines with another haploid organism's gamete, creating the zygote. The zygote undergoes repeated mitosis and differentiation to become a diploid organism again. The sporic life cycle can be considered a fusion of the <b>gametic</b> and zygotic life cycles.|$|E
50|$|In <b>gametic</b> meiosis, {{instead of}} {{immediately}} dividing meiotically to produce haploid cells, the zygote divides mitotically {{to produce a}} multicellular diploid individual {{or a group of}} more unicellular diploid cells. Cells from the diploid individuals then undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells or gametes. Haploid cells may divide again (by mitosis) to form more haploid cells, as in many yeasts, but the haploid phase is not the predominant life cycle phase. In most diplonts, mitosis occurs only in the diploid phase, i.e. gametes usually form quickly and fuse to produce diploid zygotes.|$|E
50|$|P. lucida can hybridise with Poeciliopsis monacha. When a male P. lucida {{mates with}} a female P monacha, the {{offspring}} are diploid and are all female. If a male P. lucida mates with these females, the offspring are all female but are triploid. The all-female status is maintained by {{a process known as}} hybridogenesis. The sperm is incorporated for a single generation and then excluded during the formation of the ovum. The triploid individual reproduces by gynogenesis, a process triggered by the presence of sperm but not involving <b>gametic</b> fusion.|$|E
50|$|Cycling meiosis and {{fertilization}} events {{produces a}} series of transitions {{back and forth between}} alternating haploid and diploid states. The organism phase of the life cycle can occur either during the diploid state (<b>gametic</b> or diploid life cycle), during the haploid state (zygotic or haploid life cycle), or both (sporic or haplodiploid life cycle, in which there are two distinct organism phases, one during the haploid state and the other during the diploid state). In this sense there are three types of life cycles that utilize sexual reproduction, differentiated by the location of the organism phase(s).|$|E
50|$|Gustavia angustifolia has a <b>gametic</b> {{chromosome}} number of n=17. The inflorescence of G. angustifolia is racemose and terminal, occurring {{at the end}} of the branches. Each raceme typically has 4-10 flowers and each flower has 8 petals. The pedicels of the flowers range from 35mm-100mm in length. The buds of G.angustifolia are tomentose with a gray coloration. These flowers can grow to be 10 cm-14.5 cm in diameter. The petals have an elliptical shape and are 50-65mm long and 20-25 mm wide. The androecium of G.angustifolia is fused. The fruit are globe shaped with a flat summit.|$|E
50|$|Aneuploidy {{may also}} occur within {{a group of}} closely related species. Classic {{examples}} in plants are the genus Crepis, where the <b>gametic</b> (= haploid)numbers form the series x = 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; and Crocus, where every number from x = 3 to x = 15 is represented {{by at least one}} species. Evidence of various kinds shows that trends of evolution have gone in different directions in different groups. Closer to home, the great apes have 24x2 chromosomes whereas humans have 23x2. Human chromosome 2 was formed by a merger of ancestral chromosomes, reducing the number.|$|E
