It is straight down at the North Magnetic Pole and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0°) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured with a <b>dip</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 15 May 1831 Abernethy was on James Ross's team of six which {{attempted}} {{to reach the}} North Magnetic Pole. They were equipped with a <b>dip</b> <b>circle</b> and on 1 July they reached [...] where the angle of dip was 89°59'. For two days they retested using different observers at slightly different locations attaining an average 89°59'28" [...] so discovering a slight daily change {{in the position of}} the magnetic pole. This {{was the first time the}} magnetic pole had been reached and, inevitably, they erected the Union Jack. Ross decided to explore a few miles further north before turning back so he chose Abernethy as his sole companion. On returning to the ship Ross named an island they passed after Abernethy. In 21 days they had travelled about 300 miles and the map they had been able to draw remained the standard for over 100 years.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the hot {{corrosion}} resistance of conventional YSZ TBC system, the Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay coating has been successfully produced {{on the surface of}} YSZ by the Sol-gel route. The YSZ substrates were coated with boehmite sol by dip coating process, dried to form a gel film and calcined at 1200 C to form {alpha}-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay. The microstructures of TBC and Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that micro-pores ranged from 3 {micro}m to 20 {micro}m and micro-cracks could be clearly seen on the surface of APS YSZ coating. The thickness of alumina overlay increased with increasing the number of <b>dip</b> coating <b>circles.</b> The small microcracks (0. 5 - 1. 0 {micro}m width) on the YSZ surface could be filled and blocked by calcined alumina particles, whereas large pores remained empty and the alumina overlay was un-continuous after one time <b>dip</b> coating <b>circle.</b> Alumina overlay thicker than 5 m m obtained by five times <b>dip</b> coating <b>circles</b> largely cracked after calcinations. As a result, multiple dip coatings up to three times were ideal for getting high quality, crack- free and continuous overlay. The optimal thickness of alumina overlay was in the range of 2. 5 - 3. 5 {micro}m. In the next reporting period, we will study the hot corrosion behaviors of YSZ TBC with Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay coating produced by sol gel route by exposure the samples to molten salts mixtures (Na{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } + 5 %V{sub 2 }O{sub 5 }) at 950 C...|$|R

50|$|Early dip circles {{were not}} {{accurate}} and gave poor results. Over the next 300 years many improvements were made, including reducing the {{friction between the}} needle and its pivot and encasing the circle in glass. Between the late 18th century and late 19th century the design approached its peak. Improvements which made the <b>dip</b> <b>circle</b> a practical aid for polar navigation were made by Robert Were Fox FRS, who developed in the 1830s the first <b>dip</b> <b>circle</b> {{that could be used}} on board a moving ship. Another important improvement to the instrument was developed in the 1830s by the Dublin Physicist Humphrey Lloyd, who devised a way of attaching a magnetic needle at right-angles to the dip needle in order to measure the intensity of force (by seeing {{the extent to which the}} right-angle needle deflected the dip-needle).|$|E

5000|$|Magnetic dip, dip angle, or {{magnetic}} inclination is the angle {{made with the}} horizontal by the Earth's magnetic field lines. This angle varies at different points on the Earth's surface. Positive values of inclination indicate that the magnetic field of the Earth is pointing downward, into the Earth, {{at the point of}} measurement, and negative values indicate that it is pointing upward. The dip angle is in principle the angle made by the needle of a vertically held compass, though in practice ordinary compass needles may be weighted against dip or may be unable to move freely in the correct plane. The value can be measured more reliably with a special instrument typically known as a <b>dip</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A compass must be {{balanced}} {{to counter the}} tendency of the needle to dip {{in the direction of}} the Earth's field. Otherwise, it will not spin freely. Often, compasses that are balanced for one latitude do not work as well at a different latitude. This problem was first reported by Georg Hartmann, a vicar in Nuremberg, in 1544. Robert Norman was the first to recognize that this occurs because the Earth's field itself is tilted from the vertical. In his book The Newe Attractive, Norman called inclination [...] "a newe discouered secret and subtil propertie concernyng the Declinyng of the Needle." [...] He created a compass in which the needle was floated in a goblet of water, attached to a cork to make it neutrally buoyant. The needle could orient itself in any direction, so it dipped to align itself with the Earth's field. Norman also created a <b>dip</b> <b>circle,</b> a compass needle pivoted about a horizontal axis, to measure the effect.|$|E

After all, the instrument is thoght to be adequate for field-observation.

40|$|A {{survey of}} {{geomagnetic}} dip was repeated by the <b>dip</b> <b>circle</b> {{used in the}} first survey in 1939. Remarkable changes in dip were not observed at any place in the Sakura-zima Island but one situated quite near the new lavaflow.

Measurement of tilt of the ground was also repeated in the same manner as in April. Most of bench-marks having bean destroyed, during Apr. ～Oct., only three groups of them remained. At these stations, the ground tilted towards the same direction as before(See Fig. 4), and its daily rate of the tilt decreased to 1 / 9 of that of April. The topographic distribution of direction of tilt suggests that the island consists of more than three blocks. A topographic survey near the new crater was carried out by a mountain barometer and a clinometer...|$|E
