She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.|$|E

In the measurement of gamma rays or other <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation,</b> a radiation monitor or dosimeter will commonly use a filter to attenuate those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body, while letting through those that do the most damage, so that any source of radiation may be measured in terms of its true danger rather than just its 'strength'.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiations</b> on ageing is still controversial. Since Hayflick established the concept hat diploid cells have finite lifespan in vitro, {{human diploid fibroblast}} (HDF) cultures have been recognised as a potent experimental model for cyto-gerontological investigations. In this study HDF cultures in phase II were exposed to acute irradiation with either X-rays or fast neutrons. The replicative potentials and labelling indices with [3 H]thymidine were measured post irradiation until the cultures ceased growth in phase III. Cell mortality was measured by cloning. The apparent loss in replica-tive potential of irradiated mass cultures was wholly attributable {{to the loss of}} viable clonogenic ells. The current concept of precocious clonal senescence in vitro as a late effect of irradiation in clonogenic survivors is not supported by the present experiments. Instead, our results suggest hat exposure to a single dose of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiations</b> either causes total replicative incapacitation (killing) of HDF cells and their progeny early after irradiation or leaves their replicative potentials unperturbed...|$|R
25|$|While {{significantly}} {{resistant to}} heat and radiation, endospores can {{be destroyed by burning}} or by autoclaving at a temperature exceeding {{the boiling point}} of water, 100°C. Endospores are able to survive at 100°C for hours, although the longer the number of hours the fewer that will survive. An indirect way to destroy them is to place them in an environment that reactivates them to their vegetative state. They will germinate within a day or two with the right environmental conditions, and then the vegetative cells, not as hardy as endospores, can be straightforwardly destroyed. This indirect method is called Tyndallization. It was the usual method for a while in the late 19th century before the introduction of inexpensive autoclaves. Prolonged exposure to <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation,</b> such as x-rays and gamma rays, will also kill most endospores.|$|E
25|$|The fMRI {{technique}} can complement or supplement {{other techniques}} {{because of its}} unique strengths and gaps. It can noninvasively record brain signals without risks of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> inherent in other scanning methods, such as CT or PET scans. It can also record signal from all regions of the brain, unlike EEG/MEG, which are biased toward the cortical surface. But fMRI temporal resolution is poorer than that of EEG since the HDR takes tens of seconds to climb to its peak. Combining EEG with fMRI is hence potentially powerful because the two have complementary strengths—EEG has high temporal resolution, and fMRI high spatial resolution. But simultaneous acquisition needs {{to account for the}} EEG signal from varying blood flow triggered by the fMRI gradient field, and the EEG signal from the static field. For details, see EEG vs fMRI.|$|E
25|$|The primary form of fMRI {{uses the}} blood-oxygen-level {{dependent}} (BOLD) contrast, discovered by Seiji Ogawa. This {{is a type}} of specialized brain and body scan used to map neural activity in the brain or spinal cord of humans or other animals by imaging the change in blood flow (hemodynamic response) related to energy use by brain cells. Since the early 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate brain mapping research because it does not require people to undergo shots or surgery, to ingest substances, or to be exposed to <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation.</b> This measure is frequently corrupted by noise from various sources; hence, statistical procedures are used to extract the underlying signal. The resulting brain activation can be graphically represented by color-coding the strength of activation across the brain or the specific region studied. The technique can localize activity to within millimeters but, using standard techniques, no better than within a window of a few seconds. Other methods of obtaining contrast are arterial spin labeling and diffusion MRI. The latter procedure is similar to BOLD fMRI but provides contrast based on the magnitude of diffusion of water molecules in the brain.|$|E

Irritants are typically thought of as chemical agents (for example phenol and capsaicin) but mechanical, thermal (heat), and radiative stimuli (for example ultraviolet light or <b>ionising</b> <b>radiations)</b> can also be irritants.

40|$|Recent work using low-doses of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiations,</b> both {{in vitro}} and in ViVO, has {{suggested}} that the responses of biological systems in the region of less than 1 Gray may not be predicted by simple extrapolation from the responses at higher doses. Additional experiments, using high-LET radiations at doses of much less than one alpha particle traversal per cell nucleus, have shown responses in a greater number of cells than have received a radiation dose. These findings, and increased concern over the effects of the exposure of the general population to low-levels of background radiation, for example due to radon daughters in the lungs, have stimulated the investigation of the response of mammalian cells to <b>ionising</b> <b>radiations</b> in the extreme low-dose region. In all broad field exposures to particulate radiations at low-dose levels an inherent dose uncertainty exists due to random counting statistics. This dose variation produces a range of values for the measured biological effect within the irradiated population, therefore making the elucidation of the dose-effect relationship extremely difficult.

500|$|At St Bartholomew's, Rotblat {{worked on}} the effects of {{radiation}} on living organisms, especially on aging and fertility. This led him to an interest in nuclear fallout, especially strontium-90 and the safe limits of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation.</b> In 1955, he demonstrated that the contamination caused by the fallout after the Castle Bravo test at Bikini Atoll nuclear test by the United States would have been far greater than that stated officially. [...] Until then the official line had been that the growth in the strength of atomic bombs was not accompanied by an equivalent growth in radioactivity released. [...] Japanese scientists who had collected data from a fishing vessel, the Lucky Dragon, which had inadvertently been exposed to fallout, disagreed with this. Rotblat was able to deduce that the bomb had three stages and showed that the fission phase {{at the end of the}} explosion increased the amount of radioactivity by forty times. His paper was taken up by the media and contributed to the public debate that resulted in the ending of atmospheric tests by the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.|$|E
500|$|Bomb {{development}} {{called for}} large detectors of <b>ionising</b> <b>radiation,</b> whose response {{is proportional to}} the energy released in the detector and follows rapid changes in radiation intensity. [...] From the earliest research on radioactivity, radiation had been measured in terms of Ionisation, but existing Ionisation chambers were slow to respond to changes. [...] To address this problem, Rossi and Staub carried out a careful analysis of the pulses that result when individual charged particles create ions within an ionisation chamber. [...] They realised that the high mobility of free electrons removed from ionised atoms means that the pulses produced by single particles can be very brief. [...] With James S. Allen, Rossi found gas mixtures of high electron mobility and low electron attachment. [...] On the basis of these investigations, Allen and Rossi invented the [...] "fast ionisation chamber", which they patented after the war. [...] It was a crucial factor in the success of the Manhattan Project and became widely used in postwar research on particle physics.|$|E
