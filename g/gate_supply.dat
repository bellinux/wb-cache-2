40|$|Current-based gate {{modeling}} {{achieves a}} new level of accuracy in nanoscale design timing and signal integrity analysis. However, to generate current-based gate models requires additional pre-characterization of the gate, e. g., {{in the form of a}} new or an extended timing library format. We construct current-based gate models based on the existing Liberty timing library format without further pre-characterization. We present an inverse problem formulation, and propose to solve the problem by quadratic polynomial regression. Our constructed current-based gate models find applications in timing, power, and signal integrity verifications for improved accuracy in library-compatible flows, e. g., to include power supply voltage drop effect in gate delay calculation without further pre-characterization, to calculate <b>gate</b> <b>supply</b> current, etc. Our experimental results show our constructed currentbased gate models achieve slightly less accurate results, e. g., within 4. 6 %(8. 6 %), than pre-characterized current-based gate models, e. g., within 4. 3 %(4. 4 %), of SPICE results in gate delay calculation for ideal (degraded) power supply voltage, and accurate <b>gate</b> <b>supply</b> current calculation. ...|$|E
40|$|Assigning <b>gate</b> <b>supply</b> voltage and {{transistor}} threshold voltages to a {{range of}} discrete values is a combinatorial problem. The optimization computational difficulty grows exponentially with the netlist size. Whereas, if the range of values is continuous, we show that the global optimum can be found in polynomial time. We show that posynomials can model variable supply and threshold voltages, with skewed gate drive strengths. The models have root mean square (RMS) errors of 10 % or less compared to 0. 13 um SPICE data. With these models, geometric programming gives a convex problem formulation with globally optimal solutions for minimum delay, energy×delay, or power. For the examples considered, dual voltage and continuous voltage solutions reduce power by up to 22 % compared to the optimal solution using single supply and thresholds voltages. 1...|$|E

40|$|A voltage-controlled {{oscillator}} (VCO) that operates {{in the frequency}} range from 77. 5 to 83. 5 GHz has been constructed {{in the form of}} a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) that includes high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs). This circuit is a prototype of electronically tunable signal sources in the 75 -to- 110 -GHz range, needed for communication, imaging, and automotive radar applications, among others. This oscillator (see Figure 1) includes two AlInAs/GaInAs/InP HEMTs. One HEMT serves mainly as an oscillator gain element. The other HEMT serves mainly as a varactor for controlling the frequency: the frequency-control element is its gate-to-source capacitance, which is varied by changing its <b>gate</b> <b>supply</b> voltage. The gain HEMT is biased for class-A operation (meaning that current is conducted throughout the oscillation cycle). Grounded coplanar waveguides are used as impedance-matching transmission lines, the input and output matching being chosen to sustain oscillation and maximize output power. Air bridges are placed at discontinuities to suppress undesired slot electromagnetic modes. A high density of vias is necessary for suppressing a parallel-plate electromagnetic mode that is undesired because it can propagate energy into the MMIC substrate. Previous attempts at constructing HEMT-based oscillators yielded circuits with relatively low levels of output power and narrow tuning ranges. For example, one HEMT VCO reported in the literature had an output power of 7 dBm (. 5 mW) and a tuning range 2 -GHz wide centered approximately at a nominal frequency of 77 GHz. In contrast, as shown in Figure 2, the present MMIC HEMT VCO puts out a power of 12. 5 dBm (. 18 mW) or more over the 6 -GHz-wide frequency range from 77. 5 to 83. 5 GH...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With {{increasing}} {{contribution of}} leakage in total active power, run-time leakage control techniques are becoming extremely important. <b>Supply</b> <b>gating</b> provides an effective, low-overhead and technology scalable approach for active leakage reduction through the well-known “stacking effect”. However, conventional <b>supply</b> <b>gating</b> approaches are typically coarse-grained in both space and time- i. e. {{are applied to}} large datapath or memory blocks when an entire logic/memory block is idle for sufficiently long period. They suffer from limited applicability at run time. On the other hand, fine-grained <b>supply</b> <b>gating</b> is constrained primarily by the large wake-up delay and wake-up power overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained width-aware dynamic <b>supply</b> <b>gating</b> (WADSG) approach to reduce both active leakage and redundant switching power in datapath and embedded memory (e. g. L 1 /L 2 cache). The approach exploits the abundance of narrow-width (NW) operands in general-purpose and embedded applications to “supply-gate ” unused parts of integer execution units and memory blocks while they are in use. We introduce a novel levelized gating strategy to virtually eliminate the wake-up delay overhead. We employ the proposed WADSG approach to a superscalar processor. To reduce the wake-up power we use a width-aware instruction issue policy. In case of L 1 and L 2 cache, we store the width information per “ways ” of associative cache and supply-gate the most significant bits of the NW ways. We also propose a width-aware block allocation and replacement policy to maximize the number of NW ways. Simulation results for 45 nm technology with Spec 2 k benchmarks show major savings (34. 5 %) in total processor power (considering both switching and active leakage power) with no performance impact. As a by-product, the proposed scheme also improves the thermal profile of both datapath and memory...|$|R
