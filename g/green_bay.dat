5|$|Another freeway section {{from north}} of <b>Green</b> <b>Bay</b> to Suamico was opened in 1971. In 1972, the divided-highway segment between Suamico and Abrams opened, {{and the state}} started the {{construction}} of additional freeways between <b>Green</b> <b>Bay</b> and Milwaukee. The bypasses of Sheboygan and Cedar Grove were converted to full freeways in 1973. Another segment of freeway opened in 1975 that bypassed Port Washington and connected the freeway sections that ended near Grafton and Cedar Grove. I-43 was first designated on the 1978 official state highway map along US141 from Milwaukee to Sheboygan; missing segments of I-43 between <b>Green</b> <b>Bay</b> and Milwaukee are shown as either under construction or proposed. By 1980, the northern bypass of <b>Green</b> <b>Bay</b> was under construction and I-43/US141 was open from Maribel to Branch northwest of Manitowoc; US141 was truncated to end at {{the northern end of}} the Sheboygan bypass. I-43 was initially completed in 1981, and the southern terminus of US141 was moved again, truncating the highway to end in Bellevue by 1983.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{original}} incorporated city of Chicago in 1837, Rush Street is one of the city's oldest thoroughfares.

Early Rush Street was commonly agreed to be desirable place of residence, and hosted the first house designed by an architect in Chicago (designed for the first Mayor of Chicago William Ogden by John M. Van Osdel). The house, bounded by Erie, Ontario, Rush and Cass (now Wabash Avenue) Streets, did not survive the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.|$|E

5|$|When the US Highway System {{was formed}} on November 11, 1926, US141 ran from Milwaukee to <b>Green</b> <b>Bay,</b> and one {{segment of the}} modern highway in Michigan was {{originally}} designated US102. This other designation was decommissioned in 1928 when US141 was extended north from <b>Green</b> <b>Bay</b> into Michigan. Michigan has rebuilt the highway in stages {{over the years to}} smooth out sharp curves in the routing. Since the 1960s, the section south of <b>Green</b> <b>Bay</b> has been converted into a freeway in segments. US141 has ended southeast of <b>Green</b> <b>Bay</b> in Bellevue since the 1980s—the southern freeway segment was redesignated as I-43. The section north of Abrams, Wisconsin, was converted to a freeway in the opening years of the 21st century, with an additional divided-highway section opening a few years later.|$|E
