5|$|According to Kinne's later testimony, on the {{afternoon}} of May 26 she contacted Patricia Jones at Jones's office and told her that Walter Jones {{was having an affair with}} Kinne's sister.

5|$|During the season, Woodfull's {{physical}} courage, stoic {{and dignified}} leadership won him many admirers. He refused to employ retaliatory tactics {{and did not}} publicly complain even though {{he and his men}} were repeatedly hit— according to Ken Piesse, 34 times in all. Once the issue was resolved, and practice stopped, Woodfull refused to <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> fearing that it would disturb the peace.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the magistrates}} {{delegated}} Henry Law {{to go to}} London to <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> with Lord Sidmouth, the Home Secretary. On the way, Law stopped at the barracks of the Royston troop of volunteer yeomanry cavalry and requested they go to Ely. Law was unable to convince Sidmouth {{of the seriousness of}} the situation, and Sidmouth asked Reverend Sir Henry Bate Dudley to return with Law and report on the matter.|$|E
5|$|My {{object in}} {{writing to you}} at present is merely to draw your {{attention}} to the subject, and to suggest a friendly conference to <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> more fully.

5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E

5|$|A series frontiersmen {{assemblies}} {{were held}} {{over several years}} across the Willamette Valley, with many on the French Prairie at Champoeg. The death of prominent settler Ewing Young on 9 February 1841, who left neither a will or had an heir in Oregon Country, left the future of his property uncertain. Jason Lee chaired the first meeting organised to <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> on the 17th. He proposed {{the creation of an}} authority over the pioneers centered on a governor. French-Canadian settlers blocked the measure and instead a probate judge and a few other positions were appointed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the short}} {{existence}} of the Council, it became involved with regulating the fur trade. The Council feared furs contaminated with smallpox would be exported outside the quarantine zone. The Council invited {{people involved in the}} fur trade from Keewatin, Manitoba, and even the United States government to <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> The purpose of the meeting was to solicit testimony and gain the support of the industry, so that the Council could effectively draft, implement and enforce legislation.|$|E
5|$|In San Antonio de Béxar, Ugartechea asked Dr. Launcelot Smither, a Gonzales {{resident}} in town on personal business, to help Castañeda convince the settlers to follow orders. When Smither arrived on October 1, {{he met with}} militia captain Mathew Caldwell to explain that the soldiers meant no harm if the settlers would peacefully relinquish the cannon. Caldwell instructed Smither to bring Castañeda to the town the following morning to <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> At roughly the same time, Moore called a war council, which quickly voted to initiate a fight. It is unclear whether the war council was aware that Caldwell had promised Castañeda safe passage to Gonzales the next morning.|$|E

5|$|The Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to {{join their}} {{exhibition}} basketball squad. Russell, who was sensitive to any racial prejudice, was enraged {{by the fact that}} owner Abe Saperstein would only <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> with Woolpert. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes. The USF center was livid after this snub and declined the offer: he reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart to speak with him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint {{received}} the models from Ortmayer. On May 23 its superintendent, Edwin Dressel, sent O'Reilly a memorandum from Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, {{stating that the}} sculptor's models were in too high relief, and suggesting that Ortmayer come to the mint to <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> A letter from O'Reilly to Melish on June 18 reports that after some modification, Sinnock wrote that the coin was at the very limit of high relief that the mint could coin, and that dies for the Cincinnati piece {{were expected to be}} tested by coining trial strikes in early July.|$|E
5|$|As Captain Picard and Commander Data (Brent Spiner) <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> {{with the}} Ventaxian leader (Marcelo Tubert), a woman {{appears in the}} chamber, announcing herself as Ardra. She proves her {{identity}} by starting an earthquake at will, and transforming into both the Christian and then the Klingon devil. Ardra states that {{she has come to}} claim the planet. Picard is instantly suspicious and orders Data to examine the contract that supposedly was signed by Ardra and the leaders of the planet a thousand years ago. Picard returns to the Enterprise afterwards, and Ardra appears on the bridge sitting in the Captain's chair. Security Chief Worf (Michael Dorn) tries to remove her without success, Data returns just then and confirms the language of the contract as well as Ardra's claim to the planet, including anything in orbit, including the Enterprise.|$|E

5|$|Chandler, who {{was also}} {{allegedly}} at the meeting, made no public mention of it until a 1972 interview. In the interview, Chandler then corroborated the essentials of Rickey's story, although he placed the meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in January 1947. He also recounted that later in 1947, Rickey came {{to his home in}} Kentucky to <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> further. According to Chandler, Rickey professed that he would not move forward with Robinson's transfer unless he had Chandler's full support, which Chandler subsequently pledged. Aside from Chandler's anecdote, which he frequently repeated after the 1972 interview, {{there is no evidence that}} his meeting with Rickey ever took place. Nevertheless, future baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn and Washington Post sportswriter Bob Addie maintained that Robinson would not have played had it not been for Chandler's intervention.|$|E
5|$|In January 1917, {{a second}} mounted division– the Imperial Mounted Division– was formed from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and the British 5th and 6th Yeomanry Brigades. A British regular army officer fresh from {{experience}} in the Senussi Campaign, Major General Sir H. W. Hodgson, was appointed to command, with an all-British staff. The deliberate mixing of Australian and Imperial troops was done with Chauvel's approval but was contrary to {{the policy of the}} Australian Government, which soon registered its displeasure, sending Brigadier General Sir Robert Anderson to Cairo to <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> frankly with Chauvel and his superiors. As a result, the Imperial Mounted Division was renamed the Australian Mounted Division.|$|E
5|$|Revolt also flared in {{neighbouring}} Kent. Sir Simon de Burley, a close {{associate of}} both Edward III {{and the young}} Richard, had claimed that a man in Kent, called Robert Belling, was an escaped serf {{from one of his}} estates. Burley sent two sergeants to Gravesend, where Belling was living, to reclaim him. Gravesend's local bailiffs and Belling tried to negotiate a solution under which Burley would accept a sum of money in return for dropping his case, but this failed and Belling was taken away to be imprisoned at Rochester Castle. A furious group of local people gathered at Dartford, possibly on 5 June, to <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> From there the rebels travelled to Maidstone, where they stormed the gaol, and then onto Rochester on 6 June. Faced by the angry crowds, the constable in charge of Rochester Castle surrendered it without a fight and Belling was freed.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Rakesh tells Raj about {{a defect}} in the company's new mobile handset: a call goes to two people simultaneously—the {{intended}} recipient and another random person on the phone's contact list. Raj needs Sonia's permission to stop production, and she invites him to her house to <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> Sonia makes provocative and sexually explicit statements to Raj, who ignores her. She then aggressively tries to pursue Raj, who resists. Although he repeatedly rejects her advances, Sonia continues trying to seduce him. As he leaves, Sonia threatens to punish him for spurning her. The next day, he learns that Sonia has told her husband that he sexually harassed her. Since he has admitted finding Sonia attractive, his claim of innocence is not believed, and the company pressures him into resignation.|$|E
5|$|After {{a horrible}} night, Quagmire {{approaches}} Lois about talking to Brenda about leaving Jeff. At lunch, Lois and Brenda begin {{talking about the}} situation, and requests that Brenda remove her sunglasses, revealing a bruise over her eye. Upon seeing this, Lois tries to convince Brenda to leave Jeff, but Brenda only makes excuses for Jeff's treatment of her, much to Lois' disapproval. Later, at the bar, Peter, Quagmire and Joe <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> asking if the police can solve the situation. Joe then suggests that the group have an intervention with Brenda, where Quagmire confesses that the sister he knew growing up no longer exists, and he wants her back. The two then embrace each other by hugging, until Jeff enters the intervention, causing an enraged Quagmire {{to tell him that}} Brenda has agreed to leave him. Pressured by Jeff, Brenda reveals that the two are engaged, and that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Carpender was not inflexible, {{and reached}} a {{compromise}} with Mackay to transport a battalion to Finschhafen in high speed transports (APDs). Herring was in Dobodura, lunching with Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, {{when he heard}} this news. He decided to fly to Milne Bay to <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> of resupply in general with Barbey. On 28 September, Herring {{and two of his}} staff officers, Brigadiers R. B. Sutherland and R. Bierwirth, boarded a U.S. Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bomber at Dobodura. As the plane was about to take off, the undercarriage collapsed and the plane ploughed into the Marston Mat runway. A propeller shattered, splinters ripped through the fuselage into the cabin and Sutherland, who was sitting in the navigator's compartment next to Herring, was struck by a flying fragment that killed him instantly. The crew, Herring and Bierwirth escaped shaken but unscathed. The trip to Milne Bay was cancelled. Brigadier Sutherland was buried with full military honours at Soputa the next day, with a fly past by B-25s. When next he flew, Herring once again took a B-25 and made a point of requesting the major who had been in charge of the crashed plane to be his pilot.|$|E
