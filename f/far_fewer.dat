One of the major {{differences between the two}} E-9 ranks is that master gunnery sergeants retain their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), while sergeants major are given a new MOS to reflect their general command focus. This reinforces the master gunnery sergeant's role as a provider of technical military leadership.|$|E

The album, however, sold <b>far</b> <b>fewer</b> copies in the UK than his record label EMI had predicted.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of the Taylor Report in January 1990, Sunderland was obliged to make plans to turn their Roker Park home into an all-seater stadium. Roker Park was a ground that mainly {{consisted}} of standing terraces, and if converted into all-seater it would have held <b>far</b> <b>fewer</b> spectators than before. Enclosed by residential streets on all sides, expansion was practically impossible. So, by 1991, Sunderland chairman Bob Murray began investigating the possibility of relocation to a new stadium.|$|E

5|$|Dragonflies {{are found}} on every {{continent}} except Antarctica. In {{contrast to the}} damselflies (Zygoptera), which tend to have restricted distributions, some genera and species are found across continents.

The globe skimmer Pantala flavescens is probably the most widespread dragonfly species in the world; it is cosmopolitan, occurring on all continents in the warmer regions. Most Anisoptera species are tropical, with <b>far</b> <b>fewer</b> species in temperate regions.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to 2008, {{there was no}} organised dissent against Mugabe within ZANU-PF. The party elite decided to avoid the violence that had marred 2008's election {{so as not to}} undermine its credibility, particularly {{in the eyes of the}} SADC, thus allowing Zimbabwe's government to consolidate its rule without interference. Mugabe called upon supporters to avoid violence, and attended <b>far</b> <b>fewer</b> rallies than in past elections, in part because of his advanced age and in part to ensure that those rallies he did attend were larger. The ZANU-PF offered gifts, including food and clothing, to many members of the electorate to encourage them to vote for the party.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondrial genomes have <b>far</b> <b>fewer</b> genes {{than the}} {{bacteria}} {{from which they}} {{are thought to be}} descended. Although some have been lost altogether, many have been transferred to the nucleus, such as the respiratory complex II protein subunits. This is thought to be relatively common over evolutionary time. A few organisms, such as the Cryptosporidium, actually have mitochondria that lack any DNA, presumably because all their genes have been lost or transferred. In Cryptosporidium, the mitochondria have an altered ATP generation system that renders the parasite resistant to many classical mitochondrial inhibitors such as cyanide, azide, and atovaquone.|$|E

Even though a wider array of targets {{was assigned to the}} task groups, from the Pescadores to northern Luzon and Formosa, <b>far</b> <b>fewer</b> enemies were encountered in the air. Results of the day's strike operations were hard to ascertain due to the overcast. Pilots' reports from these two days of strikes helped uncover a larger network of air bases on Formosa than previously anticipated. This knowledge, combined with radio intercepts and the dusk strikes fended off the previous evening, led Commander Task Force 38 Mitscher to cancel any strikes scheduled to take off after 14:00 hours. Instead, the task groups prepared to defend against another night assault.|$|E

The front runner Lojze Peterle, supported by the governing conservative coalition, won the first round with <b>far</b> <b>fewer</b> votes than predicted by opinion polls. In the second round, held on 11 November 2007, Peterle faced the runner-up, the left-wing candidate Danilo Türk. Türk won the second round in a landslide, with 68.03% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{relied on}} a {{logistical}} system which was very lean and substantially smaller than the United Nations' system. This logistics network was therefore capable of moving <b>far</b> <b>fewer</b> supplies, and this caused considerable difficulty for front-line troops. Based on the efficient Soviet model, this ground-based network relied primarily on railroads to transport supplies to the front while troops transported those items to the individual units on foot, trucks, or carts. This second effort, though more versatile, was also a substantial disadvantage because it was less efficient and often too slow to follow the moving front-line units.|$|E
