50|$|In {{plant tissue}} culture IBA and other auxins are used to {{initiate}} root formation in vitro in a procedure called micropropagation. Micropropagation of plants {{is the process of}} using small samples of plants called explants and causing them to undergo growth of differentiated or undifferentiated cells. In connection with cytokinins like kinetin, auxins like IBA can be used to cause the formation of masses of undifferentiated cells called callus. Callus formation is often used as a first step process in micropropagation where the callus cells are then caused to form other tissues such as roots by exposing them to certain hormones like auxins that produce roots. The process of callus to root formation is called <b>indirect</b> <b>organogenesis</b> whereas if roots are formed from the explant directly it is called direct organogenesis.|$|E
30|$|As it was mentioned, the {{relation}} of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>organogenesis</b> changed depending on the cytokinin-to-auxin ratio. In summary, with increasing BAP concentration the contribution of <b>indirect</b> <b>organogenesis</b> in general regeneration response increased. However, it seems that indirect/direct organogenesis ratio in hypocotyls slightly decreases when BAP/NAA was around the middle values e.g. BAP/NAA[*]≈[*] 10. While a less or more extreme cytokinin-to-auxin relation was used (like BAP/NAA[*]≈[*] 5 or 20), intermediate callus appeared. However, {{it is difficult to}} confront such an observation since it was made for a particular concentration of PGRs (plant growth regulators) and a particular cultivar.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the development of plant regeneration protocols for Bienertia sinuspersici, one of three species of the family Chenopodiaceae that were discovered to perform C 4 photosynthesis in individual chlorenchyma cells. Protocols for in vitro regeneration of B. sinuspersici were developed as follows: 1) vegetative propagation via adventitious root induction of cuttings was optimized; 2) direct organogenesis and plant regeneration using bud cultures was achieved; 3) plant regeneration via <b>indirect</b> <b>organogenesis</b> of stem-derived callus was established. All plant materials were obtained from mature, greenhouse grown B. sinuspersici plants and cultured in vitro on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal media supplemented with phytohormones. Vegetative propagation by adventitious root formation of cuttings was examined using various strengths of MS medium as well as the effects of auxins [2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D), indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA), and α-napthalene acetic acid (NAA) ] on root development. Half-strength MS medium and IBA were most effective for adventitious root induction. Histological analysis of root anatomy demonstrated the various effects of individual auxin on root development. Direct organogenesis via bud culture for shoot multiplication and plant regeneration was established. Shoot multiplication occurred on medium supplemented with a cytokinin, 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP). Elongation of multiplied shoots was achieved using medium containing a lower concentration of BAP or gibberellic acid. Rooting of elongated shoots was attempted using IBA in vitro or ex vitro, and through micrografting. Rooted shoots were transplanted to soil, acclimated in the greenhouse, and transferred to a growth chamber. Plant regeneration via <b>indirect</b> <b>organogenesis</b> was also established. Stem explants were cultured on medium containing kinetin and 2, 4 -D to induce callus formation. Shoot organogenesis from callus tissue was obtained on medium containing thidiazuron (TDZ). In vitro-derived shoots were transferred to medium containing BAP for shoot multiplication, and subsequently elongated and rooted as described above. Histological analysis of leaves of regenerated plants from both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>organogenesis</b> methods showed chlorenchyma cells have the distinctive feature, intracellular compartmentalization of organelles, of the single-cell C 4 system. Immunoblot analysis of proteins isolated from leaves of regenerated plants detected key C 4 photosynthetic enzymes, providing further evidence that single-cell C 4 photosynthesis is present. Cytological analysis of root tips from in vitro-derived plants via <b>indirect</b> <b>organogenesis</b> verified normal diploid chromosome number (2 n= 18) in dividing cells, suggesting neither polyploidy nor aneuploidy occurred in regenerated plants.

Both the explants were initially inoculated on Murashige and Skoogs (MS) Basal medium. After a week they were transferred to MS medium supplemented with combinations of 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP) and Indole- 3 - butyric acid (IBA). MS medium supplemented with 3. 0 and 5. 0 µM IBA with 27. 0 µM BAP supported quick callus initiation, while increasing the concentration of IBA to 7. 5 µM led to delay in callusing. Emergence of shoot bud was first observed on medium supplemented with 27. 0 µM BAP with 3. 0 µM IBA. Of the combinations reported here 3. 0 µM IBA with 4. 5 µM and 27. 0 µM BAP was found to be the best suitable medium for promoting multiple shoot regeneration with offshoot measuring 1. 5 - 2. 0 cm. Rooting was observed on MS basal medium...|$|E
40|$|Plants of {{the genus}} Valeriana produce irioid esters of biotechnological interest, known as valepotriates. The {{regeneration}} of Valeriana edulis ssp. procera via <b>indirect</b> <b>organogenesis</b> and somatic embryogenesis from leaf-derived callus and suspension cultures, is presented. For induction of callus, leaves were cultured on semisolid MS medium supplemented with 2, 4 -dichLorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and kinetin. Embryogenic and organogenic callus development was observed after 16 weeks. Calli were transferred to semisolid and liquid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with kinetin and 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Appearance of shoot and somatic embryo occurred 4 weeks later. Shoots were rooted and somatic embryos were germinated and were transferred to the greenhouse. A better organogenic and embryogenic response was observed from suspension cultures. Histological observations of morphogenic callus revealed that both somatic embryos and shoots arose from {{the same type of}} callus. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|AbstractThe current survey {{exemplifies the}} {{achievements}} on experimental results of production of planting materials through in vitro direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>organogenesis</b> of genus Acacia. Several species of Acacia {{have been given}} due importance in tree tissue culture owing to their proven wasteland reclamation ability, ecological and economical significance. Plant cell, tissue and organ culture-based techniques have been employed in forest tree research for successful reforestation and forest management programs. The relevance of tissue culture methods has gained impetus to meet the growing demands for biomass and forest products. Ever since the last four decades, in vitro protocols are being developed with the aim to regenerate several woody species. This survey strives {{to serve as a}} compendium of various routine processes involving organogenesis of Acacia via in vitro; which would encouragingly be worthwhile for researchers to exploit this perennial woody legume with enormous multidimensional value, via more innovative approaches, in order to promote the cause for its improvement...|$|E
