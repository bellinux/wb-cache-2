In this simple case, we show that writing the dissipative component of the observable response to a given excitation as the result of multiple internal processes working for equilibrium recovery (flux of internal hidden variables), can yield a recursive series in time. This can be obtained when use is made of the theorem of created entropy equipartition as a model for fluctuation regression. A distribution (spectrum) for relaxation times naturally follows.

The noctuid moth Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) consists of two strains that exhibit allochronic <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> their mating <b>time,</b> which acts as a premating isolation barrier between the strains. We investigated the genetic basis of the strain-specific timing differences to identify the molecular mechanisms of <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> circadian rhythms. Results: Through QTL analyses we identified one major Quantitative trait chromosome (QTC) underlying <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> circadian timing of mating activity. Using RADtags, we identified this QTC to be homologous to Bombyx mori C 27, on which the clock gene vrille is located, which thus became the major candidate gene. In S. frugiperda, vrille showed strain-specific polymorphisms. Also, vrille expression differed significantly between the strains, with the rice-strain showing higher expression levels than the corn-strain.

40|$|Summary Embryo {{development}} requires precise orchestration of {{cell proliferation}} and <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> both <b>time</b> and space. A molecular clock operating through gene expression oscillations was first {{described in the}} presomitic mesoderm (PSM) underlying periodic somite formation. Cycles of HES gene expression have been further identified in other progenitor cells, including the chick distal limb mesenchyme, embryonic neural progenitors and both mesenchymal and embryonic stem cells. In the limb, hairy 2 is expressed in the distal mesenchyme, adjacent to the FGF source (AER) and along the ZPA-derived SHH gradient, the two major regulators of limb development. Here we report that hairy 2 expression depends on joint AER/FGF and ZPA/SHH signaling. FGF plays an instructive role on hairy 2, mediated by Erk and Akt pathway activation, while SHH acts by creating a permissive state defined by Gli 3 -A/Gli 3 -R> 1. Moreover, we show that AER/FGF and ZPA/SHH present distinct temporal and spatial signaling properties in the distal limb mesenchyme: SHH acts at a long-term, long-range on hairy 2, while FGF has a short-term, short-range action. Our work establishes limb hairy 2 expression as an output of integrated FGF and SHH signaling <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and space, providing novel clues for understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying HES oscillations in multiple systems, including embryonic stem cell pluripotency...|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} {{dynamical}} behaviour {{of the engineering}} and physical systems, we often need to capture their continuous behaviour, which is modeled using differential equations, and perform the frequency-domain analysis of these systems. Traditionally, Fourier transform methods are used to perform this frequency domain analysis using paper-and-pencil based analytical techniques or computer simulations. However, both of these methods are error prone and thus are not suitable for analyzing systems used in safety-critical domains, like medicine and transportation. In order to provide an accurate alternative, we propose to use higher-order-logic theorem proving to conduct the frequency domain analysis of these systems. For this purpose, the paper presents a higher-order-logic formalization of Fourier transform using the HOL-Light theorem prover. In particular, we use the higher-order-logic based formalizations of differential, integral, transcendental and topological theories of multivariable calculus to formally define Fourier transform and reason about the correctness of its classical properties, such as existence, linearity, time shifting, frequency shifting, modulation, time scaling, time reversal and <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> domain, and its relationships with Fourier Cosine, Fourier Sine and Laplace transforms.

Using camera-traps, we studied the species richness, activity patterns, and habitat use of middle and large mammals in two adjacent forests, a native forest and a Eucalyptus grandis reforestation located at the Colombian Central Andes. Since the two forests were adjacent, we expected no differences between species richness in the two forests. The reforestation was a monoculture and an artificial ecosystem, thus we expected differences in activity and habitat use by mammals in the two forest types. We did not find significant differences in the species richness between the forests. The activity of Sciurus granatensis and Mazama rufina was influenced {{by the time of the}} day, and there was a temporal and spatial segregation among the soil forager species Nasua nasua, Nasuella olivacea and Dasypus novemcinctus. The species N. nasua y D. novemcinctus used the Andean forest more than the reforestation, whereas N. olivacea used the reforestation more. D. novemcinctus and N. olivacea were mainly nocturnal and/or crepuscular, whereas N. nasua was mainly active during daytime. This suggests that the creation of a new habitat, such as the reforestation, might influence the interactions among some species and apparently, could reduce interspecific competition and thus contribute to their co-existence at the study zone though niche <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and space. ...|$|E

In teleost fish, however, cell division and differentiation in the retina continue throughout {{the life of the}} animal in two distinct ways. Stem cells in a circumferential germinal zone at the periphery of the retina give rise to all retinal cell types and progenitor. cells located throughout the retina in the outer nuclear layer ONL produce new rod photoreceptors. These processes in adult retina recapitulate in space the embryonic events responsible for forming the retina. Analysis of these events in an African cichlid fish, Haplochromis burtoni, confirmed that cone photoreceptors differentiate first, followed by rod photoreceptors. Correspondingly, at the margin of the eye, cone photoreceptors differentiate nearer to the margin than do rods. Control of photoreceptor production is not understood. Here we present the time of appearance and distribution pattern of GABA and vimentin which are candidates for the control of retinal cell division and differentiation. Antibody staining reveals that both GABA and vimentin exhibit unique patterns of expression during embryonic retinal development.

40|$|Solute {{transport}} {{in natural}} formations {{at the regional}} scale is influenced by several scales of heterogeneity which correspond {{to the presence of}} several geological units called facies. As customarily assumed in stochastic theories, inside the facies the transport can be characterized by a single scale of heterogeneity. At the regional scale Several geological units are present such that a hierarchy of relevant scales needs to be defined. A possible model for this spatial variability assumes the log conductivity as a random space function of stationary increments characterized by a power law semivariogram. With this hypothesis the ergodic dispersion coefficient grows unbounded as time increases, leading to the phenomenon called anomalous dispersion, An alternative approach considers the plume in nonergodic conditions and assumes the effective dispersion coefficient, which is defined through <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> of the expected value of the spatial second-order plume moment, as representative of macrodispersion. Large differences have been observed in the resulting plume spreading while approaching the problem using the above alternative definitions. In this paper we provide first-order analytical solutions for the longitudinal effective dispersion coefficient, D-L, {{as well as for the}} expected value of the longitudinal spatial plume moment, [S- 11] that complement semianalytical expressions recently proposed in literature. Furthermore, we provide a semianalytical expression for the standard deviation of the longitudinal second-order moment which is important in assessing the interval of confidence of the estimation provided by [S- 11]. Suitable numerical simulations are performed to validate analytical and semianalytical expressions as well as to assess the impact of the cutoff in the log conductivity power spectrum imposed by choosing a finite domain dimension, We conclude that according to recently published results, the dispersion is anomalous when the Hurst coefficients, H, is larger than 0. 5 while it is Fickian for H < 0. 5. This is in contrast with the ergodic analysis which concludes that the dispersion is anomalous irrespective of the Hurst coefficient, Hence the effective dispersion coefficient is more effective than the ergodic dispersion. coefficient to represent the plume spreading. However, the standard deviation of the longitudinal spatial second-order moment is of the same order of magnitude as the expected value leading to the conclusion that the estimations provided by D-L and [S- 11] are affected by large uncertainties.

40|$|Industrial ecology {{is assumed}} as a {{conceptual}} tool emulating models derived from natural ecosystems {{and it is}} aimed at developing fundamentally new approaches to the industrial system environmentall-oriented reorganization. It implies two essential elements of definition: it is a concept involving a systemic approach to changes in goods manufacture, use and disposal {{and it is a}} concept related to the organization of new interactions among the industrial system structural components. Starting from these assumptions, this paper opens three possible paths to the theoretical implications of such a perspective: (i) the need to conceive the sustainable industrial growth as a process of co-adaptation between natural and industrial systems; (ii) the need for a better definition of the "environment " of a manufacturing system; (iii) the possibility of designing innovative interactions for manufacturers, consumers and decomposers as structural components of the industrial ecosystem. Starting from the Seventies the possibility of re-orienting the industrial system processes referring to models derived from natural ecosystems, first let emerge some relevant natural characteristics to be emulated. The attention was primarily focussed on the assumptions that (Tibbs, 1993, p. 6) : - in natural systems there's no such thing as "waste" (if it is considered as something which can not be absorbed somewhere in the system); - nutrients for one species are derived from the decay or elimination of another; - materials are constantly circulating within an ecosystem and they are continuously transformed; - a natural system is dynamic and the identity of each of its components is defined in process terms; - a natural system allows independent activity to species individuals but all species are interlinked and held in balance through cooperation and competition; - efficiency and productivity of an ecosystem are held in balance with resiliency; - each member of an ecosystem has multiple functions. Ecosystem characteristics are conventionally divided into characteristics related to structural components and characteristics related to processes. An ecosystem is in fact conventionally made up of six processes (energy flows, food chains, biological diversity in time and space, biogeochemical cycles, <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and evolution, homeostatic control mechanisms) and six structural components (organic substances, inorganic substances, climate, producing organisms, consumers and decomposers). Such characteristics - whose possible analogy with industrial processes is simple enough to be preceived even by non specialists - sinthetize the essential functioning of natural ecosystems. Models derived from ecology to be applied to industrial processes are largely simplified: the complexity of the original structure has been somehow impoverished, mainly resulting in the simplified description of energy and material flows in industrial systems. As a matter of fact, since two decades at least, the study of industrial ecosystem has strictly meant the organization and optimization of these flows. The perspective of a progressive resource depletion and the awareness of the limits to growth let recognize that "the traditional model of industrial activity - in which individual manufacturing processes take in raw materials and generate products to be sold plus waste to be disposed of - should be transformed into a more integrated model: an industrial ecosystem. In such a system the consumption of energy and materials is optimized, waste generation is minimized and the effluents of one process - whether they are spent catalysts from petroleum refining, fly or bottom ash from electric-power generation or discarded plastic containers from consumer products - serve as raw material for another process. The industrial ecosystem should work as a biological system" (Frosch and Gallopoulos, 1989, p. 96). The cycle to be emulated is represented by the biological cycle where plants are nutrients for herbivores, which are part of the food chain of carnivores, whose wastes close the cycle as nutrients for plants. In this sense the conceptual roots of the industrial ecosystem are strongly related {{to the development of the}} concept of industrial metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} protein 2 (BMP- 2) is {{a potent}} osteoinductive cytokine {{and a growing number}} of i n vitro studies analyze its effects on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) derived from aged or osteoporotic donors. In these studies the exact quantification of osteogenic differentiation capacity is of fundamental interest. Nevertheless, the experimental conditions for osteogenic differentiation of aged hMSC have not been evaluated systematically and vary to a considerable extend. Aim of the study was to assess the influence of cell density, osteogenic differentiation media (ODM) change intervals and duration of BMP- 2 stimulation on osteoinduction. Furthermore, time series were carried out for osteogenic differentiation and BMP- 2 concentration in ODM/BMP- 2 cell culture supernatants. The experiments were performed using hMSC isolated from femoral heads of aged patients undergoing hip joint replacement. ODM change intervals of 96 hours resulted in significantly higher calcium deposition compared to shorter intervals. A cell density of 80 % prior to stimulation led to stronger osteoinduction compared to higher cell densities. In ODM, aged hMSC showed a significant induction of calcium deposition after 9 days. Added to ODM, BMP- 2 showed a stable concentration in the cell culture supernatants for at least 96 hours. Addition of BMP- 2 to ODM for the initial 4 days led to a significantly higher induction of osteogenic differentiation compared to ODM alone. On the other hand, addition of BMP- 2 for 21 days almost abrogated the osteoinductive effect of ODM. We could demonstrate that the factors investigated have a substantial impact on the extent of osteogenic differentiation of aged hMSC. Consequently, it is of upmost importance to standardize the experimental conditions in order to enable comparability between different studies. We here define standard conditions for osteogenic <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> regard to the specific features of aged hMSC. The finding that BMP- 2 induces or inhibits osteogenic <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> a <b>time</b> dependent manner indicates an age related alteration in signal transduction of hMSC and requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes logic {{programs}} as a specification for robot control. These provide a formal specification {{of what an}} agent should do depending on what it senses, and its previous sensory inputs and actions. We show how to axiomatise reactive agents, events as an interface between continuous and discrete time, and persistence, as well as axiomatising integration and <b>differentiation</b> over <b>time</b> (<b>in</b> terms of the limit of sums and differences). This specification need not be evaluated as a Prolog program; we use can {{the fact that it}} will be evaluated <b>in</b> <b>time</b> to get a more efficient agent. We give a detailed example of a nonholonomic maze travelling robot, where we use the same language to model both the agent and the environment. One of the main motivations for this work {{is that there is a}} clean interface between the logic programs here and the model of uncertainty embedded in probabilistic Horn abduction. This is one step towards building a decisiontheoretic planning system where the ou [...] ...|$|R

Growth inhibition and morphological and biochemical differentiation have been examined following radiation exposure to 1 - 10 Gy.

40|$|The {{classification}} of gait patterns has great {{potential as a}} diagnostic tool, for example, for the diagnosis of injury or to identify at-risk gait in the elderly. The purpose of the paper is to present a method for classifying group differences in gait pattern by using the complete spatial and temporal information of the segment motion quantified by the markers. The classification rates that are obtained are compared with previous studies using conventional classification features.  For our analysis, 37 three-dimensional marker trajectories were collected from each of our 24 young and 24 elderly female subjects while they were walking on a treadmill. Principal component analysis was carried out on these trajectories to retain the spatial and temporal information in the markers. Using a Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel, a classification rate of 95. 8 % was obtained. This classification approach also allowed visualisation of the contribution of individual markers to group <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> position and <b>time.</b> The approach made no specific assumptions and did not require prior knowledge of specific <b>time</b> points <b>in</b> the gait cycle. It is therefore directly applicable for group classification tasks in any study involving marker measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} and mode of selection operating on heritable adaptive traits {{can be inferred}} by comparing population <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> neutral genetic variation between populations (often using F(ST) values) with the corresponding estimates for adaptive traits. Such comparisons indicate if selection acts in a diversifying way between populations, <b>in</b> which case <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> selected traits is expected to exceed <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> neutral markers [F(ST) (selected) > F(ST) (neutral) ], or if negative frequency-dependent selection maintains genetic polymorphisms and pulls populations towards a common stable equilibrium [F(ST) (selected) < F(ST) (neutral) ]. Here, we compared F(ST) values for putatively neutral data (obtained using amplified fragment length polymorphism) with estimates of <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> morph frequencies in the colour-polymorphic damselfly Ischnura elegans. We found {{that in the first}} year (2000), population <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> morph frequencies was significantly greater than <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> neutral loci, while in 2002 (only 2 years and 2 generations later), population <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> morph frequencies had decreased to a level significantly lower than <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> neutral loci. Genetic drift as an explanation for population <b>differentiation</b> <b>in</b> morph frequencies could thus be rejected in both years. These results indicate that the type and/or strength of selection on morph frequencies in this system can change substantially between years. We suggest that an approach to a common equilibrium morph frequency across all populations, driven by negative frequency-dependent selection, is the cause of these temporal changes. We conclude that inferences about selection obtained by comparing F(ST) values from neutral and adaptive genetic variation are most useful when spatial and temporal data are available from several populations and time points and when such information is combined with other ecological sources of data...|$|R
