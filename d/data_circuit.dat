50|$|Merit renamed its Communication Computers to be Primary Communication Processors (PCPs) {{and created}} LSI-11 based Secondary Communication Processors (SCPs). PCPs formed {{the core of}} the network and were {{attached}} to each other over Ethernet and dedicated synchronous <b>data</b> <b>circuits.</b> SCPs were attached to PCPs over synchronous <b>data</b> <b>circuits.</b> PCPs and SCPs would eventually include Ethernet interfaces and support local area network (LAN) attachments. PCPs would also serve as gateways to commercial networks such as GTE's Telenet (later SprintNet), Tymnet, and ADP's Autonet, providing national and international network access to MTS. Later still the PCPs provided gateway services to the TCP/IP networks that became today's Internet.|$|R

50|$|The <b>data</b> <b>circuit</b> known with a DP designation, {{would have}} been {{terrestrial}} with no TASI or DCME, and the C6 signalling on the data link could perform for 48 or 96 traffic channels. It could function for up to 2,048 in the maximum. The question is whether two operators would have that many traffic channels between them, dependent on just one bearer for signalling and subject to occasional failure. It was of course practice to have standby route over a diverse path in case of outage on the original DP <b>data</b> <b>circuit</b> link.|$|E

50|$|The Verizon Building {{has five}} sub-basement levels, which house {{communications}} equipment.

50|$|One of the {{problems}} associated with the transmission of data at high speed over electrical connections is described as noise, which is due to electrical coupling between <b>data</b> <b>circuits</b> and other circuits. As a result, the <b>data</b> <b>circuits</b> can both affect other circuits, and be affected by them. Designers use a number of techniques to reduce the undesirable effects of such unintentional coupling. One such technique used in SATA links is differential signaling. This is an enhancement over PATA, which uses single-ended signaling. The use of fully shielded twin-ax conductors, with multiple ground connections, for each differential pair improves isolation between the channels and reduces the chances of lost data in difficult electrical environments.|$|R
50|$|ISDN is {{also used}} as a smart-network {{technology}} intended to add new services to the {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN) by giving users direct access to end-to-end circuit-switched digital services and as a backup or failsafe circuit solution for critical use <b>data</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|R
50|$|An Internet {{leased line}} is a premium {{internet}} connectivity product, normally delivered over fiber, which provides uncontended, symmetrical speeds with full duplex. It {{is also known as}} an ethernet leased line, dedicated line, <b>data</b> <b>circuit</b> or private line. For example, a T1 can be leased and provides a maximum transmission speed of 1.544 Mbit/s. The user can channelize the T1 to separate the 24 DS0 circuits for voice communication, partial the T1 for data and voice communications, or multiplex the channels into a single <b>data</b> <b>circuit.</b> Leased lines, as opposed to DSL, are being used by companies and individuals for Internet access because they afford faster data transfer rates and are cost-effective for heavy users of the Internet.|$|E

50|$|In RS-232, {{user data}} is sent as a time-series of bits. Both {{synchronous}} and asynchronous transmissions {{are supported by}} the standard. In addition to the <b>data</b> <b>circuits,</b> the standard defines a number of control circuits used to manage {{the connection between the}} DTE and DCE. Each <b>data</b> or control <b>circuit</b> only operates in one direction, that is, signaling from a DTE to the attached DCE or the reverse. Because transmit data and receive <b>data</b> are separate <b>circuits,</b> the interface can operate in a full duplex manner, supporting concurrent data flow in both directions. The standard does not define character framing within the data stream, or character encoding.|$|R

50|$|After takeoff, two booster rockets become {{obstructed}} and the Avedon {{is forced}} to crash land in a desolate, uncharted region of the South Asian desert wracked by seismic tremors. While trying to recover tridymite to fabricate new flight <b>data</b> <b>circuit</b> boards, the crew stumbles upon an underground military depository for advanced biological weapons. One of the passengers gets infected by the weapons and turns into a zombie with murderous proclivities. Avedon and Cooper attempt to protect the other passengers and get the plane repaired and to safety as soon as is possible.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} legacy {{of this system}} is the line rate speeds. [...] "T1" [...] now means any <b>data</b> <b>circuit</b> that runs at the {{original}} 1.544 Mbit/s line rate. Originally the T1 format carried 24 pulse-code modulated, time-division multiplexed speech signals each encoded in 64 kbit/s streams, leaving 8 kbit/s of framing information which facilitates the synchronization and demultiplexing at the receiver. The T2 and T3 circuit channels carry multiple T1 channels multiplexed, resulting in transmission rates of 6.312 and 44.736 Mbit/s, respectively. A T3 line comprises 28 T1 lines, each operating at total signaling rate of 1.544 Mbit/s. It is possible to get a fractional T3 line, meaning a T3 line {{with some of the}} 28 lines turned off, resulting in a slower transfer rate but typically at reduced cost.|$|E

50|$|These {{front-end}} processors, usually DEC PDP-8, PDP-11, or LSI-11 based with locally developed custom {{hardware and}} software, {{would act as}} IBM control units attached to the IBM input/output channels {{on one side and}} to modems and phone lines on the other. At the University of Michigan the front-end processor was known as the Data Concentrator (DC). The DC was developed as part of the CONCOMP project by Dave Mills and others and was the first non-IBM device developed for attachment to an IBM I/O Channel. Initially a PDP-8 based system, the DC was upgraded to use PDP-11 hardware and a Remote Data Concentrator (RDC) was developed that used LSI-11 hardware that connected back to a DC over a synchronous <b>data</b> <b>circuit.</b> The University of British Columbia (UBC) developed two PDP-11 based systems: the Host Interface Machine (HIM) and the Network Interface Machine (NIM).

5000|$|During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s Merit {{operated}} what {{is known}} as a [...] "value-added network" [...] where individual <b>data</b> <b>circuits</b> were leased on a relatively short term basis (one to three or sometimes five years) from traditional telecommunications providers such as Ameritech, GTE, Sprint, and MCI and assembled into a larger network by adding routers and other equipment.
