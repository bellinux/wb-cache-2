5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E
25|$|Nayyar {{first met}} Asha in 1952, {{at the music}} {{recording}} of Chham Chhama Chham. He first called her for a film called Mangu (1954), and gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> break in CID (1956). However, it was the success of Naya Daur (1957) that made the duo very popular. After 1959, she was emotionally and professionally involved with Nayyar.|$|E
500|$|... "Lifeline" [...] first {{surfaced}} in February 2007. Carl Binder {{wanted to do}} a heist episode during the off-season, though the writers had no idea where it would fit in the overall season arc. However, as [...] "Adrift" [...] was written, they realized their heist story flowed naturally from it. Even though Martin Wood was credited for directing the episode, Andy Mikita ended up directing most of it instead, as well as directing parts of [...] "Adrift"; Wood was directing [...] at the time of filming. Amanda Tapping requested that showrunners Mallozzi and Mullie not give <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> part for the episode, as she was in the Arctic filming for Stargate: Continuum. Another reason that Carter's appearance was small was that Torri Higginson was still a part of the show, and the producers wanted Carter to be introduced slowly. The episode, as a [...] "third part", was difficult to write, since the second part ("Adrift") is a comeback resolve of the first part ("First Strike"), and the third part has to [...] "resolve the resolve." [...] In the writing stages, there was also talk {{as to whether or not}} to save the experimental hyperdrive jumper. Eventually it was decided that it would be saved, to keep open the possibility of using it again.|$|E

2500|$|In his memoirs, Dodd {{described}} Mrs. Parker accordingly: [...] "As {{a teacher}} , I {{had taught her}} how to speak; as a legislator, I had gotten her a scholarship that gave her a college education; and as lieutenant governor, I had found <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> job in our administration. She was a wonderful speaker and a good administrator, but she must have been a born ingrate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Godfrey's mother, Kathryn, was {{a gifted}} artist and {{composer}} whose aspirations to fame were laid aside {{to take care}} of her family after her husband, Arthur or [...] "Darl'", died. [...] Her creativity enabled the family to get through some very hard times by playing the piano to accompany silent movies, making jams and jellies and crocheting bedspreads to sell, and even cutting off and selling her floor length hair, as it was extremely difficult for a woman of her [...] "class" [...] to find work without violating social mores of the time. [...] The one household item that was never sold or turned into firewood was the piano, and she believed at least some of her children would succeed in show business. [...] In her later years some of her compositions were performed by symphony orchestras in Canada, which earned her a mention in Time. In 1957, at the age of 78, her sauciness made <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hit with the audience when she appeared on Groucho Marx's quiz show You Bet Your Life. [...] She died of cancer in 1968 at a nursing home in a suburb north of Chicago.|$|E

60|$|Swiftly {{ascending}} {{this path}} she came at length {{to a point}} where it was possible to see some distance ahead. The ascent became hardly noticeable. Then, as she turned a bend of the trail, the light grew brighter and brighter, until presently all was open and clear. An oval space, covered with stones, lay before <b>her.</b> <b>A</b> <b>big,</b> blasted chestnut stood near by. Beyond was the dim, purple haze of distance. Above, the pale, blue sky just faintly rose-tinted by the setting sun. Far to her left the scraggly trees of a low hill were tipped with orange and russet shades. She had reached the summit.|$|E

60|$|Then Mrs. Bunker showed <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> map of {{the whole}} country, and there Lucy found the river, and the roads, {{and the names of}} the villages near, as she had seen or heard of them; and she began to {{understand}} that a map or globe really brought distant places into an exceedingly small picture, and that where she saw a name and a spot she was to think of houses and churches; that a branching black line was a flowing river full of water; a curve in, a pretty bay shut in with rocks and hills; a point jutting out, generally a steep rock with a lighthouse on it.|$|E
6000|$|Cap'n Bill {{rose to his}} foot, for he {{was not at all}} hurt, and {{examined}} the melon. Then he took his big jackknife from his pocket and cut the melon open. It was quite ripe and looked delicious; but the old man tasted it before he permitted Trot to eat any. Deciding it was good he gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> slice and then offered the Ork some. The creature looked at the fruit somewhat disdainfully, at first, but once he had tasted its flavor he ate of it as heartily as did the others. Among the vines they discovered many other melons, and Trot said gratefully: [...] "Well, there's no danger of our starving, even if this is an island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I remember, when I were young, a {{very old}} {{shepherd}} on the farm; he had been more 'n forty years there, and he was called Mark Dick.

But in a little while up she jumps and trotted straight into the fold, and from that time she were well. Next day he told his master, and his master said, with a laugh, 'Well, now you know what to do when you gits a giddy sheep.' Some time after that Mark Dick he had another giddy one, and remembering what his master had said, he swung his stick and gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> crack on the skull, and down went the sheep, dead.
