5|$|The Australian Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD) also {{collected}} <b>intelligence</b> <b>on</b> Labuan {{and other}} parts of the Brunei Bay area during May. On the first of the month several RAAF PBY Catalina aircraft carrying SRD personnel overflew Labuan. These aircraft later landed near two native prahu and questioned their crews; two sailors were flown back to an Allied base for further questioning. On 15 May two Malays working for the SRD were landed in Brunei Bay by a Catalina, and sailed to Labuan on board a prahu. These agents recruited a local civilian from Labuan, and the party was extracted by a Catalina near the mainland village of Kampong Mengalong on 19 May. The intelligence gained from these operations provided the Australians with a good understanding of Labuan's geography and infrastructure. In addition, civilians who had been recruited by the SRD's SEMUT 2 team (which had been parachuted into Borneo during April) provided <b>intelligence</b> <b>on</b> the size and movements of Labuan's garrison force.|$|E

5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, {{it is unclear}} whether the limited resources earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military <b>intelligence</b> <b>on</b> HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent.|$|E
5|$|Allen's {{regiment}} {{was part}} of the Royal Artillery; he quickly became involved with Anti-Aircraft Command and began to associate with Royal Air Force (RAF) officers. In 1940, he was appointed as an Anti-Aircraft (AA) liaison officer to RAF Hawkinge, part of an initiative to share <b>intelligence</b> <b>on</b> German AA operations with bomber groups; these posts were controlled by a branch of Military Intelligence, MI14E. Later that year, Allen's brother Geoffrey was killed fighting in France.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{not fully}} {{understood}} how it came to his attention, Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler. It has been suggested a visit by Hitler in 1912–13 while staying with his half-brother Alois Hitler, Jr. in Liverpool, or military <b>intelligence</b> <b>on</b> Rochdale, or information from Nazi sympathiser William Joyce (who had lived in Oldham), brought the building to his attention. Hitler admired the architecture {{so much that it}} is believed he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to Nazi Germany had German-occupied Europe encompassed the United Kingdom. Rochdale was broadly avoided by German bombers during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{had been}} aware of the PAVN/Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson had chosen not to attack them due to {{possible}} international repercussions and his belief that Sihanouk could be convinced to alter his policies. Johnson did, however, authorize the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG) to enter Cambodia and gather <b>intelligence</b> <b>on</b> the Base Areas in 1967. The election of Richard M. Nixon in 1968 and the introduction of his policies of gradual U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and the Vietnamization of the conflict there, changed everything.|$|E
5|$|As a spy {{working for}} the {{government}} of the United States, Berg traveled to Yugoslavia to gather <b>intelligence</b> <b>on</b> resistance groups the U.S. government was considering supporting.

After the war, Berg was occasionally employed by the OSS's successor, the Central Intelligence Agency, but, by the mid-1950s, was unemployed. He spent the last two decades of his life without work, living with various siblings.|$|E

5|$|Forward Intelligence Teams (FITs) are two or {{more police}} {{officers}} who are deployed by UK police forces to gather <b>intelligence</b> <b>on</b> the ground and in some circumstances, to disrupt activists and deter anti-social behaviour. They use cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. An unsuccessful legal challenge has been made against their use of overt surveillance, but in 2009 the Court of Appeal ruled that they must justify retention of photographs on a case-by-case basis.

The British government supplied the Iranians with materials for chemical weapons {{in order to gain}} <b>intelligence</b> <b>on</b> Iran's military programme. Tomlinson's description of his Iranian activities are generally considered to be true, due to his personal involvement and knowledge of details that only an insider would know.|$|E
5|$|Hackett {{decided the}} brigade would advance between the railway {{line and the}} Ede–Arnhem road, in order to capture their three objectives, first the high ground {{overlooking}} Johanna Hoeve farm, next the woods near to Lichtenbeek House and finally the high ground at Koepel.

With {{the element of surprise}} gone and no <b>intelligence</b> <b>on</b> the German dispositions, 156 Para headed for the first objective. Followed by 10 Para slightly behind and to their left.

5|$|In early-to-mid 1912, Stojanović and his schoolmate Todor Ilić joined Narodna Odbrana (National Defence), an {{association}} founded in Serbia in December 1908 on {{the initiative of}} Branislav Nušić. It aimed to organise a guerrilla resistance to the Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to spread nationalist propaganda. National Defence soon established a network of local committees throughout Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its members from the latter territory gathered <b>intelligence</b> <b>on</b> the Austrian army and passed it to the Serbian secret service.|$|E
5|$|In particular, {{intelligence}} gathering {{played a major}} role. Around 6,000 Belgian civilians were involved in gathering <b>intelligence</b> <b>on</b> German military installations and troop movements and communicating {{it back to the}} Allied armies. The organization was run through a large number of independent groups and included, notably, the large Dame Blanche (White Lady) network. Alongside {{intelligence gathering}} were similar organisations which helped men wishing to join the Belgian Army on the Yser Front escape occupied Belgium, usually to the neutral Netherlands. Around 32,000 were successfully smuggled out which boosted the size of the Belgian force considerably.|$|E

Several months later, as the Americans {{consolidated}} their forces to prepare for the main invasion of Luzon, nearly 150Americans were executed by their Japanese captors on December14, 1944 at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp on the island of Palawan. These Americans were herded into air-raid shelters, sealed in, doused with gasoline, and burned alive. One of the survivors, PFC Eugene Nielsen, recounted his tale to U.S. Army <b>Intelligence</b> <b>on</b> January7, 1945. Two days later, MacArthur's forces landed on Luzon and began a rapid advance towards the capital, Manila.|$|E
