Peter Holmberg succeeded as HC for Bergen Storm in 2011 and 2012. In addition, Bergen Storm brought in American import players {{for the first time in}} team history. The team went 2-4 through 2011 season with a double win over the Nidaros <b>Domers</b> which qualified for the last spot in play-offs.. Further, Bergen Storm went 3-3 in 2012 after beating the Nidaros <b>Domers,</b> VIF Trolls and AFC Show but did not qualify for playoffs due to the increased number of participating teams in the league. In 2013, the team saw much reorganizing and finished the season 0-7. Despite beating championship runners-up Kristiansand Gladiators 14-9 Storm were ruled to lose all first three games of the season 0-30 due to an administrative penalty for fielding an illegal transferred player. However, the team saw a reduction in the junior program in this period of time. The U-16 program folded after 2010 campaign and the U-19 program did not manage to field a team for the 2012 campaign after reaching playoffs in 2011 under the leadership of Christian Detjen.

5000|$|There {{are some}} {{uncertainties}} in Dodd's biography. Although naturalized in 1869 {{upon entering the}} United States, from the 1890s onward Dodd identifies as Chicago-born, doing so, Jay Gatsby-like, {{in all kinds of}} public documents. In an 1897 interview with a reporter for the Louisville Courier-Journal [...] W. J. Dodd left the reporter, and thus posterity, with the impression that he was a native Chicagoan, that he graduated from [...] "the Chicago schools" [...] and had been in the first graduating class of the Chicago Art Institute. The archives of the Institute do not yet support this claim. [...] Similarly unclear is when, in what year, Dodd began his professional practice in Louisville. The year usually offered in the histories of Kentucky architects (from Withey to Hedgepeth to Kleber to Luhan, <b>Domer</b> and Mohney) for Dodd's arrival in Louisville is 1884, based on the forementioned 1897 article in the Louisville Courier-Journal. In contrast, the Chicago Tribune still identifies him with the Pullman Rowing Clubin early 1884, around this time taking employment as an architect with the Northern Pacific Railway upon recommendation by S.S. Beman and moving to the rail company's office in Portland Oregon only to return to Chicago (Hyde Park) and employment with the Beman brothers (S.S. and W.I) by the end of 1885 after the Northern Pacific's collapse and reorganization. The journal Inland Architect of February 1886 announces Dodd's imminent departure from Chicago to begin a partnership with O. C. Wehle of Louisville, saying: [...] "Mr Dodd will soon be a valuable addition to the architects of Louisville". By September 1886 Dodd is cited as partner with Oscar Wehle for the design of [...] "a magnificent three story brown stone residence" [...] in Louisville. In November 1886, Dodd was elected to membership in the Western Association of Architects, his home city being given as Louisville. Dodd first appears as a resident, a boarder, in Louisville in the 1887 Caron's Louisville Directory.The American Institute of Architects A.I.A. Historical Directory of American Architects has held that Dodd did not join the A.I.A. national organization until 1916 despite Dodd's listing in membership with the Louisville Chapter of the A.I.A. in 1912 and in Southern California A.I.A. chapter in 1915.|$|E
