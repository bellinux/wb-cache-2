40|$|SLPI, {{a potent}} {{epithelial}} and myeloid-derived serine protease inhibitor with antimicrobial and anti-inflamma-tory functions, is {{induced by the}} intracellular parasite Leishmania major, and increased SLPI expression is ev-ident within lesions that follow L. major infection. In con-trast to self-resolving infection in C 57 Bl/ 6 WT mice, Slpi/ mice launch a strong Th 1 response <b>to</b> <b>L.</b> major, yet fail to control infection and develop destructive, nonhealing lesions with systemic spread of parasites. Because SLPI is both produced by murine macro-phages and antagonizes their function, we examined the contribution of macrophage polarization to the de-fective host response {{in the absence of}} SLPI. Slpi/ and Slpi/ macrophages were first primed with either IFN or IL- 4 to generate classically activated M 1 or al-ternatively activated M 2 macrophages. After infection with L. major, Slpi/ M 1 macrophages expressed ele-vated iNOS RNA, whereas arginase was more highly expressed in WT than Slpi/ M 2 macrophages. After in vivo infection, we found that both IFN and iNOS were persistently overexpressed in chronic lesions in Slpi/ mice, but surprisingly, IL- 4 and arginase concomitantly remained elevated. Moreover, overexpression of the negative regulators SOCS 1 and IL- 27 provided insight into the failure of IFN <b>to</b> clear <b>L.</b> major from the dermal lesions. Notably, adenoviral <b>delivery</b> of SLPI <b>to</b> <b>L.</b> major-infected Slpi/ mice significantly limited the progres-sion of infection. These studies suggest that conver-gence of M 1 and M 2 macrophage responses may influ-ence the outcome of innate host defense against intracellular parasites and that SLPI is critical for coor-dinating resistance to chronic leishmaniasis.

50|$|Stem {{cell therapy}} {{can be used}} to help {{regenerate}} myocardium tissue and return the contractile function of the heart by creating/supporting a microenvironment before the MI. Developments in targeted drug <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> tumors have provided the groundwork for the burgeoning field of targeted drug <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> cardiac tissue. Recent developments have shown that there are different endothelial surfaces in tumors, which has led to the concept of endothelial cell adhesion molecule-mediated targeted drug <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> tumors.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} adrenal {{cortical}} steroids and osmotic blood-brain barrier modification on methotrexate <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> normal and glioma-bearing rats was studied. In animals with the avian sarcoma virus-induced glioma, osmotic blood-brain barrier modification resulted in significantly increased <b>delivery</b> of methotrexate <b>to</b> the tumor-bearing hemisphere (including the tumor, the brain around the tumor, {{and the brain}} distant to the tumor), compared to the nonmodified hemisphere or to control animals. The administration of adrenal steroids, followed by intracarotid methotrexate, resulted in slightly decreased chemotherapeutic agent (methotrexate) <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> the tumor, the brain around the tumor, and the brain distant to the tumor. When adrenal steroids were given prior to barrier modification and methotrexate therapy, the level of methotrexate was significantly less in the tumor. These studies provide evidence that the blood-brain barrier exists in tumors and {{is a factor in}} drug <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> tumors. Steroid administration greatly interferes with the enhancement of drug <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> tumors that can be achieved with osmotic blood-brain barrier modification...|$|R
