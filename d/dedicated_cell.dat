40|$|Introduction and Reference List Cellular {{manufacturing}} {{has received}} {{a significant amount of}} attention in recent years by demonstrating great potential for productivity improvements in batch manufacturing. Often batch facilities produce items from a population of thousands of active part types using hundreds of machines organized in functional layouts. The cell design problem is to reconfigure the existing machines into smaller groups (or cells) of dissimilar machines with each <b>cell</b> <b>dedicated</b> to a family of parts, where, ideally all parts in a given family are produced in a single cell. However, the typical case is that <b>dedicated</b> <b>cells</b> and families cannot be created to accommodate the whole population of parts and all machines, and, often a sizable "remnant" cell is left to serve those parts that do not fit into any families. The cell design process can be lengthy, requiring substantial effort to evaluate candidate cells according to a diversity of operational and economical p...|$|R

40|$|Phasic (synaptic) {{and tonic}} (extrasynaptic) {{inhibition}} represent {{the two most}} fundamental forms of GABAA receptor-mediated transmission. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) generated by GABAA receptors are typically extremely rapid synaptic events that do not last beyond a few milliseconds. Although unusually slow GABAA IPSCs, lasting for tens of milliseconds, have been observed in recordings of spontaneous events, their origin and mechanisms are not known. We show that neocortical GABAA,slow IPSCs originate from a specialized interneuron called neurogliaform cells. Compared with classical GABAA,fast IPSCs evoked by basket cells, single spikes in neurogliaform cells evoke extraordinarily prolonged GABAA responses that display tight regulation by transporters, low peak GABA concentration, unusual benzodiazepine modulation, and spillover. These results reveal a form of GABAA receptor mediated communication by a <b>dedicated</b> <b>cell</b> type that produces slow ionotropic responses with properties intermediate between phasic and tonic inhibition...|$|E

For each cell we have determined the optimal combination of rf and laser powers which yield the highest sensitivity to magnetic field changes. Out of all produced cells, 90 % are found to have magnetometric sensitivities {{in the range of}} 9 to 30 fT / √ Hz.

40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} {{the application of}} a novel solid state modulator in monitoring the concentration of a test gas. A widespread cost-effective method of gas concentration monitoring currently uses a blackbody source and pyroelectric detector combined with a filter to isolate the required infrared spectral region. Presently the intensity on the detector is modulated by either a mechanical chopper or by electrically-pulsing the source. The device described by this work uses a continuously-driven blackbody source with a novel solid state infrared modulator operating in the 8 - 14 µm band to generate the required change in intensity on the pyroelectric detector, eliminating the need for moving parts. The modulator may be incorporated into the detector’s optical window in a more-compact future device. The modulator operation is outlined, and the results of determining the concentration of SF 6 test gas in a <b>dedicated</b> <b>cell</b> are compared for the solid state modulator and a mechanical chopper...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCellular {{manufacturing}} {{systems are}} used when both production volume and product variety are at medium level. The fluctuations of volume and mix can reduce drastically {{the performance of}} classical cellular manufacturing systems. Therefore, several configurations have been proposed in literature as virtual manufacturing cells, fractal cells and remainder cells. This paper investigates the cell loading approaches in a manufacturing system composed of dedicated cells and a remainder cell. The remainder cell consists of machines able to manufacture all part families. The loading decision concerns the allocation of the parts to the remainder cell, instead of the <b>dedicated</b> <b>cell.</b> A simulation environment based on Rockwell ARENA® has been developed to test the proposed approaches. The performance measures are evaluated in a very dynamic environment characterized by volume oscillations, mix fluctuations and machine failures.

40|$|AbstractSilicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) {{have emerged}} as {{promising}} alternative to fast vacuum photomultiplier tubes (PMT). A fully digital implementation of the Silicon Photomultiplier (dSiPM) has been developed in order to overcome the deficiencies and limitations of the so far only analog SiPMs (aSiPMs). Our sensor is based on arrays of single photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs) integrated in a standard CMOS process. Photons are detected directly by sensing the voltage at the SPAD anode using a <b>dedicated</b> <b>cell</b> electronics block next to each diode. This block also contains active quenching and recharge circuits {{as well as a}} one bit memory for the selective inhibit of detector cells. A balanced trigger network is used to propagate the trigger signal from all cells to the integrated time-to-digital converter. In consequence, photons are detected and counted as digital signals, thus making the sensor less susceptible to temperature variations and electronic noise. The integration with CMOS logic provides the added benefit of low power consumption and possible integration of data post-processing directly in the sensor. In this overview paper, we discuss the sensor architecture together with its characteristics with a focus on scalability and practicability aspects for applications in medical imaging, high energy- and astrophysics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFrom 15 to 17 June 2011, a {{dedicated}} workshop {{was held on}} the subject of in vitro models for mammalian spermatogenesis and their applications in toxicological hazard and risk assessment. The workshop was sponsored by the Dutch ASAT initiative (Assuring Safety without Animal Testing), which aims at promoting innovative approaches toward toxicological hazard and risk assessment on the basis of human and in vitro data, and replacement of animal studies.

Although feasible, significant investment is deemed essential to be able to bring new ideas into practice in the laboratory.

40|$|SummaryMammals {{generate}} external coloration via <b>dedicated</b> pigment-producing <b>cells</b> but arrange pigment into patterns through mechanisms largely unknown. Here, using mice as models, we {{show that}} patterns ultimately emanate from <b>dedicated</b> pigment-receiving <b>cells.</b> These pigment recipients are epithelial cells that recruit melanocytes to {{their position in the}} skin and induce the transfer of melanin. We identify Foxn 1 (a transcription factor) as an activator of this “pigment recipient phenotype” and Fgf 2 (a growth factor and Foxn 1 target) as a signal released by recipients. When Foxn 1 —and thus dedicated recipients—are redistributed in the skin, new patterns of pigmentation develop, suggesting a mechanism for the evolution of coloration. We conclude that recipients provide a cutaneous template or blueprint that instructs melanocytes where to place pigment. As Foxn 1 and Fgf 2 also modulate epithelial growth and differentiation, the Foxn 1 pathway should serve as a nexus coordinating cell division, differentiation, and pigmentation...|$|R
