5|$|Likewise, group theory helps {{predict the}} changes in {{physical}} properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is <b>ferroelectric</b> materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a <b>ferroelectric</b> state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry <b>ferroelectric</b> state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and molecular weight, DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is {{of the formation of}} chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral. In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present. The appearance mechanism of this macroscopic chirality is not yet entirely clear. It appears that the molecules stack in layers and orient themselves in a tilted fashion inside the layers. These liquid crystals phases may be <b>ferroelectric</b> or anti-ferroelectric, both of which are of interest for applications.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} find wide use {{in liquid}} crystal displays, which {{rely on the}} optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in {{the presence or absence}} of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in <b>ferroelectric</b> LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.|$|E
25|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{nature of}} <b>ferroelectric</b> materials {{can be used}} to make capacitors with tunable capacitance. Typically, a <b>ferroelectric</b> capacitor simply consists of a pair of electrodes sandwiching a layer of <b>ferroelectric</b> material. The permittivity of ferroelectrics is not only tunable but commonly also very high in absolute value, especially when close to the phase transition temperature. Because of this, <b>ferroelectric</b> capacitors are small in physical size compared to dielectric (non-tunable) capacitors of similar capacitance.|$|E
25|$|The {{nonlinear}} capacitance of {{a microscope}} probe scanned along a <b>ferroelectric</b> surface {{is used to}} study the domain structure of <b>ferroelectric</b> materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{polarization of}} <b>ferroelectric</b> materials implies a hysteresis effect {{which can be}} used as a memory function, and <b>ferroelectric</b> capacitors are indeed used to make <b>ferroelectric</b> RAM for computers and RFID cards. In these applications thin films of <b>ferroelectric</b> materials are typically used, as this allows the field required to switch the polarization to be achieved with a moderate voltage. However, when using thin films a great deal of attention needs to be paid to the interfaces, electrodes and sample quality for devices to work reliably.|$|E
25|$|Another idea {{of recent}} {{interest}} is the <b>ferroelectric</b> tunnel junction (FTJ) in which a contact is made up by nanometer-thick <b>ferroelectric</b> film placed between metal electrodes. The thickness of the <b>ferroelectric</b> layer is small enough to allow tunneling of electrons. The piezoelectric and interface effects {{as well as the}} depolarization ﬁeld may lead to a giant electroresistance (GER) switching effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ferroelectric</b> {{crystals}} often show several transition {{temperatures and}} domain structure hysteresis, much as do ferromagnetic crystals. The {{nature of the}} phase transition in some <b>ferroelectric</b> crystals is still not well understood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ferroelectric</b> {{materials}} {{are required by}} symmetry considerations to be also piezoelectric and pyroelectric. The combined properties of memory, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity make <b>ferroelectric</b> capacitors very useful, e.g. for sensor applications. <b>Ferroelectric</b> capacitors are used in medical ultrasound machines (the capacitors generate and then listen for the ultrasound ping used to image the internal organs of a body), high quality infrared cameras (the infrared image is projected onto a two dimensional array of <b>ferroelectric</b> capacitors capable of detecting temperature differences as small as millionths of a degree Celsius), fire sensors, sonar, vibration sensors, and even fuel injectors on diesel engines.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>ferroelectric</b> {{materials}} used include triglycine sulfate, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and lithium tantalate.|$|E
25|$|Lanthanum oxide is used {{to develop}} <b>ferroelectric</b> materials, such as La-doped Bi4Ti3O12 (BLT).|$|E
25|$|In 1974 R.B. Meyer used {{symmetry}} {{arguments to}} predict <b>ferroelectric</b> liquid crystals, and the prediction could immediately be verified by several observations of behavior connected to ferroelectricity in smectic liquid-crystal phases that are chiral and tilted. The technology allows {{the building of}} flat-screen monitors. Mass production between 1994 and 1999 {{was carried out by}} Canon. <b>Ferroelectric</b> liquid crystals are used in production of reflective LCoS.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} <b>ferroelectric</b> {{material for}} applications is {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT), {{which is part of}} the solid solution formed between <b>ferroelectric</b> lead titanate and anti-ferroelectric lead zirconate. Different compositions are used for different applications; for memory applications, PZT closer in composition to lead titanate is preferred, whereas piezoelectric applications make use of the diverging piezoelectric coefficients associated with the morphotropic phase boundary that is found close to the 50/50 composition.|$|E
25|$|All <b>ferroelectric</b> {{materials}} exhibit piezoelectricity a piezoelectric effect. Because Class 2 ceramic capacitors use <b>ferroelectric</b> ceramics dielectric, {{these types}} of capacitors may have electrical effects called microphonics. Microphonics (microphony) describes how electronic components transform mechanical vibrations into an undesired electrical signal (noise). The dielectric may absorb mechanical forces from shock or vibration by changing thickness and changing the electrode separation, affecting the capacitance, which in turn induces an AC current. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} crystal structures, {{notably the}} {{perovskite}} structure, which exhibit <b>ferroelectric</b> behavior. This is analogous to ferromagnetism, in that, {{in the absence of}} an electric field during production, the <b>ferroelectric</b> crystal does not exhibit a polarization. Upon the application of an electric field of sufficient magnitude, the crystal becomes permanently polarized. This polarization can be reversed by a sufficiently large counter-charge, in the same way that a ferromagnet can be reversed. However, although they are called ferroelectrics, the effect is due to the crystal structure (not the presence of a ferrous metal).|$|E
25|$|Yet another {{hot topic}} is multiferroics, where {{researchers}} {{are looking for}} ways to couple magnetic and <b>ferroelectric</b> ordering within a material or heterostructure; there are several recent reviews on this topic.|$|E
25|$|Lanthanum oxide is La2O3, an {{inorganic}} compound containing the {{rare earth element}} lanthanum and oxygen. It is used to develop <b>ferroelectric</b> materials, {{as a component of}} optical materials, and is a feedstock for certain catalysts.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of semiconductor technology in the 1950s, barrier layer capacitors, or IEC class 3/EIA class IV capacitors, were developed using doped <b>ferroelectric</b> ceramics. Because this doped material was not suitable to produce multilayers, they were replaced decades later by Y5V class 2 capacitors.|$|E
25|$|Together with MIT's Radiation Lab, von Hippel and his {{collaborators}} helped to develop radar technology during the war. He was awarded the President's Certificate of Merit in 1948 by U.S. President Harry Truman. He became famous also for his discovery of <b>ferroelectric</b> and piezoelectric properties of barium titanate (BaTiO3).|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{materials}} demonstrate ferroelectricity only below {{a certain}} phase transition temperature, called the Curie temperature (TC) and are paraelectric above this temperature: the spontaneous polarization vanishes, and the <b>ferroelectric</b> crystal transforms into the paraelectric state. Many ferroelectrics lose their piezoelectric properties above Tc completely, because their paraelectric phase has a centrosymmetric crystal structure.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{there are}} 230 space groups among which 32 {{crystalline}} classes {{can be found}} in crystals. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, within which 20 are piezoelectric. Among the piezoelectric classes, 10 have a spontaneous electric polarization, that varies with the temperature, therefore they are pyroelectric. Among pyroelectric materials, some of them are <b>ferroelectric.</b>|$|E
25|$|All class 2 ceramic {{capacitors}} using <b>ferroelectric</b> ceramics exhibit piezoelectricity, {{and have}} a piezoelectric effect called microphonics, microphony or in audio applications squealing. Microphony describes the phenomenon wherein electronic components transform mechanical vibrations into an electrical signal which in many cases is undesired noise. Sensitive electronic preamplifiers generally use class 1 capacitors to avoid this effect.|$|E
25|$|Class 1 {{capacitors}} do {{not experience}} <b>ferroelectric</b> aging like Class 2's. But environmental influences such as higher temperature, high humidity and mechanical stress can, {{over a longer}} period of time, lead to a small irreversible decline in capacitance, sometimes also called aging. The change of capacitance for P100 and N470 Class 1's is lower than 1%, for capacitors with N750 to N1500 ceramics it is ≤ 2%.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} {{ceramic materials}} used for ceramic capacitors, paraelectric or <b>ferroelectric</b> ceramics, influences the electrical {{characteristics of the}} capacitors. Using mixtures of paraelectric substances based on titanium dioxide results in very stable and linear behavior of the capacitance value within a specified temperature range and low losses at high frequencies. But these mixtures have a relatively low permittivity so that the capacitance values of these capacitors are relatively small.|$|E
25|$|Ceramic {{capacitors}} {{may experience}} changes to their electrical parameters due to soldering stress. The {{heat of the}} solder bath, especially for SMD styles, can cause changes of contact resistance between terminals and electrodes. For <b>ferroelectric</b> class 2 ceramic capacitors, the soldering temperature is above the Curie point. The polarized domains in the dielectric are going back and the aging process of class 2 ceramic capacitors is starting again.|$|E
25|$|An MLCC {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual capacitors stacked together in parallel and contacted via the terminal surfaces. The starting material for all MLCC chips is a mixture of finely ground granules of paraelectric or <b>ferroelectric</b> raw materials, modified by accurately determined additives. These powdered materials are mixed homogeneously. The composition of the mixture {{and the size of the}} powder particles, as small as 10nm, reflect the manufacturer's expertise.|$|E
25|$|PZT {{thin films}} have {{attracted}} attention for {{applications such as}} force sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes actuators, tunable optics, micro pumps, <b>ferroelectric</b> RAM, display systems and smart roads, when energy sources are limited, energy harvesting {{plays an important role}} in the environment. Smart roads have the potential to play an important role in power generation. Embedding piezoelectric material in the road can convert pressure exerted by moving vehicles into voltage and current.|$|E
25|$|The {{externally}} applied charge {{described above}} under condenser microphones {{is replaced by}} a permanent charge in an electret material. An electret is a <b>ferroelectric</b> material that has been permanently electrically charged or polarized. The name comes from electrostatic and magnet; a static charge is embedded in an electret by alignment of the static charges in the material, much the way a magnet is made by aligning the magnetic domains in a piece of iron.|$|E
25|$|But this paraelectric {{dielectric}} had {{relatively low}} permittivity {{so that only}} small capacitance values could be realized. The expanding market of radios in the 1930s and 1940s create a demand for higher capacitance values but below electrolytic capacitors for HF decoupling applications. Discovered in 1921, the <b>ferroelectric</b> ceramic material barium titanate with a permittivity {{in the range of}} 1,000, about ten times greater than titanium dioxide or mica, began to play a much larger role in electronic applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{pyroelectric effect}} {{converts}} a temperature change into electric current or voltage. It {{is analogous to}} the piezoelectric effect, which is another type of <b>ferroelectric</b> behavior. Pyroelectricity requires time-varying inputs and suffers from small power outputs in energy harvesting applications due to its low operating frequencies. However, one key advantage of pyroelectrics over thermoelectrics is that many pyroelectric materials are stable up to 1200 ⁰C or higher, enabling energy harvesting from high temperature sources and thus increasing thermodynamic efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO)–Wurtzite structure. While single {{crystals}} of ZnO are piezoelectric and pyroelectric, polycrystalline (ceramic) ZnO with randomly oriented grains exhibits neither piezoelectric nor pyroelectric effect. Not being <b>ferroelectric,</b> polycrystalline ZnO {{cannot be}} poled like barium titanate or PZT. Ceramics and polycrystalline thin films of ZnO may exhibit macroscopic piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity {{only if they}} are textured (grains are preferentially oriented), such that the piezoelectric and pyroelectric responses of all individual grains do not cancel. This is readily accomplished in polycrystalline thin films.|$|E
25|$|Capacitance {{may also}} change with applied voltage. This effect is more {{prevalent}} in class 2 ceramic capacitors. The permittivity of <b>ferroelectric</b> class 2 material depends on the applied voltage. Higher applied voltage lowers permittivity. The change of capacitance can drop to 80% of the value measured with the standardized measuring voltage of 0.5 or 1.0nbsp&V. This behavior is a small source of non-linearity in low-distortion filters and other analog applications. In audio applications this can be the reason for harmonic distortion.|$|E
25|$|Of the 32 crystal classes, 21 are non-centrosymmetric (not {{having a}} centre of symmetry), and of these, 20 exhibit direct {{piezoelectricity}} (the 21st is the cubic class 432). Ten of these represent the polar crystal classes, which show a spontaneous polarization without mechanical stress {{due to a}} non-vanishing electric dipole moment associated with their unit cell, and which exhibit pyroelectricity. If the dipole moment can be reversed by the application of an electric field, the material {{is said to be}} <b>ferroelectric.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ferroelectricity is a {{characteristic}} of certain materials that have a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric field. The term is used in analogy to ferromagnetism, in which a material exhibits a permanent magnetic moment. Ferromagnetism was already known when ferroelectricity was discovered in 1920 in Rochelle salt by Valasek. Thus, the prefix ferro, meaning iron, was {{used to describe the}} property despite the fact that most <b>ferroelectric</b> materials do not contain iron.|$|E
25|$|Ceramic {{capacitors}} {{are composed}} of a mixture of finely ground granules of paraelectric or <b>ferroelectric</b> materials, appropriately mixed with other materials to achieve the desired characteristics. From these powder mixtures, the ceramic is sintered at high temperatures. The ceramic forms the dielectric {{and serves as a}} carrier for the metallic electrodes. The minimum thickness of the dielectric layer, which today (2013) for low voltage capacitors is in the size range of 0.5 micrometers is limited downwards by the grain size of the ceramic powder. The thickness of the dielectric for capacitors with higher voltages is determined by the dielectric strength of the desired capacitor.|$|E
500|$|Lithium niobate, {{which is}} a <b>ferroelectric,</b> is used {{extensively}} in mobile telephones and optical modulators, and for the manufacture of surface acoustic wave devices. It belongs to the ABO3 structure ferroelectrics like lithium tantalate and barium titanate. Niobium capacitors are available as alternative to [...] tantalum capacitors, but tantalum capacitors still predominate. Niobium is added to glass to obtain a higher refractive index, making possible thinner and lighter corrective glasses.|$|E
