50|$|An <b>external</b> <b>blog</b> is a {{publicly}} available weblog where company employees, teams, or spokespersons share their views. It {{is often used}} to announce new products and services (or the end of old products), to explain and clarify policies, or to react on public criticism on certain issues. It also allows a window to the company culture and is often treated more informally than traditional press releases, though a corporate blog often tries to accomplish similar goals as press releases do. In some corporate blogs, all posts go through a review before they are posted. Some corporate blogs, but not all, allow comments to be made to the posts. According to Hoffman Agency, corporate blogs should not be ‘about me’, but should be a platform to show thought leadership and communicate views on industry issues.|$|E

This {{might not be a}} significant problem since there is evidence that users provide correct gender information in their online profiles. Burger et al. [32] studied user gender on Twitter considering gender information shared by users in <b>external</b> <b>blog</b> accounts associated with their Twitter account. This association enabled an experiment verifying that cues in Twitter profile descriptions, e.g. ‘mother of 3 children’, tend to be consistent with gender information in the blog. This may indicate that people who misrepresent their gender are consistent across different aspects of their online presence. Linked to that, our proposed methodology also does not tackle the case where users do not fit in either male or female gender, as shown by [36]. Our methodology also does not treat pollution, e.g. fake accounts. In this particular case, techniques to increase data quality could improve the results [50 – 52].|$|E

While many aspects of the technology involved, like automatic recording techniques or innovative interfaces for replay, have evolved at a rapid pace, web lecturing has been independent of other important developments such as Web 2. 0. Web 2. 0 is an emerging trend that among other things aims at integrating user generated data from different systems in order to enhance the user experience. This paper discusses the benefits web lecturing could gain from a Web 2. 0 perspective.

Our main preliminary conclusions are that estimating mixture weights for <b>external</b> expansion in <b>blog</b> post retrieval is non-trivial and we need more analysis to find out why it works better for blog distillation than for blog post retrieval. For the relevance feedback track we observe two things: (i) in terms of statMAP, a larger number of judged non-relevant documents improves retrieval effectiveness and (ii) on the TREC Terabyte topics, we can effectively replace the estimates on the judged non-relevant documents with estimations on the document collection. Finally, since the enterprise track did not have any results yet, we only described our participation and do not draw any conclusions. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The main {{objective}} of this thesis has been to analyse the use of blogs within a corporate environment. Blogging has {{found its way into}} a corporate context within the last few years and this thesis has focused on the use of this communication tool within the Danish market. The research question in this thesis has been: What role does Corporate Blogging take in collaboration with the companies’ other forms of external communication and what barriers are encountered in the adoption of a corporate blogging strategy. The thesis is based on qualitative analysis conducted with five Danish companies who were part of the first wave to adopt the tool and therefore have experience with managing an <b>external</b> corporate <b>blog.</b> Qualitative analysis has been the method used as the foundation of the research and the people interviewed in the organisation are all of managerial level in the field of external communication. The overall conclusions of the thesis is that the companies in question have benefited in regards to exposure and PR from being part of the first group of Danish corporate bloggers, For most of the companies there has been some strategic thought behind the start of their blog but the implementation process has proceeded in a very ad hoc basis. Also the largest obstacles to engaging on the blog have been personal and mental barriers, as oppose to the usual technical barriers. Overall most of the companies have had a positive learning experience implementing the blog and they are now starting to feel the value of the tool in building further external relationships with their surrounding environment...|$|R

40|$|Narratives of representation’ allow {{readers to}} see their own identities {{reflected}} within texts they access and can increase empathy by exposing readers to varied experiences (Smolkin & Young 2011 : 217). Researching personal topics has traditionally relied on approaches that require direct contact between a researcher (writer) and a participant (Wilkinson & Thelwall 2011 : 387), which can be time-consuming and expensive. The expression of personal experiences through autoethnography has also been adopted {{in the creation of}} these narratives as an alternative approach, but can limit the conclusions presented due to the restricted scope of experiences that can be explored (Méndez 2013). Critical analysis of blog posts offers new possibilities, allowing writers to explore how members of a social group candidly discuss their identities and the issues they face with each other and <b>external</b> parties. Accessing <b>blog</b> posts written by members of the queer community has allowed me to create specific narratives of representation underpinned by accurate and authentic depictions, ensuring readers are exposed to diverse perspectives that reflect reality.

40|$|This master thesis {{focuses on}} the use of {{corporate}} blogs in Norwegian organizations. A review of existing literature and research in the field of blogging and corporate blogging has been done, and the advantages/disadvantages of corporate blogging and blog reading are described. A web survey has been conducted to investigate if Norwegian organizations are blogging and their views on corporate blogging and blog reading. In addition to this, three case studies from Norwegian organizations that have adopted the blog as a tool is presented to give a more profound insight on how Norwegian organizations are utilizing blogs. The problem statement for this thesis was: What is the state of corporate blogging in Norway? With the following underlying research questions: Are Norwegian organizations blogging? Why do they blog? How do they do it? What are their experiences? How do corporate blogging in Norway compare to corporate blogging abroad? The results from this thesis show that Norwegian organizations have adopted the blog as a tool, but in small numbers so far. Both <b>external</b> and internal <b>blogging</b> has been seen in this research. The early adopters are seeing a variety of benefits from their blogging initiatives and the majority state that their blogs are considered as successful and that they will continue to blog in the future. We have also seen that the number of Norwegian organizations that read blogs and monitor the blogosphere is greater than the number of Norwegian organizations blogging themselves, and have seen indications that there is an increased interest in corporate blogging amongst Norwegian organizations...|$|R
40|$|World’s most {{influential}} companies {{are starting to}} use blogs as communication channels when communicating with their target groups. 12 % companies in the Forbes 500 list own blogs (Anderson & Cass 2007 - 2008). The present study researched the methods, target groups and reasons for blogging of Estonian corporate blogs. The main research areas were: How are Estonian corporate blogs written? Who are the main target groups of Estonian corporate blogs? Why do Estonian businesses blog? What do the bloggers recommend to businesses who are considering blogging? The {{aim of this study}} was to find out why companies should blog and which aspects they would have to take into account while adopting it. Although the number of blogs in the blogosphere is growing and there are statements about their importance, there are only a few empirical studies that would prove the benefits of corporate blogging. The theoretical background of this study covered two aspects – the role of blogs in internal and in <b>external</b> communication. <b>Blog</b> as an <b>external</b> communications channel is based on marketing communication strategies, which I divided into three categories – informing the consumer, motivating the consumer and the consumer’s image of the company. Different authors claim, that blogs cover all marketing communications strategies, except for that blogs should not be written for sales (Merken 2006). Blogs are rather used to influence and educate the consumers and to affirm the company’s image. Internally blogs work as information management tools (Röll 2003), which enable to share the information and avoid the loss of it, when employees leave the company. Methodologically I used 11 semi-structured informant interviews with Estonian corporate bloggers. The selection was based on whether the blog was active and had been opened for more than one year (by January 2008 when I started present research). Interviews were conducted in March and April, 2008. Involved businesses were: Mobi Solutions OÜ, Sevenline OÜ, OÜ Altex Marketing, OÜ Developers Team, OÜ Tr. ee (brand: Blog. tr. ee), Nagi OÜ, Baltika AS (brand: Monton), OÜ Karukoske and OÜ Vanderlin (brand: Soomaa. com), Eesti Ekspressi Kirjastuse AS, Presshouse OÜ ([digi] magazine) and AS Elion. The methods of corporate blogging in Estonia vary and there is no universal model for it. Each company used the solution that was most suitable for them. The amount of bloggers was from one to many, they worked internally in the company or were hired externally, some blogs had posts five times per week, whereas sometimes only monthly posts occurred. Themes covered a wide range of areas, but there were more blogs that concentrated on one or two subject fields. There were blogs that confirmed dialogue with their readers – there were several bloggers who said that thanks to the blog they have got feedback and suggestions both through online and offline channels. Target groups were mostly not specified, but there were also some exceptions as Monton, Elion and Sevenline had defined their target groups. Based on subject fields target groups could be defined, but often they were too general. Employees of the company were targeted only by Altex Marketing. The reasons for blogging fall into three categories: format based, beneficial for the company and the bloggers’ personal interests. A blog is a simple channel, where it is possible to write about everything the bloggers want, in the way they want it, depending on how they can write it. By helping optimize the search engines, blogs make the company more visible online, and the number of visitors to the company’s website can thereby be increased. Estonian businesses used blogs as a marketing tool and a way to enhance the brand image, which can be used to find new customers and to inform and communicate with existing ones. Bloggers personal interests vary, but mostly bloggers want to educate themselves, test the possibilities of Web 2. 0 and document important information. So there were many reasons, why business should start a blog. Nevertheless, bloggers claimed that blogging does not suit to every business. They suggested to first understand what a blog is, to determine reasons why the company should blog, who are the target groups and which topics would be covered, and then consider blogging. It was also advised to practice blogging before going public, to make sure there is a person who is responsible for maintaining the blog and decide on the blogging frequency. Furthermore, corporate bloggers said that they can make many suggestions, but those who want to start a blog should keep the planning period short and start right now. Corporate blogs and their use as a marketing or public relations tool are subjects that should definitely be researched further. In Estonia, and around the world in general, there has been too little empirical research on corporate blogs to make elaborated conclusions. It is possible to research the links between blogs and search engines. And it should also be studied, what readers' interest in blogs depend on...|$|R
