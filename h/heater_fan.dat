25|$|May 1975 - Introduction of the Chevette three-door Hatchback in {{base and}} L model variations. Both had an {{improved}} {{version of the}} 1,256 cc OHV engine from the Viva, with a similar four-speed gearbox, rear wheel drive, independent front suspension, rack-and-pinion steering and servo-assisted dual circuit brakes. Initial standard equipment included two-speed <b>heater</b> <b>fan,</b> radial tyres, reversing lights, heated rear window and reclining front seats.|$|E
25|$|The {{new body}} also {{featured}} a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection. Also new for '71 was a flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents {{mounted in the}} trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used the <b>heater</b> <b>fan</b> to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.|$|E
25|$|Also new for the 1971 Electra 225, {{as well as}} the B-body LeSabre and Centurion, and E-body Riviera, was a {{new power}} {{ventilation}} system.

50|$|Honeywell {{has many}} brands that {{commercial}} and retail consumers may recognize, including its line of home thermostats (particularly the iconic round type) and Garrett turbochargers. In addition to consumer home products Honeywell itself produces, such as thermostats, sensors, security alarm systems, and air cleaners and dehumidifiers, {{the company also}} licenses its brand name for use in various retail products made by partner manufacturers such as air conditioners, <b>heaters,</b> <b>fans,</b> security safes, home generators, and paper shredders.|$|R
50|$|A <b>fan</b> <b>heater</b> is {{a heater}} that works {{by using a}} fan to pass air over a heat source (e.g. a heating element). This heats up the air, which then leaves the heater, warming up the {{surrounding}} room. They can heat an enclosed space such as a room faster than a <b>heater</b> without <b>fan,</b> but, like any fan, create audible noise.|$|R
50|$|The three-seat, full steel {{cabin is}} heat and sound insulated, and the {{interior}} is fully upholstered. The two-piece windscreen is curved and made from laminated glass. The driver's seat can be adjusted vertically and horizontally, and it is sprung and damped. The <b>heater</b> <b>fan</b> is two-speed and the nozzles are located at windscreen, legroom and {{both ends of the}} dashboard. The windscreen wipers are with separate motors.|$|E
50|$|Another trouble-prone feature Pontiacs {{shared with}} all GM B- and C-body cars for 1971 {{was a new}} power {{ventilation}} system.

50|$|Industrial <b>fan</b> <b>heaters</b> use {{high-output}} finned {{heating elements}} {{in front of}} a fan to provide a larger airflow and higher kilowatt rating than many smaller residential <b>fan</b> heaters.Industrial <b>fan</b> <b>heaters</b> can be used in warehouses, shipping containers, clean rooms, shops and other general purpose heating applications.They can also be used as dryers or dehumidifiers with modified attachments or mountings. Portable industrial <b>fan</b> <b>heaters</b> tend to range from around 1.5 kW up to about 45 kW with either axial or centrifugal fans and various staged controls and over-temperature safety limit controls.|$|R
50|$|Portable {{fuel-powered}} <b>fan</b> <b>heaters</b> {{release all}} the fumes of combustion into the room, creating {{a risk of}} poisoning by carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Most installed fuel <b>fan</b> <b>heaters</b> {{in the first world}} use a heat exchanger and external ventilation, avoiding that risk by venting the combustion gases to the outdoors.|$|R
50|$|Although oil heaters {{are more}} {{expensive}} to run and provide far less spatial heating than gas heaters, they are still commonly used in bedrooms and other small-to-medium-sized enclosed areas. This is because gas heaters, especially when unflued, are not suitable for bedroom use - gas heaters cannot be used in confined spaces due to the reduced oxygen, and the emissions produced. This leaves electrically powered heaters, such as oil <b>heaters</b> and <b>fan</b> <b>heaters,</b> as the only alternative.|$|R

5000|$|There {{were other}} {{changes for the}} Mk II; the front bumper was raised (in common with the Spitfire Mk.3) to conform to new crash regulations, necessitating a revised front end, and side vents {{were added to the}} front wings and rear pillars. Under the bonnet, the engine was uprated to develop [...] with a new {{cylinder}} head, camshaft, and manifolds. Performance improved to 107 mph, but perhaps more noteworthy the 0-60 mph time dropped to 10 seconds. The fuel economy was also improved to 25 mpgimp average. The interior was updated with a new dashboard and better ventilation, a two-speed <b>heater</b> <b>fan</b> and a black headlining. Overdrive remained a popular option for the manual transmission.|$|E

50|$|The Alfasud {{was shown}} at the Turin Motor Show three years later in 1971 and was {{immediately}} praised by journalists for its styling. The four-door saloon featured an 1,186 cc Boxer water-cooled engine with a belt-driven overhead camshaft on each cylinder head. It also featured an elaborate suspension setup for a car in its class: (MacPherson struts at the front and a beam axle with Watt's linkage at the rear). Other unusual features for this size of car were four-wheel disc brakes (with the front ones being inboard), and rack and pinion steering. The engine design allowed the Alfasud to have a low bonnet line, making it very aerodynamic for its day, also giving it a low centre of gravity. As {{a result of these}} design features, the car had excellent performance for its engine size, and levels of road-holding and handling that would not be equalled in its class for another ten years. Despite its two-box shape, a hatchback was not initially part of the range. Some of the controls were unorthodox, the lights, turn indicators, horn, wipers and <b>heater</b> <b>fan</b> all being operated by pulling, turning or pushing the two column stalks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) {{application}} to control domotic devices usually present at home. Previous studies have shown that people with severe disabilities, both physical and cognitive ones, do not achieve high accuracy results using motor imagery-based BCIs. To overcome this limitation, we propose the implementation of a BCI application using P 300 evoked potentials, because neither extensive training nor extremely high concentration level are required for this kind of BCIs. The implemented BCI application allows to control several devices as TV, DVD player, mini Hi-Fi system, multimedia hard drive, telephone, <b>heater,</b> <b>fan</b> and lights. Our aim is that potential users, i. e. people with severe disabilities, are able to achieve high accuracy. Therefore, this domotic BCI application is useful to increase their personal autonomy and independence, improving their quality of life...|$|E

40|$|Ecological {{experiments}} on fire ants cannot, or should not, use poison baits {{to eliminate the}} fire ants because such baits are not specific to fire ants, or even to ants. Hot water is an extremely effective and specific killing agent for fire ant colonies, but producing large amounts of hot water in the field, and making the production apparatus mobile have been problematical. The construction and use of a charcoal-fired kiln made from a 55 -gal. oil drum lined with a sand-fireclay mixture is described. An automobile <b>heater</b> <b>fan</b> powered from a 12 -v battery provided a draft. Dual bilge pumps pumped water from a large tank through a long coil of copper tubing within the kiln to produce 4 to 5 l. of hot water per min. The hot water was collected in 20 l. buckets and poured into fire ant nest previously opened by piercing with a stick. The entire assembly was transported in and operated {{from the back of}} a pickup truck. Five experimental plots containing 32 to 38 colonies of the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), were treated with hot water over a period of two years. All colonies on the treatment plots were treated twice with hot water early in 2004, reducing their numbers to zero. However new colonies were formed, and mature colonies expanded into the plots.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to investigate experimentally, the performance of a fabricated solar dryer under Jordan climate condition during the summer of 2013. The temporal variations of temperature difference between absorber plate and ambient temperature were obtained in the results and its influence on the performance of solat flat plate collector was examined. The effect of absorber plate temperature, ambient temperature and wind heat transfer coefficient on the top heat loss coefficient was also investigated. The results showed that the efficiency of the collector ranging between 45 to 66 % which affected significantly by the amount of solar irradiation during the day. Only top heat loss was taken into considerations, since other losses were very small and might be negligible. Also the results confirmed that the performance of collector was maximum when the difference between plate and ambient temperatures was maximum. In addition, this work presented an indirect forced convection solar dryer, which consists of solar <b>heater,</b> <b>fan</b> and drying chamber. Fan was used to force the heated air through chamber to increase the drying rate.  A 500 gram of tomatoe were dried to the final moisture content 28 % from 95 % (w. b). The experimental moisture ratios of the tomatoes were fitted to four mathematical drying models. Comparisons between these modes are sought using statistical analysis in the results. The fit quality obtained with each model was evaluated. After the comparison with the experimental obtained values, it was concluded that polynomial equation with second order represents the drying characteristics better than the other models by indicating high value of coefficient correlation (R 2 = 0. 999564) and low values of other parameters(2 = 0. 000203; RMSE= 0. 01011; MBE= 0. 000102) compare with other models. The effective moisture diffusivity was estimated using Fick's second law and was  m 2 /s with an average temperature of 306 K.
