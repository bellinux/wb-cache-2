40|$|This paper {{undertakes}} a {{new strategy}} to estimate emigration rates among US immigrants by inferring the probability of emigration using longitudinal administrative earnings data. Two groups of emigrants are evaluated separately: those who <b>emigrate</b> <b>from</b> the United States and those who leave both the United States and the Social Security system. About 1. 0 to 1. 5 percent of the foreign-born population <b>emigrate</b> <b>from</b> the USA every year, and between about 0. 8 and 1. 2 percent of foreign-born workers <b>emigrate</b> <b>from</b> the Social Security system. Regression analysis suggests that immigrants with lower earnings {{are more likely to}} emigrate and that the likelihood of <b>emigrating</b> <b>from</b> the United States increases with age, but is unchanged for those leaving the US Social Security system...|$|R
