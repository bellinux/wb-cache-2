5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|The second <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> {{the name}} should be Leopoldia. In 1819 Herbert had {{proposed}} Leopoldia as a nomen provisorium (provisional name) {{for the same}} taxon as he called Hippeastrum in 1821. Although Leopoldia was subsequently validated (i.e. became the correct name), this was overlooked, and Hippeastrum rather than Leopoldia {{was used for the}} genus of New World amaryllids. Following Filippo Parlatore in 1845, the name Leopoldia was used for a genus of grape hyacinth species, allied to Muscari. In order to preserve the widespread usage of both Hippeastrum and Leopoldia, Fabio Garbari and Werner Greuter proposed in 1970 that Herbert's Hippeastrum and Parlatore's Leopoldia should be conserved and Herbert's Leopoldia rejected. This was accepted and Hippeastrum Herb. is now a nomen conservandum (conserved name), i.e. the correct name regardless {{of the fact that it}} does not have priority over Leopoldia.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s the Treaty {{has become much}} more legally important. However, because of {{uncertainties}} about its meaning and translation, it still does not have a firm place in New Zealand law or jurisprudence. Another <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the Crown in Right of New Zealand is bound. The separate New Zealand Crown was created when New Zealand adopted the Statute of Westminster in 1947, which granted legislative independence to New Zealand and created the Crown in Right of New Zealand. Martyn Finlay rejected this contention.|$|E
25|$|The <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> Richard {{was indeed}} {{using the same}} {{specimen}} as Lamarck; the geographical origin {{is said to be}} different, and the descriptions do not match; for example in Lamarck's Cephalanthus chinensis the inflorescences are axillary whereas in Richard's Anthocephalus they are terminal. If specimens were the same, then Anthocephalus is a synonym of the Madagascan Cephalanthus and cannot be a generic name for the Asian kadam tree. If they were different (in spite of Richard's claim that they were the same) then Anthocephalus could be a generic name for the kadam tree. Based on the latter view, the name Anthocephalus chinensis has been widely used for the kadam tree.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{difference}} between domestic and wild populations can be framed within two considerations. The first distinguishes between domestication traits that are presumed {{to have been}} essential at {{the early stages of}} domestication, and improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations. Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates and were selected during the initial episode of domestication, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations. A second <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> traits associated with the domestication syndrome resulted from a relaxation of selection as animals exited the wild environment or from positive selection resulting from intentional and unintentional human preference. Some recent genomic studies on the genetic basis of traits associated with the domestication syndrome have shed light on both of these issues.|$|E
50|$|One <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> Congress had overstepped its {{constitutional}} authority {{in creating the}} Fair Labor Standards Act.|$|R
5000|$|The court {{considered}} {{two main}} issues in its decision. The first <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> the Experi-Metal employee whose confidential information {{was used to}} initiate the fraudulent transfers was authorized to initiate transfers {{on behalf of the}} company, and in turn, whether Comerica complied with its own security procedures in accepting the orders. The second <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> Comerica acted in [...] "good faith" [...] in accepting the orders on Experi-Metal's account.|$|R

25|$|The word robot was {{introduced}} to the public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920. The play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified people called robots. The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures, but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who can be mistaken for humans. These mass-produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless, incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self-preservation. At <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor (especially after a number of specially-formulated robots achieve self-awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans).|$|E
500|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the genus}} is complicated. The first <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the name should more properly be Amaryllis L.. In 1753 Carl Linnaeus created the name Amaryllis belladonna, [...] the type species of the genus Amaryllis, in his Species Plantarum along with eight other Amaryllis species. Linnaeus had earlier worked on the Estate of George Clifford near Haarlem between 1735 and 1737 describing the plants growing there in his Hortus Cliffortianus in 1738. It is to this work that he refers in his Species Plantarum. This {{was assumed to be}} the South African Cape Belladonna, although not precisely known. Clifford's herbarium is now preserved at the Natural History Museum in London.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Marshall {{agreed with}} the O'Brien Test being {{applicable}} in this case but found fault in how it was explored. He explains {{that in terms of}} government interest [...] "the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> any substantial Government interest is served by banning sleep that is part of a political demonstration". Justice Marshall's dissent holds a stark contrast to the majority and concurring opinions. Much of his statement makes it clear he believed the demonstrators' request {{to have the right to}} sleep was a genuine freedom of expression concern.|$|E

2500|$|Philippines (Vote: For): In {{the days}} before the vote, the Philippines' {{representative}} General Carlos P. Romulo stated [...] "We hold that the issue is primarily moral. The <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the United Nations should accept responsibility for the enforcement of a policy which is clearly repugnant to the valid nationalist aspirations of the people of Palestine. The Philippines Government holds that the United Nations ought not to accept such responsibility". After a phone call from Washington, the representative was recalled and the Philippines' vote changed.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002 Phantom Works, Boeing's {{advanced}} {{research and development}} facility in Seattle, approached Evgeny Podkletnov directly. Phantom Works was blocked by Russian technology transfer controls. At this time Lieutenant General George Muellner, the outgoing head of the Boeing Phantom Works, confirmed that attempts by Boeing to work with Podkletnov had been blocked by Moscow, also commenting that [...] "The physical principles – and Podkletnov's device {{is not the only}} one – appear to be valid... There is basic science there. They're not breaking the laws of physics. The <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the science can be engineered into something workable" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} trial, the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> John {{attempted}} to kill Monica. The officer {{is asked to}} testify to what he heard Monica scream from inside the house: [...] "Help, John is trying to kill me!" [...] This statement would be hearsay. The officer is being asked to testify to what Monica said to prove that John attempted to murder Monica. Unless the attorney can show that this statement falls within {{an exception to the}} hearsay rule, the factfinder (the judge or jury) may not consider Monica's statement (this particular statement, however, would likely be admissible because of [...] "Excited Utterance" [...] and [...] "Present sense impression" [...] exceptions).|$|E

2500|$|... "Our {{evaluation}} of the proper balance {{that has to be}} struck in this type of case leads us to conclude that there must be a narrowly drawn authority to permit a reasonable search for weapons {{for the protection of the}} police officer, where he has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual, regardless of whether he has probable cause to arrest the individual for a crime. The officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger (italics added)." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{hotly debated}} <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the {{biological}} contribution includes capacities specific to language acquisition, {{often referred to}} as universal grammar. For fifty years, linguist Noam Chomsky has argued for the hypothesis that children have innate, language-specific abilities that facilitate and constrain language learning. [...] In particular, he has proposed that humans are biologically prewired to learn language at a certain time and in a certain way, arguing that children are born with a language acquisition device (LAD). However, since he developed the minimalist program, his latest version of theory of syntactic structure, Chomsky has reduced the elements of universal grammar, which he believes are prewired in humans to just the principle of recursion, thus voiding most of the nativist endeavor.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of Searle's {{response}} {{argue that}} the program has allowed the man to have two minds in one head. If we assume a [...] "mind" [...] {{is a form of}} information processing, then the theory of computation can account for two computations occurring at once, namely (1) the computation for universal programmability (which is the function instantiated by the person and note-taking materials independently from any particular program contents) and (2) the computation of the Turing machine that is described by the program (which is instantiated by everything including the specific program). The theory of computation thus formally explains the open possibility that the second computation in the Chinese Room could entail a human-equivalent semantic understanding of the Chinese inputs. The focus belongs on the program's Turing machine rather than on the person's. However, from Searle's perspective, this argument is circular. The question at <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> consciousness is a form of information processing, and this reply requires that we make that assumption.|$|E
50|$|At <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> {{the cost}} of the trip was taxable income to Mr. and Mrs. Gotcher under Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code.|$|R

2500|$|The {{debate has}} become more urgent lately, as the 2008-2009 {{recession}} shaved newspapers' profits, and as once-explosive growth in newspaper web revenues has leveled off, forestalling what the industry hoped would become {{an important source of}} revenue. At <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the newspaper industry faces a cyclical trough (or dip), or whether new technology has rendered print newspapers obsolete, at least in their traditional paper format. As of 2017, an increasing percentage of Millennials (young adults) get their news from social media websites such as Facebook. In the 2010s, many traditional newspapers have begun offering [...] "digital editions", which can be accessed via desktop computer, laptops, and mobile devices such as tablet computers and smartphones. Online newspapers may offer new advertising opportunities to newspaper companies, as online advertising enables much more precise targeting of ads; with an online newspaper, for example, different readers, such as Baby boomers and Millennials can be sent different advertisements.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{there is}} a {{question}} about how separate from the idea of -genes birth and begetting the cited uses of monogenes in the sense of [...] "unique" [...] truly are. For example, the ending -genes is arguably not redundant even in the sense of [...] "only" [...] as per when Clement of Rome (96 AD), and later Origen, Cyril and others, employ monogenes to describe the rebirth of the phoenix. At <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> Clement is merely stressing monos unique, or using monogenes to indicate unique in its method of rebirth, or possibly {{that there is only one}} single bird born and reborn. Likewise in Plato's Timaeus, the [...] "only-begotten and created Heaven", is still unique in how it is begotten, in comparison to the begetting of animals and men, just as Earth and Heaven give birth to Ocean and Tethys. Of the Liddell Scott references for [...] "unique" [...] (monogenes being used purely as monos) that leaves only Parmenides, which (as above) is no longer considered a likely reading of the Greek text.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, {{a different}} {{judge of the}} High Court departed from the view taken in Tang Kin Hwa. In Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006), Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon definitively answering the question left open by Phang {{as to whether the}} two tests for apparent bias were the same. He thought that there was a real difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, [...] "suspicion" [...] suggests a belief that something that may not be provable could still be possible. [...] "Reasonable" [...] suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, [...] "likelihood" [...] points towards something being likely, and [...] "real" [...] suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue {{is the degree to which}} a particular event is not likely or possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{main point}} at <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> the serfs should remain {{dependent}} on the landlords, or <b>whether</b> they should <b>be</b> transformed into a class of independent communal proprietors.|$|R
