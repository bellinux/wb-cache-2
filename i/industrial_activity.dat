5|$|Modi also relaxed or {{abolished}} {{a number}} of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to <b>industrial</b> <b>activity.</b> A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> in the most polluted areas in the countries. The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.|$|E

The tablets were sent to the British Museum, but other Roman material is on display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery with the lake's other historical artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Grouped into cooperatives, women play {{a leading}} role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and {{processing}} shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a rural exodus of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.|$|E

5|$|The dating of recessions {{during this}} period is controversial. Modern {{economic}} statistics, such as gross domestic product and unemployment, were not gathered {{during this period}}. Victor Zarnowitz evaluated a variety of indices to measure the severity of these recessions. From 1834 to 1929, one measure of recessions is the Cleveland Trust Company index, which measured business activity and, beginning in 1882, an index of trade and <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> was available, {{which can be used}} to compare recessions.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{the city}} {{expanded}} its railroad connections and <b>industrial</b> <b>activity.</b> It suffered a corresponding rise in pollution {{of the river}} and waterfront. During the early 1870s, the Eads Bridge was constructed over the Mississippi River, and the city established several large parks, including Forest Park. Due to local political and economic disputes, the city separated from St. Louis County in 1876 and became an independent city. Its limited geographic area has inhibited its success in the 20th and 21st centuries because of the small tax base. During the late 19th century, St. Louis became home to two Major League Baseball teams. Ragtime and blues music flourished in the city, with African Americans making major contributions also in jazz.|$|E
5|$|Although the Industrial Revolution did {{not much}} affect the rural parts of Clwyd, there was {{considerable}} <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> in the North Wales Coalfield in the north-east of the county, particularly around Wrexham. The Bersham Ironworks at Bersham, in the same area, was {{at the forefront of}} technological advances and was most famous for being the original working site of the industrialist John Wilkinson who invented new processes for boring cannons. The Williams-Wynn family of Wynnstay had become rich after the dissolution of the monasteries and owned vast estates in Clwyd with resources including lead, tin and copper as well as corn and timber.|$|E
5|$|Historically part of Cheshire, Altrincham was {{established}} as a market town in 1290, {{a time when the}} economy of most communities was based on agriculture rather than trade, and there is still a market in the town today. Further socioeconomic development came with the extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 and the arrival of the railway in 1849, stimulating <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> in the town. Outlying villages were absorbed by Altrincham's subsequent growth, along with the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall, formerly the home of the Earl of Stamford, and now a tourist attraction with three Grade I Listed Buildings and a deer park.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} decade of her reign, {{influenced}} by her Jewish courtier Abraham Mendel Theben, Maria Theresa issued edicts which offered some state protection to her Jewish subjects. Her actions {{during the late}} stages of her reign contrast her early opinions. She forbade the forcible conversion of Jewish children to Christianity in 1762, and in 1763 she forbade Catholic clergy from extracting surplice fees from her Jewish subjects. In 1764, she ordered the release of those Jews who had been jailed for a blood libel {{in the village of}} Orkuta. Notwithstanding her strong dislike of Jews, Maria Theresa supported Jewish commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> in Austria.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{industry}} {{came out}} of the depression slump by a dramatic expansion of its <b>industrial</b> <b>activity,</b> absorbing unemployed men and many women as well. The shipyards were the centre of more activity, but many smaller industries produced the machinery needed by the British bombers, tanks and warships. Agriculture prospered, as did all sectors except for coal mining, which was operating mines near exhaustion. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, rose 25 per cent, and unemployment temporarily vanished. Increased income, and the more equal distribution of food, obtained through a tight rationing system, dramatically improved the health and nutrition; the average height of 13-year-olds in Glasgow increased by 2inches.|$|E
5|$|The city of Nagasaki {{had been}} one of the largest {{seaports}} in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging <b>industrial</b> <b>activity,</b> including the production of , ships, military equipment, and other war materials. The four largest companies in the city were Mitsubishi Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90% of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90% of the city's industry. Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate at night with AN/APQ-13 radar.|$|E

5|$|The {{surrounding}} countryside, irrigated by {{the lower}} Chenab River, produces cotton, wheat, sugarcane, vegetables and fruits. The city is an industrial centre with major railway repair yards, engineering works, and mills that process sugar, flour, and oil seed. Faisalabad {{is a major}} producer of superphosphates, cotton and silk textiles, hosiery, dyes, industrial chemicals, beverages, clothing, pulp and paper, printing, agricultural equipment, and ghee (clarified butter). The Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry monitors <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> {{in the city and}} reports their findings to the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and provincial government.

5|$|A large {{petroleum}} reservoir {{was discovered}} {{just west of}} the city of Burkburnett, a small town in Wichita County, Texas in 1912. Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became boomtowns, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative oil field, and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and <b>industrial</b> <b>activity,</b> Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and mineral rights deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{carried out}} before the {{flooding}} of Chew Valley Lake also uncovered Roman remains, indicating agricultural and <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> from {{the second half of}} the 1st century until the 3rd century AD. The finds included a moderately large villa at Chew Park, where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with ink writing were found. There is also evidence from the Pagans Hill Roman Temple at Chew Stoke. In October 2001 the West Bagborough Hoard of 4th century Roman silver was discovered in West Bagborough. The 681 coins included two denarii from the early 2nd century and 8 Miliarense and 671 Siliqua all dating to the period AD 337– 367. The majority were struck in the reigns of emperors Constantius II and Julian and derive from a range of mints including Arles and Lyons in France, Trier in Germany and Rome.|$|E
