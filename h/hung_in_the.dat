5|$|A famous story, {{possibly}} apocryphal, {{states that}} during the Battle of Princeton, when Alexander Hamilton, then the commander of an artillery battery, ordered his cannons to fire upon the British soldiers taking refuge in Nassau Hall, one of the cannonballs was shot through {{the head of the}} portrait of King George II that <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chapel, which was subsequently replaced with a portrait of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating in}} 1922 Hayden {{took on a}} number of {{different}} jobs and was called to coach the University of Kentucky's basketball team in 1926 following the departure of Ray Eklund. After a 3–13 record in his first year he was replaced with John Mauer and returned to his previous occupations. When he died in 2003, at the age of 103, he was the University of Kentucky's oldest former athlete, and his jersey is among those <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school's Rupp Arena.|$|E
5|$|Oasis {{evolved from}} an earlier band called the Rain, {{composed}} of Paul McGuigan (bass guitar), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Tony McCarroll (drums) and Chris Hutton (vocals). Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance Liam Gallagher as a replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis. This change was inspired by an Inspiral Carpets tour poster that <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gallagher brothers' bedroom. One of the venues the poster listed was the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon.|$|E

5|$|On the continent, the {{extension}} of the Empire's borders beyond the Rhine <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> balance for some time, with the emperor Caligula apparently poised to invade Germania in 39 AD, and Cnaeus Domitius Corbulo crossing the Rhine in 47 AD and marching into the territory of the Frisii and Chauci. Caligula's successor, Claudius, ordered the suspension of further attacks across the Rhine, setting what was to become the permanent limit of the Empire's expansion in this direction.|$|E
5|$|The present château, {{designed}} on {{a triangular}} plan, has five conical towers and a watchtower capped by slate roofs. Archaeologists have uncovered {{traces of the}} older buildings on the site {{dating back to the}} 11th century. The architect Frantz Jourdain renovated the interior of the 14th century tower as a library for the Rochefoucault family in 1893. The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries of the building, which <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> master bedroom, were rediscovered in 1850; they were later sold to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1923.|$|E
5|$|When Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, {{it came to}} be seen as {{unlikely}} that there would be any attempted landing as long as that conflict was undecided — from the British point of view at the time, the matter <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> balance. In July 1941, construction of field fortifications was greatly reduced and concentration given to the possibility of a raid in force rather than a full-scale invasion.|$|E

5|$|A pair {{of large}} canvases with hunting dogs by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1742), now {{hanging in the}} Salle du synode, once <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Parisian hôtel particulier of Samuel-Jacques Bernard. The three {{paintings}} in the chapel are copies of works by Antonio da Correggio: Adoration of the Shepherds, Virgin and Child with Sts Jerome and Madeleine, and The Rest on the Return from Egypt. They were made in 1724 in Modena and Parma by Robert deSéry (1686–1733) for Armand Gaston, whom he had met in Rome the same year. DeSéry would later provide many other paintings for the cardinal's apartments, all of them copies of paintings by greater masters. Napoleon's green bed is an authentic work by Jacob-Desmalter.|$|E
5|$|After {{travelling}} to Tangiers in 1912, Rix held several successful {{exhibitions of}} her work, with one drawing, Grande marche, Tanger, {{purchased by the}} French government. She {{was one of the}} first Australians to paint post-impressionist landscapes, was made a member of the Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français, and had works <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Paris Salon first in 1911 and again in 1913. The family evacuated from France to England after the outbreak of World War I. A period of personal tragedy followed, as Rix's sister died in 1914, then her mother in 1915. In 1916 she met and married George Matson Nicholas, only to be widowed the next month when he was killed on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|City {{officials}} {{scheduled a}} public celebration with free {{food and drink}} for the testing of the recast bell. When the bell was struck, it did not break, but the sound produced was described by one hearer as like two coal scuttles being banged together. Mocked by the crowd, Pass and Stow hastily took the bell away and again recast it. When {{the fruit of the}} two founders' renewed efforts was brought forth in June 1753, the sound was deemed satisfactory, though Norris indicated that he did not personally like it. The bell was <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> steeple of the State House the same month.|$|E

5|$|During a June 2007 {{visit to}} the {{predominantly}} Muslim Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania {{has a population of}} 2.8million, has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy. A huge image of the President was <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him. A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana. The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing {{the outcome of}} the battle <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of the}} allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing {{the outcome of the}} battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Linda Syddick went to Sydney to see {{her work}} Ngkarte Dreaming <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Blake Prize {{exhibition}} – one of three occasions prior to 1994 on which she was a Blake finalist. The Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art included one of her paintings in 1998. She has been represented on several occasions in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, in 1995, 2006 (with her painting The Witch Doctor and the Windmill), 2008 (with Big rain at Walukurritje), and 2009, with Tingari Men at Wilkingkarra (Lake Mackay). Linda's works are held in several major public collections, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Art Gallery of South Australia.|$|E
50|$|A third daughter, Irene, {{was also}} {{the subject of a}} Renoir {{painting}} entitled Little Irene. Louis was so dissatisfied with the painting that he <b>hung</b> it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> servants' quarters and delayed payment of only 1500 francs.|$|R
50|$|Bolognara Calcagno {{would also}} wear this changed attire from then on, no longer wearing skirts or any {{feminine}} clothing, and adopting characteristically masculine behavior.

5|$|The {{powers and}} {{prestige}} {{of the prime minister}} have varied through the years. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's second prime minister, often lamented that in practice he had little power. Since the death of Pham <b>Hung</b> <b>in</b> 1988, <b>the</b> prime minister has been ranked 3rd <b>in</b> <b>the</b> order of precedence of the Communist Party's Politburo, the highest decision-making body in Vietnam.|$|R
5|$|Stokes {{returned}} from a European honeymoon in 1934, but she produced few works {{in the years immediately}} following. Although the Collins Street apartment had become a full-time studio for Stokes, only two paintings and two sketches from the period are known. The most notable is The Village (c.1933–1935), influenced, according to Stokes' own account, by the post-impressionist and portraitist Augustus John. This work was <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inaugural exhibition of the Contemporary Art Society, held at the National Gallery of Victoria. It was included in a travelling exhibition that appeared in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1941 and later in Canada. In 1946, Stokes presented the work to the National Gallery of Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The Rokeby Venus is {{the only}} {{surviving}} female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively {{by members of the}} Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} in Europe, Fuller had great success. After a pastel {{portrait}} of hers was accepted for the Paris Salon in 1895, two of her paintings were shown there in 1896. That was followed by another, La Glaneuse, in 1897, in which year {{she also had a}} work accepted by the Royal Academy in London. She exhibited in many other locations: the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and Manchester Art Gallery in England, as well as the Victorian Artists Society and the New South Wales Society of Artists, and at the Melbourne studio of Jane Sutherland. There was even a painting, Landscape, <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exhibition for the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Bendigo. Not all her time was spent in Europe, however; in 1899 she returned to South Africa to paint Cecil Rhodes. One source suggests that she ultimately prepared five portraits of the founder of Rhodesia. A later newspaper report stated that Fuller also travelled and made sketches in Wales, Ireland, and Italy.|$|E
