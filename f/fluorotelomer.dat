5000|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>fluorotelomer</b> alcohols requires a varying number of tetrafluoroethylene monomers that form an oligomer with a pentafluoroethyl iodide telogen.

50|$|Due to the {{toxicity}} of PFOA, major U.S. manufacturers volunteered {{to phase out}} production of PFOA {{by the end of}} 2015. In addition, the use of perfluoroalkyl ethyl-containing food-contact substances are no longer allowed by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations in January 2016. However, although the production of PFOA and PFOS was reduced, the production of fluorotelomer-based chemicals applied to food contact papers is still increasing. Some compounds, such as polyfluoroalkyl phosphate surfactants (PAPs) or <b>fluorotelomers</b> (FTOH), have been used in some brands of microwave popcorn bags. Those compounds are precursors of PFCAs, and evidence shows that they are more toxic than PFCAs themselves. Furthermore, they may also be degraded to PFCAs, and therefore leading to the increase of PFCAs concentrations in the environment and generating adverse effects.|$|R

Interestingly, all telomers obtained exhibit the structure CF 3 CH 2 CF 2 (VDF) nI, showing that (i) the trifluoromethyl radical preferentially attacked the methylene site of VDF with a high regioselectivity; (ii) the only transfer reaction arose from that to the CF 3 I and not from the monomer, the initiator, the solvent, or the polymer; and (iii) a very low defect of VDF chaining (0. 73 % regarded as the lowest one noted in the literature) was observed...|$|R

The allylic-containing <b>fluorotelomers</b> were prepared from a three-step reaction. The first step concerned the thermal and peroxide telomerization of 3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropene (TFP) with perfluoropropyl 2 -iodide or tridecafluoro hexyl iodide leading to monoadduct and diadduct with a ratio {{depending on the}} R 0 =[RFI] 0 /[TFP] 0 and the reaction temperature.

Then the telomers reacted onto allyl acetate yielding RF(C 3 H 3 F 3) nCH 2 CH(I) CH 2 OCOCH 3 (n= 1, 2) in 75 - 80 % yields.

40|$|The {{presence}} of fluorine {{atoms in the}} structure of an organic molecule alters in an extraordinary way its physico-chemical properties and the countless applications of organo-fluorine compounds are a strong testimony of it. The unique properties of fluorinated surfaces (low surface tension, dielectric constant, friction coefficient) derive from the particular features of the C-F bond (Chapter 1). Thanks to their exceptionally low intermolecular interactions, fluorinated compounds produce surfaces with very low interfacial energies which are hardly wet by aqueous and organic liquids, have anti-adhesive properties and low friction coefficients. Thanks to these unique properties fluoro-polymers {{play an important role in}} various fields of modern industry. Fluorinated thermoplastic polymers endowed with high thermal stability, low dielectric constants, excellent chemical resistance, very low surface tensions have now become commonly used both in the industrial practice and in everyday life applications (non-stick cookware, waterproof and breathable fabrics, optical fibers, to name a few). In 2006 the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) demonstrated the bio-accumulative effects of several perfluoro organic compounds with long perfluoro alkyl chain (and their derivatives). This environmental aspect led to the progressive banning of all long chain <b>fluorotelomers</b> compounds within 2015 (Chapter 2). Many of these compounds are currently comprised in the candidate list for SHVC (substances of very high concern) enclosed in the CLP Regulation. As a consequence of these decisions companies involved in the manufacture and marketing of fluoro-compounds for surface treatment are replacing long perfluorinated alkyl compounds with shorter ones. The shortening of the chain length of the fluorinated moiety has posed challenging technological issues because of the dramatic loss of performances. The goal of researchers is to find new molecular solutions able to maintain the same performances of “old” long chain molecules with shorter compounds. In this work the study of alternative fluorinated polymers, obtained by controlled radical polymerization techniques (Chapter 3) were investigated. In particular, the synthesis of fluoroalkyl styrene monomer with short fluorinated chain was carried out (Chapter 4) and the optimization of the synthesis of its precursor, 4 ’-nonafluorobutyl acetophenone, was also studied. The fluoroalkyl styrene monomer was polymerized by conventional radical polymerization and controlled radical polymerization (Chapter 5). Further, the telomerization of polyvinylidene fluoride in {{presence of}} 1 -iodoperfluorobutane and trifluoromethyl iodide as chain transfer agents were investigated. The telomers synthesized were characterized by NMR analyses and the structure of the telomers chains were determined (Chapter 6). ...|$|R

When PTFE is degraded by heat (pyrolysis) it can form PFOA as a minor product. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has compiled a list of 615 chemicals that have the potential to break down into perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCA) including PFOA. However, not all 615 have the potential to break down to form PFOA.|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{scientific}} literature on perfluorinated alkyl chemicals {{in the last decade}} has focused on the fate of <b>fluorotelomer</b> alcohols (FTOHs) in soil, sludge and the atmosphere as well as the identification and quantification of acid metabolites. The FTOH degradation metabolite of greatest interest has been perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) due to its apparent persistence, subsequent accumulation, and potential toxicity to wildlife and humans. The hydrolysis of <b>fluorotelomer</b> monomers used as surfactants or in the manufacturing of polymers {{is one of the most}} likely but unconfirmed source of FTOH and ultimately PFOA in the environment. To probe this hypothesis, and to explore structural factors affecting the microbial hydrolysis rates of two <b>fluorotelomer</b> esters, the biotransformation of 8 : 2 <b>fluorotelomer</b> acrylate (8 : 2 FTA), and 8 : 2 <b>fluorotelomer</b> methacrylate (8 : 2 FTMA) was monitored in aerobic soils for up to 105 days. At each sampling time, triplicate soil microcosms were sacrificed by sampling the headspace for volatile FTOHs followed by sequential extraction of soil for parent compounds, and transient and terminal degradation products. In microbial-active systems, both 8 : 2 FTA and 8 : 2 FTMA were hydrolyzed releasing 8 : 2 FTOH. Observed half-lives for FTA ranged between 3 and 5 days in three different soils. Furthermore, the observed half-lives for 8 : 2 FTMA in two different soils were determined to be at least three times (15 -d) longer. Maximum FTOH levels between 8 and 11 mol % occurred by day 3 in 8 : 2 FTA microcosms. Subsequently, <b>fluorotelomer</b> carboxylic acids (FTCAs) and perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) metabolites were generated consistent with the known biotransformation pathway of 8 : 2 FTOH. For 8 : 2 FTMA, the addition of a methyl group to the acrylate moiety adds sufficient bulk to cause some steric hindrances as well as elicit electronic differences that affect microbially-mediated ester cleavage rates. The subsequent aerobic degradation of 8 : 2 FTOH released from 8 : 2 FTMA followed the same pathway as observed for 8 : 2 FTA but yielded correspondingly lower metabolite concentrations. These biotransformation studies confirm the <b>fluorotelomer</b> esters as indirect sources of PFOA. ^ Additional preliminary studies were conducted to probe the susceptibility of fluorotelomer-based polymers to biodegradation as well as the role of fungal enzymes in the transformation process. A small custom FTA polymer (seven acrylate monomer units) was synthesized and incubated in an aerobic agricultural soil. FTOH generation was observed, but hydrolysis of the <b>fluorotelomer</b> ester side chains could not be clearly delineated from degradation of the 8 : 2 FTA residuals. Fungi are ubiquitous organisms capable of catalyzing the degradation of lignin and other biopolymers. For assessing the potential for fungi to hydrolyze the ester bond, <b>fluorotelomer</b> monomers were incubated with Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus ostreatus in potato dextrose broth and potato dextrose agar. Results from the analysis of solvent extracts as well as headspace were statistically lacking, thus additional work is needed to validate fungal biodegradation potential. ^ The dissertation work presented provides some of the first evidence of the biodegradation potential of <b>fluorotelomer</b> ester monomers to degrade into 8 : 2 <b>fluorotelomer</b> alcohol and subsequently perfluorinated acids. Although better experimental designs are needed to more completely understand the fate of fluorinated polymers in the environment, this work with some <b>fluorotelomer</b> monomers is a great starting reference. In addition, since the parent compounds along with primary and subsequent metabolites were all measured, this data set can be used to validate and improve current models used to predict fluorinated polymer biodegradation. ...|$|E

In this study, a method was developed to determine representative precursor compounds that included PFAIs, FTIs, FTOs, FTACs, and FTMACs in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) air and water samples. The sampling and sample preparation step involved the use of solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges with HLB™ material to enrich the analyte.
