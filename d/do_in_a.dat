5|$|Participants {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the crew may help the GMs {{to set up and}} maintain the environment of the LARP during play by acting as stagehands or playing non-player characters (NPCs) who fill out the setting. Crew typically receive more information about the setting and more direction from the GMs than players <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> tabletop role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically played by a separate crew member. Sometimes players are asked to play NPCs for periods of an event.|$|E
5|$|Groucho Marx played Waldorf T. Beagle (later renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel), and Chico played Emmanuel Ravelli, {{the same}} name as the Italian {{character}} {{he played in the}} film Animal Crackers (1930). Mary McCoy played secretary Miss Dimple, and it is thought that Broderick Crawford also appeared as various characters. Groucho and Chico shared a weekly income of $6,500 for appearing in the show. During the Great Depression, this was considered a high sum for 30 minutes' work, especially since radio scripts required no memorization and only a few minutes were needed for costume, hair and makeup. By comparison, Greta Garbo's weekly salary from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during the same period was also $6,500, though this was for a 40- or 50-hour week. Wynn was paid $5,000 a week for Fire Chief. In contrast, almost two-thirds of American families were living on fewer than $26 a week. In a classic Marxian twist, Harpo was paid a weekly salary for not appearing on the show, even though his mute character would have little to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> radio program anyway.|$|E

25|$|Kono Manga ga Sugoi! {{recommended}} Steel Ball Run as a {{good place}} to start for people who have not read previous parts, due to how it serves as a reboot of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, and appreciated how its move from Weekly Shōnen Jump to the monthly seinen magazine Ultra Jump enabled Araki to write longer stories and depict things that would have been difficult to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> magazine aimed at children. Erkael of Manga-News called the manga one of the best in the series, and said that it does not disappoint the reader at any point.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1897, the {{railroad}} had {{been interested in}} alternatives to steam power, namely, internal-combustion engines. The railroad's shops in Aurora had built an unreliable three-horsepower distillate motor in that year, but it was hugely impractical (requiring a massive 6,000-pound flywheel) and had issues with overheating (even with the best metals of the day, its cylinder heads and liners would warp and melt {{in a matter of}} minutes) and was therefore impractical. Diesel engines of that era were obese, stationary monsters and were best suited for low-speed, continuous operation. None of that would <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> railroad locomotive; however, there was no diesel engine suitable for that purpose then.|$|E
25|$|While Commodore Jones and Captain Landais were {{fighting}} their unexpectedly separate battles, Captains Cottineau of the Pallas and Ricot of Vengeance were left {{wondering what to}} <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> well-organised formation, {{they might have been}} able to make a contribution, but to intervene in a ship-to-ship duel would be very dangerous. In theory, they could have taken advantage of the confusion to sail off after the stragglers of the convoy, but night had now fallen, and until the moon rose, they would not be able to see their prey. Also, it quickly became clear that Bonhomme Richard would need help. Therefore, they waited until they could be useful. About this time, the little schooner caught up with them, but there was no way to transfer the potentially very useful boarding team to Bonhomme Richard or Alliance.|$|E

Sound {{designer}} Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team [...] "scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms" [...] in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to [...] "avoid sounding slick or sci-fi".

Many subplots were resolved, something Zack Handlen writing for The A.V. Club found satisfying, saying that the book had [...] "a blessed willingness to tie up loose ends," [...] something he felt Jordan had been unwilling to <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> positive review, Seth Bracken of Deseret News explained that the pace is jarring but it also [...] "creates a sense of urgency." [...] Reviewers noted that Sanderson's style comes through in the novel, Handlen felt Sanderson's prose [...] "lacks some of the descriptive punch" [...] compared to Jordan's.

500|$|Although {{interest}} has been expressed in adapting Saga for film or TV, Vaughan and Staples reaffirmed their {{desire not to}} do so in an August 2013 interview, with Vaughan stating that the point of Saga as he conceived it was [...] "to do absolutely everything I couldn't <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> movie or a TV show.
