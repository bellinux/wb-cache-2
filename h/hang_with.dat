When feeding, the birds <b>hang</b> <b>with</b> raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do not {{look as if they}} are walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E

Still upset over his fight with Zooey, Peter confronts Sydney and decides to end their friendship. Peter then patches things up with Zooey, explaining to her that while he is nervous, he is ready to get married.

25|$|In {{the time}} {{starting}} from 1933 also the Holy Cross parish was under suppression by the National Socialists ("Nazis") and from 1939 has also lost fold {{members in the}} Second World War. The church was used because of its exposed position {{as a point of}} reference for the navigation of the bombers of the USAAF and the RAF. The windows at {{the west side of the}} church were destroyed on 4 October 1943 by parts of an attack, which should meet the water works near the cemetery of Bornheim. During the first large-scale attack on Frankfurt in the evening of the same day also the windows of the eastern side and the parsonage building were destroyed by a bomb row, which came down in the garden plots at the Bornheimer <b>Hang.</b> <b>With</b> the next large attack on the city on 29 January 1944 parsonage building was heavily met. At the night from the 18. to the 19. March 1944 the church was hit by several incendiary bombs, which pierced the roof timberwork. The bombs could extinguished inside the church. On 11 December 1944 the church was hit by three bombs, which tore the large outside staircase at the west side of the steeple and the auxiliary chapel in the steeple hall. Now a large hole was into the west side of the nave. The services had to be held thereafter in the heating plant room underneath the steeple.|$|E
25|$|The Holy Cross {{church was}} built in 1929 from the master of church {{building}} Martin Weber and is {{at the edge of}} the housing development at the Bornheimer Hang. Martin Weber built also the churches St. Bonifatius in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen in 1927 and Heilig-Geist in Frankfurt-Riederwald in 1931. The planned community center at the end of the Wittelsbacher Allee was not built so there was enough space for building the new church. The Holy Cross Church was the second catholic church in Frankfurt-Bornheim. The parish was an outsourcing of the later neighbour fold St. Josef, the first catholic church in Bornheim. Reason was the expansion of the quarter Bornheim eastward at the Bornheimer <b>Hang</b> <b>with</b> the new settlement of the town planner Ernst May who built many new apartment buildings. This caused a growing number of Catholics who were living in the quarter. On 3 August 1927 a jury decided in a competition for the draft with the name slope crown from the master of church building Martin Weber. The three other participators of the competition were Hans and Christoph Rummel (Frankfurt), Richard Steidle (Munich) and Robert B. Witte (Dresden). There were several specifications for the architects like for example the front of the steeple at the Wittelsbacher Allee, between 700 and 800 seats, a high altar and two side altars and an organ loft for 150 people. The building model was called by Martin Weber slope crown, since the church should crown the Bornheimer Hang (slope). On 19 February 1928 the construction work began with the first cut of the spade. The 18. March 1928 was the day of the laying of the foundation stone. The topping-out ceremony was celebrated on 14 September 1928. On 25 August 1929 the church was inaugurated by Ludwig Maria Hugo, the Bishop of the Diocese of Mainz. The name was selected, since medieval Frankfurt possessed several the holy cross dedicated places. One of it was the chapel of the hospital to the holy cross which was donated in 1343 by Wicker Frosch. It formed with the chapel of the cloister of St. Katharinen which {{was built in}} 1354 a small double church, the predecessor building of the today's Evangelical-Lutheran Katharinen church. Until 1950 were the Holy Cross parish financially still a part of the St. Josef parish with which it has a common church executive committee.|$|E

500|$|In sixth grade, {{he went to}} {{live with}} his father {{full-time}} in Harvey, Illinois. His father lived next door to a crack house and taught Fiasco to use guns to defend himself from drug dealers. Despite his unstable upbringing, Fiasco states that he was well-educated as a child, asserting that his parents exposed him to a diverse array of subjects and that reading was highly encouraged in his household. [...] As a teenager, Fiasco participated in Academic Decathlon competitions. [...] His mother described him by saying, [...] "He was a great spirited child. Smart, a bit complex; he kind of was a loner; he didn't <b>hang</b> <b>with</b> a lot of people...He always had the glasses. [...] Always had a book bag over his shoulder and some type of a writing tablet." [...] Fiasco initially disliked hip hop music for its use of vulgarity, and preferred to listen to jazz; he idolized clarinet player Benny Goodman. [...] His struggle to learn to play an instrument led him to create poetry instead, which led to his interest in the lyrical aspects of music.|$|E
500|$|William Clark of Guitar International {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, {{and said that}} the record features [...] "some of the most elaborate, expansive, and simply wowing guitar playing that Eddie has passionately poured into a single album". Spin wrote, [...] "the frantic, haute-for-teacher 'As Is' and the mid-tempo shoulda-been-the-single 'You and Your Blues' can <b>hang</b> <b>with</b> any heavy-breathing romp they made in their heyday." [...] Jerry Shriver of USA Today gave the album 3.5/4 stars, saying that [...] "this is the true kick in the butt that arena rock desperately needs." [...] However, in the newspaper's year-end retrospective, Edna Gundersen listed A Different Kind of Truth among the overrated albums of 2012, stating that [...] "the reheated meat-and-potato riffs of Van Halen's past had critics swooning and fans panting, but vanished from the charts after the band's tour was scrapped" [...] and the album deservedly got shut out of Grammy Award nominations. Guitar World picked A Different Kind of Truth as the best album of 2012. Rolling Stone named [...] "Stay Frosty" [...] the 16th best song of 2012, and the magazine's readers ranked it the fifth best album of the year.|$|E

500|$|Clay took {{a central}} role as Congress debated the slavery question. While his {{positions}} had some overlap with Taylor's, the president always maintained his distance from Clay. Historians disagree on his motivations for doing so. With assistance from Daniel Webster, Clay developed his landmark proposal, the Compromise of 1850. The proposal allowed statehood for California, giving it independence on the slavery question, while the other territories would remain under federal jurisdiction. [...] This would include the disputed parts of New Mexico, although Texas would be reimbursed for the territory. Slavery would be retained in the District of Columbia, but the slave trade would be banned. Meanwhile, a strict Fugitive Slave Law would be enacted, bypassing northern legislation which had restricted Southerners from retrieving runaway slaves. Tensions flared as Congress negotiated and secession talks grew, culminating with a threat from Taylor to send troops into New Mexico to protect its border from Texas, with himself leading the army. Taylor also said that anyone [...] "taken in rebellion against the Union, he would <b>hang</b> ... <b>with</b> less reluctance than he had hanged deserters and spies in Mexico." [...] The omnibus law was {{a major step forward}} but ultimately could not pass, due to extremists on both sides.|$|E

The weakening of the ECW-WCW dubbed superstars didn't stop there either. The WWF faction battered their enemy tag partners off the ring apron over and over again making them appear weak and more times than not, the ECW-WCW grapplers gained an advantage only by double-teaming or employing underhanded tactics.

2500|$|Kyle Patrick for GTPlanet, however, {{was more}} positive, praising {{the quality of}} driving by all participants: [...] "Real drivers showed they could <b>hang</b> <b>with</b> the gamers on their own turf, {{which can only be}} a good thing for both sides moving forward." [...] Lukáš Redl of Medium wrote that it was {{possible}} to construct an audience around the concept of a virtual motor race and noted people approved of it. He wrote that the sim racing industry needed to adapt to a new strategy and put their focus on eSports, [...] "It is actually quite a rare example in eSports as most disciplines are not based on making things as real as possible. And here it is necessary." [...] Writing for Alphr, Curtis Moldrich echoed similar statements and believed the positive consequence of the Vegas eRace was a testament on how Formula E is forward-looking. He felt Formula One would not be able to negotiate all of their drivers into undertaking a similar event. Autosport's Scott Mitchell called the event [...] " an enormous middle finger to the traditionalists", and although he believed another eRace was unlikely to be repeated on a large scale, he wrote it was [...] "huge for a hidden part of motorsport that Formula E has taken that chance" ...|$|E

Aguilera released a statement about the tour, saying: [...] "Headlining my own tour means creative control and a high-energy, let-loose show. It's designed with my band and dancers to be a visually exciting mix of my big hits and some special surprises," [...] said Christina. [...] "Plus, my sponsors, Sears and Levi's, are giving fans lots of ways {{to get involved with}} the tour, like exclusive CDs and posters, a chance to win a backstage pass to <b>hang</b> <b>with</b> me and a cause-related program called 'Come On Over and Do Something' that was created specifically for the tour." [...] About the tour's setlist, she claimed, [...] "I'll be doing songs from my debut album. But I've changed so much from doing that at 17, so we'll put a whole new twist on things from my album. … There {{will be a lot of}} blues and soul inflections, which is what I've wanted to do more of for a long time."

2500|$|At a {{press conference}} held on August 7, Rodriguez {{announced}} that he would play in his final game for the Yankees on the following Friday, August 12, against the Rays at Yankee Stadium. It was also noted that the Yankees would sign him to a new contract that would keep him in the organization through 2017 as a special instructor and advisor. In the offseason, Rodriguez would join the Yankees' front office as a special advisor. [...] The club commemorated Rodriguez' final game as a Yankee, thanking him in front of a sold-out crowd for his efforts with a tribute of highlights on the stadium videoboard, a presentation of a framed number 13 jersey and a base autographed by teammates. This was {{in stark contrast to the}} year-long farewell tour given to his former Yankee teammate Derek Jeter. At the plate, he batted third and started as the DH, going 1-for-4 with an RBI double. In the ninth inning, he was brought onto the field at third base for one batter − his only defensive appearance for the Yankees in 2016 − and departed the field to a [...] "raucous ovation" [...] from the fans. [...] The next day, the Yankees granted him his unconditional release. On August 15, many rumors traveled around the majors. The Miami Marlins were interested in signing him to play first base until his spokesman Ron Berkowitz emailed the media and said on behalf of Rodriguez, “I want to put all this talk to rest about Alex playing for any team this season. It’s not happening. Like he said Friday night, he is happy and he is going to take some time to relax and <b>hang</b> <b>with</b> his family and friends.” Rodriguez ended the season playing 65 games with a [...]200 batting average, 9 home runs and 31 RBIs.|$|E
