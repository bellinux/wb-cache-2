This paper explores the recent trend of immigrant women from Southeast Asia countries and the impact it has rendered on Taiwan's immigration policy. The paper first reviews the history and the current conditions of Taiwan's <b>international</b> <b>marriages</b> with Southeast Asian women. It then discusses the causes behind this rising phenomenon. Next, the paper illustrates the challenges and hardships faced by these Southeast Asian women inside their host families and the host society. It also introduces the immigration policies implemented by the Taiwanese government in efforts to provide support and aid to these immigrant women, and gives examples of the problems and challenges faced by the government in enforcing these policies. Finally, the paper provides a summary of this growing social trend and offers recommendations of future measures to take in response to the trend of <b>international</b> <b>marriages</b> in Taiwan...|$|R
25|$|From 2003 to 2009, the United Kingdom has had 37 {{cumulative}} {{cases of}} British nationals being abducted to Japan by a parent, {{none of which}} have been resolved. For a yearly figure, The Guardian newspaper reported that, for 2008 alone, there are 336 cases and estimated 470 children were abducted from the UK and taken abroad illegally, an increase of 20% from 2005 figures. Pakistan (30 cases) top the list followed by the US (23), Ireland (22) and Spain (21). Other abduction hotspots included Australia, France and Egypt. The cases of international parental abduction are not well published in U.K. due to reporting restrictions that apply to any cases involving the welfare of minors. However, the Guardian provided anecdotal evidence. A reporter attended a day in London family court. Eight out of 14 cases heard involved child abduction, which may indicate that the problem is widespread. 40% (134 out of the 336) of international abductions in 2008 involve countries that are not signatories to the Hague Convention. These include Bangladesh, Russia, Iraq and Nigeria. Moreover, the problem is expected to worsen as immigration and <b>international</b> <b>marriage</b> become common. Moreover, The Independent newspaper cites the Reunite International Child Abduction Centre which claims that 43% of parental abductions involve ethnic minority children taken abroad and often forced to marry. Moreover, cultural complicity, collusion and shame mean that many cases go unreported.|$|E

Citizenship status and rights along gender lines, manifested in the legal recognition of children of <b>international</b> <b>marriages,</b> reflected this reality for much of Singapore’s independence. However, the onslaught of globalization, the rise in <b>international</b> <b>marriages,</b> disconcerting declining birth-rates, and an acceptance of “foreign talent” has given the economic imperative and demographic impulse to grant citizenship (by descent) to a person born outside Singapore whose father or mother is a citizen of Singapore, by birth, registration or descent.

This paper examines the background and contextual realities leading to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 2004.

2500|$|In Japan, {{the civil}} law forces a common surname for every married couple, unless {{in a case}} of <b>international</b> <b>marriage.</b> In most cases, women {{surrender}} their surnames upon marriage, and use the surnames of their husbands. However, a convention that a man uses his wife's family name if the wife is an only child is sometimes observed. [...] A similar tradition called ru zhui (入贅) is common among Chinese when the bride's family is wealthy and has no son but wants the heir to pass on their assets under the same family name. [...] The Chinese character zhui (贅) carries a money radical (貝), which implies that this tradition was originally based on financial reasons. [...] All their offspring carry the mother's family name. [...] If the groom is the first born with an obligation to carry his own ancestor's name, a compromise may be reached in that the first male child carries the mother's family name while subsequent offspring carry the father's family name. [...] The tradition is still in use in many Chinese communities outside mainland China, but largely disused in China because of social changes from communism. Due to the economic reform in the past decade, accumulation and inheritance of personal wealth made a come back to the Chinese society. It is unknown if this financially motivated tradition would also come back to mainland China.|$|E

Many of these marriage agencies are based near women in developing countries (such as Ukraine, Russia, Colombia, Brazil, China, Thailand, and the Philippines). <b>International</b> <b>marriage</b> agencies encourage women to register for their services, and facilitate communication and meetings with men from developed regions of North America, Western Europe, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2011. Major: History. Advisors: Donna Gabaccia and Erika Lee. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 306 pages, appendices 1 - 4. My dissertation explores transatlantic migration {{in the context}} of <b>international</b> <b>marriages</b> in the 20 th century, using marriages between Finns and Americans in Finland and the U. S. as a case study. First, I document and explain changes in migration and marriage patterns between Finland and the U. S. {{over the course of the}} 20 th century. My research shows that among Finns in the U. S. and Americans in Finland, <b>international</b> <b>marriages</b> have become extremely common. In both migrant populations marriage and migration are often inextricably intertwined: the main explanation for the high number of <b>international</b> <b>marriages</b> can be found in the mobile lifestyles of students, professionals, and young people traveling. Second, I challenge "methodological individualism" (the idea that elite migrants are professionals who are not bound by familial relationships) by revealing the important role that family plays in migration decisions of elite migrants. I examine how elite migrants negotiate their identities and transnational family life in <b>international</b> <b>marriages.</b> My research shows that during important life-changes, transnational engagements often intensify. Simultaneously, these significant events may make the migrant feel more attached to the host country. Thus, I found that a migrant's simultaneous engagement in the country of origin and the country of residence highlights the weakness of treating integration and transnationalism as if they were dichotomous categories. My study also challenges the traditional idea of migration as a unidirectional movement initiated by a single motive. I show that in reality, multiple motives and multidirectional movements are often involved. Finally, I explore how elite migrants have been incorporated into immigration discourses in Finland and the U. S. Finland is often seen an exceptionally homogeneous nation with no experience in dealing with immigration. Meanwhile, the U. S. portrays itself as a "nation of immigrants. " I found that the differing discourses surrounding immigration and the distinctive meanings attached to the term "immigrant" in the two countries were crucial determinants of the way Finns and Americans understood their place in the receiving nation. My research also challenges the assumption that elite migrants automatically enjoy an "elite status" and can choose the extent to which they integrate in the receiving society...|$|R
