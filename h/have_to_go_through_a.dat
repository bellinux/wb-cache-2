25|$|There {{is another}} aspect of aldol {{reaction}} that {{is influenced by the}} allylic strain. On the second aldol reaction, the product which is a 1,3 dicarbonyl is formed in high diastereoselectivity. This is because the acidity of the proton is significantly reduced because for the deprotonation to occur, it will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> developing allylic strain in the unfavored conformation. In the favored conformation, the proton is not aligned properly for deprotonation to occur.|$|E

25|$|Although Dhaka Residential Model College {{operates}} {{from the}} 3rd through the 12th grade, it only admits {{students into the}} 3rd, 9th and 11th grades. Consequently, the higher grades have fewer students than the lower grades, as a relatively large number of students transfer out. Admission in the 3rd and 9th grades are based on admission tests. The admission tests for DRMC are highly competitive. Students in these grades are admitted through written and viva voce tests for both the morning and day shifts. Students who pass the written test have to qualify in the viva exam. In addition to written and viva tests, candidates <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> medical examination as well.|$|E

The classes offered at nursing colleges and nursing schools are focused on more practical aspects of nursing. These institutions do not offer many general education classes, so students who attend these schools will solely be focusing on their nursing educations while they are in school.

25|$|The {{guaranteed}} {{cycle count}} may {{apply only to}} block zero (as {{is the case with}} TSOPNAND devices), or to all blocks (as in NOR). This effect is mitigated in some chip firmware or file system drivers by counting the writes and dynamically remapping blocks in order to spread write operations between sectors; this technique is called wear leveling. Another approach is to perform write verification and remapping to spare sectors in case of write failure, a technique called bad block management (BBM). For portable consumer devices, these wearout management techniques typically extend the life of the flash memory beyond the life of the device itself, and some data loss may be acceptable in these applications. For high reliability data storage, however, it is not advisable to use flash memory that would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> large number of programming cycles. This limitation is meaningless for 'read-only' applications such as thin clients and routers, which are programmed only once or at most a few times during their lifetimes.|$|E

[...] At 7:30 work started in the shifts for those privileged enough to do so, punctuated by a whistle, and prisoners would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> metal detector during work shifts. If assigned a job, prisoners had to accept that line of work; prisoners were not permitted to have money in their possessions but earnings went into a prisoner's Trust Fund. [...] Some of the prisoners were assigned duties with the guards and foremen in the Laundry, Tailor Shop, Cobblers Shop, Model Shop etc. and in gardening and labor. Smoking, a privilege, was permitted in the workplace providing there wasn't any hazardous condition, but inmates were not permitted to smoke between the recreation yard and work. Lunch was served at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells to be locked {{in for the night}} at 16:50, and lights went off at 21:30. After being locked in for the night, 6 guards usually patrolled the four cell blocks.

2500|$|Preventative {{medicines}} include gabapentin (Neurontin), tizanidine (Zanaflex), fluoxetine (Prozac), amitriptyline (Elavil), and topiramate (Topamax). In testing, gabapentin {{was found}} {{to reduce the number}} of headache days a month by 9.1%. Tizanidine {{was found to}} decrease the average frequency of headaches per week, the headache intensity, and the mean headache duration. Through studies, Fluoxetine resulted in better mood ratings and [...] "significant increases in headache-free days". Despite being associated with depression, antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, have been found to effectively treat [...] "near-daily headaches" [...] and numerous chronic pain conditions as well as improving mood and sleep—two possible triggers for chronic headache sufferers. One study found that the headache frequency over a 28-day period lowered for chronic headache patients on topiramate. Another medication to prevent headaches is botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA or BOTOX), which is given by injection instead of being taken orally. In a clinical study of botulinum toxin type A, patients participating in the 9-month treatment period with three treatments experienced headache frequency decreases up to 50%. As with all medications, the preventative medications may have side effects. Since different people respond to drugs differently, chronic headache sufferers may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> [...] "trial-and-error" [...] period to find the right medications. The previously mentioned medicines can improve headaches, but physicians recommend multiple forms of treatments.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States Coast Guard and United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, the coxswain has the {{authority}} to direct all boat and crew activities during the mission and modify planned missions to provide {{for the safety of the}} boat and the crew. [...] Before a person can be assigned to be a coxswain, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> qualification procedure, be certified and maintain the certification to be a coxswain. Upon certification, they are awarded the Coxswain Badge. [...] This qualification procedure requires a significant amount of practice in boat handling as well as previous experience as a boat crew member. Any Coast Guardsman (enlisted or officer) may become a coxswain upon proper qualification. An advancement to boatswain's mate second class requires that the individual qualify as and maintain certification as a coxswain. A commanding officer or officer in charge of a land based unit with boats has to be certified and stay certified as a coxswain on all boats in the unit or be relieved of command. A coxswain is assigned to a boat by the command authority and can only be relieved by the commanding officer/Officer in Charge, executive officer/Executive Petty Officer, or senior officer present. The coxswain’s authority is independent of rank and/or seniority in relation to any other person on board the boat. Unlike the commanding officer of a cutter or ship, a coxswain does not automatically have command authority.|$|E

60|$|And, more damnable still, the poetical {{essence of}} the legend, the {{identification}} of Proserpine's twofold existence with the grand alternation of nature's seasons, has been entirely neglected by the author. Surely his work, though published, is quite as deservedly obscure as Mrs. Shelley's derelict manuscript. Midas has the privilege, if it be one, of not challenging any obvious comparison. The subject, since Lyly's and Dryden's days, has hardly {{attracted the attention of}} the poets. It was so eminently fit for the lighter kinds of presentation that the agile bibliographer who aimed at completeness would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> fairly long list of masques, [Footnote: There is one by poor Christopher Smart.] comic operas, or 'burlettas', all dealing with the ludicrous misfortunes of the Phrygian king. But an examination of these would be sheer pedantry in this place. Here again Mrs. Shelley has stuck to her Latin source as closely as she could. [Footnote: Perhaps her somewhat wearying second act, on the effects of the gold-transmuting gift, would have been shorter, if Ovid (Metam. xi. 108-30) had not himself gone into such details on the subject.] She has made a gallant attempt to connect the two stories with which Midas has ever since Ovid's days been associated, and a distinct--indeed a too perceptible--effort to press out a moral meaning in this, as she had easily extricated a cosmological meaning in the other tale.|$|E

A lady in a dressing-gown disturbs the mind and prevents careful consideration of the political outlook in Singapur, which is now supplied with a set of very complete forts, and is hopefully awaiting some nine-inch breach-loaders that are to adorn them.

Imagine an India fit for permanent habitation by our kin, and consider what a place it would be this day, with the painter cut fifty years ago, fifty thousand miles of railways laid down and ten thousand under survey, and possibly an annual surplus. Is this sedition? Forgive me, but I am looking at the shipping outside the verandah, at the Chinamen in the streets, and at the lazy, languid Englishmen in banians and white jackets stretched on the cane chairs, and these things are not nice. The men are not really lazy, as I will try to show later on, but they lounge and loaf and seem to go to office at eleven, which must be bad for work. And they all talk about going home at indecently short intervals, as though that were their right. Once more, if we could only rear children that did not run to leg and nose in the second generation {{in this part of the}} world and one or two others, what an amazing disruption of the Empire there would be before half of a Parnell Commission sitting was accomplished!
