25|$|Sanger {{sequencing}} and pyrosequencing are {{two methods}} {{that have been}} used to detect frameshift mutations, however, it is likely that data generated will not be of the highest quality. Even still, 1.96 million indels have been identified through Sanger sequencing that do not overlap with other databases. When a frameshift mutation is observed it is compared against the Human Genome Mutation Database (HGMD) to determine if the mutation has a damaging effect. This is done by looking at four features. First, the ratio between the affected and conserved DNA, second the location of the mutation relative to the transcript, third the ratio of conserved and affected amino acids and finally the distance of the <b>indel</b> {{to the end of the}} exon.|$|E

After the first step of variant calling, germline and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) mutations are removed in CAPP-seq to reduce the background biases. Several statistical significance tests can be performed against background to all type of variant calling. For example, statistical significance of tumor-derived SNVs can be estimated by random sampling of background alleles using Monte Carlo method. For the <b>indel</b> calls, statistical significance is calculated applying a separate method that used a strand specific analysis by Z-test shown in previous work. Finally, a computational validation steps reduces the false positive calls. However, a robust computational framework specific for CAPP-seq data analysis is a high demand in this field.|$|E

In this report, we describe an approach that can detect <b>indels</b> in the heterozygous state and can comprehensively identify <b>indels</b> in the target sequence. Using this approach, we identified 2393 <b>indels</b> in a set of 330 candidate genes, i. e. an average of seven <b>indels</b> per gene with about two <b>indels</b> per gene being common (minor allele fre-quency 0. 1). We compared the population genetic characteristics of <b>indels</b> with substitutions in this data. Our data supported the findings that deletions occur more frequently in the human genome. 5 0 -UTR and coding regions of the genes showed a significantly lower diversity for <b>indels</b> compared with other regions, suggesting differences in effects of selection on <b>indels</b> and substitutions. Sequence diversity and pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) findings of the different populations were similar to earlier results and included a greater skew towards low-frequency variants and a faster rate of LD decay in the African-descent population compared with the non-African populations. Within populations, the allele frequency spectra and LD-decay profiles for <b>indels</b> were similar to substitutions. Overall, the findings suggest that, although the mechanisms giving rise to <b>indels</b> may be different from those causing substitutions, the evolutionary his-tories of <b>indels</b> and substitutions are similar, and that <b>indels</b> can play a valuable role in association studies and marker selection strategies...|$|R
25|$|Based on this work, Dayhoff and her {{coworkers}} {{developed a}} set of substitution matrices called the PAM (Percent Accepted Mutation), MDM (Mutation Data Matrix), or Dayhoff.

To produce a Dayhoff matrix, pairs of aligned amino acids in verified alignments are used to build a count matrix, which is then used to estimate at mutation matrix at 1 PAM (considered an evolutionary unit).

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that insertions and deletions (<b>indels)</b> have contributed to the sequence divergence between the human and chimpanzee genomes more than do nucleotide changes (3 % vs. 1. 2 %). However, although there have been studies of large <b>indels</b> between the two genomes, no systematic analysis of small <b>indels</b> (i. e., <b>indels</b> ≤ 100 bp) has been published. In this study, we first estimated that the false-positive rate of small <b>indels</b> inferred from human–chimpanzee pairwise sequence alignments is quite high, suggesting that the chimpanzee genome draft is not sufficiently accurate for our purpose. We have therefore inferred only human-specific <b>indels</b> using multiple sequence alignments of mammalian genomes.

Functional analysis reveals that the genes whose coding exons have been affected by human-specific <b>indels</b> are enriched in transcription and translation regulatory activities but are underrepresented in catalytic and transporter activities, cellular and physiological processes, and extracellular region/matrix.

The number of <b>indels</b> is ≈ 1 / 12 th of the number of base substitutions and the average length of the <b>indels</b> is 36 nt, including <b>indels</b> up to 10 kb. The ratio (Ru) of unpaired nucleotides attributable to <b>indels</b> to those attributable to substitutions is 3. 0 for this 2 million-nt chimp DNA sample compared with human. There is similar evidence of a large value of Ru for sea urchins from the polymorphism of a sample of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus DNA (Ru = 3 – 4). Other work indicates that similarly, per nucleotide affected, large differences are seen for <b>indels</b> in the DNA polymorphism of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Ru = 51). For the insect Drosophila melanogaster a high value of Ru (4. 5) has been determined. For the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans the polymorphism data are incomplete but high values of Ru are likely. Comparison of two strains of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 shows a preponderance of <b>indels.</b> Because these six examples are from very distant systematic groups the implication is that in general, for alignments of closely related DNA, <b>indels</b> are responsible for many more unmatched nucleotides than are base substitutions.

In addition, the peaks of nucleotide diversity between the two divergent alleles were closely associated with these <b>indels.</b> Thus, there exists a close association between <b>indels</b> and dimorphisms. Further analysis suggests that indel-associated substitutions could be an important component of genetic variation shaping nucleotide polymorphism in Arabidopsis.
