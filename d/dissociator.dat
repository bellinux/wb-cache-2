40|$|The DSM-IV characterizes {{dissociation}} as “disruption in {{the usually}} integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or {{perception of the}} environment” (American Psychiatric Association, 1994, p. 477) {{and it has been}} tenuously linked with trauma, but “lacks a single, coherent referent … that all investigators in the field embrace” (Cardena, 1994). It is known that dissociation is a spectrum (Bernstein and Putnam, 1986; Shor, Orne, and O’Connell, 1962; Spiegel, 1963; Tellegen and Atkinson, 1974), and low levels of dissociation can be a part of normal functioning, allowing us to do two things at once (Butler, Duran and Jasiukitis, 1996), but higher levels can interfere with daily functioning. The present study used survey techniques to investigate the link between dissociation and trauma. Survey results showed a significant correlation between trauma and dissociation. The current investigation also used the high temporal and spatial resolution of electroencephalographic techniques to identify the neurophysiological correlates of dissociation. Specifically, the current investigation recorded early and late event-related potentials in participants who rated high and low in dissociation while they viewed affective pictures in order to determine if there were electrophysiological differences in responses to emotional stimuli. Electroencephalographic results were nonsignificant, but trends indicated that high <b>dissociators</b> showed a heightened response to affective photos at P 1 and the late positive potential compared with low <b>dissociators.</b> If the results are thought to be reliable, the trends may indicate that high <b>dissociators</b> were not actively dissociating during the task, and because high <b>dissociators</b> have usually experienced trauma, they are more sensitive to emotional stimuli.

In a deep vs. shallow encoding paradigm, the influence of dissociative style on elaborative and avoidant encoding was studied, respectively. Furthermore, affectively neutral and negative words were presented, to test whether the effects of dissociative tendencies on memory functioning depended on the affective valence of the stimulus material.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} whether {{high and low}} dissociative individuals differ {{in their ability to}} keep target stimuli out of their awareness (suppression) and how this relates to their memory of those targets during a later cued recall task. The prediction was that high <b>dissociators</b> display a general inability to focus attention and that their distractibility undermines successful suppression, thereby enhancing memory for suppressed items. College students with high (n = 35) and low (n = 33) scores on the Dissociative Experiences Scale participated in a Dutch version of Anderson and Green's (2001) Think-No Think (TNT) task. Overall, a significant suppression effect emerged. However, no differences between high and low <b>dissociators</b> were observed. Thus, the present results do not confirm that dissociation is linked to heightened distractibility. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Individual {{differences}} in dissociative style (which {{is generally considered}} {{a risk factor for}} dissociative pathology) were studied in a nonclinical sample. It was hypothesized that high-dissociative participants would show enhanced attentional abilities toward both relevant and irrelevant stimulus features.

To facilitate the full deployment of dissociative abilities, a feature (i. e., negative valence) was included that would automatically attract attention but not interfere with the processing of the central feature.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between dissociation, attentional focus, and sexual arousal in a non-clinical sample of 162 undergraduate women. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} experimental conditions of distraction, instructed focus on somatic changes, and control, providing ratings of their cognitive and affective reactions to a sexually explicit videotape. Later participants were divided into high and low dissociation groups based on their scores on the Dissociative Experience Scale (DES). Additional measures of sexual arousability and anxiety, sexual experience, and childhood traumatic experience were used in exploratory correlational analyses. ^ Higher levels of dissociation were significantly associated with negative affective reactions to the erotic stimulus. Although negative affective reactions were associated with significantly lower levels of subjective sexual arousal, mean levels of arousal did not differ between high and low dissociation groups. ^ Correlations between lever ratings of arousal, which are continuously recorded during the videotape, and questionnaire ratings of arousal, which summarize reactions immediately after the videotape has concluded, did vary with level of dissociation, such that high <b>dissociators</b> displayed significantly higher correlations between lever and questionnaire ratings than low <b>dissociators.</b> Moreover, for high <b>dissociators,</b> the instructional sets affected correlations between lever and questionnaire ratings, with distraction and sensate focus instructions having a similar negative impact on correlations when compared with the control condition.

Unspecified acute psychiatric patients were recruited to verify a hypothesis that pathological dissociation is associated with swift switching and traumatisation may explain this relationship. Behavioural measures of intellectual function and three executive functions including updating, switching and inhibition were administered, together with standardised scales to evaluate pathological dissociation and traumatisation. Our results showed superior control ability on switching and updating in inpatients who displayed more symptoms of pathological dissociation. When all three executive functions were entered as predictors, in addition to intellectual quotient and demographic variables to regress upon pathological dissociation, switching rather than updating remained the significant predictor. Importantly, the relationship between pathological dissociation and switching became non-significant when the effect of childhood trauma were controlled. The results support a trauma-related switching hypothesis which postulates swift switching as a cognitive endophenotype of pathological dissociation; traumatisation in childhood may explain the importance of swift switching...|$|R
40|$|Background: Potential acute {{protective}} {{functions of}} dissociation include modulation of stress-induced psychophysiological arousal. This {{study was designed}} to explore whether acute dissociative reactions during a stress experiment would override the effects of reexperiencing. Methods: Psychophysiological reactions during exposure to script-driven trauma imagery were studied in relation to acute responses of reexperiencing and dissociative symptoms in 61 patients with histories of exposure to a variety of traumas. Acute symptomatic responses were assessed with the Responses to Script-Driven Imagery Scale (RSDI), and participants were divided into four groups by median splits of RSDI reexperiencing and dissociation subscale scores. Results: In a comparison of the high RSDI reexperiencing groups with low versus high acute dissociative symptoms, the high <b>dissociators</b> exhibited significantly lower heart rate (HR) during trauma script and a significantly smaller script-induced decrease in parasympathetic cardiac activity. HR reactivity to the trauma script was negatively correlated with acute dissociative symptom severity. Conclusions: Acute dissociative reactions are a potential moderator of response to experimental paradigms investigating psychologically traumatized populations. We therefore suggest that future research on psychophysiological stress reactions in traumatized samples should routinely assess for acute dissociative symptoms...|$|R

Fisher’s exact tests measured the relative contribution of specific abuse types. There was {{a positive relationship between}} abuse frequency and the pre-sence of DD. DD patients experienced more abuse than patients without DDs. Two combinations of abuse type and relational tie predicted a DD: childhood emotional neglect by biological parents/siblings and later emotional abuse by inti-mate partners. These findings support the early childhood etiology of DDs and subsequent maladaptive cycles of adult abuse. Enquiries about childhood maltreatment should include a history of emotional neglect by biological parents/siblings. Adult emotional abuse by intimate partners should assist in screening for DDs.
