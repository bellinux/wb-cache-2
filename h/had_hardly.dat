5|$|In Paris, Bizet {{discovered}} the difficulties faced by young and relatively unknown composers {{trying to get}} their operas performed. Of the capital's two state-subsidised opera houses, the Opéra and the , the former offered a static repertoire in which works by foreign composers, particularly Rossini and Meyerbeer, were dominant. Even established French composers such as Gounod had difficulty getting works performed there. At the Opéra-Comique, innovation was equally rare; although more French works were performed, the style and character of most productions <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> changed since the 1830s. However, one condition of the Opéra-Comique's state funding was that from time to time it should produce one-act works by former Prix de Rome laureates. Under this provision, Bizet wrote La guzla de l'Emir, with a libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré, and this went into rehearsal early in 1862.|$|E
5|$|To assist at {{practice}} for the 1927 season, Krichell signed Billy Werber from Duke University. He left the team after a month, but re-signed after graduating in 1930. During that time, Krichell was involved in what {{is considered one of}} the worst deals from the era. Barrow asked him to travel to Durham, North Carolina to negotiate with the Durham Bulls for an outfielder named Dusty Cooke. Neither Krichell nor Barrow had seen Cooke; he was believed to be a great hitter, even though he <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> played for the Bulls. The Yankees signed him for $15,000 ($ in 2010), beating the Cleveland Indians' offer of $12,500 ($ in 2010) and an unnamed player in exchange. Cooke turned out to be an injury-prone backup outfielder, and the Yankees gave up on both Cooke and Werber. After the 1933 season, the two were traded to the Boston Red Sox for cash considerations.|$|E

The grid of streets <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> expanded westward as far as 20th Street {{and there was no}} City Hall in the Center Square. The Pennsylvania Railroad Terminal was located at 11th and Market Streets, and there was a covered wooden bridge over the Schuylkill River.|$|E
25|$|Election day news {{included}} {{reports of}} widespread electoral fraud throughout the day. At one polling station in Nad-e-Ali, in the Helmand province, just over 400 people had voted by 1 p.m., but three hours later, the figure had apparently rose to some 1,200, despite that guards <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> seen any voters. Election officials were later seen counting piles of ballot papers, without checking simply declaring the votes had been cast for Karzai.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} October 1920, a {{party was}} held at the Rockefeller Institute, to which the heads, {{managers}} and researchers came to say goodbye to a highly promising young researcher, who was about to leave for a remote, desolate country, where scientific work <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> taken place. In January 1921, Kligler arrived in the Holy Land, and began working as a manager of the laboratories of the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, located then in Prophets Street.|$|E

Before the positive historical reevaluations of Jesus by some Jewish thinkers in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, he <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> featured in the popular Jewish imagination and little had been written about him by the religious leaders and scholars. Arguably, he is absent from the Talmud and rabbinical literature, although he makes an appearance in some variants of the medieval polemic Toledot Yeshu (as a spy for the rabbis).|$|E
25|$|The Malankara Church <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> {{any contact}} with the Western Church. The Portuguese used their power to bring the Malankara Church under Latin jurisdiction. A {{powerful}} Archbishop Aleixo de Menezes arrived in Goa in 1595. He then convened a Synod at Udayamperoor, south of Ernakulam, from 20–26 June 1599, known as the Synod of Diamper. Here the Archbishop demanded complete submission to the Latin jurisdiction. The representatives sent from various parishes in and around Cochin were forced to accept the decrees read out by the Archbishop.|$|E
25|$|The {{first years}} of the 20th was time of {{increased}} labour movement activity; also the yard and engineering shop workers were dissatisfied to their working conditions. The daily working time was long and salaries low, and in change of lot of responsibility the workers <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> any rights. The first notable strike took place in 1902, when the yard smiths were striking for one month. The action did not lead to favourable results for the workers; instead of reaching a collective agreement, each worker made a personal contract with the employer.|$|E

25|$|The {{relations}} between the Kriegsmarine <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> been improved with the failure of Rheinübung. Since 1937 Göring and the Luftwaffe had thwarted any attempt by the navy to produce a naval air arm. Not only did the Luftwaffe maintain control over all aspects of aviation, the naval commanders, like Raeder and Dönitz had to rely, on Göring's good will to receive support. In order to have air support, the highest authorities in both services had to consult {{on the use of}} units. Even if the negotiations were devoid of friction, it was inflexible and inefficient system.|$|E
25|$|In {{memory of}} his late brother Niels he founded {{memorial}} endowments at the Abbeys of Ås (by 1192) and Vä (1182). From 1184 on Valdemar officiated as steward of the Duchy of Schleswig for Valdemar the Great's minor son Duke Valdemar (later King Valdemar II of Denmark). In 1187 King CanuteVI Valdemarsen endowed the diocese of Schleswig with far reaching privileges. At Christmas 1187 Duke Valdemar took over the Duchy of Schleswig and soon later Valdemar Knudsen was consecrated bishop probably in the Cathedral of St. Peter's. After consecration in 1188 Bishop Valdemar levied the tithe, supported by his metropolitan Absalon, since before the tithes <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> ever been levied in Danish dioceses.|$|E
25|$|Persian crosses were {{in churches}} once {{attended}} by Nasranis. Out of five Persian crosses two are in Kottayam Knanaya Valia Palli. According to the archaeologists, the earliest one {{was made in}} the 7th century. The cross became a symbol of Christianity in the west, during the time of Constantine (272–337). Saint Thomas Christians of Malabar <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> any contact with other Christians before the arrival of Knanaya people from Persia. Moreover, two of the oldest church buildings that still exist in South India do not have any marking of a Cross on their original structure. So most probably it was during the 7th century that the cross became a symbol of St. Thomas Christians.|$|E

Behind Gueudecourt lay {{open country}} which <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> been shelled with Le Barque in the middle distance and then Bapaume beyond. German troops passed through the village in late September 1914 during the First Battle of Albert, {{part of a series}} of reciprocal operations by the German and Franco-British armies, to advance round the northern flank of their opponent during the operations known as the Race to the Sea. The village became a backwater until 1916 when a third line of defence was dug behind the Somme front, as part of the German preparations to receive the British-French offensive being prepared on the Somme.|$|E
25|$|Zhang Jing was {{eventually}} replaced by Yang Yi (楊宜), {{who tried to}} curry favour with Zhao to prevent suffering a similar fate as Zhang Jing. However, Yang was ineffective in his role, and Zhao Wenhua recommended Yang's removal {{when he returned to}} Beijing to report to the emperor. Zhao tried to set up Hu Zongxian in Yang's place, but the Minister of Personnel Li Mo (李默), who detested Yan Song's clique, picked Wang Gao (王誥) instead. Zhao Wenhua responded by impeaching Li Mo, suggesting that Li had slighted the emperor. The infuriated emperor threw Li Mo in prison and promoted Zhao Wenhua to Minister of Works and Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent (太子太保) on May 3, 1556. Wang Gao <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> arrived in his post before he was replaced by Zhao's candidate, Hu Zongxian.|$|E
25|$|The King {{thought it}} would be “a {{national}} calamity” if Robertson was removed but when told of this Lloyd George told Stamfordham that “he did not share the King’s extremely favourable opinion” of Robertson “who had never fought at the Front, <b>had</b> <b>hardly</b> ever visited the trenches, and who was not known by the rank and file” and that the government would resign if the King attempted to block Robertson’s removal. Curzon and Balfour were sympathetic to Robertson’s position that the Versailles delegate must report to the CIGS, but he lost Balfour’s sympathy at a Cabinet meeting on 14 February where he made clear his dislike of Wilson. He had told Stamfordham that he would serve at Versailles under Plumer as CIGS, but not under Wilson “his Junior”.|$|E
