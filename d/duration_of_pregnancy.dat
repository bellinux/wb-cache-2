25|$|In most countries, {{women with}} PKU {{who wish to}} have {{children}} are advised to lower their blood Phe levels (typically to between 2 and 6nbsp&mg/dL) before they become pregnant, and carefully control their levels throughout the pregnancy. This is achieved by performing regular blood tests and adhering very strictly to a diet, in general monitored {{on a day-to-day basis}} by a specialist metabolic dietitian. In many cases, as the fetus' liver begins to develop and produce PAH normally, the mother's blood Phe levels will drop, requiring an increased intake to remain within the safe range of 2–6nbsp&mg/dL. The mother's daily Phe intake may double or even triple {{by the end of the}} pregnancy, as a result. When maternal blood Phe levels fall below 2nbsp&mg/dL, anecdotal reports indicate that the mothers may suffer adverse effects, including headaches, nausea, hair loss, and general malaise.

5000|$|... "Fetal death" [...] means death {{prior to}} the {{complete}} expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of human conception, irrespective of the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and which is not an induced termination of pregnancy. The death is indicated {{by the fact that}} after such expulsion or extraction, the fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles. Heartbeats are to be distinguished from transient cardiac contractions; respirations are to be distinguished from fleeting respiratory efforts or gasps.|$|E
5000|$|Gestational age is not {{the same}} as {{fertilization}} age. It takes about 14 days from the first day of the last menstrual period for conception to take place and thus for the conceptus to form. The age from this point in time (conception) is called the fertilization age and is thus 2 weeks shorter than the gestational age. Thus a 6-week gestational age would be a 4-week fertilization age. Some authorities however casually interchange these terms [...] and the reader is advised to be cautious. An average gestational period (<b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> from the first day of the last menstrual period up to delivery) is 280 days. On average, this is 9 months and 6 days.|$|E
