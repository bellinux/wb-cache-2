5|$|On 13 April 1948, {{the goods}} hoist to the Waterloo and City line began to sink while a M7 class tank engine was pushing loaded coal wagons onto it. The engine <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> the hoist's shaft, ending up {{upside-down}} and spurting steam over it. The driver and fireman managed to jump free, and the locomotive was rescued piecemeal {{and used for}} spares.|$|E
5|$|The station, its {{surrounding}} {{streets and the}} railway approach feature prominently in the 1955 Ealing comedy film The Ladykillers. In the story, a gang robs a security van near the station after planning in a house overlooking the railway.

The band <b>drops</b> <b>into</b> a lengthy free time at the 10-minute mark, before coming back into [...] time about 5 and a half minutes later. They <b>drop</b> <b>into</b> free time again at the 17:15 mark and continue {{to the end of the}} song at about 23:00.|$|R
5|$|Australia toured New Zealand {{before the}} World Cup, and Poulton was <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> the middle-order. She made {{four in the}} first two matches, both of which the hosts won. She {{struggled}} in these matches, taking 15 and 18 balls to score the four runs in either ODI, was omitted for the third match. She then returned to her customary opening position and scored 81 from 97 balls, including 11 fours, in the fourth match, helping to set up an Australia victory by 44 runs. The fifth match of the series was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> place.|$|E
5|$|Both Titus and Domitian were fond of gladiatorial games, and {{realised}} {{its importance}} {{to appease the}} citizens of Rome. In the newly constructed Colosseum, the Flavians provided for spectacular entertainments. The Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre lasted for a hundred days and {{were said to be}} extremely elaborate, including gladiatorial combat, fights between wild animals (elephants and cranes), mock naval battles for which the theatre was flooded, horse races and chariot races. During the games, wooden balls were <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> the audience, inscribed with various prizes (clothing, gold, or even slaves), which could then be traded for the designated item.|$|E

5|$|Celtic {{began the}} 2015–16 season again {{attempting}} {{to qualify for}} the Champions League. They knocked out Stjarnan from Iceland and Qarabağ from Azerbaijan in the early qualifying rounds, but lost 4–3 on aggregate to Swedish side Malmö FF in the final play-off round. This meant for the second successive season, Celtic <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> the Europa League. Celtic's Europa League campaign was poor and littered with individual errors which contributed to dropped points in every match. Celtic failed to qualify after finishing bottom of their group, and was the first time Celtic went through a group stage of a European competition without recording a single victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ryusuke Taguchi defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Kenny Omega of the Bullet Club. Distractions by the Bullet Club's Young Bucks allowed Omega to spray Taguchi {{in the eyes}} with an aerosol can and broke Taguchi's ankle lock on Omega later in the match. Omega {{captured}} the championship after a snap dragon suplex, a bicycle knee strike, and the One Winged Angel (electric chair <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> a one-handed driver), pinning the champion at 13 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Lucas, who had {{previously}} confronted problems with the props used to depict R2-D2, allowed ILM and the production's British special effects department {{to create their own}} versions of the robot. Nine R2-D2 models were created; one was for actor Kenny Baker to be <b>dropped</b> <b>into,</b> seven were built by ILM and featured two wheelchair motors capable of moving , enabling it to run and be mostly used in stage sets, and the British studio produced a pneumatic R2-D2 that could shift from two to three legs and was mostly used in Tunisia because its motor drive system allowed it to drive over sand.|$|E

5|$|Skaði also {{included}} in her terms of settlement that the gods must do something she thought {{impossible for them to}} do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied one end of a cord around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> Skaði's lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Brigade's next {{parachute}} {{operation was}} Operation Hasty in June 1944. This {{was a small}} diversionary raid carried out by sixty men from the 6th Parachute Battalion. They were <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> the area between Sora and Avezzano, their objective being to harass the Germans withdrawing to the Gothic Line. The mission was a success: a German brigade was diverted to hunt the small force, and a German division was retained on rear-area security duties instead of going into the front line. In June 1944, the brigade {{was released from the}} Eighth Army and joined the 1st Airborne Task Force for airborne operations in the south of France.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{has established a}} military program, the , wherein fifty randomly selected classes of third-year junior {{high school students are}} kidnapped, <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> a remote location, and forced to kill one another until only one student of each class remains. Ostensibly, it is to help the government and its military research survival skills and battle readiness - in actuality, it is meant to instill terror and distrust in all of Japan's citizens to curb any attempts at rebellion, by showcasing the government's power and ability to target citizen's families and preying on the fear of being killed by a friend.|$|E
5|$|A cancer-stricken Hadden, now in {{residence}} on the Mir space station, reveals to Arroway {{that a second}} machine was secretly made in Japan, and that Arroway {{will be the one}} to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> four rapidly spinning rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of wormholes. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Florida, and a figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War Millwall's {{form was}} {{poor and the}} club <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> the Third and Fourth Division of the Football League. West Ham have never played below the Second Division in their history and often played a league or two above Millwall. The two sides did not play each other {{competitively}} between 13 October 1959 and 7 October 1978, making the 1960s the only decade the teams have not met. Despite the infrequency of their meetings, both sets of supporters still consider the other club their major rival. During these years, the Hammers enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup in 1964, 1975 and 1980. They also won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965. Over four decades the sides were only in the same tier of the Football League for three seasons, in 1946–47, 1947–48 and 1978–79. They played two cup games {{against each other in}} the Southern Professional Floodlit Cup in 1959 and the Full Members Cup in 1987.|$|E
