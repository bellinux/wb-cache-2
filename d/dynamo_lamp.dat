25|$|Old <b>dynamos</b> and <b>lamps</b> did {{not limit}} their output voltage, leading to early {{failure of the}} {{incandescent}} light bulbs in the lamps. Modern <b>lamps</b> and <b>dynamos</b> contain voltage limiters to solve this problem.|$|R
50|$|Kaihei Ushikubo {{founded the}} company, Sankyo Electric Company (Sankyo Denki Co), in July 1943. The company's first {{products}} were wireless communication devices, mica-condensers, and paper-condensers. Five {{years later the}} company expanded their product line by adding <b>dynamo</b> bicycle <b>lamps</b> to their products.|$|R

50|$|Mr. Howell {{was educated}} at the College of the City of New York (1874-76), Rutgers College (1876-78) and Stevens Institute of Technology (1878-81). In {{his last year}} at Stevens he wrote a thesis on “Economy of Electric Lighting by Incandescence,” giving {{original}} and accurate data on the efficiency of <b>dynamos</b> and <b>lamps,</b> carrying capacity of conductors, drops in house wiring, and allied subjects. Published in booklet form under the title of “Incandescent Electric Lights,” in 1882, it was at once translated into several languages.|$|R
50|$|He was {{commissioned}} as an ensign in the United States Navy. During his ensuing naval service, he first {{served on the}} USS Richmond, then the USS Minnesota. While his ship was in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1881, Sprague invented the inverted type of dynamo. After he {{was transferred to the}} USS Lancaster, flagship of the European Squadron, he installed the first electric call-bell system on a United States Navy ship. Sprague took leave to attend the International Exposition of Electricity of 1881 in Paris and the Crystal Palace Exhibition in Sydenham, England in 1882, where he was on the jury of awards for gas engines, <b>dynamos</b> and <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Carbone Lorraine SA {{was born}} in 1937 from the merger of two companies, Compagnie Générale Electrique de Nancy and Compagnie Lorraine de Charbons pour l'Electricité. The first, founded in 1891, {{manufactured}} electric motors, <b>lamps,</b> <b>dynamos,</b> generators and lighting equipment. The second, founded in 1892, was a pioneer in producing artificial graphite from amorphous carbon, manufacturing graphite brushes for electric motors. At {{the time of the}} merger, both companies had developed a strong international sales network.|$|R
50|$|Defiance, a fast {{touring car}} on the 40 hp chassis was {{exhibited}} at Olympia's 1912 Motor Show. It is delivered ready for the road with hood, screen, Austin-Sankey detachable wheels, <b>dynamo</b> and <b>lamps.</b> The CAV <b>dynamo</b> projects through the aluminium dashboard from its mounting on an aluminium bridge over the flywheel. It is driven by a counter shaft taking its drive from the camshaft. The Automotor Journal described Defiance as having a Torpedo body.Defiance had been developed from the 40 hp for the 2,000 mile trial held by the Automobile Club of Russia and run from St Petersburg to Riga and Moscow. It was given a streamlined body, a tapered bonnet and a radiator with rounded edges. It performed well. At St Petersburg over the flying kilometre carrying three people, two spare wheels, spare parts and luggage it was timed at 28 seconds, more than 80 miles an hour.|$|R
50|$|The college would {{continue}} to hit landmarks and expand throughout the years, including seeing its first female graduate, Ada Wilson, in 1907, {{and the creation of}} the Engineering Library in 1906. Thomas Edison gave the university an electric <b>dynamo</b> and incandescent <b>lamps</b> in 1882, and in 1885, the college created a department of electrical engineering. Mechanical engineering came next in 1891. Chemical engineering debuted as a department in 1903, with bioengineering following in 1917, industrial and manufacturing systems engineering in 1958 and nuclear engineering in 1964. Computer science moved from the College of Arts and Sciences to Engineering in 1995, with the Information Technology program launching in 2005.|$|R
25|$|At {{the close}} of the 19th century, the reductionism of atomic theory began to advance into the atom itself; determining, through physics, the nature of the atom and the {{operation}} of chemical reactions. Electricity, first thought to be a fluid, was now understood to consist of particles called electrons. This was first demonstrated by J. J. Thomson in 1897 when, using a cathode ray tube, he found that an electrical charge would travel across a vacuum (which would possess infinite resistance in classical theory). Since the vacuum offered no medium for an electric fluid to travel, this discovery could only be explained via a particle carrying a negative charge and moving through the vacuum. This electron flew in the face of classical electrodynamics, which had successfully treated electricity as a fluid for many years (leading to the invention of batteries, electric motors, <b>dynamos,</b> and arc <b>lamps).</b> More importantly, the intimate relation between electric charge and electromagnetism had been well documented following the discoveries of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell. Since electromagnetism was known to be a wave generated by a changing electric or magnetic field (a continuous, wave-like entity itself) an atomic/particle description of electricity and charge was a non sequitur. Furthermore, classical electrodynamics was not the only classical theory rendered incomplete.|$|R
