25|$|Some {{historians and}} admirers of Patel such as Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India and {{industrialist}} J. R. D. Tata have expressed {{the opinion that}} Patel {{would have made a}} better prime minister for India than Nehru. These admirers and Nehru's critics cite Nehru's belated embrace of Patel's advice regarding the UN and Kashmir and the integration of Goa by military action and Nehru's rejection of Patel's advice on China. Proponents of free enterprise cite the failings of Nehru's socialist policies as opposed to Patel's <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights and his mentorship of what was to be later known as the Amul co-operative project. However, A. G. Noorani, in comparing Nehru and Patel, writes that Nehru had a broader understanding of the world than Patel.|$|E
60|$|It was in {{line with}} these {{experiences}} that White Fang came to learn the law of property and {{the duty of the}} <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>property.</b> From the protection of his god's body to the protection of his god's possessions was a step, and this step he made. What was his god's was to be defended against all the world--even to the extent of biting other gods. Not only was such an act sacrilegious in its nature, but it was fraught with peril. The gods were all-powerful, and a dog was no match against them; yet White Fang learned to face them, fiercely belligerent and unafraid. Duty rose above fear, and thieving gods learned to leave Grey Beaver's property alone.|$|E

5000|$|Being a fluent German speaker, ascetic {{philosopher and}} atheist, he {{played host to}} Albert Einstein, when he visited London in 1921. As President of the Institute of Public Administration, he was a leading {{intellectual}} on the philosophy of governance. [...] "The Reign of Relativity" [...] combined Haldane's love of all things German expressed by Goethe and his works, with the Hegelian military-industrial complex. Haldane admired the fact that Germans were [...] "trained to obey". Hegel's aristocratic desire for law and order and <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> against revolution had a mathematical symmetry. Hegel was a purist: his work attempted to keep science and philosophy apart. The rising tide of New Liberalism and moral realism was for Haldane, Hegel's philological precept to improve behaviour, using the empiricism of scientific data as a proof.|$|E

He implicitly accused Licinianus of Cartagena of ordaining ignoramuses to the priesthood, but Licinianus simply replied that to not do so would leave the diocese of the province empty: a sad commentary {{on the state of}} clerical education in Spania.|$|R

Although this case is on the specific interpretation <b>of</b> the statutory <b>defence</b> under s5 Criminal Damage Act 1971, the fact that the defendant was not out of time after nine months of inaction is interesting. On a similar statutory defence, DPP v Bayer and Others (2004) 1 Cr.

5000|$|In 1688 {{there were}} 50 {{offences}} on the statute book punishable by death, but that number had almost quadrupled by 1776, and it reached 220 {{by the end}} of the century. Most of the new laws introduced during that period were concerned with the <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> which some commentators have interpreted as a form of class suppression of the poor by the rich. George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax, expressed a contemporary view when he said that [...] "Men are not hanged for stealing horses, but that horses may not be stolen". Grand larceny was one of the crimes that drew the death penalty; it was defined as the theft of goods worth more than 12 pence, about one-twentieth of the weekly wage for a skilled worker at the time. As the 18th century proceeded, jurors often deliberately under-assessed the value of stolen goods, in order to avoid making a sentence of death mandatory.|$|E
5000|$|Justice McGrath {{delivered}} the unanimous {{judgment of the}} Court dismissing Taueki's appeal. The Supreme Court clarified the meaning of possession and peaceable possession {{in the context of}} the <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>property.</b> On possession, they held:Possession, as required by s 56, accordingly turns on whether the person raising the defence has actual control over the property in question. Whether a person has sufficient control to be in possession is a factual question turning on all the circumstances including, for example, the nature of the land in question and the manner in which it is usually enjoyed.On the definition of peaceable possession they ruled that:Overall, the meaning of [...] "peaceable possession" [...] which best fits the context of the Crimes Act is simply possession that has been achieved other than in the context of an immediate or ongoing dispute. In brief, it is possession obtained and maintained before the employment of the physical force the use of which the person seeks to justify.|$|E

His successor, St Hubert, transferred the body of St Lambert to Liège, which was then a small settlement, a vicus, named Vicus Leudicus. On his grave Hubert built a chapel (St. Lambert's Cathedral) which became the nucleus of the city, and near which the permanent residence of the bishops was established.|$|R

But the younger Glendinning stood up in <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> her <b>property,</b> and, with a positiveness which had hitherto made no part of his character, declared, that now the kind lady was dead, the book was Mary's, and no one but Mary should have it.|$|R
