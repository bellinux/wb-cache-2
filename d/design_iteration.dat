50|$|The initial design {{had three}} landing legs. As any {{particular}} leg {{would have to}} carry {{the weight of the}} vehicle if it lands at any significant angle, three legs was the lightest configuration. However, it would be the least stable if one of the legs were damaged during landing. The next landing gear <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> had five legs and was the most stable configuration for landing on an unknown terrain. That configuration, however, was too heavy and the designers compromised on four landing legs.|$|E

The minesweepers were badly {{needed in the}} heavily mined Baltic Sea, therefore pre-production series comprising 32 vessels were ordered 12 April 1943, followed by full-capacity production on two shipyards starting from 12 June 1943. The minesweeper was extremely successful, resulting in 4 shipyards assigned to its production starting from 31 October 1943.|$|E

40|$|Optimized {{designs of}} the Navigation Doppler Lidar (NDL) {{instrument}} for Autonomous Landing Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) were accomplished via Interdisciplinary Design Concept (IDEC) at NASA Langley Research Center {{during the summer}} of 2013. Three branches in the Engineering Directorate and three students were involved in this joint task through the NASA Langley Aerospace Research Summer Scholars (LARSS) Program. The Laser Remote Sensing Branch (LRSB), Mechanical Systems Branch (MSB), and Structural and Thermal Systems Branch (STSB) were engaged to achieve optimal designs through iterative and interactive collaborative design processes. A preliminary <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> was able to reduce the power consumption, mass, and footprint by removing redundant components and replacing inefficient components with more efficient ones. A second <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> reduced volume and mass by replacing bulky components with excessive performance with smaller components custom-designed for the power system. The existing power system was analyzed to rank components in terms of inefficiency, power dissipation, footprint and mass. Design considerations and priorities are compared along with the results of each <b>design</b> <b>iteration.</b> Overall power system improvements are summarized for design implementations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reasons for}} <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> and describes models of <b>design</b> <b>iteration.</b> Iteration {{is the process of}} repeating tasks within a design project, and is common to all types of engineering <b>design.</b> <b>Iteration</b> is typically necessary for two reasons: an unexpected failure of a design or prototype to meet established criteria; and an expected response to information which was generated after the previous iteration was completed. Both types of iteration are typical of most engineering projects. This paper describes these two types of iteration, and presents two mathematical models which attempt to capture the effects of iteration on total development time. The models are the Probabilistic Sequential Iteration Model, which describes unexpected iteration, and the Work Transformation Model, which describes expected iteration. The two models correspond to the two reasons that iteration occurs in engineering design. They are useful in identifying {{some of the most important}} effects of iteration on development time, and can support important managerial decisions which affect successful completion of the design project in a timely manner...|$|E

As a case study, DSM methods are implemented to reduce the <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> or rework in a complex engineering project.

40|$|As {{companies}} {{compete to}} gain market share, increase profits and affect growth they often turn to concurrent engineering {{in an effort}} to bring new products to the market more quickly. Despite many anecdotal success stories, implementation of concurrent engineering can often prove difficult. As the pressure to bring new products to market increases, companies often compress their <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> cycle times {{in an effort to}} develop products more quickly. In many cases, design cycles may overlap creating situations where learning opportunities (e. g. through testing) are missed and/or ignored. More perversely, compressing <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> cycles can cause the creation of "phantom errors" and unnecessary rework as concurrent design activities iterate at different speeds. In this research, I use a system dynamics approach to develop a stylized simulation model of the design-build-test iteration cycle to explore the effects of cycle timing on learning. Specifically, I look at the frequency and timing of integration (build) test events and their effect on new product delivery time, quality, and development cost. This research adds to the existing literature in new product development, concurrent engineering, and system dynamics. Ultimately, the results serve to inform new product development project managers of the implications of <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> timing on project performance and assist in the scheduling of integration events. by Daniel J.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel Model-Based Design (MBD) approach and associated tool-chain for the Time-Triggered Real-time Embedded (TTRE) 1 systems. Our tool-chain automat-ically synthesizes software for manufacturing TTRE systems. A Software-In-the-Loop Simulation (SILS) framework integrated into our tool-chain helps {{to reduce the}} <b>design</b> <b>iterations.</b> Using a manufacturing robot-arm use-case, we validate our tool-chain and demonstrate a 39 × improvement in the Quality-of-Control (QoC) {{when compared to the}} state-of-the-art approach [4]. Our auto-generated scheduler meets all the hard real-time constraints (zero deadline misses) for a given TTRE system when compared to the scheduler (e. g., 145 deadline misses for a CPU utilization of 95 %) presented in [1], [26]. Moreover, compared to the traditional MBD approach for the TTRE systems where many <b>design</b> <b>iterations</b> are required [5], our approach and tool-chain can generate high qualit...|$|R
