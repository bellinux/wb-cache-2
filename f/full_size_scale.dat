40|$|The {{results of}} visual {{inspection}} according to UNI 11119 : 2004 and bending tests made on 20 old chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) beams according to EN 408 : 2010 were statistically analyzed {{in order to}} provide a consistent and feasible procedure to predict their modulus of elasticity (MOE) in bending. Local data obtained from smaller size specimens was used for the prediction of the global mechanical properties of full structural size members and compared with the results of mechanical tests. The prediction models took into account the visual strength classes and the influence of defects on the determination of the MOE. Moreover, random sampling was considered in order to demonstrate the possibility of using smaller representative samples, thus avoiding excessive need of removal of on-site samples and allowing for a smaller number of mechanical tests. The models using random sampling predicted the behavior of <b>full</b> <b>size</b> <b>scale</b> elements accurately, with strong correlations to the experimental results (coefficient of determination r 2 ranging from 0. 70 to 0. 79) and a percentage error lower than 20 %, thus allowing a reliable estimation of mechanical characteristics of existing timber members with a combination of visual inspection and local sampling.

40|$|Most design {{assignments}} in architecture schools are copies of typical {{assignments in}} an architecture practice. They {{start with the}} first sketches, which are further developed in a preliminary design, and end with working drawings and design details. This sequence works for someone who masters all the aspects of architecture, and therefore can foresee the consequences for the realisation of a preliminary design sketch. But {{this is not the}} case for beginning architecture students; for whom the construction often turns out at the end of the design process as a choice of the less disturbing structure to realise their designed form. This lack of integration makes good architecture impossible, because earlier research proves that in good architecture, more satisfactory solutions encompass more topics of the stated problem at the same time. So these good solutions integrate many topics, including form and construction. A literature review on didactics bring up 3 interesting strategies to counter this problem. First, thematic assignments simplify the complexity of architectural problems and make it possible to focus on certain aspects, for example the integration of construction and form. Secondly, by working on scale 1 / 1, the difficulty of rescaling and problems of representation are both omitted out of the design process and reinforce the possibility to focus on form and construction. And thirdly, the order in which steps are applied in practice, does not have to be the order in which they should be taught. There are very good reasons to teach "backwards", so there is always something before you is that you already know. All three strategies were applied in a thematic studio assignment last year, that started where the design process in practice often ends: the details. The assignment started with the exploration of the formal and constructive aspects of possible connections between 2 parts of the same or different materials by building and exploring the connections in reality. And it ended with the exploration of the form and the constructive properties of vertical or horizontal structures, created by frequently repeating that connection. During the whole design process, the formal aspects of what the students were constructing, were visible and at the same time, the constructive qualities were tangible with there hands on a <b>full</b> <b>size</b> <b>scale.</b> While not paying attention to context, nor to function, they were able to concentrate on the integration of form and construction. status: publishe...|$|E

These often serve to determine the direction of projection for the subsequent view. By the 90° circuitous stepping process, projecting in any direction from the point view of a line yields its true length view; projecting in a direction parallel to a true length line view yields its point view, projecting the point view of any line on a plane yields the plane's edge view; projecting in a direction perpendicular to the edge view of a plane will yield the true shape (to scale) view.

40|$|To reduce {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{emissions}} of road going vehicles, the aerodynamic drag {{is an important}} area to focus on. Reducing aerodynamic drag will lead to reduced fuel consumption and hence decreased CO 2 emissions. A significant element of the aerodynamic drag of a modern passenger car is the cooling drag, which can constitute up to 15 %. Possible solutions to reduce the cooling drag include closing off parts of the cooling air inlets when {{only a small amount}} of cooling air flow is needed. The focus of this study is on the aerodynamic effects closing off the cooling air inlets have on a modern passenger car. Both <b>full</b> <b>size</b> and <b>scale</b> model experiments were utilized, together with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. Results show that reduction in aerodynamic drag is possible by closing off the lower cooling air inlet and furthermore that this has a noticeable effect on the base pressure.

These screens {{are used for}} multiple purposes, such as to filter the propellant and oxidizer for example. But there is another major task for such screens: {{they are able to}} detain gas bubbles in a liquid flow. This is important to provide a pure liquid flow of propellant and oxidizer to the spacecraft’s engine. Regarding to this, the Bubble Point becomes important. It describes the maximum pressure difference across a screen, when gas bubbles can break through. It is of importance, that in a feed line system the pressure drop across a metallic screen device never becomes higher than the Bubble Point of the used screen. Otherwise a gas-free fluid flow cannot be provided. For that reason, and for the total pressure loss in the feed line system, {{it is important to know}} the pressure loss behaviour of metallic screen elements.

40|$|The {{importance}} of aerodynamics of road-going {{vehicles on the}} total driving resistance and hence fuel consumption is well known to vehicle manufactures. At present, upper body aerodynamics of passenger cars is relatively well understood. However, upper body aerodynamics only represents half of the total aerodynamic resistance on a typical passenger car. It {{has been shown that}} as much as 25 percent of the total aerodynamic drag of a passenger car originates from the wheels. Consequently it is possible to achieve important reductions in driving resistance by optimising the flow around the wheels and underbody. At present, advanced ground simulations techniques exist. Several car manufacturers perform wind tunnel experiments with moving ground and other systems for boundary layer treatment. It has been shown that such system have a large impact on the results and are essential to create accurate boundary conditions when investigating road-going vehicles in wind tunnels. A full width moving ground system has been developed for the L 2 Aerodynamic Wind Tunnel at Chalmers University of Technology. It will be used for future correlation investigations between <b>full</b> <b>size</b> and <b>scale</b> model experiments. Detailed flow field investigations around the front and rear wheels on a <b>full</b> <b>size</b> Volvo C 30 DRIVe™ passenger car have been performed in the Volvo Aerodynamic Wind Tunnel. Omni-directional pressure probes were used to map the local flow field using an automated traversing and data acquisition system. General flow field structures were identified both at the front and the rear wheels. Two large scale wakes were found at the front wheel and one at the rear wheel. A significant dependence on ground simulation was found for both the front and rear wheel flow structures {{as well as for the}} global drag. Some dependency on wheel geometry was found at the front wheel whereas the differences at the rear wheel were insignificant for the investigated configurations. A qualitative agreement between front wheel lower wake size and global drag was found. However, integrated microdrag showed that even though there was a quantitative difference in the local flow field, it did not fully explain the differences between configurations. Consequently, it is necessary to expand the experimental investigation in order to fully explain the reasons for changes in global drag. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of an equivalent vehicle showed good qualitative agreement in the local flow field with some minor exceptions that need to be further investigated. The difference in global drag between the investigated wheel configurations differed by only 1 drag count between experiments and CFD, thus showing good correlation as well...|$|R
