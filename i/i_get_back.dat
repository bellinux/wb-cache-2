500|$|Debate over Trescothick's {{place in}} the England squad {{continued}} amid an end-of-series reshuffle in the England batting lineup. This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, {{and the rise of}} Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: [...] "Of course I'd love to play for England again.... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if and when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to full fitness and I think I am OK and ready to play, I'll make myself available for England." [...] He added that he was [...] "desperate to play for England again" [...] but was waiting until he was [...] "as convinced as I can be that I am ready to take on the challenge of international cricket".|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} {{ends with}} continuous clicking of the camera. Gaga {{comes to the}} top of the pillar and sings a combination of [...] "Starstruck" [...] and [...] "LoveGame" [...] as she is joined by her dancers in tracks and jackets and hands Gaga her trademark disco stick. After [...] "LoveGame", she talks a monologue about the year [...] "3009". And says that [...] "The kids came out of New York and shot the paparazzi." [...] followed by saying [...] "It was a thousand years before when the monster first entered the city, vanished for our hearts and for our brains and for our faces (referencing to the three video interludes of the tour)" [...] and [...] "we knew we could co-exist with this monster with our MUSIC!!! With our art and with our fashion. My name is Lady Gaga." [...] and tells the crowd she feels [...] "beautiful and dirty rich" [...] and sang [...] "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich". This leads to the end of the first part wherein a video introduction called [...] "The Brain" [...] starts with Gaga appearing again as Candy Warhol and brushing her hair. After the video ends, Gaga appears on the stage in a black and white leotard with high-pointed [...] "puff" [...] shoulders and lightning shaped symbols, while riding on a similarly colored vespa. She then starts singing [...] "The Fame". This is followed by a speech. Gaga said she's been [...] "travelling the whole world, but when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>back,</b> I can still smell the stench of greed." [...] And then she performs [...] "Money Honey" [...] with the dancers who are wearing backpacks. [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] starts immediately, accompanied by hand-waving and Gaga wore a hat made of toppled dominoes.|$|E

500|$|Hank Williams, {{who heard}} both the Miller and Griffin versions, started {{performing}} the {{song on the}} Louisiana Hayride shortly after joining in August 1948. Horace Logan, the show's producer and programming director for KWKH, reported that the audience [...] "went crazy" [...] the first time Williams performed the song on the show. [...] In light of the live audience's strong positive reaction, Williams decided to record the song. His decision was questioned by his musicians and also his producer, Fred Rose, who felt that the song did not merit a recording. Williams, mindful of the reaction he received live, [...] persisted, and the recording {{took place during the}} final half-hour of a session recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 22, 1948. For this recording, Williams replaced the jazz musicians with a modern country music band, using a rhythm guitar, mandolin, string bass, drums and a steel guitar. [...] Williams' session band was composed of Clyde Baum (mandolin), Zeke Turner (electric guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), Louis Innis (rhythm guitar), Tommy Jackson (fiddle) and Willie Thawl (bass). With little time left, Byrd and Turner replicated the musical arrangement they previously used on an Ernest Tubb session for a cover of Jimmie Rodgers' [...] "Waiting for a Train". [...] In the episode of American Masters about Williams, Drifting Cowboy Don Helms recalls, [...] "When they recorded 'Lovesick Blues,' Fred told Hank, 'That song's out of meter! [...] Got too many bars in it. [...] And you hold that note too long.' [...] And Hank said, 'Well, when I find a note I like, I wanna hold on to it as long as I can,' you know, just tryin' to be funny. [...] And Fred said, 'Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. [...] That thing is so much out of meter, I'm gonna get me {{a cup of coffee and}} when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> maybe ya'll have that thing cut.' [...] And they did, but it was still out of meter. [...] So Fred lived with that the rest of his life." [...] Williams combined Griffin's lyrical arrangement with a two-beat honky-tonk track, borrowing the yodeling and beat drops from Miller's recording. [...] "Lovesick Blues" [...] was recorded in two takes.|$|E

[...] On June 30, 2011, a new song was released onto T.I.'s official website and on his official YouTube channel â€“ titled [...] "We Don't Get Down Like Y'all", which features fellow Grand Hustle rapper B.o.B on the hook. While commenting on the song, T.I. said in another letter; [...] "It's a song that I did soon after my release last time. What inspired me to write this record was the differences in how we do us and how they do them suddenly became incredibly evident in just {{a very short period of}} time." [...] It was originally only available on Atlantic Records's online store. The song was available on iTunes and other vendors, such as Spotify on August 9 and it peaked at number seventy-eight in the US.|$|E
