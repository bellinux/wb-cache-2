40|$|The authors {{present a}} {{database}} <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> innovative activity {{around the world}} since the early 1960 s. The data include measures <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> outcomes as well as variables related to innovation effort. The main <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs</b> is patents. The main variables related to innovation inputs are investment {{in research and development}} (R&D) and technical personnel (engineers, scientists) working in R&D activities. The sources of these data are publicly available (OECD, UNESCO, etc.), yet there have been few attempts at double checking the consistency of these data and digitizing observations dating back to the 1960 s. After discussing the sources and definitions of the data, the authors examine trends and patterns <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs</b> and inputs by looking at the over-time behavior of the relevant series and comparing the performance of developing and high-income countries. They also provide cross-regional comparisons and a detailed examination of trends in selected countries. In turn, the authors provide estimates of the impact <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> on long-run development by following an emerging empirical literature on the determinants of levels of GDP per capita. The econometric results suggest that innovation might indeed have strong positive effects on long-run development, which might be stronger than the direct effects of institutions. The analysis pays close attention to issues related to the potential endogeneity <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> (and institutions) with respect to the level of development.

40|$|It is {{sometimes}} suggested that innovation is inherently impossible to quantify and to measure. This chapter argues that {{while this is}} true for some aspects <b>of</b> <b>innovation,</b> its overall characteristics do not preclude measurement of key dimensions of processes and outputs. An important development has been the emergence <b>of</b> new <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> inputs and <b>outputs,</b> including economy-wide measures that have some degree of international comparability. Following sections discuss first some broad issues in the construction and use of science, technology, and innovation (STI) indicators, then turn (briefly) to the strengths and weaknesses <b>of</b> current <b>indicators,</b> particularly R&D and patents.

40|$|For newly-founded and {{established}} firms different initial or prevailing conditions apply in the innovation process. Against this background, {{the question arises}} as to what implications this has for a firm's innovation behaviour {{and to what extent}} both groups of companies differ significantly from each other as regards internal and environment-related influences. The present contribution takes this as its starting point. With the aid of discrimination analysis it is established which variables can be drawn on to describe significant group differences. Empirical investigations show clear differences in innovation behaviour between start up firms and incumbent firms. Both groups of companies differ most greatly in resource input during the R&D and innovation phase. The variables, ‚personnel expenditure per employee', ‚investment expenditure per employee', ‚R&D employment intensity'and ‚innovation expenditure per employee in the launch phase' display the highest discrimination coefficients. But also the sales share of new products as an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> the firm's <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> is characterized by a significant separatory power. Environmental factors <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> behaviour, on the other hand, (technological level of the industry, R&D cooperation behaviour) possess minor discriminatory significance.

40|$|Contribution in-kind, {{innovative}} project, {{in-kind contribution}} capacity <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs,</b> valuation <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs.</b> Summary The paper presents {{a method for}} the valuation of innovative project outputs {{as the object of}} in-kind contribution to a commercial company. In-kind contribution of an innovative project can be treated as a form of technology transfer. The realisation of technology transfer {{in the form of the}} in-kind contribution requires an estimate of its value. Assuming that a research project is a value carrier in the process of valuation, this value should be estimated in terms of its ability to cover liabilities, which is the attribute of each in-kind contribution. The presented valuation method is based on the philosophy adopted within the framework of the income valuation methods, i. e. on the capacity of innovative project outputs to generate current cash flows from the company profits in the future. Innovation in itself is not, however, the source of profits. It is, in addition to financial capital, part of the overall capitals that finance operational assets. Thus, the process of innovative project valuation must be preceded by the measurement <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs</b> generated by the project, i. e. its innovation potential. “The duration of the competitive advantage ” achieved through the implementation <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> in the compan...|$|R

40|$|One {{important}} element of a firm’s organizational environment that may influence innovation is whether the CEO of the firm is its founder. Popular perception is that the inherent venturous spirit of the founders creates an environment that fosters innovation. This study investigates whether founder-CEOs are more innovative than nonfounder CEOs. Using a sample of S&P 500 firms from 1995 - 2005 and the NBER patent database for measuring <b>innovation</b> <b>output,</b> the study’s baseline results suggest that founder-CEOs are actually associated with fewer patents (quantity <b>of</b> <b>innovation)</b> and fewer citations (quality <b>of</b> <b>innovations),</b> a finding that is contrary to popular perception. However, to reveal the true picture of the innovativeness of founders, evaluating the effect <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> on overall firm valuation is necessary. Thus, the study considers the effect <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> on firm valuation and suggests that founder-CEOs add more value by innovation. The market greets the <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> founder-run firms more favorably than the <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> non-founder-run firms. This value addition holds even after controlling for strategic investments such as R&D.

40|$|Having {{recognized}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> {{for the improvement}} of productivity in firms and for the growth of national economies, researchers have been exploring the innovation process and its underlying factors for over a decade now.

This paper attempts to fill this gap by investigating the impact <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> on firms’ productivity across a number of East and West European countries, using a structural model based on Crepon, Duguet and Mairesse (1998) and a firm-level dataset from the 2006 round <b>of</b> the Community <b>Innovation</b> Survey (CIS 6).

A radiation effect related to traffic arteries as spatial diffusion corridors was prominent. Accordingly, a spatial correlation effect <b>of</b> its <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs</b> also indicated a hollowness in the city center; the spatial structure <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>of</b> Beijing had a single-core oriented structure all the way. Together with the tendency for innovation resources to be agglomerated in the city center, the spatial correlation effect <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs</b> reflected the characteristics of the evolutionary feature where "rural area encircles cities". The <b>innovation</b> spatial structure <b>of</b> Shanghai and Beijing have intrinsic consistency with the spatial structure of their respective regions (Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan region), which suggested that the principle of proportional and disproportional distribution of a city-scale pattern of technological and innovational activities is closely related to its regional innovation pattern.
