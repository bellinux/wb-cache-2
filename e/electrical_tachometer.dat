50|$|By 1908 Hutchison had {{developed}} an <b>electrical</b> <b>tachometer</b> {{that would give}} an accurate reading {{of the speed of}} steam ship engines.Previously, ship speed was judged by spinning shafts that were mechanically connected to the propellers. The innovation of using a simple generator and voltmeter allowed much more precise control, and using wires the speed could be displayed remotely in the pilot house or captain's stateroom as well as engine room. The device even allowed speeds to be measured when the ship's engines were reversed. It was licensed to Industrial Instrument Company for production.|$|E
5000|$|For most PHM {{industrial}} applications, commercial off {{the shelf}} data acquisition hardware and sensors are normally the most practical and common. Example commercial vendors for data acquisition hardware include National Instruments and Advantech Webaccess; [...] however, for certain applications, the hardware can be customized or ruggedized as needed. Common sensor types for PHM applications include accelerometers, temperature, pressure, measurements of rotational speed using encoders or <b>tachometers,</b> <b>electrical</b> measurements of voltage and current, acoustic emission, load cells for force measurements, and displacement or position measurements. There are numerous sensor vendors for those measurement types, with some having a specific product line that is more suited for condition monitoring and PHM applications.|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of the}} paper is to establish the framework for power quality and vibration measurements assessment of hydropower generator. To meet the objective the set of measurements were performed on hydropower generating unit, using typical instrumentation like voltage analyzer for three-phase <b>electrical</b> networks, laser <b>tachometer</b> kit, vibration measurement equipment, air gap measuring system etc. The suggested framework states that electric voltage quality is affected by mechanical faults of power generator like rotor air gap eccentricity and stator poles faults, rotor and stator vibration characteristics and unbalance. The voltage characteristics were analyzed based on every generator pole. The proposed framework is beneficial for diagnosis of hydropower units since it relates electrical and mechanical analysis and provides example of data acquisition program suitable for further investigation...|$|R
