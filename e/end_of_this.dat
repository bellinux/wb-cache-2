5|$|Population {{estimates}} for Tikal vary from 10,000 to {{as high as}} 90,000 inhabitants, with the most likely figure being at the upper <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> range.|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, 26 April {{marks the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> battle, {{although}} less severe and isolated clashes {{in that region}} continued until 30 April. Other sources note that heavy fighting still took place on 27 April, and that the German advance was only completely halted by 28 April. By {{the end of the}} month, the Polish Second Army and the Soviet forces had repelled the German attack, forming a line toward Kamenz–Doberschütz–Dauban, and was preparing to launch an offensive toward Prague.|$|E
5|$|After {{the hamlet}} of Wethersfield, NY78 {{continues}} southwest, crossing through rural farms as a two-lane roadway, intersecting with the southern terminus of CR57 (Poplar Tree Road). A short distance after CR57, NY78 intersects {{with the northern}} terminus of NY362 while winding southwest through Wethersfield. At the intersection with Maxwell Drive, NY78 becomes westbound, remaining rural for several miles. After the intersection with Irish Road, NY78 makes a gradual bend to the southwest, then north. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> bend, NY78 intersects with the eastern terminus of CR54 (Chaffee Road) and the northern terminus of CR11 (East Arcade Road).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> story ties in {{with the}} <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> Year One and leads into Batman: The Man Who Laughs, which portrays Batman's first {{encounter}} with The Joker.|$|R

5|$|As the TUTT {{gradually}} warmed, Gordon {{was able}} to undergo a prolonged period of rapid intensification, despite having restricted outflow. Over a 30-hour period from July14 to 15, the storm's central pressure decreased by 70mbar (hPa; 2.07inHg), just below the threshold for explosive intensification. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> phase, Gordon attained its peak strength as a Category5 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260km/h (160mph). Around the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the storm to have attained 10-minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) along with a minimum pressure of 915mbar (hPa; 27.02inHg).|$|E
5|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period Windsor Castle {{became a}} place of royal confinement. In 1788 the king first became ill during a dinner at Windsor Castle; {{diagnosed}} as suffering from madness, he was removed for a period to the White House at Kew, where he temporarily recovered. After relapses in 1801 and 1804, his condition became enduring from 1810 onwards and he was confined in the State Apartments of Windsor Castle, with building work on the castle ceasing the following year.|$|E
5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> century.|$|E
50|$|Mahasamund City has two Cinema Hall and {{recently}} {{the construction of}} THREE SCREEN INOX MULTIPLEX is in under process which may be completed in the <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> year.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{episode was}} {{disrupted}} during its airing {{in some time}} zones in North America due to breaking {{news coverage of the}} death of Osama bin Laden.|$|R

5|$|Between 23 and 27 May {{and again}} 30 May 1951, New Jersey pounded targets near Yangyang and Kansong, {{dispersing}} troop concentrations, dropping a bridge span, and destroying three large ammunition dumps. Air spotters reported Yangyang abandoned at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> action, while railroad facilities and vehicles were smashed at Kansong. On 24 May, she {{lost one of}} her helicopters after the crew pushed their chopper to the limit of its fuel searching for a downed aviator. The helicopter crew was able to reach friendly territory and were later returned to their ship.|$|E
5|$|By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, {{particularly for the}} auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} returned briefly, {{creating the}} White Throne member, but encroaching seas again beveled the coastline, forming a regional unconformity. Thin beds of clay and silt mark the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation {{make up the}} capstone of West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example). Temple Cap iron oxide is also {{the source of the}} red-orange color of much {{the lower half of the}} Navajo Formation.|$|E
5000|$|Like [...] "Space Road", {{this song}} was {{included}} in Casiopea. Intro and <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> song includes a lot of 16th-note-triplets in impressive unison phrases, and song to symbolize their technical aspects.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> episode, {{in which}} a {{high-ranking}} official drop their charges {{on one of the}} surgeons based on their skills, is identical to that of the pilot episode and several later ones.|$|R

5|$|During his World War II service, Davis flew 266 missions, accruing a {{total of}} 705 combat hours and {{destroying}} seven Japanese aircraft. For these exploits, {{he was awarded the}} Silver Star, two Distinguished Flying Crosses and nine Air Medals. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> war, Davis had over 2,200 hours of flight time.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{movements}} {{after the}} Carboniferous period {{resulted in the}} up-doming of the area and, particularly in the west, the folding of the rock strata along north–south axes. The region {{was raised in a}} north–south line which resulted in the dome-like shape and the shales and sandstones were worn away until limestone was exposed. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period, the Earth's crust sank here which led to the area being covered by sea, depositing a variety of new rocks.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Nakayama {{commissioned}} the famed architect Yoshikazu Uchida {{to draw up}} a blueprint for the area. Uchida arranged ten buildings around Oyasama's Residence. A 50-meter boulevard would come out of the Residence on a north-south axis, along which six school buildings would be lined up. Classrooms and large auditoriums would be built at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> boulevard. The international school and library were to be eventually integrated into this plan. In January 1937, a middle school (now Tenri High School) was built according to Uchida's plan, but as Japan mobilized for the Pacific War the plan had to be temporarily shelved.|$|E
50|$|Runway 4-22 is Forks Municipal Airport's sole runway. This runway is 2400 ft long, 75 ft wide, is {{equipped}} with medium intensity runway lighting, and has an asphalt surface. Approaches to both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> runway are visual.|$|R
50|$|The A861 {{serves the}} {{communities}} of the remote Ardgour, Sunart, Moidart and Ardnamurchan areas Although the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> road are only 14 mi apart (the direct link being {{by way of the}} A830 road) its total length is 70 mi.|$|R
5000|$|The Blue Jay wrote To {{tell you}} all the truth, I'm a sucker for cute, romantic moments, and this episode was FULL OF THEM. Amazing acting by @aclockworkobi and @mayaaliofficial as always. The <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> drama was just so satisfying[...]|$|R
5|$|Only two {{or three}} frets are needed for the guitarchords—major, minor, and {{dominant}} sevenths—which are emphasized in introductions to guitar-playing and to the fundamentals of music. Each major and minor chord can be played on two successive frets on three successive strings, and therefore each needs only two fingers. Other chords—seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths—are played on only three successive frets. For fundamental-chord fingerings, major-thirds tuning's simplicity and consistency are not shared by standard tuning, whose seventh-chord fingering is discussed at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> section.|$|E
5|$|Stretching {{between the}} Pfullendorf heights {{and the village}} lies a flat, wide plain, marshy in places, ringed with low-lying hills, and creased with a small {{tributary}} stream from which the village takes its name. Ostrach itself lies almost at the northern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. By 7March, the first French forces arrived there, and the Austrians arrived {{a day or so}} later. Over the following week, additional forces for both sides arrived, and the two armies faced each other across this valley.|$|E
5|$|The River Brue {{marks the}} {{boundary}} with Glastonbury, {{to the north}} of Street. At the time of King Arthur, the Brue formed a lake just south of the hilly ground on which Glastonbury stands. This lake is one of the locations suggested by Arthurian legend as the home of the Lady of the Lake. Pomparles Bridge stood at the western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> lake, guarding Glastonbury from the south, and it was here that Sir Bedivere is thought to have thrown the sword Excalibur into the waters after King Arthur fell at the Battle of Camlann. The old bridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete arch bridge in 1911.|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> movie, when Oliver {{arrives at}} his splendidly {{beautiful}} castle, he discovers that his ruthless and corrupt fiancée, Vivian, {{has already made}} arrangements for their wedding {{and that they were}} going to get married that very evening.|$|R
50|$|Let Γ be a {{connected}} graph where {{the degree of}} every vertex is finite. One can view Γ as a topological space by giving it the natural structure of a one-dimensional cell complex. Then the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> Γ are the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> topological space. A more explicit definition of the number <b>of</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a graph is presented below for completeness.|$|R
50|$|Following Theresa May's {{appointment}} as Prime Minister in July 2016, {{the department was}} disbanded and merged with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to form the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, with the consequent <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> shadow post.|$|R
