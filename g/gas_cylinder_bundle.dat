For carrying or use as a forearm, the aluminum legs can be folded back and secured in slots under the receiver by hooks and a spring-loaded catch. When firing from the hip, the bipod legs remain extended and the left leg is gripped for support. The bipod can be removed from the <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> by tapping-out a roll pin in the <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> head until it is flush and the bipod can be rotated enough to clear the <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder's</b> retaining lugs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{explosion}} suppression {{fire extinguisher}} {{is an important}} component part of fire extinguishing and explosion suppression system of special equipment. Because of particularity and specificity of the place where it is used, the explosion suppression fire extinguisher’s body itself is commonly called the special <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The material for special <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> selected and used in the earliest design is mainly the ordinary steel <b>gas</b> <b>cylinders</b> such as the carbon structural steel <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Because of the following characteristics: being rich in their resources, the prices are low and the process is simple, they can meet the requirements for the use in many kinds of places, and up to now, there are still used widely. But with the continuous development of special equipment in the fields of land, seas and oceans, aviation and aerospace and so on, the single material for the ordinary steel <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> is unable to meet the special requirements of some special equipment. Therefore, it is necessary to research and manufacture new materials whose performance is different from the performance of steel <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> and replace steel <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> with the new materials, {{in order to meet the}} different demand in every field. With the continuous development of materials science of our country, some new materials and new technologies are researched and applied continuously.

40|$|Compressed <b>gas</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{contaminated}} with radionuclides are a unique waste item that {{may become a}} Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste through two mechanisms: either {{the contents of the}} compressed <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> are regulated under RCRA or the internal pressure of the compressed <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> gives it the characteristic of reactivity. The characteristic of reactivity is defined by RCRA in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 261. 23 (a) (6) as a waste that is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating source or heated under confinement. In a letter dated September 1, 1989, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Solid Waste referred the interpretation of the definition of reactivity to the EPA Regional Office and/or the state (if the state has primacy). The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) has made the interpretation that to meet the definition of reactive as specified in 40 CFR 261. 23 (a) (6) there must be a chemical reaction that causes the explosion or detonation. This interpretation limits the compressed <b>gas</b> <b>cylinders</b> that have to be treated as RCRA hazardous waste to those that have other RCRA characteristic codes or contain listed wastes. The difficulty in treating compressed <b>gas</b> <b>cylinders</b> is heightened in the case of radiologically contaminated compressed <b>gas</b> <b>cylinders</b> because the internal pressure and possible hazardous constituents must be treated in most cases before decontamination of the cylinder is possible. Special procedures must be followed to ensure that radiological contamination is not transferred to clean <b>gas</b> <b>cylinders</b> or released into the environment...|$|R
