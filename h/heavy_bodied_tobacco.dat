30|$|The {{nicotine}} content of tobacco leaves generally ranges from 0.3 to 3  %, though 5  % and even 7  % {{have been recorded}} in some <b>heavy</b> <b>bodied</b> <b>tobaccos</b> (Blakely and Bates 1998). Wang et al. (2008) in a study from China reported the nicotine level ranging from 0.78 to 3.26  % depending upon different leaf position and different treatment. Geto et al. (2012) reported the nicotine level in two brands of Ethiopian cigarette tobacco as 3.84 and 4.26  %, while Kassa et al. (2013) reported the nicotine levels in another two brands of Ethiopian cigarette tobacco as 2.04 and 2.54  %. Thus, the nicotine level of Ethiopian raw (unprocessed) Virginia tobacco leaves (3.26  %) are comparable to the nicotine levels reported in other studies. While the nicotine levels in other two Ethiopian raw tobacco leaves (Gaya 1.11  % and Burley 0.650  %) are lower than that in Virginia but comparable {{to that in the}} other tobacco leaves (Blakely and Bates 1998; Wang et al. 2008).|$|R

They are noted for having the ability to change color, though the exact mechanism and reasons for it are not completely understood. The color is reputed to change when the snake is agitated. They can vary from black to a mustard yellow, but are normally an olive green in appearance when young and dark olive when older, with the sides and underside distinctly lighter.|$|R
50|$|Starch from {{waxy maize}} differs from regular maize starch in both {{molecular}} structure and pasting characteristics. Pastes made from waxy starch {{are long and}} cohesive, whereas pastes made from regular maize starch are short and <b>heavy</b> <b>bodied.</b> Waxy maize starch is a major starch component in adhesives used for making bottle labels. This waxy starch-based adhesive imparts resolubilizing resistance to the labels which prevents their soaking off the bottle if immersed in water or being subjected to very high humidity conditions. Moreover, waxy maize starches are commonly used in the US for the manufacture of gummed tapes and envelope adhesives.|$|R

The majority of adult specimens range from 1 to 1.5 m in length. Some specimens, particularly those from Sri Lanka, may grow to lengths of 2.1 to 2.2 m, but this is relatively uncommon.|$|R

5000|$|Larger horses, such as {{varieties}} of Cleveland Bay, {{could be used}} on higher underground roadways, but on many duties small ponies no more than 12 hands high were needed. Shetlands were a breed commonly used because of their small size, but Welsh, Russian, Devonshire (Dartmoor) and Cornish ponies also saw extensive use in England. In the interwar period, ponies were imported into Britain from the Faroe Islands, Iceland and the United States. Geldings and stallions only were used. Donkeys were also used in the late 19th century, and in the United States, large numbers of mules were used. [...] Regardless of breed, typical mining ponies were low set, <b>heavy</b> <b>bodied</b> and <b>heavy</b> limbed with plenty of bone and substance, low-headed and sure-footed. Under the British Coal Mines Act of 1911, ponies had to be four years old and work ready (shod and vet checked) before going underground. They could work until their twenties.|$|R
40|$|The woodchuck, Marmota monax, {{also known}} as the groundhog, whistle pig, or marmot {{is one of the most}} widely {{distributed}} animals in the Northeast. It is the largest member of the squirrel family. Many people regard the woodchuck as a nuisance, which is understandable, however they are beneficial in some respects. Their burrows help aerate the soil and provide denning sites and refuge for many other animals such as rabbits and foxes. Prior to the European settlement of North America the woodchuck was far less common than today. The settlers created more suitable habitat by converting forests into farmland, and as a result the woodchuck population grew tremendously. Description: The woodchuck is a large, <b>heavy</b> <b>bodied</b> rodent ranging in weight from 5 to 10 pounds. The head and body range from 16 to 20 inches length.

5000|$|This {{species of}} cobra is medium in length, and <b>heavy</b> <b>bodied.</b> The {{average length of}} an adult ranges from 1 to 1.2 m; they can grow to 1.4 m. The head is elliptical, depressed, {{slightly}} distinct from the neck with a short, rounded snout and large nostrils. The body is compressed dorsoventrally and subcylindrical posteriorly. Its scales are smooth and strongly oblique. The eyes are moderate in size with round pupils. The body of this species is yellowish-brown to dull brown, with darker brownish mottling. The belly is pale with some dark speckling. Specimens are often dark under the chin and throat, followed by a more pale clear area, then by 2 or 3 dark bands across the venter of the hood. This species has no obvious markings on dorsum of the hood, although a spectacle-shaped hood mark may be present, especially in some juveniles. Like other spitting cobra species, they possess a pair of fixed front upper fangs that are highly modified for [...] "spitting" [...] venom.|$|R
50|$|Three-spined stickleback {{populations are}} also found in {{freshwater}} lakes and streams. These populations were probably formed when anadromous fish started spending their entire lifecycle in fresh water, and thus evolved to live there all year round. Freshwater populations are extremely morphologically diverse, {{to the extent that}} many observers (and some taxonomists) would describe a new subspecies of three-spined stickleback in almost every lake in the Northern Hemisphere. One consistent difference between freshwater populations and their anadromous ancestors is the amount of body armour, as the majority of freshwater fish only have between none and 12 lateral armour plates, and shorter dorsal and pelvic spines. However, also large morphological differences occur between lakes. One major axis of variation is between populations found in deep, steep-sided lakes and those in small, shallow lakes. The fish in the deep lakes typically feed in the surface waters on plankton, and often have large eyes, with short, slim bodies and upturned jaws. Some researchers refer to this as the limnetic form. Fish from shallow lakes feed mainly on the lake bed, and are often long and <b>heavy</b> <b>bodied</b> with relatively horizontal jaws and small eyes. These populations are referred to as the benthic form.|$|R

5000|$|The family Salticidae, {{commonly}} called jumping spiders, have a characteristic cephalothorax shape, {{as shown in}} the diagram below. They have eight eyes, two of them very prominent, and excellent vision. Their maximum size is perhaps 13/16 inch (20 mm), but many species are much smaller than that. The largest North American species such as Phidippus regius, P. octopunctatis, etc., are so <b>heavy</b> <b>bodied</b> that they cannot jump far. The smaller species of jumping spider can jump many times their own body length. They hunt by first getting within range of a prey animal such as a fly, securing a silken [...] "climbing rope" [...] to their current perch, and then jumping onto their prey and biting it. Many seem to take unerring aim at the neck of their prey. Should they jump from one twig to another in an attempt to capture prey and miss or get knocked off the second twig by their struggling prey then they are protected from falling by their silken lifeline. At night these spiders usually retreat to a silken [...] "puptent" [...] that they construct for their own protection and, when needed, as a place to deposit their eggs. They are frequently seen in sunlit areas on walls, tree trunks, and other such vertical surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]338-06 is a wildcat {{cartridge}} {{based on}} the [...]30-06. It allows heavier [...]338 caliber bullets to be used from the [...]30-06 non-belted case.

The [...]338-06 maintains much {{of the benefits of}} the [...]338 Magnum cartridge but has substantially less recoil, makes more efficient use of powder, and allows use of widely available [...]30-06 commercial and military cases.

A-Square adopted the caliber as the [...]338-06 A-Square in approximately 1998, and was approved by SAAMI as a standardized caliber. Weatherby offered factory rifles and ammunition, but has now dropped the rifles from its inventory.

[...] The 20/25 are relatively easy to maintain for someone with general automotive experience.

For many, part of the joy of owning a 20/25 is maintaining these magnificent cars. The Rolls-Royce car clubs sponsor popular on-line forums and regular in-person meetings for members to help each other on all type of repairs and restorations.
