5|$|Deafness: Sensorineural (nerve <b>deafness).</b>|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog carries {{recessive}} piebald alleles {{that produce}} {{white in the}} coat and skin and are linked to congenital hereditary <b>deafness,</b> though {{it is possible that}} there is a multi-gene cause for <b>deafness</b> in a dog with the piebald pigment genes. Around 2.4% of Cattle Dogs in one study were found to be deaf in both ears and 14.5% were deaf in at least one ear.|$|E
5|$|Some {{are prone}} to {{dislocation}} of the kneecaps, inherited eye diseases, <b>deafness</b> and Legg Perthes—a disease of the hip joints of small dog breeds. Prone to mast cell tumors.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a small}} {{incidence}} of other conditions, such as autoimmune diseases and <b>deafness</b> in Labradors, either congenitally or later in life.|$|E
5|$|Gil's mother, Betty, {{who became}} deaf {{as a result}} of the genetic {{disorder}} Otosclerosis, was responsible for his love of books. As a result of his mother's <b>deafness,</b> Gil became fluent in American Sign Language in order to be able to communicate with her.|$|E
5|$|Merle colored dogs {{may suffer}} from mild to severe <b>deafness,</b> {{increased}} intraocular pressure, ametropia, microphthalmia, and colobomas. Merle dogs born from {{parents who are}} also both merles may additionally suffer from abnormalities of the skeletal, cardiac and reproductive systems.|$|E
5|$|Other eye {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include cataracts in juveniles, corneal dystrophy, progressive retinal atrophy and posterior vitreous detachment. Non-eye breed related {{conditions which}} may affect a Parson are <b>deafness</b> and patella luxation. The average lifespan of a Parson Russell Terrier is between 14 and 15 years.|$|E
5|$|People may be {{released}} after assessment from hospital or emergency {{room to the}} care of a trusted person with instructions to return if they display worsening symptoms or those that might indicate an emergent condition such as: change in consciousness, convulsions, severe headache, extremity weakness, vomiting, new bleeding or <b>deafness</b> in either or both ears.|$|E
5|$|The {{onset of}} <b>deafness</b> forced Harrison {{to give up}} conducting. He had been closely {{associated}} with the Elgar Festival in Malvern, and his last appearance on the podium was at the final concert of the 1947 festival. He was a founder member and vice-president of the Elgar Society.|$|E
5|$|When Lazzell was fifteen, she {{enrolled}} in the West Virginia Conference Seminary (now West Virginia Wesleyan College) in Buckhannon. Probably sometime prior to her entering the Seminary she became partially deaf, although the exact origin of her condition is unclear. In 1894 she sought treatment from a Baltimore doctor who blamed her <b>deafness</b> on catarrh.|$|E
5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When hearing loss is a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss. When <b>deafness</b> is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had several}} health problems, {{including}} childhood tuberculous scrofula resulting in deep facial scarring, <b>deafness</b> {{in one ear}} and blindness in one eye, gout, testicular cancer, and a stroke in his final year that left him unable to speak; his autopsy indicated that he had pulmonary fibrosis along with cardiac failure probably due to hypertension, a condition then unknown. Johnson displayed signs consistent with several diagnoses, including depression and Tourette syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is similar to}} several syndromes that share its features. Brachydactyly of the distal phalanges, sensorineural <b>deafness</b> and pulmonary stenosis are common with Keutel syndrome. In Muenke syndrome, developmental delay, distal brachydactyly and sensorineural hearing loss are reported; features of Teunissen-Cremers syndrome include nasal aberrations and broadness of the thumbs and big toes, also with brachydactyly. Broad thumbs and big toes are primary characteristics of Rubinstein syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Regional {{versions}} of the show, featuring native hosts, have been produced in other countries. It was a big success in the United Kingdom (hosted by Kevin Duala), became part of pop culture in Korea, was syndicated in 120 countries, and was translated into 15 languages. In 2000, it {{became one of the}} first preschool shows to incorporate American Sign Language into its content, with between five and ten signs used consistently in each episode. Blue's Clues won an award from the Greater Los Angeles Agency on <b>Deafness</b> (GLAD) for promoting deaf awareness in the media.|$|E
5|$|Tactile ASL (TASL) is {{a variety}} of ASL used {{throughout}} the United States by and with the deaf-blind. It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome. This syndrome results in <b>deafness</b> from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often {{grow up in the}} Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of non-manual signing.|$|E
5|$|Tallon missed {{selection}} {{during the}} 195152 season due his increasingly error-prone glovework and {{a combination of}} health reasons including stomach ulcers and <b>deafness.</b> He did not play a first-class match {{because of lack of}} his fitness. In any case, Tallon had secretly been barred from selection by the Australian Board of Control for making unauthorised comments in the media; this fact was not revealed for half a century.|$|E
5|$|The breed has a {{reputation}} for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital <b>deafness,</b> patellar luxation, ataxia, myasthenia gravis, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{eleventh}} nocturne {{was written}} in memory of Noémi Lalo; her widower, Pierre Lalo, was a music critic and a friend and supporter of Fauré. Morrison suggests that its funereal effect of tolling bells may also reflect the composer's own state of anguish, with <b>deafness</b> encroaching. The melodic line is simple and restrained, and except for a passionate section near the end is generally quiet and elegiac.|$|E
5|$|The human ear can {{generally}} hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz (the audio range). Sounds {{outside this}} range are considered infrasound (below 20Hz) or ultrasound (above 20kHz) Although hearing requires an intact and functioning auditory {{portion of the}} central nervous system as well as a working ear, human <b>deafness</b> (extreme insensitivity to sound) most commonly occurs because of abnormalities of the inner ear, rather than in the nerves or tracts of the central auditory system.|$|E
5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are <b>deafness</b> and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Brain damage, {{or disease}} of the brain can {{manifest}} {{in a wide variety}} of ways. Traumatic brain injury, for example in contact sport, after a fall, or in traffic or work accidents, can be associated with both immediate and longer-term problems. Immediate problems that develop may include bleeding within the skull, compressing the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to a particular area, <b>deafness,</b> and concussion. In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, hydrocephalus, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{remained}} {{active and}} in good health right through his retirement despite the gradual onset of <b>deafness,</b> but {{the death of his}} wife Ethel in March 1967 took a deep toll on him. He died on 25 August 1967 at the age of 84. He was the last surviving member of Billy Hughes' Cabinet. His memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields and was widely attended, including by representatives of the Royal Family. His ashes were scattered over Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra. The Canberra suburb of Bruce, and the electoral Division of Bruce based in south-east Melbourne, were both named for him after his death.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's {{music has}} been {{described}} as linking the end of Romanticism with the modernism of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, Chopin was still composing, and by the time of Fauré's death, jazz and the atonal music of the Second Viennese School were being heard. The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which describes him as the most advanced composer of his generation in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing <b>deafness.</b> In contrast with the charm of his earlier music, his works from this period are sometimes elusive and withdrawn in character, and at other times turbulent and impassioned.|$|E
5|$|Incorrect {{figures are}} {{sometimes}} cited {{for the population}} of ASL speakers in the United States based on misunderstandings of known statistics. Demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of ASL use, since adults who become deaf late in life rarely use ASL in the home. This accounts for currently cited estimations which are greater than 500,000; such mistaken estimations can reach as high as 15,000,000. A 100,000-person lower bound has been cited for ASL users; {{the source of this}} figure is unclear, but it may be an estimate of prelingual <b>deafness,</b> which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing.|$|E
5|$|Luoyang, {{the region}} of his birthplace, was {{recovered}} by government forces {{in the winter of}} 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill-health (by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, <b>deafness</b> and general old age in addition to his previous ailments). They stayed in Kuizhou (in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing) {{at the entrance to the}} Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 766. This period was Du Fu's last great poetic flowering, and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense, late style.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and <b>deafness)</b> and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying intention. The ability to share gaze with another individual {{is an important}} skill in establishing reference. The ability to identify intention is important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development {{and the ability to}} take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The ability to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by <b>deafness,</b> blindness, and developmental disorders such as autism.|$|E
5|$|After Louise's death, {{and after}} bearing {{criticism}} of his war record from other Confederates for decades, Longstreet refuted most of their arguments in his memoirs entitled From Manassas to Appomattox, a labor of five years that was published in 1896. His final years were marked by poor health and partial <b>deafness.</b> In 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism {{and was unable to}} stand {{for more than a few}} minutes at a time. His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903. Cancer developed in his right eye, and in December he had X-ray therapy in Chicago to treat it. He contracted pneumonia and died in Gainesville on January 2, 1904, six days before his 83rd birthday. Longstreet's remains are buried in Alta Vista Cemetery. He outlived most of his detractors, and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Alice {{spent her}} {{childhood}} between Darmstadt, London, Jugenheim, and Malta (where her naval officer father was occasionally stationed). Her mother {{noticed that she}} was slow in learning to talk, and became concerned by her indistinct pronunciation. Eventually, {{she was diagnosed with}} congenital <b>deafness</b> after her grandmother identified the problem and took her to see an ear specialist. With encouragement from her mother, Alice learned to both lip-read and speak in English and German. Educated privately, she studied French, and later, after her engagement, she learned Greek. Her early years were spent in the company of her royal relatives, and she was a bridesmaid at the marriage of George, Duke of York (later King George V) and Mary of Teck in 1893. A few weeks before her sixteenth birthday she attended the funeral of Queen Victoria in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and shortly afterward she was confirmed in the Anglican faith.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital <b>deafness</b> related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|Erin Ryan and {{her colleagues}} {{performed}} a 2009 study {{on the effect of}} the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in Blue's Clues episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to <b>deafness</b> and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Tracy joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, at {{the time}} Hollywood's most prestigious studio. His career flourished {{with a series of}} hit films, and in 1937 and 1938 he won {{consecutive}} Oscars for Captains Courageous and Boys Town. By the 1940s, Tracy was one of the studio's top stars. In 1942, he appeared with Katharine Hepburn in Woman of the Year, beginning a popular partnership that produced nine movies over 25 years. Tracy left MGM in 1955, and continued to work regularly as a freelance star, despite an increasing weariness as he aged. His personal life was troubled, with a lifelong struggle against alcoholism and guilt over his son's <b>deafness.</b> Tracy became estranged from his wife in the 1930s, but never divorced, conducting a long-term relationship with Katharine Hepburn in private. Towards the end of his life, Tracy worked almost exclusively for director Stanley Kramer. It was for Kramer that he made his last film, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner in 1967, completed just 17 days before Tracy's death.|$|E
5|$|In March 1909, Riley was {{stricken}} {{a second}} time with Bell's palsy, and partial <b>deafness,</b> the symptoms only gradually eased {{over the course of}} the year. Riley was a difficult patient, and generally refused to take any medicine except the patent medicines he had sold in his earlier years; the medicines often worsened his conditions, but his doctors could not sway his opinion. On July 10, 1910 he suffered a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body. Hoping for a quick recovery, his family kept the news from the press until September. Riley found the loss of use of his writing hand the worst part of the stroke, which served only to further depress him. With his health so poor, he decided to work on a legacy by which to be remembered in Indianapolis. In 1911 he donated land and funds to build a new library on Pennsylvania Avenue. By 1913, with the aid of a cane, Riley began to recover his ability to walk. His inability to write, however, nearly ended his production of poems. George Ade worked with him from 1910 through 1916 to write his last five poems and several short autobiographical sketches as Riley dictated. His publisher continued recycling old works into new books, which remained in high demand.|$|E
25|$|A {{positive}} attitude towards <b>deafness</b> is typical in Deaf cultural groups. <b>Deafness</b> is not generally considered {{a condition that}} needs to be fixed.|$|E
25|$|Domestic horses often cope {{well with}} <b>deafness,</b> and deaf horses may go undiagnosed. Some deaf horses are more skittish than normal, {{while others are}} {{distinctly}} calmer. <b>Deafness</b> in horses can be diagnosed by {{brainstem auditory evoked potential}} (BAEP), which is minimally invasive and requires no sedation and minimal restraint. While blue eyes and a white face are often associated with <b>deafness</b> in other species, apron-faced, non-splash horses are not known to be deaf. Nor is the presence of one blue, one normal eye indicative of unilateral <b>deafness.</b> The case horse in Hardland's 2006 case study had one blue eye, while the other was parti-colored, but the horse was bilaterally deaf.|$|E
