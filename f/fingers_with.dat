5|$|It {{lived in}} what is now {{southern}} Germany in the Late Jurassic period around 150million years ago, when Europe was an archipelago in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the equator than it is now. Similar in shape to a European magpie, with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a raven, Archaeopteryx could grow to about 0.5metres (1.6ft) in length. Despite its small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, Archaeopteryx has more in common with other small Mesozoic dinosaurs than it does with modern birds. In particular, it shares the following features with the deinonychosaurs (dromaeosaurs and troodontids): jaws with sharp teeth, three <b>fingers</b> <b>with</b> claws, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes ("killing claw"), feathers (which suggest homeothermy), and various skeletal features. These features make Archaeopteryx a clear candidate for a transitional fossil between dinosaurs and birds, making it important in the study both of dinosaurs and of the origin of birds.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{skeleton}} of Majungasaurus closely resembles those of Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus, {{the only other}} abelisaurid genera for which complete skeletal material is known. Majungasaurus was bipedal, with a long tail to balance out the head and torso, putting {{the center of gravity}} over the hips. Although the cervical (neck) vertebrae had numerous cavities and excavations (pleurocoels) to reduce their weight, they were robust, with exaggerated muscle attachment sites and ribs that interlocked for strength. Ossified tendons attached to the cervical ribs, giving them a forked appearance, as seen in Carnotaurus. All of these features resulted in a very strong and muscular neck. Uniquely, the cervical ribs of Majungasaurus had long depressions along the sides for weight reduction. The humerus (upper arm bone) was short and curved, closely resembling those of Aucasaurus and Carnotaurus. Also like related dinosaurs, Majungasaurus had very short forelimbs with four extremely reduced digits, first reported with only two very short external fingers and no claws. The hand and finger bones of Majungasaurus, like other majungasaurines, lacked the characteristic pits and grooves where claws and tendons would normally attach, and its finger bones were fused together, indicating that the hand was immobile. In 2012, a better specimen was described, showing that the lower arm was robust, though short, and that the hand contained four metatarsals and four, probably inflexible and very reduced, <b>fingers,</b> <b>with</b> small claws on the second and third finger. The phalanx formula was 1-2-2-1-0.|$|E

At first it was dismissed as a freak accident, but after the conference championship, the truth came out: Fryar's wife, Jacqueline, had slashed him in a domestic incident after Fryar had knocked her down. It was a distraction that, many thought, epitomized the history of these Patriots – coming as it did in what was otherwise to that point the franchise's finest hour.|$|E

25|$|The scapulocoracoid, a bone {{that makes}} up the {{pectoral}} girdle, is large and broad. While abelisaurids have arms that are extremely reduced in size, Masiakasaurus and other noasaurids had longer forelimbs. The humerus is slender and {{the bones of the}} hand are relatively short. The related genus Noasaurus has a raptorial ungual which was originally interpreted as a sickle-like claw on the foot, but has more recently been considered a claw of the hand. The penultimate phalanx, a finger bone that immediately precedes the raptorial ungual in Noasaurus, is also known in Masiakasaurus and has a similar appearance. The enlarged ungual, however, is unknown in Masiakasaurus. The hand bore three large <b>fingers</b> <b>with</b> stout - but not particularly sharp - claws, and a highly reduced fourth finger.|$|E
25|$|No {{explicit}} {{regulations are}} expressed in the bible concerning the treatment of a corpse itself, although historic rabbinical sources saw an implication that the dead should be thoroughly washed per Ecclesiastes, as children are washed when born; according to Eliezer ben Joel HaLevi, a prominent rishon, argued that the corpse should be cleansed carefully, including the ears and <b>fingers,</b> <b>with</b> nails pared and hair combed, so that the corpse could be laid {{to rest in the}} manner that the person had visited the synagogue during life. Washing of corpses was not observed among the Jews living in Persian Babylon, for which they were criticised as dying in filth, without a candle and without a bath; at the time, the non-Jewish Persians were predominantly Zoroastrian, and consequently believed that dead bodies were inherently ritually unclean, and should be exposed to the elements in a Tower of Silence to avoid defiling the earth with them.|$|E

25|$|The king, Shalmaneser III, {{stands before}} four divine emblems: (1) the winged disk, {{the symbol of}} the god Ashur, or, as some hold, of Shamash; (2) the six-pointed star of Ishtar, goddess of the morning and evening star; (3) the crown of the sky-god Anu, in this {{instance}} with three horns, in profile; (4) the disk and crescent of the god Sin as the new and the full moon. On his collar the king wears as amulets (1) the fork, {{the symbol of the}} weather-god, Adad; (2) a segment of a circle, of uncertain meaning; (3) an eight-pointed star in a disk, here probably the symbol of Shamash, the sun-god; (4) a winged disk, again of the god Ashur. The gesture of the right hand has been much discussed and variously interpreted, either {{as the end of the}} action of throwing a kiss as an act of worship, or as resulting from cracking the <b>fingers</b> <b>with</b> the thumb, as a ritual act which is attributed to the Assyrians by later Greek writers, or as being simply a gesture of authority suitable to the king, with no reference to a particular religious significance. It seems fairly clear that the gesture is described in the phrase 'uban damiqti taraṣu', 'to stretch out a favourable finger', a blessing which corresponds to the reverse action, in which the index finger is not stretched out. There is a cuneiform inscription written across the face and base and around the sides of the stela.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Three {{dimensional}} solid-fluid interaction {{numerical analysis}} models {{of both the}} <b>finger</b> seal <b>with</b> herringbone-grooved pad and the <b>finger</b> seal <b>with</b> herringbone-grooved rotor were established in order to study the performance of hydrodynamic finger seal. The models investigated fluid radial under pad force and fluid leakage {{as a function of}} both the rotor speed and the high- to low-pressure differential. It was shown that the <b>finger</b> seal <b>with</b> herringbone-grooved structure in pad or in rotor could bring lift force under the finger pad so as to keep the finger seal in non-contacting status. For the two types of finger seal, their load carrying ability and fluid leakage varying with the pressure differential were almost same. In the same velocity of rotor surface, the load carrying capacity of the <b>finger</b> seal <b>with</b> herringbone- grooved rotor was greater and the leakage was less than that of the <b>finger</b> seal <b>with</b> herringbone-grooved pad respectively. With the conditions of rotor structure allowing, it is suggested to select the <b>finger</b> seal <b>with</b> herringbone-grooved rotor first for designing the hydrodynamic <b>finger</b> seal <b>with</b> herringbone-grooved structure...|$|R
40|$|Background: People with {{diabetes}} mellitus are instructed to clean their skin prior to self-monitoring of blood glucose {{to remove any}} dirt or food residue that might affect the reading. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers have become popular when soap and water are not available. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether a hand sanitizer is compatible with glucose meter testing and effective for the removal of exogenous glucose. Methods: We enrolled 34 nonfasting subjects [14 male/ 20 female, mean ages 45 (standard deviation, 9. 4) ] years, 2 with diagnosed diabetes/ 32 without known diabetes]. Laboratory personnel prepared four separate fingers on one hand of each subject by (1) cleaning the second <b>finger</b> <b>with</b> soap and water and towel drying (i. e., control finger), (2) cleaning the third <b>finger</b> <b>with</b> an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, (3) coating the fourth <b>finger</b> <b>with</b> cola and allowing it to air dry, and (4) coating the fifth <b>finger</b> <b>with</b> cola and then cleaning it with the instant hand sanitizer after the cola had dried. Finger sticks were performed on each prepared finger and blood glucose was measured. Several in vitro studies were also performed to investigate the effectiveness of the hand sanitizer for removal of exogenous glucose. ...|$|R
