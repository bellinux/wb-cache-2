50|$|Mobile DNA (<b>jumping</b> <b>gene)</b> {{technology}} uses retrotransposons and transposons for {{the production}} of knockout rat models. This platform technology meets all of the criteria for a successful gene knockout approach in mammals by permitting random mutagenesis directly in the germ cells (sperm and oocytes) of mammalian model organisms, including rats. Using this technology, genes are disrupted completely and in a stable manner, are knocked out at a high frequency, and are randomly disrupted throughout the entire genome. The genomic location of mutations can be easily mapped, creating a library of knockout rats for later use. Once the random knockout mutations are created, more refined mutations such as conditional mutations can be created by breeding knockout lines with rat lines expressing CRE recombinase in a tissue specific manner. Knock-ins can be produced by recombination mediated cassette exchange.|$|E

In Our study in the GA, some changes are made to search locally and globally by adding <b>jumping</b> <b>genes</b> operation. A typical flexible job shop model is considered for this research study. For that layout, five different example problems are formulated for purpose of evaluation.

The phenomenological flotation model developed by Mehrotra and Kapur (1974) is used for circuit optimization. Two different optimization problems are formulated and solved. The first optimization problem involves a single objective function, which uses available plant data to estimate the feed-characterizing parameters, i. e., the flotation rate constants, by minimizing the weighted sum-of-square errors between the computed and plant values. The second optimization problem involves two objective functions to obtain several simplified circuits. The number of non-linking streams and the overall recovery of the concentrate, i. e., the acid-grade product, are maximized simultaneously in this problem.

40|$|It was {{hypothesized}} by Barbara McClintock that Transposable Elements (TEs) can become activated by conditions that “shock” the genome (McClintock 1984). TEs, which are {{sometimes referred to}} as <b>Jumping</b> <b>Genes,</b> are segments of DNA that have the ability to copy themselves and move within the genome. TEs are found in all organisms, but they are usually kept in an inactive state by host defense mechanisms. We set out to determine if radiation will induce TE activity in the maize genome. The results may indicate the feasibility of growing crops in space, particularly whether the genome will be stable over multiple generations. In addition, the results may indicate the effects of increased radiation and climactic challenges on crop plants here on Earth. Maize (p 1 -wwB 54) seedlings were first irradiated by both UV and X-rays according to conditions similar to the Martian atmosphere. Currently, phenotypic data indicates that root, shoot, and leaf development are drastically affected by radiation ranging from 25 Gy to 250 Gy. The data also suggests that the stage of the seedling at the time of irradiation and the time of planting after irradiation are major factors in plant survival. Future plans include preparing and sequencing genomic DNA samples from both irradiated and control seedlings. The sequences will then undergo analysis by bioinformatic methods to identify new mutations caused directly by radiation and indirectly through the activation of TEs. References:McClintock, B. 1984.

It is recognized that the transposons (the <b>jumping</b> <b>genes)</b> facilitate the evolution of increasingly complex forms of life by providing the creative playground for the mutation where the latter could experiment with developing novel genetic structures without the risk of damaging the already existing, well-functioning genome. In this work we investigate the effect of a GT-inspired mechanism on the efficiency of genetic programming (GP) employed for coevolution of locomotion gaits and sensing of the simulated snake like robot (Snakebot). In the proposed approach, the task of coevolving the locomotion and the sensing morphology of Snakebot in a challenging environment is decomposed into two subtasks, implemented as two consecutive evolutionary stages. At first stage we employ GP to evolve a pool of simple, sensorless bots that are able to move fast in a smooth, open terrain. Then, during the second stage, we use these Snakebots to seed the initial population of the bots that are further subjected to coevolution of their locomotion control and sensing in a more challenging environment. For the second phase the seed is used as it is to create only part of a new individual, {{and the rest of the}} new individual’s genetic makeup is created by a mutant copy of the seed.

40|$|Specialization is {{ubiquitous}} in biological systems and its manifold mechanisms are active research topics. Although clearly adaptive, {{the way in}} which specialization of cells is realized remains incompletely understood as it requires the reshaping of a cell's genome to favor particular biological processes in the competition on a cell's functional capacity. Here, a self-specialization mechanism is identified as a possible biological role of <b>jumping</b> <b>genes,</b> in particular LINE- 1 retrotransposition. The mechanism is self-limiting and consistent with its evolutionary preservation despite its likely gene-breaking effects. The scenario we studied was the need for a cell to process a longer exposition to an extraordinary situation, for example continuous exposure to the nociceptive input or the intake of addictive drugs. Both situations may evolve toward chronification. The mechanism involves competition within a gene set in which a subset of genes cooperating in particular biological processes. The subset carries a piece of information, consisting of the LINE- 1 sequence, about the destruction of their functional competitor genes which are not involved in that process. During gene transcription, an active copy of LINE- 1 is co-transcribed. At a certain low probability, a subsequently transcribed and thus actually exposed gene can be rendered nonfunctional by LINE- 1 retrotransposition in a relevant gene part. As retrotransposition needs time it is unlikely that LINE- 1 retrotranspose into its own carrier gene. This reshapes the cell genome toward self-specializing of those biological processes that are carried out with a high number of LINE- 1 containing genes. Self-termination of the mechanism is achieved by allowing LINE- 1 to also occasionally jump into the coding region of itself, thus destroying the information about competitor destruction by successively decreasing the number of LINE- 1 until the mechanism ceases. Employing a computational functional genomics approach, we demonstrate the biological plausibility in functional genomic datasets of potentially chronifying situations and interpret our results in relation to a biological mechanism of self-specialization of complex systems in response to a persistent challenge as met in chronifying traits...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that we owe {{the discovery of}} mobile genetic elements to American scientist Barbara McClintock. However, others before her did indeed encounter transposons, but {{without being able to}} recognize them. The early work of maize geneticist Emerson (Emerson, 1917) put him ahead of his peers because he managed to understand what others failed to; how an unstable mutation responsible for stripes of dark red pigmentation on the kernels of corn behaves within the Mendelian paradigm. He realized that a certain inhibiting factor was affecting the pigmentation gene, but could not exactly describe what this factor could be. This was followed up by Marcus Rhoades (Rhoades, 1945) who found out that a stable null mutation on the A locus of maize could be converted to an unstable one if combined with a locus he named Dotted. It was this type of unstable mutation that Barbara McClintock managed to explain by predicting the existence of <b>jumping</b> <b>genes</b> or mobile genetic elements. While studying chromosome breakage in corn, she noticed the repeated loss of a fragment of chromosome 9, and termed this breakage site the Dissociation (Ds) locus. She further observed that another locus was essential for chromosome breakage activation, the Activator (Ac) locus, and that chromosome breakage was linked to frequency and timing of mutations leading to variegation of maize kernels. Her genetic experiments led to the realization that Ds was indeed moving to a new location on chromosome 9 and she named such an element “Controlling element”. Her “Controlling elements” were transposon insertions disrupting certain genes, causing the type of unstable mutation that Emerson and Rhoades were trying to explain.
