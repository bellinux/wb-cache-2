5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum <b>display</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remains, {{the body of}} Lindow Man has been {{objectified}} rather than treated with the respect due the dead.

5|$|ATC {{maintained}} normal {{two-way radio}} {{contact with the}} Embraer up until 15:51, when the last successful radio exchange with the Embraer was made on VHF frequency 125.05MHz with Brasilia Center. At that point the Embraer was just approaching the Brasilia VOR. The Embraer overflew the Brasilia VOR at 15:55, four minutes later, and proceeded northwest-bound along UZ6. At 16:02, seven minutes after crossing the Brasilia VOR, secondary radar contact was lost with the Embraer, thus stopping the <b>display</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Embraer's reported altitude (Mode C) on the controller's radar screen.|$|E

5|$|Before World WarII, all {{homes were}} {{required}} to display Hinomaru on national holidays. Since the war, the <b>display</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flag of Japan is mostly limited to buildings attached to national and local governments such as city halls; it is rarely seen at private homes or commercial buildings, but some people and companies have advocated displaying the flag on holidays. Although the government of Japan encourages citizens and residents to fly the Hinomaru during national holidays, they are not legally required to do so. Since the Emperor's 80th Birthday on December 23, 2002, the Kyushu Railway Company has displayed the Hinomaru at 330 stations.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{displays}} {{are made}} by insects including the praying mantises (Mantidae) and stick insects (Phasmatodea). While undisturbed, these insects are usually well camouflaged. When disturbed by a potential predator, they suddenly reveal their hind wings, which are brightly coloured. In mantises, the wing display is sometimes reinforced by showing brightly coloured front legs, and accompanied by a loud hissing sound created by stridulation. For example, the grasshopper Phymateus displays red and yellow areas on its hind wings; it is also aposematic, producing a distasteful secretion from its thorax. Similarly the threat <b>display</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walking stick phasmid (Peruphasma schultei) is not a bluff: the insect sprays defensive dolichodial-like monoterpene chemical compounds at attackers.|$|E
5|$|Detractors of {{the flag}} movement, {{including}} Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the Swaraj flag {{as a symbol of}} national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed public use {{of the flag}}, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the <b>display</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swaraj flag. The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become the symbol of the independence movement.|$|E

5|$|Japan has a {{comprehensive}} network of legislation for protecting, preserving, and classifying its cultural patrimony. The regard for physical and intangible properties and their protection {{is typical of}} Japanese preservation and restoration practices. Methods of protecting designated National Treasures include restrictions on alterations, transfer, and export, as well as financial support {{in the form of}} grants and tax reduction. The Agency for Cultural Affairs provides owners with advice on restoration, administration, and public <b>display</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> properties. These efforts are supplemented by laws that protect the built environment of designated structures and the necessary techniques for restoration of works.|$|E
5|$|Kates {{built the}} game to {{showcase}} his additron tube, a miniature version of the vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides Bertie before {{it was no longer}} useful. Bertie the Brain is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual <b>display</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display. Berties use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E
5|$|On 7 March 2015 The Veterans Charity {{unveiled}} a temporary monument at {{the crash site}} on the Green in Sutton Wick Lane. A Veterans Charity researcher working on a <b>display</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crash, {{to be placed in}} Blackburn Beverley at Fort Paull, visited the site {{a few weeks before the}} anniversary and noted a lack of a local memorial at the site. So through the Charity, a memorial was rapidly ordered and efforts to locate survivors and families of those involved were made. Invitations were sent to local branches of the Royal British Legion, RAF Association, RAF Police Association, RAF Police, Thames Valley Police PCSOs and the Air Training Corps. Despite very short notice about 100 people attended, including two RAF Police NCOs from RAF Benson.|$|E
