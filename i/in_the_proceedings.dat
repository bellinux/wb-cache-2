5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
40|$|The role {{of public}} {{prosecutor}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preparatory criminal <b>proceedings</b> <b>The</b> thesis on The role of public prosecutor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preparatory criminal <b>proceedings</b> attempts to comprehensively analyse {{the role and}} activities of <b>the</b> public prosecutor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>proceedings.</b> <b>The</b> public prosecutor is the significant subject and also <b>the</b> party <b>in</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>proceedings.</b> His role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>proceedings</b> is irreplaceable and {{he is able to}} fundamentally affect <b>the</b> preparatory criminal <b>proceedings</b> through his activities. It depends on him whether the accused will be bring to court or the case will be already terminated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preparatory criminal <b>proceedings.</b> <b>The</b> paper is dividend into four chapters. The first chapter outlines the historical development of <b>the</b> public accusation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Czech lands from the the beginning until the present. As the thesis deals with the role of public prosecutor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preparatory criminal <b>proceedings,</b> so <b>the</b> second chapter deals with <b>the</b> preparatory criminal <b>proceedings</b> and it describes its aim, kinds, periods and functions.

5|$|Alcoholic {{beverage}} and {{the process}} of fermentation: The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation and the consumption of alcoholic beverages was discovered in neolithic China dating from 7000–6600 BC. Examination and analysis of ancient pottery jars from the neolithic village of Jiahu in Henan province in northern China revealed fermented residue left behind by the alcoholic beverages they once contained. According to a study published <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Proceedings</b> of the National Academy of Sciences, chemical analysis of the residue revealed that the fermented drink was made from fruit, rice and honey. Elsewhere in the world, fermented beverages have been found dating from 6000 BC in Georgia, 3150 BC in ancient Egypt, 3000 BC in Babylon, 2000 BC in pre-Hispanic Mexico, and 1500 BC in Sudan.|$|E

5|$|Beginning with {{statehood}} in 1859, {{the court}} had just four justices, one for each judicial district in the state. The constitution created by the Oregon Constitutional Convention in 1857 called for these justices to serve as both circuit court judges and supreme court justices. This was set to remain until {{the population of the}} state reached 100,000 people. Each justice was assigned one district, and then all justices would gather at set intervals to confer on appeals, which would occur at least once per year and were authorized to meet more frequently if needed. On appeals, the justice who presided over the lower court case would not participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that the}} grounds were haunted, {{they decided to}} publish their {{findings}} in a book An Adventure (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did not take it seriously {{on the grounds of}} the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Proceedings</b> of the Society for Psychical Research suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to living}} in Seneca Falls, Stanton had become an admirer and friend of Lucretia Mott, the Quaker minister, feminist, and {{abolitionist}} whom she had met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England {{in the spring of}} 1840 while on her honeymoon. The two women became allies when the male delegates attending the convention voted that women should be denied participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings,</b> even if they, like Mott, had been nominated to serve as official delegates of their respective abolitionist societies. After considerable debate, the women were required to sit in a roped-off section hidden from the view of the men in attendance. They were soon joined by the prominent abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, who arrived after the vote had been taken and, in protest of the outcome, refused his seat, electing instead to sit with the women.|$|E
40|$|Resumé This thesis titled The Scope of <b>the</b> Prosecutor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Preliminary Criminal <b>Proceedings</b> {{presents}} a compact {{view on the}} prosecutor's role and activities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preliminary <b>proceedings.</b> At this stage, the prosecutor has a vital role and {{is regarded as the}} master of <b>the</b> preliminary <b>proceedings</b> (dominus litis), for he carries the ultimate responsibility for its results. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> court <b>proceedings,</b> where he is accorded the party status, the prosecutor represents <b>the</b> public prosecution. <b>In</b> relation to <b>the</b> police authorities, the prosecutor has a number of privileges that enable him to supervise the adherence of legality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preliminary <b>proceedings.</b> <b>The</b> work is divided into four main chapters. The first chapter discusses the legal base of prosecution as a body of public prosecution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>proceedings.</b> This chapter also characterizes the institute of external and internal supervision within the system of prosecution. The second chapter defines <b>the</b> preliminary <b>proceedings</b> as an obligatory, pre-trial part of every criminal proceeding. Furthermore, this chapter elaborates individual functions of <b>the</b> preliminary <b>proceedings,</b> including its forms and stages.

By the time Gould wrote The Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle with Darwin and three other zoologists in 1841, he had placed the Iago sparrow in the genus Passer, where it remains. The genus, among the sparrows of the Old World in the family Passeridae, also contains at least 20 other species, among them the house sparrow and Eurasian tree sparrow.|$|E
