Therefore, this work focuses on {{the potential of the}} water soluble part of pea, chickpea and lentil protein isolates under acidic emulsions (pH 3. 0) using a novel mild technique: premix membrane emulsification. Pea proteins (PP) and chickpea proteins (CP) lower the interfacial tension {{in the same way as}} whey protein isolate (WPI), which suggests that they could facilitate emulsion droplet formation similarly as WPI, while lentil proteins (LP) are slightly less effective. It is possible to make oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions with an average droplet diameter (d 4, 3) of ~ 5 μm after 5 cycles in the premix system. The droplet size distribution of the emulsions remained constant during one day of storage, indicating that legume proteins are able to form and kinetically stabilize O/W emulsions. CP and PP exhibited emulsifying properties comparable to those of WPI, whereas LP is slightly less efficient, therewith indicating the great potential and that pea and chickpea protein <b>isolates</b> <b>hold</b> as emulsifiers in acidic food formulations...|$|R

PCR reactions were performed to evaluate eight PCR-primer pairs, including a primer pair that targeted the T. vaginalis ferredoxin gene.

So, species of Acromyrmex have developed specific mechanisms to control the microclimate of the nest, creating thermic stability which allows them to live under extreme conditions of humidity and temperature (Quirán and Pilati [1998]). The workers can move the fungus gardens to the most appropriate areas in the nest and change the architecture which has an affect on the ventilation (O 2 -CO 2 exchange) (Kleineidam et al.

Ice-wedge formation causes the archetypal polygonal patterns seen in tundra across the Arctic landscape. Here we use field and remote sensing observations to document polygon succession due to ice-wedge degradation and trough development in ten Arctic localities over sub-decadal timescales. Initial thaw drains polygon centres and forms disconnected troughs that <b>hold</b> <b>isolated</b> ponds. Continued ice-wedge melting leads to increased trough connectivity and an overall draining of the landscape. We find that melting at the tops of ice wedges over recent decades and subsequent decimetre-scale ground subsidence is a widespread Arctic phenomenon. Although permafrost temperatures have been increasing gradually, we find that ice-wedge degradation is occurring on sub-decadal timescales. Our hydrological model simulations show that advanced ice-wedge degradation can significantly alter the water balance of lowland tundra by reducing inundation and increasing runoff, in particular due to changes in snow distribution as troughs form. We predict that ice-wedge degradation and the hydrological changes associated with the resulting differential ground subsidence will expand and amplify in rapidly warming permafrost regions...|$|R

Here, we evaluate {{the representation of}} the thermodynamics of slush and snow-ice formation in large-scale sea-ice models, using laboratory experiments (NaCl solutions poured into grated ice in an isolated container). Scaling analysis highlights latent heat as the main term of the energy budget. The temperature of the new sea ice immediately after flooding is found very close to the saltwater freezing point, whereas its bulk salinity is typically > 20 g/kg. Large-scale sea-ice models faithfully represent such physics, yet the uncertainty on the origin of flooding saltwater impacts the calculated new ice temperature, because of the different salinities of seawater and brine. The laboratory experiments also suggest a potential limitation to the existing physical representations of flooding: for brine fractions > 60 %, ice crystals start floating upon saltwater. Natural sea-ice observations suggest that the <b>isolated</b> system assumption <b>holds</b> for a few hours at most, after which rapid heat and salt exchanges mostly destroy the initial flooding signature on temperature and salinity.
