5|$|Although {{its origins}} are obscure, {{the site of}} the present ancient church has been used for Christian worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, {{probably}} by Saint Padarn, after whom it was named.

5|$|His {{antiquarian}} studies led Planché to take {{an interest}} in heraldry. He had published several papers on heraldic topics in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association before publishing in 1852 The Pursuivant of Arms, or, Heraldry founded upon facts. As indicated by the subtitle, Planché was concerned with verifiable facts, as opposed to the unfounded theories perpetuated by many earlier heraldic writers. In the view of eminent herald Sir Anthony Wagner, Planché rewrote the <b>early</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> heraldry.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{have to make}} {{considerable}} assumptions {{trying to}} reconstruct the full family tree because of extremely scarce written sources about the <b>early</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Lithuania. The matter is further complicated by the 16–17th century genealogies, most famously the Bychowiec Chronicle, that mixed legends and facts into one. The legends about Palemonids, a noble family from the Roman Empire who settled in Lithuania and {{gave rise to the}} Duchy, are quite popular and widespread in these genealogies. The real historical data comes from the Russian and Livonian chronicles, most important of these being the Hypatian Codex.|$|E
5|$|Many of the regnal {{dates of}} the East Anglian kings are {{considered}} unreliable, often being based upon computations. Some dates have presented particular problems for scholars: for instance, during the three-year-long period of apostasy {{that followed the}} murder of Eorpwald, {{when it is not}} known whether any king ruled the East Angles. The main source of information about the <b>early</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the kingdom's rulers is Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People.|$|E
