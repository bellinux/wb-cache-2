5000|$|However, in 1996 ROCAR {{signed a}} {{contract}} with RATB and Bucharest Local Council for Buses, therefore over 300 buses Rocar De Simon U412 were delivered between 1996 and 2002, and also renewed some manufacturing technologies, but the number of built vehicles was still to low, however after the moment when RATB hurt ROCAR some years before, by acquiring new DAF busses and some second hand busses, and later new Ikarus IK415T for trolleybuses. Trolleybuses were not any more from ROCAR, however a few ROCAR trolleybuses were delivered to RATB, 14 trolleybuses. However, the contract with RATB and Bucharest local Council did not improved the deteriorating situation of ROCAR of the mid to late '90s, because other public transport companies( [...] and other customers like The Army or <b>Interurban</b> <b>Transport</b> Operators) in Romania completely refused to buy its products (main reason stated by them being the low quality products, prices are to high, low availability due to low production capacities, outdated, and they were acquiring instead second hand vehicles mostly (except for The Army, which were buying GRIVBUS or other new vehicles). ROCAR was also affected by concurrence of two new Romanian manufacturers of busses, trolleybuses and light weight transport vehicles, the same profile of ROCAR : ASTRA BUS ARAD, a new Romanian bus and trolleybus manufacturer, under IRISBUS and Grivbus another new Romanian busand light weight transport vehicles manufacturer. They took some of ROCAR's customers, like RATB, Army, and some public transport operators as these two newer manufacturers were using newer technologies, manufacturing more actual vehicles, and with a better quality, and a higher capacity of production and lower prices. In 2001-2002, ROCAR {{signed a contract}} with Constanta Council for 100 Buses and 40 trolleybuses, but only 15 trolleybuses were delivered, 2 of them in half assemble state. Few buses were delivered to Constanta but were having major manufacturing deficiencies, therefore they were returned However Constanta Council paid for the undelivered buses. Massive second bus hand imports from west which continued in Romania even after 2000, and also contracts with ex soviet manufacturer MAZ and some other manufacturers ( [...] Irisbus, Isuzu, BMC) gradually sent ROCAR to lack of demand and finally to bankruptcy. Rocar, after 1990, also suffered from technology retard, using outdated technologies, manufacturing outdated products (some of them even 30 years !) in low capacity, and at high prices, thus leading ROCAR to huge losses and loss of employees. Although Rocar De Simon U412 was a fairly modern vehicle with EURO 2 engine and automatic transmission, and chopper in case of some trolleybuses it did not prove a very big success, as many other transport companies still preferred second hand buses/trolleybuses or other new buses/trolleybuses ( [...] MAN, Mercedes, MAZ, Ikarus, BMC, [...] ), accentuating the deteriorating situation of ROCAR. Rocar De Simon (E/U 412) remained in production until the factory went bankrupt. As a last attempt in their struggle, ROCAR was courted by SOLARIS BUS, for a partnership to assemble URBINO busses from Poland as CKD, but eventually cooperation between ROCAR and SOLARIS BUS failed, only one vehicle is supposed to be built (other said that only the badge ROCAR was attached to it, the bus was in fact made in Poland). However, in the past, many other well known manufacturers (like Scania, Daf, Renault, Volvo, Mercedes, even MAZ (they wanted a partnership with ROCAR in mid to late 2000, just like the one with De Simon, to assemble busses as CKD delivered by MAZ, models 103, 104, 105,107 were proposed)) wanted to buy ROCAR or wanted partnership with ROCAR for assembling busses, trolleybuses and light commercial vans, but eventually gave up, and after 2000, no company showed no interest. In Romania, ROCAR was the only bus and trolleybus manufacturer and small commercial vehicle, until ASTRA BUS ARAD and GRIVBUS appeared on the market. Rocar officially stopped production in early 2002 as there was no more demand for their products (however, production was restarted in the summer of 2002, but very few vehicles were built), exports were down, many workers left because they were unpaid for months, and by the late 2002 production fully ended and ROCAR went into bankruptcy, however not before last vehicles were delivered to companies which acquired them. Debts were at a very high level, so were the loses. In the early 2003, while ROCAR was in its last days of life they made some repairs and reconditioning to some old buses belonging to the army and some other bigger companies (like dacia), however no new demands were registered, and losses increased. In late 2003 and early 2004, the company was liquidated and radiated from the registry of commerce, ending 52 years of bus manufacturing in Romania. Its precursors are from now on, Grivbus and Astra Bus Arad. Some half assembled vehicles were sold to ( [...] or taken by) some customers together with spare parts and assembled by the customer, some other unassembled vehicles were sold as spare parts to customers which had previously acquired ROCAR products. Spare parts remained into the factory were also taken by companies which were operating ROCAR vehicles, probably as a debt, or by companies which were selling spare parts. It is rumored that some of these were sold by liquidators in order to recover some losses. Other old type vehicles remained unassembled in the factory were scrapped as they had no value, however many of their former customers were, by now, affording new modern vehicles.|$|E

We needed to work on a large dataset spanning different types of data, such as service provision, ridership, economic data, and geographical information. The size of the task warranted the effort to merge all those data into a single database and develop an analysis tool on purpose. Therefore we custom built a web-based visual analysis tool, using free web applications, including geo-referenced dynamic maps and allowing users to visualise and interact readily with the information in the database. This web GIS application was used to characterise public transport lines on the basis of combinations of indicators of interest (such as ridership, number of services and km produced by time unit), or on the basis of their characteristics (such as route overlaps, reference public administration, type of services, e. g. daily, for schoolchildren, market day only). Tables, charts and maps obtained from the web GIS were employed to compare the information we had with a set of criteria and identify instances of inefficiency or ineffectiveness of <b>interurban</b> public <b>transport</b> services...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} work, thresholds {{have been}} introduced to describe situations where the consumer is indifferent between any two alternatives. Krishnan (Krishnan, K. S. 1977. Incorporating thresholds of indifference in probabilistic choice models. Management Sci. 23 (July) 1224 [...] 1233.) formalised thresholds as minimum perceivable differences between the utilities of the alternatives compared and incorporated such thresholds into the binary logit model. The present paper provides an extension and application of the theory to situations where the decision maker is confronted with more than two alternatives. In such situations thresholds can lead to systematic and predictable intransitivity of indifference, violating a basic postulate of utility theory. Explicit probabilities of transitive and intransitive choices are derived {{within the framework of}} the multinomial logit model and the stochastic consumer theory associated with this model. The empirical applicability and managerial usefulness of the proposed theory is illustrated using a transportation example with three alternatives. The data employed reflect actual travellers' use of <b>interurban</b> <b>transport</b> modes in Greece. Parameters are estimated by a maximum-likelihood technique, based on a gradient search method.

40|$|Workshop AThe {{market of}} {{interurban}} mobility to rural areas {{is one of}} the most challenging for Public Transport (PT). In Portugal it has been quite difficult for Public Transportation to establish itself in this market as an effective alternative to the use of private cars. Two of the main reasons for this are the low accessibility of long distance railway services and urban sprawl in many Portuguese regions. Integration facilitates the use of several services of the transport chain and facilitates a more efficient resource allocation on the supply side of the system. By making local distribution possible in connection with long distance services, even in low demand areas, integration may foster a higher patronage of PT and its competitiveness compared to private car. This paper presents the study of five short-range road transport services in connection to the railway network in the Médio Tejo region, including the key elements that are to be considered on their design. The research identified the possible interested agents and made an account of their related costs and benefits. The conclusion is that these services can be commercially interesting and may bring considerable increase in the market share of PT.

40|$|Like all EU countries, Spain should {{design and}} promote {{a fair and}} {{homogeneous}} generalized road pricing scheme. Tolls should vary according to infrastructure damage, degree of congestion, risk of accident, and environmental nuisances. An initial study (Spanish road pricing model project: META) of <b>interurban</b> <b>transport</b> pricing {{has been carried out}} at national level, considering the valuation of the internal and external costs to define efficient road pricing schemes of different type of roads and appropriate price levels in different interurban road contexts, shifting from a toll for financing infrastructure construction to a toll for recovering social costs. The META project has developed an easy-to-apply pricing methodology, based on a bottom-up approach. The main variable is the AADT -daily flow- applied to accurately estimate generalized road transport costs for each kind of vehicles and each type of road. Based on the current Spanish road network, the META model estimates all social costs: internal costs (fuel, vehicle maintenance, labor, insurance and tax) and external costs (infrastructure, congestion, accident and environmental nuisances). Computed for the 13, 156 Km of interurban highways network, the model calculates the costs for each vehicle type (Car, HGV, LGV and bus) and for each road network section following the interurban road characteristics (AADT, capacity and traffic composition for each section of highway network). The two main results of META model for costs in terms of policy implications suggest to moderate the construction of new interurban road infrastructures in Spain and to analyze congestion before to built new metropolitan roads. If we decide for a road pricing scheme based on the environmental, accident and infrastructure costs, because of the reduced number of the congestion situation, we can use the average external costs that are very similar to the marginal external costs...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} the art in {{appraisal}} of transport infrastructure (particularly for developed countries) is moving towards inclusivity of a set of wider impacts than has traditionally been the case. In appraisal frameworks generally Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), features as either an alternative to, or complementary with, Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) particularly when assessing a wider set of distributional and other impacts. In that respect it goes some way towards addressing an identified weakness in conventional CBA. This paper proposes a new method to incorporate the wider impacts into the appraisal framework (SUMINI) based upon a composite indicator and MCA. The method is illustrated for a particular example of the wider set of impacts, i. e. equity, through the ex-post assessment of two large EU transport infrastructure (TEN-T) case studies. The results suggest that SUMINI assesses equity impacts well and the case studies highlight the flexibility of the approach in reflecting different policy or project objectives. The research concludes that this method should not be viewed as being in competition with traditional CBA, but that it could be an easily adopted and complementary approach. The value in the research is in providing a new and significant methodological advance to the historically difficult question of how to evaluate equity and other wider impacts. The research is of strong international significance due to the publication of the TEN-Ts review by the European Commission, as well as the transnational nature of large scale <b>interurban</b> <b>transport</b> schemes, the involvement of national and transnational stakeholder groups in the approval and funding of those schemes, the large numbers of population potentially subject to equity and other wider impacts and the degree of variation in the regional objectives and priorities for transport decision makers...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate how much <b>interurban</b> passenger <b>transport</b> modes internalize the external costs they produce in order to calculate the efficient charge that the users would have to pay. This analysis is relevant since it affects the competitiveness of the different transport modes in the corridor. For this research the case study of the Madrid– Seville corridor in Spain has been chosen since several transport modes compete in this origin-destination pair. The research carries out a balance between the marginal external costs per user produced by each transportation mode and the charges that the users currently pay. The gap between the social marginal cost and the fare paid by the users will give us the extra–charge per passenger that each transportation mode would have to pay to internalize the external cost they produce. We found that that, unlike what many people think, the rail mode does not internalize all the external cost it produces whereas the road modes do it. This happens because even though the road modes pollute more, they also pay much more due to large discriminatory fuel taxes...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{planning}} is usually based on models' forecasts, but {{the reliability of}} their outputs depends {{so much on the}} quality of input-data they are fed with. Discrete-choice models are used to characterise travellers' behaviour in choosing their transport mode. Their calibration process is usually based on data stemming from household survey campaigns. However, the modelling in multimodal and intermodal transport on an interurban level is far more complicated and costly than {{in the case of an}} urban area. An alternative way to reduce costs is achieved by designing a choice-based sampling strategy where household surveys are replaced by specific surveys for each transport mode. This strategy generates a non-random sample that has to be treated correctly during the estimation process. In principle, the sample does not represent population market quotas for each different transport option. Moreover, as a result of both physical and functional constraints, the survey period cannot cover all origin-destination pairs (O-D pairs) in an optimal way and, consequently, the above-mentioned bias also affects each different individual O-D pair or, at least, group of pairs. In order to overcome this problem, this study presents a new procedure derived from the introduction of maximum likelihood estimators. These estimators assume the original mode options in terms of population quotas and in terms of O-D groups of pairs. The procedure is based on the optimisation of an objective-function to correct the above-mentioned bias in a way similar to the estimators of samples based on different choice options. The method named DWELT estimates the parameters corresponding to each explanatory variable using mode shares for each O-D pair or group of pairs. DWELT has been successfully validated in the case study of the Madrid-Barcelona interurban corridor in Spain. This result allows to achieve a more flexible cheaper survey procedure for <b>interurban</b> <b>transport</b> planning activities. Therefore transport policy strategies could be better designed and tested with lower costs. ...|$|E
40|$|Chile is {{a lightly}} {{populated}} country of 15 million that has undergone large economic transformations. Over the past 25 years, {{the economy has}} evolved from a slow-growing state-directed economy into a fast growing, market-oriented economy. Its South American neighbors are imitating this transformation. The changes have been especially great in the transport sector, {{with the private sector}} taking over many traditional public sector activities. This report addresses the implications of Chile's economic growth on transportation, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental impacts [...] Both urban and <b>interurban</b> <b>transport</b> are included. Chile's transport sector is experiencing rapid growth, especially in Santiago. Between 1985 and 1998, the economy increased 2. 5 fold (7. 4 % per year) and the transport sector more than 3. 5 fold (over 10 % per year). Public transport continues to lose market share. Between 1977 and 1991, cars increased their share of passenger travel by more than 60 %, while the bus share fell 27 %. These shifts are motivated by the strong urbanization process, with over 85 % of the population now living in cities; and strong growth in car ownership, with one in ten persons now owning a car. Cars now account for 26 percent of travel within cities (measured as passenger-kilometers) and 41 percent between cities. Transport consumes almost 40 % of energy sector emissions and is responsible for about 28 % GHG emissionsin in Chile. Of the total GHG emissions from transport, 45 % is from cars and taxis, 24 % from trucks, 14 % from ships, 10 % from planes, 9. 5 % from buses, and nearly zero from trains. Passenger transport accounts for about 2 / 3 of transportation's greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), while about 1 / 3 is from freight; and <b>interurban</b> <b>transport</b> accounts for over half of total GHG emissions. Chile's policymakers, both at the national and sectoral levels, have largely ignored the environmental consequences of rapid development; a policy of "grow first, clean up later" was pursued until 1990. The lack of interest in GHG emission reductions stems from this growth- oriented thinking, as well as a realization that Chile's impact on greenhouse gases is small compared to major industrial nations. With only 15 million people each using on average less than 1 / 6 as much energy as each US resident, and with extensive carbon-consuming biotic resources, including vast forests, offsettinjg its anthropocentric production of CO 2, its relative impact on global climate change is small. Thus while sympathetic to global warming issues, Chile is not likely to view its contribution as significant and global warming is not likely to motivate policy action. But worsening pollution and traffic congestion have placed motor vehicles at the center of policy debates over its development path. Thus, even though global warming is not a priority issue for the nation, actions directed at resolving transportation and air pollution problems will have the side effect of slowing greenhouse gas emissions growth. We develop high ("business-as-usual") and low scenarios for greenhouse gases for the next two decades. The scenarios are based upon interviews with experts and policymakers, and extensive analysis of transport and energy data gathered {{from a wide range of}} Chilean sources. In the next twenty years, in the "business-as-usual scenario," we assume strong continued economic growth (5. 8 % annual GDP growth) and no strong actions taken to curb environmental problems. The result is a doubling of energy consumption by the transport sector, and more than a doubling of greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger-related energy use and greenhouse gases increase faster than freight-related energy use and emissions, resulting in passenger transport increasing its share of transport greenhouse gas emissions from 70 % to 80 % over the 20 years In an alternative "low emissions" scenario, changes include policies to improve and enhance public transport, and to introduce cleaner and more efficient vehicles. The net effect is a 34 % increase in greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in 38 % fewer emissions than in the high scenario. ...|$|E

Firstly, it sets out the different variables used to characterise the progress of vehicles along a thoroughfare, and secondly the fundamental relationships between some of these variables. By way of illustration, this is followed by a number of simple calculations for estimating the time taken to get through a traffic jam. The next section looks at the concepts of cumulative flows and journey times, whilst the last chapter deals with the problem of interconnected networks and calculations relating to spatio-temporal changes in congestion. Finally, {{there are a number of}} appendices, with a series of exercises and suggested answers, a French-English glossary and a bibliography. This publication is aimed primarily at professionals dealing with the problems of congestion, whether as operators of urban, suburban or <b>interurban</b> <b>transport</b> networks, or heading up research into the design of new infrastructure or improving the operation of existing infrastructure. It may also be of interest to undergraduate and Masters students, particularly those studying engineering. Le niveau éleÎ de la demande de trafic, le nombre important d'acteurs concernés, ainsi que le maillage des réseaux viaires, contribuent à faire du trafic routier un domaine d'études complexe. La congestion des réseaux est un phénomène de plus en plus courant, et directement perceptible par le grand public, car elle est subie par de nombreux usagers. C'est pourquoi, depuis une cinquantaine d'années, des théoriciens du trafic cherchent à mieux comprendre et à quantifier les mécanismes à l'oeuvre. Le présent ouvrage tente de faire le point, de manière accessible, sur le sujet. Il présente en premier lieu les différentes variables qui permettent de caractériser la progression des Îhicules sur une voie, puis la relation fondamentale qui permet de relier certaines de ces variables. À titre d'illustration, quelques calculs simples, permettant d'estimer le temps de traversée d'un bouchon, sont ensuite fournis. Les notions de débits cumulés et de temps de parcours sont ensuite abordées. La problématique des réseaux maillés, ainsi que les calculs d'évolution spatio-temporelle de la congestion terminent l'ouvrage, qui est par ailleurs complété par plusieurs annexes (série d'exercices avec leurs corrigés, glossaire français -anglais et bibliographie) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} focused on {{improving}} the observation and knowledge of <b>interurban</b> road freight <b>transport.</b> It investigates some directions {{for the improvement of}} a classic French road-side survey protocol, usually employed to gather origin-destination data. To do that, new questions are added to the classic roadside survey form, and the enhanced survey form is tested in the frame of two surveys. The new questions concern currently unobserved variables: the volume occupied by the freight in vehicles; the organizations (double crew, relays) set by motor carriers; the existence of specific logistic imperatives; and the breaks drivers have to take. The questions about the volume constraint and the organizations of carriers prove to be the most informative ones; as such, these two questions are two promising directions for improving French roadside surveys. The questions about specific logistic imperatives and about breaks prove less fruitful...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose : The {{focus of}} this paper is to enhance our {{observation}} and knowledge of <b>interurban</b> road freight <b>transport.</b> It explores some possibilities for improving roadside freight surveys, usually used to gather origin-destination data. Methodology : To achieve this, new questions are added to a standard roadside survey form, and the enhanced survey form is tested through two surveys. The new questions relate to currently unobserved variables: the vehicle volume occupied by freight; the method of organisation (double crew, relays) used by the carriers; the existence of speci c logistical imperatives; and drivers' compulsory breaks. Results : The questions on volume constraint and carrier organisation prove to be the most informative. These two questions are thus two promising areas for improvement in roadside freight surveys. The questions about speci c logistical imperatives and driver breaks prove less fruitful. Conclusion : The paper concludes that it is possible, through minor modi cations in data collection protocols, to signi cantly enhance observation quality in road freight transport activity...|$|R
40|$|An {{econometric model}} of air {{pollution}} for an intraurban location (the Chicago area) is constructed and estimated. The model treats employment and population as simultaneously determined. Exogenous variables are selected to represent transportation infrastructure investments resulting primarily from federal and state decisions. The exogenous variables account for the relative services provided by highways, commuter railroads, rail rapid transit, waterways, and airports. The employment location equations appear to be considerably more successful than those in previous studies. These equations indicate that waterway availability constrains the locational options of most major industrial air polluters; that highway accessibility is a more influential factor in industrial than services location choices; that rail rapid transit accessibility {{is more important to}} services than industrial locations; and that major airports attract light industrial development. The success of the employment location equations reflects the importance of disaggregating intraurban modes of transport and of adding to urban location models the local effects of <b>interurban</b> modes of <b>transport</b> such as water and air...|$|R
