The topics {{in the survey}} were among others if firms been through significant organizational change, how the firm had developed its human resources, and what were the motives for organizational change. Our analysis shows that more intense competition is a primary driving force behind organisational change and technical innovation. Firms are divided into three groups (the C-firms, the A-firms and the S-firms), according to how fare the intensity of competition had changed in recent years. The propensity to change and adapt is much higher among the firms that have experienced the strongest rise in competition (the C-firms).

40|$|Summary The {{topic of}} this paper is the {{connections}} between on one hand the quality of caring work {{and on the other hand}} the influence of the participants (workers, leaders, clients) on this work. The choice of theory and methods to analyze is motivated by the increasing problems with hostile mental work environment and burnout among the employees in the health system. By using the concepts of critical psychology the institutional conditions for producing quality in caring work are discussed, along with the conditions’ significance for the employees’ possibilities to influence the work, and the ways different groups of professionals (and different persons) deal with these conditions. It is tried to bring to light, that different participants in the community of practice have different interests, motivation and engagement in participating, because the work and the results of it have different meanings and significance for each and everyone and offers different possibilities of action, dependant of personal perspective and position in the context. In the leading management strategy <b>Human</b> <b>Ressource</b> Management the value of the employees’ subjectivity in the work is put on the agenda. In this paper it is discussed how we can understand employee-subjectivity - staff-employees as well as manager-employees – and it is argued that it is a precondition for developing the quality of the work, that all subjective perspectives are included in solving problems in the work, employees’ and managers’ as well as the perspectives of the users of the caring work...|$|R

For the practical part was chosen Porsche České Budějovice company which ranks to the most important dealers in the automotive industry in South Bohemia thanks to the professional attitude of its staff and excellent facilities. The practical part {{is based on a}} managed interview with the top manager of the selected company to desribe the human resource management from his own perspective. Further an analysis of the work organization in a selected department will be realized {{to be able to make}} a suggestion for its efficiency improvement. At last a survey between the employees will be carried out to analyze staff satisfaction with the motivational program. The aim is to find out the relevant motivational factors in compliance with the staff preferences. The top management considers HRM positively especially in case of education. In some aspects the management admits also weaknesses. Firstly, employee evaluation must be mentioned because it is realized only at the level of the middle management. An objective evaluation of all employees could be used to reward and motivate them to higher performance. The job evaluation is closely linked with exploration of work per-formance. The analysis of work organization revealed that its staff spends a significant part of the work time with paper work. Therefore I suggest to recruit a new employee who would make them possible to concentrate on customer care. A pay for the success-ful "mystery shopping" could motivate the sales staff as well as complete a fair reward system. Secondly a further weakness, an inflexible internal communication can be eli-minated through an effective use of available communication tools. Based on data from the survey the staff expressed their interest in new elements of the motivational pro-gram: a further week of vacation, contributions to pension insurance, new leisure activi-ties like squash. From my point of view, the motivational program is varied and stable offering a guarantee to the staff as well as potential for staff satisfaction improvement...|$|R

40|$|La gestion des {{ressources}} humaines n'est ni une science, ni {{un ensemble}} de techniques mais un art: l'art de mobiliser des individus à la réalisation d'un objectif commun. Pourtant, la grande majorité des activités reliés à la gestion des ressources humaines ne tiennent pas toujours compte de la nature et des caractéristiques des individus. L'objet de cet article est de proposer une typologie des styles de gestion qui remet en cause la façon traditionnelle d'aborder la gestion des personnes et la productivité organisationnelle. This article proposes a typology {{of the management}} styles which bring to light traditional methods of personnel management and organizational productivity. Up to now, the majority of management Systems have been explored {{from the perspective of}} the ideal or perfect management prototype. This model doesn't exist. The exageration of the «rationalisation» causes us to loose sight of the human being as a whole. The fact is that each person acts in a manner that permits them to use their abilities and strenghts to the maximum in the pursuit of their objectives. The identification of thèse strengths is a junction of two major components: - the preference between «rational» and «intuitive» thinking as a method of environmental perception;- the preference between «reflexion» and «action» as a method of environmental control. The integration of these two components allows the identification of four styles of management: 1. the «specialist» who plans the achievement of concrete results based on his analysis; 2. the «organizer» who coordinates a multitude of operational activities based on his energy and a will-power; 3. the «strategist» who conciliates contradictory interests and succeeds in establishing a consensus based on his ability to influence others; 4. the «adviser» who brings forth innovative ideas taking into account the issues in a situation based on his ability to evaluate the situation. The management styles concept is not to categorize individuals; it is more a schematization of the dynamic process of individuals and their reactions vis-à-vis the environment. Basically, each individual possesses the abilities of each of these styles with one dominating, giving him the maximum assurance and security. The respect of this dominant style constitutes the most significant factor in the Personal development of the manager. Although the dominant style of an individual is fairly constant, this is not to say that the individual's development is static. According to their experiences and motivation, each one can master abilities in one or more styles. In short, the individual's efficiency and productivity depend largely upon the respect and integration of their dominant style, and it must be the same at the organizational level. To facilitate the managers development, many organizations offer training programs. Most of theses attempt to correct the manager's weaknesses while adopting desirable management behavior, so that the candidates perform better within the established System. Rather than pursuing the emphasis on the weaknesses, it appears to be more important to concentrate on their strengths, thereby optimizing the impact. Regarding the selection process, many organizations have opted for assessment centers. Others use more conventional methods (i. e. interviews, psychometric tests). However, common in these two approaches is the absence of an integrated vision and the dynamics of the candidates. Up to now, the manager has been seen as a collection of behavioral characteristics, whereas now he is seen as more complex, integrated and human. A new approach in evaluation techniques must focus on the behavioral inter-relations of each individual. This is the same for the process of performance evaluation where the superior should be able to recognize the specifie contributions of each of his collaborators. He can thereby identify with them the means to optimize the impact of their style in the goal of increasing the productivity of the unit. As regards organizational development, <b>human</b> <b>ressource</b> managers should seek to distance themselves from traditional roles and advance their approaches by mobilizing the intelligence of each employee. Between the standardization brought by collective agreements, and the human relations approach that puts the emphasis on individual development, there exists some approaches that assure the equilibrium between the organization (production) and the individual (self-realization). Certain organizations have offered their people a philosophy of management in which the client is the key element. This philosophy attempts to re-establish the link between the personal contribution of each employee and the result (goods or services) expected by the client. It is curious that at a time when we talk about «robotisation», we must return to basics and consider how individuals think and act and how they are motivated. Above all, we must remember that each individual is different...|$|R
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK) liberates type 1 diabetics with (pre) terminal {{renal failure}} (end stage renal failure grade IV or V) from application of exogenous insulin and dialysis. Compared to type 1 diabetics who remain on dialysis successfully transplanted SPK patients show a considerable increase in life quality, a prevention of further secondary diabetical and uremic complications {{as well as}} a dramatically improved long-term survival. Based on these facts the SPK is considered to be the treatment of choice for (pre) terminal type 1 diabetics. For the treatment of SPK patients, monitoring of the function of the pancreas transplant is of particular interest. For that reason this paper examines the question whether the insulin sensitivity of patients changes before and after SPK. This issue was pursued further based on the euglycemic-hyperinsulemic clamp test in the Transplant Center - Charité, Campus Virchow-Klinikum. Because of different immunosuppressive regimens these ten patients were subdivided in two groups. Four patients received a calcineurin inhibitor (Tacrolimus/Cyclosporine A), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisolone (Group PRED). The remaining six patients exclusively received Tacrolimus and MMF (Group TM). In Group PRED no clear difference of insulin sensitivity could be detected pre and post SPK. On a closer look at individual patients, a slight deterioration of insulin sensitivity after SPK could be noticed with patients who received 5 mg prednisolone versus 2, 5 mg. Already minor prednisolone-doses seem to affect insulin sensitivity in a negative way depending on dosage. In Group TM five of the six patients showed an improvement of their insulin sensitivity after SPK. Despite the low number of patients it appeared that patients with steroid free and low-dosed Tacrolimus-therapy benefited notably from this therapeutic regimen regarding their peripheral insulin sensitivity. Thus the probability of a post transplantation diabetes caused by increased insulin resistance seems to be reduced in Group TM. The euglycemic-hyperinsulemic clamp test was part of the clinic's standard procedure for the evaluation and postoperative monitoring of all successfully transplanted SPK patients in order to detect malfunctions of the glucose homeostasis. Considering the large input of time, <b>human</b> and financial <b>ressources</b> and the limited clinical relevance, the test was taken out of the routine evaluation and follow up procedure, particularly as it has been possible to develop a more practicable algorithm (up to biopsy of the pancreas transplant) for clarification of malfunctions of glucose homeostasis after SPK) ...|$|R

The ultimate objective of this work is to bring assistance to the technical services and bringade forces in terms of accessibility by providing itineraries with respect to rescue operations and the evacuation of people and goods.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the gender}} earnings gap in Sweden at career entry, {{for individuals with}} comparable educational profile. There are many studies on this topic. Usually, researchers are focusing their attention {{on the evolution of}} this gap through individuals’ career. Our paper concentrates only on individual’s career entry, to exclude work experience as an explanatory factor. By studying six different educational fields we can have a precise image of the use of <b>human</b> <b>ressources</b> in the economy. An empirical analysis has been conducted using the method of OLS on a restricted data sample concerning graduates, having accomplished at least two years of university education. The result showed that, even at career entry, the raw gender earnings gap is of 20, 2 %. After controlling for fields of studies and occupations, the gap is reduced to 15, 4 %. This gap fluctuates among different fields of education, depending on the society’s perception of these fields. We distinguish male-dominated (i. e. Engineering and manufacturing), female-dominated (i. e. Teaching methods and teacher education) and gender-neutral (i. e. Social sciences, law, commerce and administration) educational fields. Our results depict some large gender earnings gap within male-dominated fields of study – women earn on average 20 % less than their male counterparts when studying Engineering and manufacturing – and rather small ones within female-dominated and gender-neutral fields of study but due to statistical insignificance of the gender dummy coefficients we cannot make a conclusion concerning these fields...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} {{of the human}} capital stock {{plays a key role}} to explain the economic performance across regions. However, empirical evidence for this claim has been not very convincing, probably due to low quality of the data. This paper provides a robustness analysis of alternative human capital measures available for EU regions. Examining the spatial dimension can offer new insights. Most strikingly, the amount of information is tremendously enlarged. Studies based on country level data are based on heterogeneous economies to obtain a high number of observations. The heterogeneity is not fully captured by fixed effects. As the EU or at least {{the old and the new}} member states are more homogeneous geographical areas, the quality of the results should be enhanced. In addition to univariate measures of human capital, composite indicators are discussed. To examine the robustness of the results, different aggregation methods are considered. The reliability of alternative indicators is explored by the Krueger and Lindahl (2001) approach. Indicators based on wage regressions are also presented, see Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1997) and Gershuny and Kun (2002). Due to data availability, the latter analysis is carried out for only for German regions. The analysis shows a significant impact of construction techniques on the quality of indicators. While composite indicators and labour income measures point to the same direction, their correlation is not very high. Moreover, popular indicators should be applied with caution.

By building joint ventures companies form strategic alliances that help them to enter new economic markets and further their business goals in a cooperative effort without loosing own independence. Upon building a joint venture company, two or more ”parent ” companies agree to share capital, technology, <b>human</b> <b>ressources,</b> risks and rewards in a formation of a new entity under shared control by a ”board of directors”, which consists of representatives of ”parent ” companies. The establishment of such shared control is tricky and relies generally on the ”trust, but verify ” relationship, i. e., companies trust the information they receive from prospective partners, but it is a good business practice to verify the facts. In this paper we focus on the issue of the shared financial control in a joint venture. We consider the mostly preferred form of the control where every member of the board is able to issue payment orders on behalf of the joint venture, but at the same time representatives of other companies, should be able to monitor the accounting to achieve fairness in the spending of shared funds. For this form of the shared control we propose a new secure group-oriented signature scheme, called a democratic group signature scheme, which results from the modification of the standard notion of group signatures by eliminating the role of the group manager. We also show that existing schemes, e. g., ring and group signatures, cannot be used to realize the required shared control based on the ”trust, but verify ” relationship...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWith {{the present}} and future surveys for {{exoplanet}} detection by transit photometry (K 2, TESS and PLATO), one of the biggest challenge of the next decade for the exoplanet community will be to maximise the scientific return from this huge amount of data. These missions will give us hundreds of thousands of light-curves, amongst which approximatively 10 % will exhibit transit signals. Without any vetting, around 90 % of them will be false positive, {{in the sense that they}} will not correspond to an exoplanet transiting the target star. So a key step will be to focus the follow-up ressources (in terms of telescope time, computer time and <b>human</b> <b>ressources)</b> one the planetary transit. In order address this problematic, we developed a software called BART which stands for Bayesian Analysis for the Ranking of Transits. When most of the existing ranking tools rely on a set of individual criteria, our tool performs a fully coherent analysis combining the most used criteria and taking into account their correlations. It is automated and relies on bayesian model comparison, bayesian parameter inference and Monte Carlo Markov Chain exploration technique. It produces a ranked list of transits where those which are the most likely to be due to planets (around the target stars) have a higher rank allowing to focus the follow-up on targets with the highest scientific merit. But it also gives the most probable scenario for the transits and provides an estimate of the parameters for each possible scenarios. This is a priceless information since it allows to estimate the precision required for a given follow-up observation. Thus it will allow to optimize the follow-up strategy and direct the observations. This tool has been originally developed and tested with CoRoT and I will present the results obtained on the CoRoT transit list. I will also show the results recently obtained with K 2 data...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{railway traffic}} {{supervision}} {{systems are not}} considered as safety critical (basic safety constraints being ensured by other sub-systems). By taking a closer look, we can notice that these systems are able to prove their efficiency in safety management by offering critical information to the supervisor confronted with a crisis situation {{in order to help}} him to take the right decisions that lead to reduce considerably the impact and the severity of an accident. Taking into account these scenarios in the design in order to contribute to enhance the global safety level is therefore mandatory in a context where the concern of economic efficiency of infrastructures lead to increase traffic. Supervision is tightly related to human decisions; therefore human factor is to be foremost when designing future supervision systems. This work focuses on evaluating the human-machine interactions and their impact on safety. In order to complete this study, we required the participation of specialists from three main areas. Firstly railway engineers for the technical aspects, secondly human factors and organisational specialists, and thirdly dependability experts to summarize and evaluate the impact on safety caused by the interactions of the two previous components. These three fields have different approaches that can sometimes be contradictory and this thesis tries to set links between them for the common objective to reach a greater safety level. The specific studies on the human factor have been conducted on a platform designed to supervise the railway traffic installed in the UTC offices. This platform was composed of an automatic train supervision system coupled with a traffic simulator enabling to re-create the working conditions of a an operator. The objective was to obtain information on the general cognitive processes involved in managing a dynamic traffic environment of trains in order to evaluate the supervising system while in use by operators facing three type of situations: nominal, normal, or degraded. The difficulty of such study remains the integration of the results from the observation, with the technics of ergonomical cognitive psychology in the safety analysis. An interdisciplinary approach based on a common referential of these three fields has been proposed {{in order to get a}} common model for <b>human</b> <b>ressources</b> and dependability experts. This referential was designed in a systemic perspective of the safety studies. Bien qu'actuellement considérés comme non sécuritaires (les fonctions de sécurité étant assurées par d'autres sous-systèmes) les systèmes de supervision du trafic ferroviaire peuvent contribuer à la sécurité dans certains scénarios de crise où une décision adaptée d'un opérateur de supervision pourrait réduire notablement la gravité des scénarios d'accident. Il est donc de toute première importance d'identifier ce type de scénarios afin d'envisager les systèmes de supervision du futur dans la perspective d'améliorer encore la sécurité des circulations dans un contexte d'augmentation du trafic ferroviaire prévisible et souhaitable dans les années à venir. La supervision impliquant des décisions prises par l'homme, la prise en compte du facteur humain est indispensable, et ce dès la conception des futurs systèmes. L'étude se focalise sur l'évaluation de l'interaction opérateurs humains [...] machines et son impact sur la sécurité. Cette démarche nécessite la coopération de spécialistes de l'ingénierie ferroviaire (composante technique), des sciences humaines et sociales (composante humaine et organisationnelle) et de la sûreté de fonctionnement pour la synthèse et l'évaluation de la sécurité. Ces disciplines ont des approches différentes et quelquefois opposées, la thèse vise à établir un pont entre ces différentes disciplines dans un objectif commun de l'évaluation de la sécurité. Des études spécifiques du facteur humain ont été réalisées sur une plateforme de supervision de trafic ferroviaire. Installée dans les locaux de l'utc, cette plateforme comprend un système de supervision couplé à un simulateur de trafic permettant de recréer en laboratoire les conditions de travail d'un opérateur de supervision de trafic ferroviaire. L'objectif des expérimentations est d'obtenir des informations sur les processus cognitifs généraux impliqués dans la gestion d'un environnement dynamique de circulation de mobiles et de contribuer ainsi à l'évaluation du système de supervision en situation d'utilisation par des opérateurs confrontés à la gestion d'une situation nominale, normale et dégradée...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBy {{implementing}} {{strategies such as}} the Lisbon Agenda (2000 - 2010) and Europe 2020 (2010 - 2020), the European Union explicitly puts {{science education}} {{at the heart of}} economical development, and stresses scientific excellency as a means to economic growth. Social justice is an important stake for these strategies, as women and minorities are underrepresented in science courses and careers. This phenomenon has been documented and described using the “leaky pipeline” metaphor (Blickenstaff, 2005), and although this appellation deserves to be discussed (Cannady, 2014), it is useful to depict the way women and some minorities rarely reach positions of responsibility in science. This continues to be true in France, for instance, where merely 13 % of university professors of mathematics are women (Ministry of Higher-Education and Research, 2015). Women, and students from the working classes or ethnic minorities are indeed particularly marginalized in science in France, where social equity is far below OECD average and has been degrading between 2003 and 2016 (OECD, 2015). In this context, France has aimed to revalorize its science courses and careers in order to make them more attractive and to foster greater inclusion and diversity. In schools, this concern for social justice is reflected in the implementation of projects to promote equality within science. This paper aims to account for one of these projects in order to analyze the effects it can have for students and teachers - in other words, can social justice be taught?Our study focuses on a French program we anonymise as the “Science, Aspirations and Equality Project” (SAEP). SAEP aims to follow a cohort of about one hundred students for four years, from 4 thto 7 th grade, by involving them in weekly science workshops, in order to foster confidence and interest in science in young girls and boys from the working class. Most of these students are also from minority ethnic backgrounds (Black African, Arab). These workshops are led by science teachers and science mediators from an organisation specializing in science and social justice. By interviewing students at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the program and by observing what went on during the workshops, we tried to assess the effects of SAEP, and to reflect on social justice education. Methodology, Methods, Research Instruments or Sources UsedThis study consists in the qualitative analysis of a “science and equality” educational project (“SAEP”) through observations and interviews.  We observed weekly science workshops during four years — 4 th to 7 th grade; 9 to 13 year-olds — and took detailed notes on interactions between educators and students. We also had the opportunity to attend preparatory and review meetings for the workshops, where teachers and mediators set up sessions. At the end of the 5 th and 7 th grade, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 52 students, with the same students being interviewed two years apart. A few science teachers, mediators and parents were also interviewed. Explored themes included school careers, personal attitudes to science, and perception and assessment of the SAEP project. We assessed whether the project had any effects on science representations and aspirations, and if it had rendered science more inclusive for these students. The empirical material thus recovered is analyzed through Bourdieusian perspective. Our approach draws on “critical” sociological theories, and uses concepts of socialization, habitus (Bourdieu 1979; Passeron & Bourdieu 1970) and identity in order to determine how opportunities for identification with science fluctuate during the project, seen as a socializing agent. Alongside feminist researchers such as Judith Butler (1990), we consider that identity is not fixed, but rather fluid and in process, and aim to account for this fluidity with regard to relationships to science. This work also seeks to be counterpoint to recent European studies conducted on the same topic, and especially to the ASPIRE study, a five-year research project on young people’s science aspirations in the United-Kingdom (Archer et al., 2013 & 2016). Although having a very similar topic, our study uses a more local and qualitative approach, thus allowing comparison between countries and between methodologies. Conclusions, Expected Outcomes or FindingsAnalysis of the 7 th grade interviews is still in progress, and the comparative approach has yet to be finalized - the final report from the ASPIRE study was published earlier this year (Archer & DeWitt 2016). However, we can draw conclusions regarding the teaching of social justice in the SAEP project from 5 th grade interviews and observations.  The first result is that halfway through the project, all participants feel the effects are mixed. Educators, parents and students are all partly disappointed. They all approve of the project’s goal in theory (making science more inclusive), but further investigation reveals resistance and difficulties which had not been taken into account. We try to explain how organisational factors (the way schools functions for instance) and factors linked with individual trajectories and socializations can impact the project negatively.  A second result concerns the teaching of social justice and equality, and how it is unthought by the project’s stakeholders, who consider that equality will “come along naturally” if intentions are good. Social justice ends up being disembodied from science; it is perceived as falling within the scope of discourse and not of action. We show how this leads to the resurfacing of repressed stereotypes and discriminations against girls and students from Black-African and Arab backgrounds. Avenues of research we would like to explore for this paper include the following:•With regard to young students’ relationships to science, how does France fits into the European context?•From the case study of a “science and equality” educational project, what can we learn about teaching social justice?•France is known for its attachment to a republican universalism which often hinders affirmative action (De Rudder, 2000; Bereni & Lépinard, 2004) - what does it means for “science and equality” and social justice programs? ReferencesArcher, L., & DeWitt, J.
