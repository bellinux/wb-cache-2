The influence of the effective dropper tip perimeter, surface tension and viscosity of the liquid, and the dispensing angle upon the weight of drop was studied at four commercial ophthalmic preparations containing various viscolyzers, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and xyloglucan, and benzalkonium chloride as an antimicrobial preservative. The weight of a drop was directly proportional to {{the diameter of the}} outer perimeter of the dropper tip and the liquid surface tension. No significant influence of viscosity upon the weight of drops was discovered. The weight of drops decreased when the dispensing angle was reduced from 90 ř to 45 ř except of the situation when the drop slided down the external lateral surface of the dropper tip and consenquently increased its weight. That was observed for the eye dropper Ursapharm. Minimum failures of <b>drop</b> <b>dispensing</b> with low variability of the weight of drops at both investigated dispensing angles have been found for eye dropper Johnson & Johnson (eye drops Visine - tired eyes).

50|$|The {{contact angle}} formed between a liquid and solid phase will exhibit {{a range of}} contact angles that are possible. There are two common methods for {{measuring}} this range of contact angles. The first method {{is referred to as}} the tilting base method. Once a <b>drop</b> is <b>dispensed</b> on the surface with the surface level, the surface is then tilted from 0° to 90°. As the drop is tilted, the downhill side will be in a state of imminent wetting while the uphill side will be in a state of imminent dewetting. As the tilt increases the downhill contact angle will increase and represents the advancing contact angle while the uphill side will decrease; this is the receding contact angle. The values for these angles just prior to the drop releasing will typically represent the advancing and receding contact angles. The difference between these two angles is the contact angle hysteresis.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Facilitated {{by the development of}} various direct-write techniques and functional polymeric materials including polymer based conductors and semiconductors, printed electronics are flourishing both commercially and as a research topic. This is not only because of their simpler manufacturing routes and lower cost, but also as a result of lower processing temperatures and better compatibility with flexible substrates, compared with conventional electronics. The development of conventional electronics has been guided by Moore s Law, the driver for which lies in the demand for electronic devices with better performance and portability at lower prices. Therefore, one can expect a similar trend for printed electronics to guide its development. Multi-layered printing can be adopted in printed electronics to achieve higher density integration, so that this development trend can be maintained. In such circumstances, creation of electrical connections between multiple layers emerges as an important issue for printed electronics. Inkjet-etched via holes are one potential solution to providing such electrical interconnections, and which can provide good integration with other inkjet-printed features simply by switching nozzles. This thesis aims to elicit {{a better understanding of the}} physics involved in inkjet etching and investigate the capability of the inkjet etching technique. In the thesis, the factors that can affect the size of via holes produced by inkjet etching are evaluated, which is significant for evaluating the capability of this technique to deliver industrially relevant features. Identified factors include droplet ejection frequency, droplet diameter, solvent properties and substrate temperature. Droplet ejection frequency, i. e. the reciprocal of the time interval between drops, determines the extent of evaporation of the solvent between two consecutive drop impacts. Droplet diameter determines the radius of the wetted area after the droplet I impacts on the surface and spreads into a sessile drop. Solvents with different evaporation properties result in different size evolution with the number of <b>drops</b> <b>dispensed,</b> as does droplet ejection frequency. Higher substrate temperatures can reduce the drop diameter during flight and decrease the evaporation time on polymer surfaces, which can shrink the size of via holes. Another important issue is achieving complete polymer penetration as residual polymer creates an electrical conduction barrier after such holes are subsequently filled with conductive materials or act as a barrier to filling by electroplating. Experiments have been carried out to test the effect of outer diameter and polymer thickness on polymer penetration. Electroplating is utilised to test the completeness of via hole penetration. A mechanism using the Marangoni effect to explain the protrusion drying pattern other than a hole in the polymer layer is proposed...|$|R

The comercially available dropping system used {{for the purpose of this}} investigation was formed by white plastic vial and white plastic dropper tip. The weight of drop of water and comercially product ATROPIN POS® (containins 0, 5 % atropine sulphate) was measured under two dispensing angles (90 ř and 45 ř). According to gained results, the weight of drop was significantly lower in the case of Atropine sulphate solution (p < 0, 01) then in the case of water. This can be explained by lower surface tension caused by the presence of antimicrobial preservative and surfactant Benzalkonium chloride. The average weight of Atropine sulphate solution was cca 33 mg when <b>dropped</b> under <b>dispensing</b> angle 90 ř. When the dispensing angles was lowered to 45 ř, the weight of solution was only 29 mg, which is significantly lower value (p < 0, 01).

Consideration {{is given to}} G I Taylor’s equation describing the critical potential for the onset of instability between closely spaced drops, and this is shown experimentally to require correction for different humidities. It is demonstrated that the critical potential, Vc, at a relative humidity of 100 % is approximately 50 % of that at 40 % RH. Possible reasons for this are discussed, drawing attention to the problem of establishing an accurate DC relative permittivity value for vapour-laden air in small interfacial gaps. The rôle of evaporation in modifying the system geometry is considered experimentally and theoretically, and shown to be significant only for humidities < 50 %. The complex nature of the interface in the case of very small air-gaps is discussed, together with the implications of these investigations for the interfacial stability of a floating drop or boule system. A theoretical model based on a consideration of the complex liquid-air-liquid interface as a capacitive system is developed, and shown to be in good agreement with practical observations. This model demonstrates that the parts played by electrical forces, together with environmental factors, are likely to be significant in terms of coalescence at stages prior to gap thinning to the point where London/van-der-Waals forces become dominant. Interfacial potentials are calculated in a boule system at a number of times between 0. 1 and 10 seconds, and shown to be sufficient to promote instability and coalescence. Full data based on a number of values of instability potentials is appended to the thesis. Development of the model raises questions concerning the validity of currently accepted values both for interfacial stability in small gaps and for the relative permittivity of humid air in similar situations. Suggestions are made for future work in such areas, together with possible methodologies. The phenomenon of floating water drops is therefore shown to be compatible with the general coalescence process, the event time being modified by such diverse factors as the impact energy with the surface, the ambient humidity and the magnitude of the initial drop charge. The latter is shown to be the dominant factor in the case of drops arriving on a clean surface with low kinetic energies, with the small charge inherent on any water drop being sufficient to produce potentials adequate to promote eventual instability.

Results: Regardless of bottle orientation and shaking, all difluprednate emulsion concentrations {{at each time point}} analyzed were within 15 % of declared concentration.

An improved sessile drop method was adopted, i.e., the liquid <b>drop</b> was <b>dispensed</b> from a small hole (1 mm in diameter) {{at the bottom of}} an alumina tube (99.6 wt% purity) only when the preferred testing temperature (600 K) was reached. Detailed information can be found elsewhere [14]. The most significant advantage of this improved method lies in the separate locating of the substrate and the pure metal, and thus the Fe 78 B 13 Si 9 amorphous ribbons, which were initially fixed on an alumina support and adjusted to a horizontal position, can be pre-annealed at different temperatures ranging between 600 and 1000 K for 10 min in a high vacuum (approx. 3 × 10 - 4 Pa) to produce various structures and phases through relaxation and crystallization, and then cooled at 15 K min- 1 to the constant temperature of 600 K for the wetting test. Other advantages include mechanical removal of the oxide film covering the drop surface and elimination of the prior interaction between the drop and the substrate during heating, thus making the measurement of contact angle more accurate and reliable. As soon as the liquid was dropped and rested on the substrate, photos were taken using a high-resolution digital camera at a maximum speed of two frames per second under the illumination of 50 -mW parallel laser beams with a diameter of 30 mm. The captured drop profiles were analyzed by an axisymmetric drop shape analysis program to calculate the contact angles. The substrate surfaces outside the drop were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max 2500 PC, Japan) to identify the structure and phase changes from the amorphous to crystalline states.

Commercially available sparse matrix screens were used for screening crystallization conditions. Crystals grew in a solution containing 100 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.5, 26 % (w/v) PEG 4000.

Diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beamlines BL 1 A, BL 5 A, and BL 17 A at KEK (Tsukuba, Japan) after crystals were soaked in the reservoir solutions supplemented with 20 % (v/v) glycerol for 10 s and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. HKL 2000 software (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) was used for processing data.

The model of MtbHadAB complex was auto-built and then refined using native data. Manual adjustments to the model were made using COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and refined using PHENIX. Structures of MtbHadAB bound with flavonoids were solved by molecular replacement (MR) method with Phaser program (McCoy et al., 2007) in CCP 4 (Potterton et al., 2003), using the native MtbHadAB structure as a search template. Data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table S 1. Structural figures were prepared using PyMol (Schrodinger, 2010).|$|R

D. Title of Thesis Study {{of factors}} influencing dose of commercial eye drops Five commercially produced ophthalmic preparations which differed in a dispensing {{system and a}} shape of the dropper tip {{were used in the}} thesis. The influence of the surface tension, viscosity, osmolality, density, and dispensing angle on the weight of the drops produced by original dispensing system, consisting of dropper tip and dropper bottle, was examined. To evaluate the influence properties of solutions, an uniform dropper tip and uniform dropper bottle were used. The weight of the eye drops were compared with the drop weight of water and the model solutions 0. 01 % and 0. 02 % benzalkonium chloride. Direct correlation proportion was found out between the surface tension and the weight of the <b>drops.</b> When the <b>dispensing</b> angle decreased from 90 ř to 45 řthe weight of the drops significantly decreased too. When the dropper tip was wetted the effective circuit of the dropper tip produced larger drops increasing variability of drop weigth together with the amout of applied drugs. Out of dropper systems tested, we can conclude that the lowest [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{commercial}} {{packages of}} oral drops with seven different dropper tips {{have been tested}} in this thesis. The mass of a drop has been investigated in the dependence on density, surface tension, dynamic viscosity and dispensing angle. Physical and chemical properties of oral formulations influence significantly the <b>dropping</b> ability of <b>dispensing</b> systems {{as well as the}} mass of a drop. An explicit dropping condition has been deduced. It formulates relations among characteristic dimensions of the dispensing system, surface tension and density of the liquid. The validity of the dropping condition has been verified for all original commercial packages. A linear relationship between drop mass and viscosity has been determined experimentally; a weak decreasing dependence between necking diameter and viscosity has been found. A combined influence of density and surface tension on diameter of a drop has been explained. The mass of drop decreases significantly when the dispensing angle decreases from 90 ř to 70 ř. However, the variability of dose increases simultaneously due to wetting of dropper tip and possible formation of bigger drops. A patient should be informed about the necessity to drop the oral formulation upon strictly vertical position. This information has been missing at seven from ten original [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{manipulation}} {{and control of}} drops of liquid and gas bubbles is achieved using high intensity acoustics {{in the form of}} and/or acoustic radiation pressure and acoustic streaming. generated by a controlled wave emission from a transducer. Acoustic radiation pressure is used to deploy or <b>dispense</b> <b>drops</b> into a liquid or a gas or bubbles into a liquid at zero or near zero velocity from the discharge end of a needle such as a syringe needle. Acoustic streaming is useful in manipulating the drop or bubble during or after deployment. Deployment and discharge is achieved by focusing the acoustic radiation pressure on the discharge end of the needle, and passing the acoustic waves through the fluid in the needle. through the needle will itself, or coaxially through the fluid medium surrounding the needle. Alternatively, the acoustic waves can be counter-deployed by focusing on the discharge end of the needle from a transducer axially aligned with the needle, but at a position opposite the needle, to prevent premature deployment of the drop or bubble. The acoustic radiation pressure can also be used for detecting {{the presence or absence of}} a drop or a bubble at the tip of a needle or for sensing various physical characteristics of the drop or bubble such as size or density...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} roll-to-roll UV imprint {{lithography}} tool {{as a way}} to pattern flexible PET foil with µm-resolution. As a way to overcome dimensional instability of the foil and its effect on overlay, a self-align approach was investigated, that permits to make several layers in a single lithography step. Flexible Ni-stamps were used, with a single level and with 2 levels. The stamps were fabricated on wafers using conventional optical lithography and Si etching. Thin Ni replica, both single and multilevel, were obtained by electroplating using a thickness of 50 µm. The flexible Ni stamps were attached on the main drum that is placed on a conventional roll-to-roll machine. Resist was <b>dispensed</b> <b>drop</b> by drop by valve-jet nozzle using solvent-free UV resist. The imprint speed was of 0. 35 m/min, using a UV illumination of 2 W. Fifty imprints were made in a row, equivalent to 20 m foil length. High imprint quality was observed with good reproducibility. All features type were replicated, from 500 µm contact pads to 800 nm wide trenches and 1 µm wide lines. A resolution of 800 nm in 1 µm thick resist was obtained for single level imprint. Multi-level imprints (2 levels) show the same quality in replication with a resolution of 1 µm. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{continuous}} {{hot-dip galvanizing}} process, steel strip is {{immersed in a}} molten zinc bath containing small amounts of aluminium (less than 1 wt. %). Before immersion in the molten metal, the steel strip is annealed at 800 °C {{in an atmosphere of}} nitrogen and hydrogen (5 vol. %) with low partial water pressure (20 - 50 Pa). Under these conditions, the most oxidizable alloying elements in the steel (e. g., Si, Mn) segregate to the surface where they form oxide particles. The presence on the steel surface of such oxide particles sometimes results in problems of wettability by liquid zinc-aluminium and may lead to the formation of surface defects. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of this problem, the wetting by liquid zinc-aluminium of heterogeneous surfaces composed of metallic iron and silica particles or films was investigated at 450 °C using the <b>dispensed</b> <b>drop</b> technique. The liquid zinc-aluminium wets oxidized surfaces to a lesser extent than the iron substrates. With the operating conditions used in the laboratory experiments, the transition from wetting to non-wetting was found to occur when the surface area fraction covered by silica was equal to 34 6 %. Mechanisms are proposed to explain the formation of the surface defects sometimes observed in galvanized coatings, based on the wettability experiments and characterization of surface defects from industrial coatings...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{introduce}} the novel technique of in-chip drop on demand, which consists in dispensing picoliter to nanoliter drops on demand {{directly in the}} liquid-filled channels of a polymer microfluidic chip, at frequencies up to 2. 5 kHz and with precise volume control. The technique involves a PDMS chip with one or several microliter-size chambers driven by piezoelectric actuators. Individual aqueous microdrops are dispensed from the chamber to a main transport channel filled with an immiscible fluid, in a process analogous to atmospheric <b>drop</b> on demand <b>dispensing.</b> In this article, the drop formation process is characterized with respect to critical dispense parameters such as the shape and duration of the driving pulse, {{and the size of}} both the fluid chamber and the nozzle. Several features of the in-chip drop on demand technique with direct relevance to lab on a chip applications are presented and discussed, such as the precise control of the dispensed volume, the ability to merge drops of different reagents and the ability to move a drop from the shooting area of one nozzle to another for multi-step reactions. The possibility to drive the microfluidic chip with inexpensive audio electronics instead of research-grade equipment is also examined and verified. Finally, we show that the same piezoelectric technique can be used to generate a single gas bubble on demand in a microfluidic chip...|$|R

The dropping of the solutions of methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose in the concentration range of 0, 15 - 1, 00 %, a significant influence was observed on the weight of the eye <b>drops</b> in both <b>dispensing</b> angles, 90 ř (vertical dropping) and 45 ř (inclined dropping). The addition of the 0, 15 % MC and HPMC increased the weight at least 8 %, while the 1 % additive increased the weight more than doubled in comparison to water. HEC and NaCMC had significantly less influence on the weight of drops in comparision with MC and HPMC, which became evident in the slight increase of the weight of the drop in correlation with the increase of the concentration of the polymer. The 1 % solution of NaCMC showed a maximum increase of the weight of the drop of 13 % compared to water. As a result of changing dispensing angle from 90 ř to 45 ř, a significant decrease of the drop's weight was shown only {{in the case of the}} additives, HEC and NaCMC.
