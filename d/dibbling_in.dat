60|$|Some {{months after}} I had started {{shooting}} I {{began to have}} trouble with my beloved gun, owing to a weakness it had developed in its lock--one of the infirmities incidental to age which the gunsmiths of Buenos Ayres {{were never able to}} cure effectually. Whenever it got bad I was permitted to put it into the cart sent to town periodically, to have it repaired, and would then go gunless for a week or ten days. On one of these occasions I one day saw a party of shoveller duck <b>dibbling</b> <b>in</b> a small rain-pool {{at the side of the}} plantation, within a dozen yards of the old moat which surrounded it. Ducks always appeared to be exceptionally tame and bold when I was without a gun, but the boldness of those shovellers was more than I could stand, and running to the house I got out the old blunderbuss, which I had never been forbidden to use, since no one had ever thought it possible that I should want to use such a monster of a gun. But I was desperate, and loading it for the first (and last) time, I went after those shovellers.|$|E
30|$|The {{field trial}} of pigeonpea {{was carried out}} in the rainy season of 2014 at ICRISAT, Patancheru on Vertisols. The {{experiment}} was laid out with three replicates and subplot sizes of 4  m ×  2 ridges (1.2  m) in a RCBD design. Seeds of pigeonpea (variety ICPL 88039) were treated individually with the selected bacterial strain (108  CFU ml− 1) for 45  min and sown by <b>dibbling</b> (<b>in</b> rows 60  cm apart and 10  cm between plants at a depth of 5  cm) on 28 June 2014. Plants were inoculated with bacterial strains until the flowering stage once every 15  days on the soil close to the plant. Control plots were not treated with bacterial strains. All the agronomic practices including weeding and irrigation were done as and when required. The crop was harvested manually on 27 Oct 2014. At 30 DAS, the nodule number and nodule weight while at 60 DAS, the branches number, leaf area, leaf weight, stem weight and root weight were recorded. At crop maturity, the plant height, shoot weight, pod weight, pod number, seed weight, seed number, stover yield and grain yield were recorded.|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Dibble {{knew that}} his {{hospital}} and Tuskegee Institute needed to provide research opportunities as well as clinical care. When the offer {{to work on the}} study came, he accepted it for the opportunity to gain resources as well as funding for medical care. The study provided specialists for the patients and Raymond A. Vonderlehr was appointed to Dr. <b>Dibble.</b> <b>In</b> the 1950s, <b>Dibble</b> reported on the study as part of the work of John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital and titled it: “the U.S. Public Health Service study of syphilis in the Negro male in Macon County.” In his report he mentions the study and the examinations but the word “untreated” is omitted. Dibble died four years before the study made national news and it was never known whether or not he knew about the complete ongoing of the study. He was not alive for questions to be asked. Susan M. Reverby describes <b>Dibble,</b> <b>in</b> her book, Examining Tuskegee: The Infamous Syphilis Study and Its Legacy, as a race/science man who was committed to the improvement of conditions for African Americans.
