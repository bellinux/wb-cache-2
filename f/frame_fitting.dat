2500|$|The {{traditional}} tail vise uses {{one large}} screw, either wooden or metal. It {{is made in}} the form of a frame, with the back part of the <b>frame</b> <b>fitting</b> under the bench, and the movement of that frame located and restrained by a [...] complex system of sliding tongues and grooves, and runners, such that smooth left and right movements of the frame are possible, but forward and backward movements, or rotative movements of the frame are impossible. The jaw has a face that contacts the bench top, and it has one or more dog holes on the top—often 3 to 4, each spaced 5 inches apart—that are in line with the dog holes located on the front face (apron) of the bench—numerous holes, each also spaced 5 inches apart. This is the least expensive option for a tail vise, but it is by far the most complex to design, construct and maintain. Tage Frid and Frank Klausz popularized this type of tail vise in North America, although its origin dates back to northern Europe (most probably Germany) in the 18th century.|$|E

40|$|Remote {{controlled}} operation {{requires a}} lot of information about the working environment. Cameras and proximity sensors can not give all the information being considered as necessary for working in a narrow and hardly observable environment. If the environment is geometrically more or less defined, computer support can give the missing information. The handling task in this case is the cutting of the old mortar in brick sewers and the replacing of a new one. The sewers have an elliptic cross-section which is exactly mathematically described. Therefore, the handling task can be preplanned by a computer algorithm. During the cutting operation the operator has the possibility to correct the cutter path with a joystick which works in a coordinate <b>frame</b> <b>fitting</b> to the sewer surface. In the first working step the longitudinal gaps are cut and the end points of the transverse gaps are taught. In this way we get a number of path points which have to be combined by a special computer algorithm t o an extended gap-program. The operator has the ability to change the path velocity between 0 % and 100 %; therefore, it can react on unpredictable events. In case of emergency, like breaking of a cutter, the operator can start a interruption routine. After a repairing of the damaged part the automatic program can be restarted {{at the beginning of a}} gap. The real manipulator movement will be shown on three video terminals. Additionally, a synthetical two-dimensional representation on a personal computer is available which does not only show the manipulator in the sewers but also the working process and the state of the machine...|$|E
40|$|Donkey milk is {{recently}} gaining attention {{due to its}} nutraceutical properties. Its low {{casein content}} does not allow caseification, so {{the production of a}} fermented milk would represent an alternative way to increase donkey milk shelf life. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the possibility of employing selected Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus plantarum isolates for the production of a novel donkey milk fermented beverage. Lysozyme resistance and the ability to acidify donkey milk were chosen as main selection parameters. Different fermented beverages (C 1 –C 9) were produced, each with a specific combination of isolates, and stored at refrigerated conditions for 35 days. The pH values and viability of the isolates were weekly assessed. In addition, sensory analysis was performed. Both S. thermophilus and L. plantarum showed a high degree of resistance to lysozyme with a Minimum Bactericidal Concentration > 6. 4 mg/mL for 100 % of S. thermophilus and 96 % of L. plantarum. S. thermophilus and L. plantarum showed the ability to acidify donkey milk in 24 h at 37 °C, with an average ΔpH value of 2. 91 ± 0. 16 and 1. 78 ± 0. 66, respectively. Four L. plantarum and two S. thermophilus were chosen for the production of fermented milks. Those containing the association S. thermophilus/L. plantarum (C 1 –C 4) reached a pH lower than 4. 5 after 18 h of fermentation and showed microbial loads higher than 7. 00 log cfu/mL until the end of the storage period. Moreover, comparing the microbial loads of samples containing both species and those containing S. thermophilus alone (C 5), we highlighted the ability of L. plantarum to stimulate S. thermophilus replication. This boosted replication of S. thermophilus allowed to reach an appropriate pH in a time <b>frame</b> <b>fitting</b> the production schedule. This was not observed for samples containing a single species (C 5 –C 9). Thus, L. plantarum strains seem to be good candidates in the production of a novel type of fermented milk, not only for their probiotic potential, but also for the enhancing effect on S. thermophilus growth...|$|E

Given hundreds of unlabeled motion capture markers from multiple articulated targets that are interacting each other, our approach automatically labels these markers frame by <b>frame,</b> by <b>fitting</b> rigid bodies and exploiting trained structure and motion models.

The alteration enabled the locos to travel the tight curves found in the works, and also reduced excessive buffer and coupler misalignment. Deep buffer beams were fitted with a 3+1/2 in rail clearance, to minimise damage during derailments. To reduce excessive body roll due to poor track conditions, extra bearing pads were fitted {{to the outside of}} the bogie frame and the main <b>frame.</b> The <b>fitting</b> of large [...] capacity air reservoirs on each side enabled the locos to be used with 6 of the pneumatic dump cars in use at the steelworks.
