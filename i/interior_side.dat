5|$|Literary Hall is {{flanked by}} two <b>interior</b> <b>side</b> chimneys, between {{the second and third}} bays of the west and east {{elevations}} of the building. The building rests on a sandstone, ashlar block foundation. Its gable roof is sheathed with standing seam tin sheeting.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to protein- and solution-mediated processes, {{it is also}} possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling. A classic example of this is phosphatidylserine-triggered phagocytosis. Normally, phosphatidylserine is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only on the <b>interior</b> <b>side.</b> During programmed cell death a protein called a scramblase equilibrates this distribution, displaying phosphatidylserine on the extracellular bilayer face. The presence of phosphatidylserine then triggers phagocytosis to remove the dead or dying cell.|$|E
5|$|Sabah {{culture is}} diverse {{due to a}} wide range of {{different}} ethnicity. In the coastal areas, Sabahan culture has been influenced by the Bruneian Malays and West Coast Bajaus on the west coast side while in the east coast it is influenced by either East Coast Bajau, Bugis and Suluk cultures with Islam being the important part of their lives. Christianity plays an important part to the indigenous cultures in the <b>interior</b> <b>side</b> in the daily lives of the Kadazan-Dusun, Lundayeh, Murut and Rungus beside their old practice of the traditional Animism and Paganism. Interracial marriage among the different ethnicity and religion are common in Sabah.|$|E

40|$|Solar earth-water {{distillation}} is a {{means of}} extracting moisture from an earth medium. Three designs of the hot-box type of solar earth-water still were tested using wet or saturated sand. The designs included: low height with reflective <b>interior</b> <b>siding,</b> tall height with reflective siding and tall height with absorptive siding. The daily volume of distillate from different designs was compared. A twenty-centimeter-tall still with reflective siding produced significantly greater yields than one twice as tall. No significant difference in the yield between tall stills with light-absorptive versus light reflective <b>interior</b> <b>siding</b> was found. A regression equation was developed to predict water production for a low still with reflective siding and a sixteen-degree cover slope. Independent variables included soil moisture, solar radiation and maximum and minimum daily temperature...|$|R

25|$|The {{anterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} the iliopsoas, {{a group of}} two or three muscles with a shared insertion on the lesser trochanter of the femur. The psoas major originates from the last vertebra and along the lumbar spine to stretch down into the pelvis. The iliacus originates on the iliac fossa on the <b>interior</b> <b>side</b> of the pelvis. The two muscles unite to form the iliopsoas muscle which is inserted on the lesser trochanter of the femur. The psoas minor, only present in about 50 per cent of subjects, originates above psoas major to stretch obliquely down to its insertion on the <b>interior</b> <b>side</b> of the major muscle.|$|E

25|$|Construction of the {{staircase}} proceeded using several cream and taupe colored marbles including Vermont Westland cream. The new Grand Staircase was framed by a rectilinear archway, with the <b>interior</b> <b>side</b> walls faced with the seals of the original 13 states. Above the opening facing the Cross Hall was a plaster arch with a spread American eagle in bas relief with a corona of 13 radiating arrows. A contrasting marble string course with triglyphs and five pointed stars projected around the stairwell at the landing. Winslow designed a custom railing with cast iron balusters that incorporated the five pointed federal star within a circle he used in the carved moulding.|$|E
50|$|The {{first floor}} {{interior}} {{walls of the}} cabin show signs of modernization, possibly in the 1960s, but the loft walls are still unfinished. The cabin flooring has also been replaced, dating early to mid-twentieth center. The roof rafters are exposed with broad planks and a metal roof sitting atop. In the gable ends the studs and <b>interior</b> <b>sides</b> of the weatherboard cladding are exposed.|$|R
50|$|This is a circular, {{cup-shaped}} crater {{with a small}} interior {{floor at}} {{the midpoint of the}} sloping inner walls. The <b>interior</b> <b>sides</b> have a higher albedo than the surroundings. There is a small crater situated along the north-northeastern edge of the rim. The crater chain named Catena Mendeleev passes just to the west of Richards, continuing in a line of small craters from the southwestern edge of Mendeleev.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a nearly}} {{circular}} crater, although the rim {{to the north}} is somewhat straightened. It has a well-formed edge {{that has not been}} noticeably degraded through impact erosion. There are terraces along the <b>interior</b> <b>sides,</b> particularly along the western edge (which is hidden from view from the Earth.) The interior floor is deep and uneven, with an impact feature joining the midpoint to the north-northwestern inner wall.|$|R
500|$|The large, column-free {{space between}} the {{perimeter}} and core was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses. The floors supported their own weight, as well as live loads, provided lateral stability to the exterior walls, and distributed wind loads among the exterior walls. The floors consisted of [...] thick lightweight concrete slabs laid on a fluted steel deck with shear connections for composite action. A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the floors. The trusses had a span of [...] in the long-span areas and [...] in the short span area. The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns, and were on [...] centers. The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the exterior side and a channel welded to the core columns on the <b>interior</b> <b>side.</b> [...] The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with viscoelastic dampers, which helped {{reduce the amount of}} sway felt by building occupants.|$|E
500|$|Fucaia buelli is the {{earliest}} mysticete, {{dating back to}} 33 million years ago (mya). Measuring only , it is the smallest baleen whale discovered. It is only known from its teeth; they suggest a suction feeding behavior, much like that of beaked whales. Like other early toothed mysticetes, or [...] "archaeomysticetes", F. buelli had heterodont dentition. Archaeomysticetes from the Oligocene are the Mammalodontidae (Mammalodon and Janjucetus) from Australia. They were small with shortened rostra, and a primitive dental formula (...) [...] In baleen whales, enlarged mouths adapted for suction feeding evolved before specializations for bulk filter feeding. In the toothed Oligocene mammalodontid Janjucetus, the symphysis is short and the mouth enlarged, the rostrum is wide, and {{the edges of the}} maxillae are thin, indicating an adaptation for suction feeding. The aetiocetid Chonecetus still had teeth, but the presence of a groove on the <b>interior</b> <b>side</b> of each mandible indicates the symphysis was elastic, which would have enabled rotation of each mandible, an initial adaptation for bulk feeding like in modern mysticetes.|$|E

Another notable feature of the Triumph is that all opening parts, hood trunk, and doors, have their <b>interior</b> <b>sides</b> painted black - where other manufacturers either simply paint these areas in body color or leave them unpainted with sloppy paint over-spray. Less authentic looking is the engine compartment which appears as a cheap diecast base with various 'bumps' sprayed silver.|$|R
5000|$|In 1981, Bird and Johnson won Best of Show at the Santa Fe Indian Market. More recently, {{they have}} become famous for their {{necklaces}} which often carry designs on the reverse side of bezel-set stones which reflect symbols that are personalized to the intended wearer. They use an overlay technique, which they describe as [...] "underlay", that was inspired by Charles Loloma's stone inlay designs on the <b>interior</b> <b>sides</b> of rings and bracelets.|$|R
2500|$|In 1967, Prest-O-Lite made a [...] "Black Box" [...] {{ignition}} amplifier, {{intended to}} take the load off of the distributor's breaker points during high r.p.m. runs, which was used by Dodge and Plymouth on their factory Super Stock Coronet and Belvedere drag racers. This amplifier was installed on the <b>interior</b> <b>side</b> of the cars' firewall, and had a duct which provided outside air to cool the unit. The rest of the system (distributor and spark plugs) remains as for the mechanical system. The lack of moving parts compared with the mechanical system leads to greater reliability and longer service intervals.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{remaining}} {{links to the}} castle's history, is the Santo António Gate, formed from two thick walls, separated by a rounded arch, broken on the exterior and rounded on the <b>interior</b> <b>side.</b> The gate is approximately [...] high, with the still visible the grooves in the granite stones for the hinges used in opening and closing the access. Over the gate are vestiges of the primitive Chemin de ronde walkway, which was later transformed into a terrace for the residences. There are other wall segments throughout the city, some [...] high and [...] thick, built with a base of granite and shale throughout.|$|E

2500|$|On July 7, 1588, the {{physician}} of the Duke of Urbino, Vincenzo Remosetti, {{was summoned to}} a consultation at the Farnese Palace at Caprarola, [...] "per uno grande accidente di epilepsia," [...] accompanied by severe respiratory problems. The Cardinal was gravely ill. He was subjected to the usual quackery, cautery and bleeding. [...] He was attended by Msgr. Camillo Caetani, the brother of Cardinal Enrico Caetani, who kept his brother informed of Farnese's condition. On August 13, the doctor {{had to return to}} Rome; he left the Cardinal restless and weak, and suffering from [...] "gotta" [...] in his left arm. [...] On February 28, 1589, he suffered an attack of some sort, perhaps a stroke ("ictus"). Cardinal Farnese died quietly of the effects of apoplexy in Rome on March 2, 1589, at the age of seventy. He was buried before the high altar in the Church of the Gesù. Forty-two cardinals participated in the funeral ceremonies.

2500|$|The core of {{the towers}} housed the {{elevator}} and utility shafts, restrooms, three stairwells, and other support spaces. The core of each tower was a rectangular area 87 by 135feet (27 by 41m) and contained 47 steel columns running from the bedrock {{to the top of}} the tower. The large, column-free space between the perimeter and core was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses. The floors supported their own weight as well as live loads, providing lateral stability to the exterior walls and distributing wind loads among the exterior walls. The floors consisted of [...] thick lightweight concrete slabs laid on a fluted steel deck. A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the floors. The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns and were on 6foot 8inch (2.03m) centers. The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the exterior side and a channel welded to the core columns on the <b>interior</b> <b>side.</b> The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with viscoelastic dampers that helped reduce the amount of sway felt by building occupants.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ruins of}} the cashel itself are {{described}} as being a circular wall enclosing an area of [...] in diameter. The wall had a height of [...] with a breadth varying from [...] to [...] While not perpendicular, it had an inclination inwards indicating its similarity to most other Irish stone forts. [...] Petrie suggests that it was probably originally between twice and four times {{as high as it}} was when he surveyed it. [...] up on the <b>interior</b> <b>side</b> of the wall, the thickness was [...] due to the presence of terracing. The terrace is reached by flights of steps {{on either side of the}} entrance gateway. Fallen stones had covered any other existing stairs. Petrie suggests that there were originally three or four such terraces ascending to the top of the wall. [...] On each side of the entranceway, there are [...] "galleries" [...] within the wall. Their precise purpose is not clear and they do not connect with the entrance. These two wall-passages, one on the south and another from the northeast run towards the gateway, but stop short. Near the north end of the south passage is a small recess in its west wall. At the south end of the north passage there is a seat-stone.|$|E
