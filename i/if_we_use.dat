5|$|Varying {{definitions}} of the term First World and {{the uncertainty of the}} term in today's world leads to different indicators of First World status. In 1945, the United Nations used the terms first, second, third, and fourth worlds to define the relative wealth of nations (although popular use of the term fourth world did not come about until later). There are some references towards culture in the definition. They were defined in terms of Gross National Product (GNP), measured in U.S. dollars, along with other socio-political factors. The first world included the large industrialized, democratic (free elections, etc.) nations. The second world included modern, wealthy, industrialized nations, but they were all under communist control. Most {{of the rest of the}} world was deemed part of the third world, while the fourth world was considered to be those nations whose people were living on less than US$100 annually. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>use</b> the term to mean high-income industrialized economies, then the World Bank classifies countries according to their GNI or gross national income per capita. The World Bank separates countries into four categories: high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income economies. The First World is considered to be countries with high-income economies. The high-income economies are equated to mean developed and industrialized countries.|$|E

25|$|One can {{generate}} Student-t samples {{by taking the}} ratio of variables from the normal distribution and the square-root of chi-squared distribution. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>use</b> instead of the normal distribution, e.g., the Irwin–Hall distribution, we obtain over-all a symmetric 4-parameter distribution, which includes the normal, the uniform, the triangular, the Student-t and the Cauchy distribution. This is also more flexible than some other symmetric generalizations of the Gaussian distribution.|$|E
25|$|Any {{family of}} sets that {{satisfies}} (2–4) is called a filter (an example: the complements to the finite sets, {{it is called the}} Fréchet filter and it is used in the usual limit theory). If (1) also holds, U is called an ultrafilter (because you can add no more sets to it without breaking it). The only explicitly known example of an ultrafilter is the {{family of sets}} containing a given element (in our case, say, the number 10). Such ultrafilters are called trivial, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>use</b> it in our construction, we come back to the ordinary real numbers. Any ultrafilter containing a finite set is trivial. It is known that any filter can be extended to an ultrafilter, but the proof uses the axiom of choice. The existence of a nontrivial ultrafilter (the ultrafilter lemma) can be added as an extra axiom, as it is weaker than the axiom of choice.|$|E

Now a question arises: is {{the estimate of}} the population variance that arises in this way using the sample mean always smaller than what <b>we</b> would get <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> the population mean? The answer is yes except when the sample mean {{happens to be the}} same as the population mean.|$|R
25|$|As {{the cycle}} {{named after him}} doesn't waste caloric, the {{reversible}} engine has to use this cycle. Imagine now two large bodies, a hot and a cold one. He postulates now {{the existence of a}} heat machine with a greater efficiency. We couple now two idealized machine but of different efficiencies and connect them to the same hot and the same cold body. The first and less efficient one lets a constant amount of entropy ∆S = Q/T flow from hot to cold during each cycle, yielding an amount of work denoted W. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>use</b> now this work to power the other more efficient machine, it would, using the amount of work W gained during each cycle by the first machine, make an amount of entropy ∆S' > ∆S flow from the cold to the hot body. The net effect is a flow of ∆S' − ∆S ≠ 0 of entropy from the cold to the hot body, while no net work is done. Consequently, the cold body is cooled down and the hot body rises in temperature. As the difference of temperature rises now the yielding of work by the first is greater in the successive cycles and due to the second engine difference in temperature of the two bodies stretches by each cycle evan more. In the end this set of machines would be a perpetuum mobile that cannot exist. This proves that the assumption of the existence of a more efficient engine was wrong so that an heat engine that operates the Carnot cycle must be the most efficient one. This means that a frictionless heat engine that lacks of conductive heat flow driven by a difference of temperature shows maximum possible efficiency.|$|E

For example, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>use</b> the concept of a bird, there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind: we might assume that it flies, eats worms and so on. We know these facts are not always true and that deductions using these facts will not be [...] "logical", but these structured sets of assumptions are part of the context of everything we say and think.
