40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of social norms and attitudes about gender, i. e. culture, for labour market {{behaviour}} and cultural assimilation of immigrants in Sweden. Using source country <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> as cultural proxies {{we find that the}} labour force participation of immigrants in Sweden is related to culture, in the sense that immigrants originating from countries with high <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in labour force participation rates (LFPR) also have high <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in LFPR within their immigrant group on the Swedish labour market. On the contrary, high source country <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in earnings are, if anything, associated with lower <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in earnings within immigrant groups in Sweden. In addition, we find that <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in LFPR among immigrants in Sweden assimilate towards the corresponding gap among natives as time in Sweden increases. These results suggest that culture is one explanation for the existence of <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in LFPR and that cultural assimilation takes place as time since exposure to the source country culture increases...|$|R
40|$|Unprecedented {{population}} {{aging in}} poorer settings {{is coinciding with}} the rapid spread of obesity and other chronic conditions. These conditions predict disability and poor self-rated health and often are more prevalent in women than men. Thus, <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in obesity and other chronic conditions may account for older women's greater disability and worse self-rated health in poor, rural populations, where aging, obesity, and chronic conditions are rapidly emerging. In a survey of 604 adults 50 years and older in rural Guatemala, we assessed whether <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in obesity and other chronic conditions accounted for <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in disability and self-rated health. Obesity strongly predicted gross mobility (GM) disability, {{and the number of}} chronic conditions strongly predicted all outcomes, especially in women. Controlling for <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in body-mass index (BMI) and especially the number of chronic conditions eliminated <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in GM disability, and controlling for <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in the number of chronic conditions eliminated <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in self-rated health. We recommend conducting longitudinal cohort studies to explore interventions that may mitigate adult obesity and chronic conditions among poor, rural older adults. Such interventions also may reduce <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in later-life disability and self-rated health.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the quantitative effects of <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in entrepreneurship and workforce participation in an occupational choice {{model with a}} household sector. <b>Gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in entrepreneurship affect negatively both income and aggregate productivity, since they reduce the entrepreneurs’ average talent and female labor force participation. We estimate the <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> for 37 European countries and we find that <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> cause an average market output loss of 11. 5 % when they are considered constant across talent levels.

40|$|Gender {{relations}} {{are a key}} institution governing important aspects of production and reproduction of societies. They are guided by formal institutions as well as informal norms and values. As this survey shows, there is great regional heterogeneity in gender inequality in formal and informal social institutions. The literature on long-term drivers of <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> suggests that those <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> are related to long-standing and regularly reproduced gender norms and values related to differences in women's economic opportunities and constraints. The paper also shows that these <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> not only affect gender equity but overall development outcomes such as economic growth and reductions in mortality. This is best documented {{in the case of}} <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in education but there is also evidence for the negative effects <b>gender</b> of <b>gaps</b> in employment, political and economic empowerment, access to resources, and social institutions on development outcomes. The paper then shows {{that there has been a}} large and heterogeneous change in <b>gender</b> <b>gaps.</b> While <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in education (and legal rights) have closed very rapidly, <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in labor force participation, health, political participation, and time use have closed much less rapidly, and there has been virtually progress in reducing occupational and sectoral segregation, unexplained <b>gender</b> pay <b>gaps,</b> and violence against women. The paper presents some hypotheses that might explain this differential performance and also contribute to understanding regional dynamics, before pointing towards a forward-looking research agenda on better understanding the linkages between institutions and their change, gender inequality, and economic development...|$|R
5|$|Women have {{traditionally}} been disadvantaged {{in terms of economic}} and social status and power, which in turn reduces their access to the necessities of life including health care. Despite recent improvements in western nations, women remain disadvantaged with respect to men. The <b>gender</b> <b>gap</b> in health is even more acute in developing countries where women are relatively more disadvantaged. In addition to gender inequity, there remain specific disease processes uniquely associated with being a woman which create specific challenges in both prevention and health care.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed the <b>gender</b> <b>gap</b> in life expectancy and now {{live longer than}} men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E
5|$|Another {{instance}} of population control is {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per {{year because of the}} preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help to find out the sex of the fetus. In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge <b>gender</b> <b>gap</b> in China.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} to {{what extent}} <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> in education, health, employment, productive assets and inputs can affect pro poor growth (in the sense of increasing monetary incomes of the poor).

While there is a considerable literature suggesting negative impacts of <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> on growth, there is much less information on the impact of <b>gender</b> <b>gaps</b> on inequality. The paper then examines the experiences of country cases and finds that gender inequality can have a significant effect on pro-poor growth, but that the importance and type of effects differ considerably between different regions.

However, in 2008, a study of young people and self-harm saw the <b>gender</b> <b>gap</b> close, with 32% of young females, and 22% of young males admitting to self-harm.
