Betz was able to show that the maximum coefficient of power of a wind turbine is 16/27. Airflow operating at higher thrust will cause the axial <b>induction</b> <b>factor</b> to rise above the optimum value. Higher thrust cause more air to be deflected away from the turbine. When the axial <b>induction</b> <b>factor</b> falls below the optimum value the wind turbine is not extracting all the energy it can. This reduces pressure around the turbine and allows more air to pass through the turbine, but not enough to account for the lack of energy being extracted.|$|E

That is, we are dealing with an isolated system. In physics, isolated systems must obey conservation laws. An example of such is the conservation of angular momentum. Thus, the angular momentum within the streamtube must be conserved. Consequently, if the rotor acquires angular momentum through its interaction with the fluid, something else must acquire equal and opposite angular momentum. As already mentioned, the system consists of just the fluid and the rotor, the fluid must acquire angular momentum in the wake.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve the efficiency of wind farm power production by applying Bayesian Optimization (BO) in a cooperative game theoretic framework. In the game theoretic framework, wind turbines in a wind farm are treated as agents interacting with other wind turbines through the wake interference. Through minimizing wake interference by coordinated control actions of wind turbines, the power performance of the wind turbines can increase. The goal is to find the optimal, coordinated sets of yaw offset angles and <b>induction</b> <b>factors</b> for wind turbines by applying a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm. In BO, the objective function is modeled as a Gaussian Process (GP) and the optimum point is found by sequentially querying (sampling) the function values. Since BO does not require an explicit form for the objective function, the methodology can be effectively deployed to wind farm power maximization problem whose objective function involves complicated wake interactions and uncertainties in environmental influence such as wind speed and direction.

40|$|A {{momentum}} theory {{which includes the}} effects of slipstream rotation for wind turbines is presented. The theory accounts for the axial and radial pressure gradients within the slipstream {{as well as the}} wake expansion caused by wake rotation. Because of the limiting approximations of previous methods, the effects of slipstream rotation have not been accurately realized. The method included here, which does not suffer from the unrealistic approximations of previous methods, predicts that the effects of slipstream rotation are manifest entirely through an increase in the turbine thrust coefficient. The method predicts, as previous methods do, that the Lanchester-Betz-Joukowski limit of 16 / 27 is an upper limit for the maximum efficiency, or power coefficient, of a wind turbine. Unlike the results from classical methods that are traditionally reported in terms of the axial <b>induction</b> <b>factor,</b> results of this work are presented in terms of two independent variables, the tip-speed ratio and the torque coefficient. The results included here allow the dependent variables including the thrust coefficient, power coefficient, axial <b>induction</b> <b>factor,</b> and circumferential <b>induction</b> <b>factor</b> to be evaluated in terms of the tip-speed ratio and torque coefficient.

40|$|Wind farms {{have been}} used on large scales to {{increase}} the amount of power produced while minimizing the interconnection costs to decrease the overall cost of energy. However placing these wind turbines in close proximity to one another has reduced the performance of wind turbines due to wake loss effects. By modeling wind turbines using actuator disk theory and modeling wakes using the PARK and Mosaic Tile wake models, two different optimization methods are used in this research to determine the ideal axial <b>induction</b> <b>factor</b> configuration in order to minimize wake loss effects to improve the overall performance of a wind farm. Lowering the axial <b>induction</b> <b>factor</b> allows for more wind to pass through the upstream wind turbines reducing the wake loss effects so that downwind turbines can produce more power. Through this research it has been shown that with the optimization of the axial induction factors a 4 % to 6 % increase in power can be obtained depending on the size of the wind farm, the turbine spacing, and the number of turbines controlled. Additionally comparisons are made to the wake loss effects observed at the Horns Rev wind farm as well as wind farm control experiments performed in a wind tunnel at the Energy research Center of the Netherlands.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to purify the compound and describe factors affecting its production, with particular emphasis on food-relevant factors. Amino acid sequencing showed that the compound is a class IIa bacteriocin with an N-terminal amino acid sequence identical to that of carnobacteriocin B 2. The production of the bacteriocin was autoinducible, and the threshold level for induction was 9. 6 × 10 − 10 M. We also report, for the first time, that acetate acts as an <b>induction</b> <b>factor,</b> with a threshold concentration of 0. 3 to 12 mM.

40|$|Understanding the {{velocity}} field information near the rotor plane of a wind turbine at various operating conditions {{is very important}} to understanding the aerodynamic performance of the wind turbine. Investigation of these flow fields has been an important area of study in experimental fluid dynamics for the last few decades. It is more convenient and cost effective to perform experiments with scaled-down model wind turbines rather than taking measurements around a full-scale model. Along with different experimental techniques, computational models to predict the performance of wind turbines have been developing. The basis of most of the commercially available codes is the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) method. However, the applicability and performance of these codes are often questionable at different operating conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to validate these codes with different wind turbine designs under a large variety of operating conditions. In this research project, two-dimensional PIV measurements near the rotor plane of a three-bladed, horizontal axis model wind turbine were taken at six different operating conditions and at 15 azimuthal angles. The results are presented in terms of axial <b>induction</b> <b>factor.</b> The radial distribution of axial <b>induction</b> <b>factor</b> at the rotor plane was compared to the results obtained from WT_Perf, a typical BEM method. BEM fails to predict of the value of axial <b>induction</b> <b>factor</b> at the tip region for most of the operating conditions. However, the predictions are good at the root region. At the mid-span region, BEM has good predictions for operating conditions higher than the optimum operating condition, better in the optimum operating conditions and differs significantly at the operating conditions lower than optimum tip-speed ratio.

40|$|Enterocin A is a small, heat-stable, antilisterial {{bacteriocin}} {{produced by}} Enterococcus faecium DPC 1146. The sequence of a 10, 879 -bp chromosomal region containing at least 12 open reading frames (ORFs), 7 {{of which are}} predicted {{to play a role}} in enterocin biosynthesis, is presented. The genes entA, entI, and entF encode the enterocin A prepeptide, the putative immunity protein, and the <b>induction</b> <b>factor</b> prepeptide, respectively. The deduced proteins EntK and EntR resemble the histidine kinase and response regulator proteins of two-component signal transducing systems of the AgrC-AgrA type. The predicted proteins EntT and EntD are homologous to ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters and accessory factors, respectively, of several other bacteriocin systems and to proteins implicated in the signal-sequence-independent export of Escherichia coli hemolysin A. Immediately downstream of the entT and entD genes are two ORFs, the product of one of which, ORF 4, is very similar to the product of the yteI gene of Bacillus subtilis and to E. coli protease IV, a signal peptide peptidase known to be involved in outer membrane lipoprotein export. Another potential bacteriocin is encoded in the opposite direction to the other genes in the enterocin cluster. This putative bacteriocin-like peptide is similar to LafX, one of the components of the lactacin F complex. A deletion which included one of two direct repeats upstream of the entA gene abolished enterocin A activity, immunity, and ability to induce bacteriocin production.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve the cost-effectiveness and production efficiency of wind farms using cooperative control. The key factors in determining the power production and the loading for a wind turbine are the nacelle yaw and blade pitch angles. However, the nacelle and blade angles may adjust the wake direction and intensity in a way that may adversely affect the performance of other wind turbines in the wind farm. Conventional wind-turbine control methods maximize the power production of a single turbine, but can lower the overall wind-farm power efficiency due to wake interference. This paper introduces a cooperative game concept to derive the power production of individual wind turbine so that the total wind-farm power efficiency is optimized. Based on a wake interaction model relating the yaw offset angles and the <b>induction</b> <b>factors</b> of wind turbines to the wind speeds experienced by the wind turbines, an optimization problem is formulated with the {{objective of}} maximizing the sum of the power production of a wind farm.
