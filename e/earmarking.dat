40|$|Congressional <b>earmarks</b> {{have been}} the subject of {{significant}} political debate in recent years. Also known as “pork barrel spending,” <b>earmarks</b> are budgetary requests made by a single legislator that typically circumvent the traditional competitive bidding process designed to ensure the efficient use of public dollars. Utilizing annual state-level estimates of pork barrel spending, we briefly examine the factors influencing states’ receipt of <b>earmarked</b> funds from Congress. Results indicate that on average smaller states receive the largest amount of per capita <b>earmarked</b> funding, most likely as a result of their disproportionate influence in the Senate. In addition, the presence of a Republican Congressional delegation increases pork spending in the state.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedEarmark spending {{has come under}} attack by, and scrutiny of, government watchdog groups, the media and some fiscal conservatives in Congress because of the political corruption that has centered around its use, {{the increase in the}} amount of new <b>earmarks</b> being requested and funded, and because of the waste thought to be associated with <b>earmarked</b> spending. As a result, Congress has considered a series of <b>earmark</b> reforms, focused primarily on reforming Senate and House rules to ensure better control of the appropriations process and also providing transparency and accountability of all <b>earmark</b> requests and spending. Of the numerous reform bills and resolutions introduced in the Senate and House during the 110 th Congress, one bill and one resolution became law. The Honest Leadership and Government Act of 2007 was intended to provide greater transparency of <b>earmarks</b> requested during committee mark-ups and in conference. House Resolution 491, "Providing for <b>Earmark</b> Reform," discouraged the unauthorized insertion of <b>earmarks</b> into the language of conference reports. Although total <b>earmarked</b> spending and the number of <b>earmarks</b> declined slightly following passage of these measures, there is little evidence to suggest cause and effect. This was apparent after the passage of the FY 2009 spending package when congressional leaders were criticized for failing to offer lawmakers and the public sufficient time and opportunity to adequately scrutinize all <b>earmark</b> requests.

The legislation also escrowed proceeds until the 1990 General Assembly and specified that the first expenditures from those proceeds would fund a one-time bonus to veterans of the Vietnam War.

40|$|<b>Earmarked</b> {{funds are}} {{mentioned}} in the Polish Public Finances Act {{as one of the}} five organisational legal forms of budget management. This article deals with their legal status. Establishing the legal status of <b>earmarked</b> funds requires a comparative analysis based on administrative and tax law. As an introduction the author discussed the notion of a fund both in colloquial and legal language. Next she analysed the dogmatic and legal definition of this notion on the basis of regulations in force and the doctrine of financial law, pointing to inaccuracies in legal regulations. As a result there are considerable interpretative difficulties e. g. in establishing a catalogue of <b>earmarked</b> funds. From the financial and legal point of view it was necessary to consider the legal nature c f revenue and expenditure and the nature of financial plan of <b>earmarked</b> funds. The relation between plans of <b>earmarked</b> funds and budgetary acts and resolutions was also emphasised. The issues of the legal from of <b>earmarked</b> funds and the nature of property administered by the funds required a civil legal analysis. The analysis of administrative legal status of <b>earmarked</b> funds is based on the organisational and territorial structures of particular funds, the nature and competence of fund agencies. It seems that the essence of funds was not taken into consideration properly in the Polish tax law. <b>Earmarked</b> funds functioning on the basis of regulations in the Public Finances Act enjoy exemption from tax. Still, the way the issue is settled is debatable. Legal forms on which <b>earmarked</b> funds are based are non-uniform and casuistic. For that reason establishing a catalogue of universal legal properties of <b>earmarked</b> funds is problematic...|$|R
