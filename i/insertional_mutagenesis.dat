25|$|<b>Insertional</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> – If the DNA is {{integrated}} in a sensitive {{spot in the}} genome, for example in a tumor suppressor gene, the therapy could induce a tumor. This has occurred in clinical trials for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) patients, in which hematopoietic stem cells were transduced with a corrective transgene using a retrovirus, and {{this led to the}} development of T cell leukemia in 3 of 20 patients. One possible solution is to add a functional tumor suppressor gene to the DNA to be integrated. This may be problematic since the longer the DNA is, the harder it is to integrate into cell genomes.

PhgC has a domain with similarity to diacylglycerol kinases of eukaryotes and is the first described member of a family of related proteins found in many gram-positive bacteria. phgA and phgC mutant strains were constructed by <b>insertional</b> duplication <b>mutagenesis</b> and found to have impaired growth under conditions of high osmotic and oxidative stress.

The phgA and phgC mutant strains were reduced in virulence in models of both systemic and pulmonary infection. As the virulence of the phgA mutant strain was not restored in gp 91 phox−/− mice and the phgA and phgC mutant strains had reduced growth in both blood and serum, the reduced virulence of these strains is unlikely to be due to increased sensitivity to the respiratory burst of phagocytes but is, instead, due to impaired growth at physiological osmolality...|$|R

40|$|The first {{bacterial}} N-linked glycosylation {{system was}} discovered in Campylobacter jejuni, and the key enzyme involved in the coupling of glycan to asparagine residues within the acceptor sequon of the glycoprotein is the oligosaccharyltransferase PglB. Emerging genome sequence data have revealed that pglB orthologues are present in a subset of species from the Deltaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria, including three Helicobacter species: H. pullorum, H. canadensis, and H. winghamensis. In contrast to C. jejuni, in which a single pglB gene is located within a larger gene cluster encoding the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of the N-linked glycan, these Helicobacter species contain two unrelated pglB genes (pglB 1 and pglB 2), neither of which is located within a larger locus involved in protein glycosylation. In complementation experiments, the H. pullorum PglB 1 protein, but not PglB 2, was able to transfer C. jejuni N-linked glycan onto an acceptor protein in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the characterized C. jejuni N-glycosylation system with an in vitro oligosaccharyltransferase assay followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry demonstrated the utility of this approach, and when applied to H. pullorum, PglB 1 -dependent N glycosylation with a linear pentasaccharide was observed. This reaction required an acidic residue at the − 2 position of the N-glycosylation sequon, as for C. jejuni. Attempted <b>insertional</b> knockout <b>mutagenesis</b> of the H. pullorum pglB 2 gene was unsuccessful, suggesting that it is essential.

We defined the iron-responsive idiA promoter by using <b>insertional</b> inactivation <b>mutagenesis</b> and reporter gene assays. A 67 -bp DNA region was sufficient for full iron deficiency-inducible idiA promoter activity. Within this fragment is a palindromic sequence 4 bp upstream of a putative − 35 promoter element, which resembles the binding site of FNR/CAP-type helix-turn-helix transcription factors. The absence of this palindromic sequence or a 3 -bp mutation in a putative − 10 region eliminated promoter activity completely. A previously identified candidate for a positively acting transcription factor is the IdiB protein, whose gene lies immediately downstream of idiA. IdiB shows strong similarity to helix-turn-helix transcription factors of the FNR/CAP family. A His 6 x-tagged IdiB that was overexpressed in Escherichia coli bound to a 59 -bp fragment of the idiA regulatory region that included the palindrome. Although the idiA promoter lacks a consensus binding site for the iron-sensing regulator Fur, we attempted to inactivate fur in order to investigate the potential role of this factor.

The use of these two assays and the nitrite reductase assay allowed a detailed study {{not only of the}} correlation between nitrite reductase and nitrosation but also between nitrous oxide reductase and nitrosation in Neisseria subflava. The three activities have been studied with various electron donors and inhibitors and also with cells grown under various conditions. Maximum activities were:- Nitrite reductase 1130 nmol/min/mg protein with lactate as electron donor, Nitrous oxide reductase 7. 17 ^unol/min/mg protein with glucose as electron donor 7 and nitrosation 427 nmol/min/mg protein with ethanol as electron donor. When this work was coupled with the production of N. subflava mutants deficient in different aspects of denitrification using <b>insertional</b> transposon <b>mutagenesis</b> it provided a wealth of information regarding the correlation between denitrification and bacterial nitrosation. The strains of N. subflava isolated from the achlorhydric stomach were all able to nitrosate. The ability to nitrosate required the reduction of nitrite but nitrite reductase itself was unable to catalyse nitrosation. Reactions involving nitrous oxide, nitrous oxide reductase and dinitrogen were shown to have no involvement in bacterial nitrosation. Leaving only nitric oxide and nitric oxide reductase as possible connections between bacterial nitrosation and denitrification. With the knowledge that oxygen was required for bacterial nitrosation and the growth conditions necessary to induce bacterial nitrosation a hypothesis could be proposed to connect nitrosation activity and denitrification: Nitric oxide may accumulate following nitrite reduction and could be subsequently oxidised (by molecular oxygen) to produce dinitrogen trioxide and dinitrogen tetroxide. These two products are known to be very powerful nitrosating agents which can then react with amines, amides and ureas to produce various N-nitroso compounds. As the strains of N. subflava used in this work were gastric isolates it is plausible that these reactions producing N-nitroso compounds could occur in the stomach. This would account for the high risk from gastric cancer seen in patients whose gastric pH is close to 7 allowing bacteria to colonise the stomach...|$|R

Full-length AE 1, when expressed in transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) - 293 or COS- 7 cells, retained a high-mannose oligosaccharide structure. Scanning N-glycosylation mutagenesis of EC loop 4 showed that N-glycosylation acceptor sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) spaced 12 residues from the ends of adjacent transmembrane segments could be N-glycosylated. An acceptor site introduced at position 743 in intracellular (IC) loop 5 that could be N-glycosylated in a cell-free translation system was not N-glycosylated in transfected cells. Mutations designed to disrupt the folding of this loop enhanced the level of N-glycosylation at Asn 743 in vitro. The results suggest that this loop might be transiently exposed to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum during biosynthesis but normally folds rapidly, precluding N-glycosylation. EC loop 4 insertions into positions 428, 484, 754 and 854 in EC loops 1, 2, 6 and 7 respectively were efficiently N-glycosylated, showing that these regions were extracellular. EC loop 4 insertions into positions 731 or 785 were poorly N-glycosylated, which was inconsistent with an extracellular disposition for these regions of AE 1. Insertion of EC loop 4 into positions 599 and 820 in IC loops 3 and 6 respectively were not N-glycosylated in cells, which was consistent with a cytosolic disposition for these loops. Inhibitor-affinity chromatography with 4 -acetamido- 4 '-isothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulphonate (SITS) -Affi-Gel was used to assess whether the AE 1 mutants were in a native state. Mutants with insertions at positions 428, 484, 599, 731 and 785 showed impaired inhibitor binding, whereas insertions at positions 754, 820 and 854 retained binding. The results indicate that the folding of the C-terminal region of AE 1 is more complex than originally proposed and that this region of the transporter might have a dynamic aspect...|$|R
