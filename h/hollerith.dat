50|$|Fredrik Bull {{was sent}} abroad to study <b>Hollerith's</b> systems, {{returning}} with {{the conviction that}} <b>Hollerith's</b> systems were expensive and unstable. He was convinced that he could develop a device that was cheaper and more efficient than <b>Hollerith's.</b> As a result, Bull convinced his employer, Storebrand, to pay him an advance of $10,000 {{to develop a new}} machine. The terms of the deal required the advance to be repaid in full if the machine was not successful.|$|R

They shall be identified properly by a document with photo and the server's <b>holleriths</b> showing the contribution when entering the hospital.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{automatic}} {{data processing}} was applied to operations performed by means of unit record equipment, such as Herman <b>Hollerith's</b> application of punched card equipment for the 1890 United States Census. [...] "Using <b>Hollerith's</b> punchcard equipment, the Census Office was able to complete tabulating most of the 1890 census data in 2 to 3 years, compared with 7 to 8 years for the 1880 census.... It is also estimated that using Herman <b>Hollerith's</b> system saved some $5 million in processing costs" [...] (in 1890 dollars) even with twice as many questions as during 1880.|$|R
25|$|Earlier, Herman <b>Hollerith</b> {{developed}} the first keypunch devices, which soon evolved to include keys for text and number entry akin to normal typewriters by the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hollerith</b> {{initially}} {{did business}} {{under his own}} name, as The <b>Hollerith</b> Electric Tabulating System, specializing in punched card data processing equipment. He provided tabulators and other machines under contract for the Census Office, which used them for the 1890 census. The net effect of the many changes from the 1880 census: the larger population, the data items to be collected, the Census Bureau headcount, the scheduled publications, {{and the use of}} Hollerith's electromechanical tabulators, was to reduce the time required to process the census from eight years for the 1880 census to six years for the 1890 census.|$|E
25|$|Until the mid-1970s, the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway (then the Northwest Tollway) used {{a ticket}} {{system on the}} segment between Elgin and Beloit to collect tolls based upon the exact mileage traveled. Drivers were handed a <b>Hollerith</b> card when they entered the segment and paid a toll when they left.|$|E

25|$|The {{tabulating machine}} is an {{electrical}} device designed {{to assist in}} summarizing information and, later, accounting. The results of a tabulation are electrically coupled with a sorter while displayed on clock-like dials. The concept of automated data processing had been born. In 1890, Herman <b>Hollerith</b> invented the mechanical tabulating machine, a design used during the 1890 Census which stored and processed demographic and statistical information on punched cards.|$|E
25|$|A {{keypunch}} is {{a device}} for manually entering data into punched cards by precisely punching holes at locations {{designated by the}} keys struck by the operator. Early keypunches were manual devices. Later keypunches were mechanized, often resembling a small desk, with a keyboard similar to a typewriter, and with hoppers for blank cards and stackers for punched cards. In 1901, Herman <b>Hollerith</b> invented and patented the mechanical key punch that was operated by keys, like a typewriter, and that advanced the card automatically to the next column after each punch. Later models would be motor driven with rudimentary programming features.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the urging}} of John Shaw Billings, <b>Hollerith</b> {{developed}} a mechanism using electrical connections to increment a counter, recording information. [...] A key idea was that a datum could be recorded by {{the presence or absence}} of a hole at a specific location on a card. For example, if a specific hole location indicates marital status, then a hole there can indicate married while not having a hole indicates single. [...] <b>Hollerith</b> determined that data in specified locations on a card, the now-familiar rows and columns, could be counted or sorted electromechanically. A description of this system, An Electric Tabulating System (1889), was submitted by <b>Hollerith</b> to Columbia University as his doctoral thesis, and is reprinted in Randell's book. On January 8, 1889, <b>Hollerith</b> was issued U.S. Patent 395,782, claim 2 of which reads: ...|$|E

5000|$|... 1919: Fredrik Rosing Bull, after {{studying}} <b>Hollerith's</b> machines, constructs a prototype 'ordering, recording and adding machine' (tabulator) {{of his own}} design. About a dozen machines were produced during the following several years for his employer.|$|R
2500|$|Jacquard loom, <b>Hollerith</b> punch cards, {{telegraphy}} and telephony—the electromechanical relay: Bell and Newell (1971) {{indicate that}} the Jacquard loom (1801), precursor to <b>Hollerith</b> cards (punch cards, 1887), and [...] "telephone switching technologies" [...] were the roots of a tree leading {{to the development of}} the first computers. By the mid-19th century the telegraph, the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, its discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as [...] "dots and dashes" [...] a common sound. By the late 19th century the ticker tape (ca 1870s) was in use, as was the use of <b>Hollerith</b> cards in the 1890 U.S. census. Then came the teleprinter (ca. 1910) with its punched-paper use of Baudot code on tape.|$|E
2500|$|Herman <b>Hollerith</b> {{was born}} the son of German {{immigrant}} Prof. Georg <b>Hollerith</b> from Großfischlingen (near Neustadt an der Weinstraße) in Buffalo, New York, where he spent his early childhood. He entered the City College of New York in 1875, graduated from the Columbia University School of Mines with an [...] "Engineer of Mines" [...] degree in 1879 at age 19, and in 1890 asked for (and was awarded) a Ph.D based on his development of the tabulating system. In 1882 <b>Hollerith</b> joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he taught mechanical engineering and conducted his first experiments with punched cards. [...] He eventually moved to Washington, D.C., living in Georgetown, with a home on 29th Street and a business building at 31st Street and the C Canal, where today there is a commemorative plaque installed by IBM. He died in Washington D.C. of a heart attack.|$|E
2500|$|Herman <b>Hollerith</b> (February 29, 1860 – November 17, 1929) was an American {{inventor}} {{who developed}} an electromechanical punched card tabulator {{to assist in}} summarizing information and, later, accounting. He was {{the founder of the}} Tabulating Machine Company that was [...] amalgamated (via stock acquisition) in 1911 with three other companies to form a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company later renamed IBM. <b>Hollerith</b> is {{regarded as one of the}} seminal figures in the development of data processing. His invention of the punched card tabulating machine marks the beginning of the era of semiautomatic data processing systems, and his concept dominated that landscape for nearly a century.|$|E
50|$|Powers {{managed to}} invent his own system which bore no {{resemblance}} to <b>Hollerith's</b> one. The system included the whole set of machines, necessary for tabulating, namely, the electric card punch, card verifier, sorting machine, and printing tabulator.|$|R
25|$|In 1911 four corporations, {{including}} <b>Hollerith's</b> firm, were amalgamated {{to form a}} fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). Under {{the presidency}} of Thomas J. Watson, CTR was renamed International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) in 1924. By 1933 The Tabulating Machine Company name had disappeared as subsidiary companies were subsumed by IBM.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Hollerith</b> {{had left}} {{teaching}} and begun {{working for the}} United States Census Bureau in the year he filed his first patent application. Titled [...] "Art of Compiling Statistics", it was filed on September 23, 1884; U.S. Patent 395,782 was granted on January 8, 1889.|$|E
2500|$|The 1921 census {{introduced}} {{automatic machine}} tabulation equipment, hired from England for the census. [...] Three punched cards {{were used to}} store individual, dwelling and family information. The cards were processed using an electric sorting machine prior to final totalling with an electric tabulator machine, devised by Herman <b>Hollerith.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1896 <b>Hollerith</b> {{founded the}} Tabulating Machine Company (in 1905 renamed The Tabulating Machine Company). Many major census bureaus {{around the world}} leased his {{equipment}} and purchased his cards, as did major insurance companies. Hollerith's machines were used for censuses in England, Italy, Germany, Russia, Austria, Canada, France, Norway, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines, {{and again in the}} 1900 census.|$|E
5000|$|... 1911: James Powers forms Powers Tabulating Machine Company, later renamed Powers Accounting Machine Company. Powers {{had been}} {{employed}} by the Census Bureau to work on tabulating machine development and was given the right to patent his inventions there. The machines he developed sensed card punches mechanically, as opposed to <b>Hollerith's</b> electric sensing.|$|R
50|$|He {{invented the}} first {{automatic}} card-feed mechanism {{and the first}} keypunch. The 1890 Tabulator was hardwired to operate on 1890 Census cards. A control panel in his 1906 Type I Tabulator simplified rewiring for different jobs. The 1920s removable control panel supported prewiring and near instant job changing. These inventions were among {{the foundations of the}} data processing industry and <b>Hollerith's</b> punched cards (later used for computer input/output) continued in use for almost a century.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Beverley Fenbyhttps://books.google.com/books?id=WDxEAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA2641 was an {{inventor}} in St Johns, Worcester, England. who designed a device called the “Electro-Magnetic Phonoscope”,. His concept detailed {{a system that}} would record a sequence of keyboard strokes onto paper tape. Although no model or workable device was ever made, it is often seen as {{a link to the}} concept of punched paper for player piano rolls (1880s), as well as Herman <b>Hollerith's</b> punch card tabulator (used in the 1890 census), a distant precursor to the modern computer.|$|R
