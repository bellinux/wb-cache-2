25|$|One of {{his star}} {{students}} was Rabbi Shlomo Wahrman, a tremendous Torah scholar {{who came from}} Leipzig for fifteen years {{and went on to}} becoming principal and Rosh Yeshiva of the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County. Rabbi Wahrman attributes his success to Rabbi Silver’s insistence and encouragement to hone his writing skills and record his copious chidushei Torah. Rabbi Wahrman writes in the short biography he published on Rabbi Silver:I remember at times he screamed at me for lack of understanding-however, even then <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> his great love and concern for me and not the slightest hint of hatred. Rabbi Silver was a man whose very essence was giving to others-his ahavas yisroel (love for his fellow Jew) knew no bounds…he saw every Jew as an extension of himself.|$|E

[...] He went on to comment that the novel only [...] "offers the frustrated Bond addict... a small academic problem, of swiftly passing interest." [...] The Daily Mirrors reviewer, Alexander Muir considered the book to be [...] "an exciting, violent, sadistic and sexy piece of reading matter", although, partly because of Amis' abilities as a writer, Colonel Sun [...] "is altogether too meticulous and well written – Fleming was a hypnotic but slapdash writer. And, at times, <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> parody. This could be fatal." ...|$|E
500|$|As a {{freshman}} at Fairfax High School, Slovak formed a band with Irons on drums and two other high school friends, Alain Johannes and Todd Strassman. They called their band Chain Reaction, then changed the name to Anthem after their first gig. [...] After one of the group's shows, Slovak met audience member Anthony Kiedis, and invited him to his house for a snack. [...] Kiedis later described the experience in his autobiography Scar Tissue: [...] "Within {{a few minutes of}} hanging out with Hillel, <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> that he was absolutely different from most of the people I'd spent time with...He understood a lot about music, he was a great visual artist, and he had a sense of self and a calm about him that were just riveting." [...] Slovak, Kiedis and Flea became best friends and often used LSD, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine recreationally.|$|E

500|$|The actor Richard Harris {{bought the}} lease for £75,000 in 1969 after {{discovering}} that the American entertainer Liberace {{had made an}} offer but had not put down a deposit. Reading of the intended sale in the Evening Standard, Harris bought it the following day, describing his purchase as the biggest gift he had ever given himself. In his autobiography, the entertainer Danny La Rue recalled visiting the house with Liberace, writing, [...] "It was a strange building and had eerie murals painted on the ceiling... <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> evil". Meeting La Rue later, Harris said {{he had found the}} house haunted by the ghosts of children from an orphanage that had previously occupied the site and that he had placated them by buying them toys. Harris employed the original decorators, Campbell Smith & Company Ltd., to carry out restoration, using Burges's drawings from the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E
500|$|Director Ole Christian Madsen {{had read}} the book They Saw It Happen about the Nazi Resistance when he was 12. He was {{especially}} attracted by {{the story of the}} pair because of their moral ambiguity. Madsen stated, [...] "They both fascinated and scared me, and <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> there was something dark and untold in their story." [...] He [...] "wanted to make a film that would revive and reassess their reputation". Years later, he met writer Lars K. Andersen, who had also read the book during his childhood, and this led them to envision a film. The project started in 1999; the idea for the film did not attract sponsors because it was viewed as [...] "past history" [...] or because it portrayed the resistance [...] "outrageously". This was precisely one of Madsen's objectives: to talk about their story because Danish wartime archives listed many fatalities simply as casualties of war instead of counting them as murders, thus [...] "suppress" [...] their real story. He wanted to bring attention to a part of Danish history [...] "the nation has since neglected to talk about", resulting in a [...] "collective misrepresentation".|$|E
500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E

And <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> that immediately, so we did very little talking about it...he said, 'Shut up, I don't want to hear about it.' He didn't want me to tell him about it, you know.

2500|$|Following {{the signing}} of a co-production {{agreement}} between SAL and Soviet broadcaster Gostelradio in 1988, cameras teams went to Siberia, the Volga, the Steppes and the forests and mountains of the Russian Far East to capture images of stunning landscapes and creatures seldom filmed before. The footage was edited into three one-hour films under the generic title The Nature of Russia. A highlight was cameraman Richard Kemp’s nocturnal encounter {{with one of the}} world’s rarest animals, a Siberian tiger. [...] "As he looked towards me <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> his power. It’s something you can’t forget," [...] Kemp said.|$|E
2500|$|Years later, in his autobiography, Brando remarked: [...] "Tony Quinn, whom I admired professionally {{and liked}} personally, played my brother, {{but he was}} {{extremely}} cold to me while we shot that picture. During our scenes together, <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> a bitterness toward me, and if I suggested a drink after work, he either turned me down or else was sullen and said little. Only years later did I learn why." [...] Brando related that, to create on-screen tension between the two, [...] "Gadg" [...] (Kazan) had told Quinn—who {{had taken over the}} role of Stanley Kowalski on Broadway after Brando had finished—that Brando had been unimpressed with his work. After achieving the desired effect, Kazan never told Quinn that he had misled him. It was only many years later, after comparing notes, that Brando and Quinn realized the deception.|$|E

2500|$|While {{living with}} his father, an engineer, Edgard was pushed to further his {{scientific}} understanding at the Institute Technique, {{a high school in}} Italy that specialized in teaching mathematics and science. It was here where Edgard became particularly interested in the works of Leonardo da Vinci. It was through Edgard's love of science that he began to study sound, as he later recalled [...] "When I was about twenty, I came across a definition of music that seemed suddenly to throw light on my gropings toward music <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> could exist. Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński, the Polish physicist, chemist, musicologist and philosopher {{of the first half of}} the nineteenth century, defined music as 'the corporealization of the intelligence that is in sounds.' It was a new and exciting conception and to me the first that started me thinking of music as spatial—as moving bodies of sound in space, a conception I gradually made my own." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kiedis {{also met}} future bandmate Slovak after seeing him perform with his band Anthym. After the show, Slovak invited Kiedis {{to his house}} for a snack.

[...] Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea became best friends and often used LSD, heroin, cocaine, and speed recreationally. Despite his frequent drug use, he excelled in school, often receiving straight A grades. In June 1980, Kiedis graduated with honors from high school. That August, he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles to study writing. However, he dropped out {{at the beginning of his}} second year due to his worsening addiction to cocaine and heroin.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the age of}} 10, Theile {{was enjoying}} success at local {{swimming}} carnivals, so his father offered to arrange {{for him to be}} coached, but left Theile with the choice of coaches. Of the two coaches in the town, Theile chose Arthur Cusack, who had a reputation as a physical training instructor of whom Theile recounted as being [...] "tough and enthusiastic. All my friends avoided him....somehow <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> that it was an important decision." [...] Cusack turned out to be his lifelong coach. Under the guidance of Cusack, Maryborough Swimming Club challenged the metropolitan clubs in Brisbane for statewide supremacy. Theile won Queensland junior and open titles in all four strokes. In 1954, at the age of 16, he came second in the open backstroke, and after becoming the national junior champion that year, he decided to concentrate on the given stroke. In 1955, he captured the 110yd backstroke title at the Australian Championships in Adelaide. At the same time, Theile completed his secondary education and was awarded an academic scholarship to study medicine at the University of Queensland.|$|E
