5|$|The {{nature of}} the work carried out by {{accountants}} and auditors requires a high level of ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an informed decision about investment. They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company. Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.|$|E

Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, the researchers examined 812 cases with sufficient <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an appropriate determination, and found that 2.1% of these were classified by police as false reports. All of these complainants were then charged or threatened with charges for filing a false police report.|$|E

But Steitz never responded. Kean was particularly interested in Steitz's source of <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such a statement, since he also indicated there were no surviving records and the court-ordered search also turned up no relevant records.|$|E
25|$|Reeves and Nass ran {{the test}} again but added a voice speaker to both {{computers}} that would verbally communicate <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the human-social theme more explicit. The test resulted in {{almost exactly the}} same results. They concluded that people are polite to computers in both verbal and textual scenarios. The respondents did not need much of a cue to respond socially to the computers. The experiment proves that social rules can apply to media and computers can be social initiators. Participants denied being intentionally polite to the computer, but the results suggest differently.|$|E

25|$|It is {{expected}} {{for children to}} develop gender-typed behavioural cues given that children often use gender-related <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> judgments. Society often rewards shared traditional behaviours, especially for men, and thus having progressed to a cross-gender development can lead to unwanted criticisms and punishment. Therefore, when children undergo atypical gender development, due to both genetic and environmental contributors, it can drastically alter normal development from a person’s sense of self-worth, self-esteem, to feelings of acceptance. When the child identifies as the opposite sex, {{he or she is}} then diagnosed with gender dysphoria (often termed gender identity disorder or GID).|$|E
25|$|In {{fulfillment}} of its charter, DACS engages {{in a continuous}} cycle of data and information collection, analysis, and dissemination.

25|$|When World War II {{broke out}} in September 1939, Cartier-Bresson joined the French Army as a Corporal in the Film and Photo unit. During the Battle of France, in June 1940 at St. Dié in the Vosges Mountains, he was {{captured}} by German soldiers and spent 35 months in prisoner-of-war camps doing forced labor under the Nazis. He twice {{tried and failed to}} escape from the prison camp, and was punished by solitary confinement. His third escape was successful and he hid on a farm in Touraine before getting false papers that allowed him to travel in France. In France, he worked for the underground, aiding other escapees and working secretly with other photographers to cover the Occupation and then the Liberation of France. In 1943, he dug up his beloved Leica camera, which he had buried in farmland near Vosges. At {{the end of the war}} he was asked by the American Office of War <b>Information</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a documentary, Le Retour (The Return) about returning French prisoners and displaced persons.|$|E

On June 23, in {{retaliation}} for the passage of the immigration enforcement bill Arizona SB 1070, LulzSec released a cache of documents from the Arizona Department of Public Safety, including the personal information and home addresses of many law enforcement officers. On June 22, LulzSecBrazil took down the websites of the Government of Brazil and the President of Brazil. Later data dumps included the names, addresses, phone numbers, Internet passwords, and Social Security numbers of police officers in Arizona, Missouri, and Alabama. Antisec members also stole police officer credit card <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> donations to various causes.|$|E

This [...] "cascade" [...] structure accounts for differences in the time required to make a metamemory judgment; judgments which occur quickly are based on cue familiarity, while slower responses are based on both cue familiarity and accessibility.|$|E

2500|$|Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, dissenting, {{argued that}} [...] "the {{imperative}} {{of a free}} and unfettered press comes into collision with another imperative, the effective functioning of a complex modern government", {{that there should be}} a detailed study on the effects of these actions. He argued that in the haste of the proceedings, and given the size of the documents, the Court was unable to gather enough <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a decision. He also argued that the Times should have discussed the possible societal repercussions with the Government prior to publication of the material. The Chief Justice did not argue that the Government had met the aforementioned standard, but rather that the decision should not have been made so hastily.|$|E
2500|$|The Special Board {{made its}} {{first visit to the}} wreck of the Maine on September 10, 1910, {{measuring}} the site and taking soundings. Preliminary borings and additional soundings were made the following week, giving the Special Board enough <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> more formal plans for salvaging the wreck. The Maine was found to be lying in [...] of water, and the Corps of Engineers believed that 75 bodies lay within the wreck of the Maine. (Contemporary accounts claim that only 68 bodies were missing.) The first human remains aboard the Maine were found near the rear cabins on September 22, 1910, while measurements and soundings were taken. Cuban divers examining the wreck discovered the bones, but did not disturb them.|$|E

2500|$|Blackmun further {{described}} how the court’s past precedent had whittled down the “commercial speech” exemption through past precedent; for example, Bigelow v. Virginia, , {{in which the}} Court struck down a Virginia statute prohibiting the advertisement of out-of-state abortion procedures. [...] He also distinguished commercial speech from such “unprotected” categories of speech such as “fighting words” and obscenity. [...] Nor does having a purely economic interest {{in the content of}} speech deprive the speaker or listener of the protection of the First Amendment. [...] This is especially true for the consumers in this case, as the poor, elderly, and infirm needed access to such <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> informed decisions about how to get their prescriptions filled inexpensively. [...] For such people in need, Blackmun reasoned, such information was more than simply a convenience. [...] Furthermore, he stressed the importance of price advertising in a free market economy, because they serve to provide the underlying information for citizens to make private economic decisions.|$|E
2500|$|Engineering {{is quite}} {{different}} from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined. [...] In the past engineers working on new designs found {{that they did not have}} all the required <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.|$|E
2500|$|When the Air Force {{finally made}} Special Report #14 public in October 1955, it was {{claimed that the}} report scientifically proved that UFOs did not exist. Critics of this claim note that the report {{actually}} proved that the [...] "unknowns" [...] were distinctly different from the [...] "knowns" [...] {{at a very high}} statistical significance level. The Air Force also incorrectly claimed that only 3% of the cases studied were unknowns, instead of the actual 22%. They further claimed that the residual 3% would probably disappear if more complete data were available. Critics counter that this ignored the fact that the analysts had already thrown such cases into the category of [...] "insufficient information", whereas both [...] "knowns" [...] and [...] "unknowns" [...] were deemed to have sufficient <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a determination. Also the [...] "unknowns" [...] tended to represent the higher quality cases, q.e. reports that already had better information and witnesses.|$|E
