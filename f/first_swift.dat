The first station to be completed, a training facility at the Merrill Creek bus base, was opened during a media event on May 5, 2009; in September 2009, the first station on the line was completed at 196th Street in Lynnwood.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand Motor Bodies {{assembled}} the <b>first</b> <b>Swift,</b> no. 456, for the agents {{to use as}} a demonstration. It was purchased by the Board and entered service in 1973. Board general manager Fardell had hoped to purchase additional Swifts but was unable to obtain approval to do so. The local agent, in anticipation of further business with the Board, had imported a further two chassis, but these ended up in storage when not purchased. When the Board finally purchased them in 1977, they were assembled by Hawke Brothers and commenced their duties as nos. 457 and 458, with the same internal configuration as no. 456.|$|E

2500|$|Formally, the satire in the Tale is {{historically}} novel for several reasons. <b>First,</b> <b>Swift</b> {{more or less}} invented prose parody. In the [...] "Apology for the [...] " [...] (added in 1710), Swift explains that his work is, in several places, a [...] "parody," [...] which is where he imitates the style of persons he wishes to expose. What is interesting is that the word [...] "parody" [...] had not been used for prose before, and the definition he offers is arguably a parody of John Dryden defining [...] "parody" [...] in the Discourse of Satire (the Preface to Dryden's translations of Juvenal's and Persius' satires). Prior to Swift, parodies were imitations designed to bring mirth, but not primarily {{in the form of}} mockery. Dryden imitated the Aeneid in [...] "MacFlecknoe" [...] to describe the apotheosis of a dull poet, but the imitation made fun of the poet, not Virgil.|$|E

60|$|The dance-house {{was a large}} {{octagonal}} hut {{built of}} pine logs, partly roofed with grass and soil. It was lighted by a leaping fire in the centre, and by four lanterns on the walls, and as Curtis and his party entered, the clamor (in their honor) redoubled. In a <b>first</b> <b>swift</b> glance Elsie apprehended only a confused, jingling, fluttering mass of color--a chaos of leaping, half-naked forms and a small circle of singers fiercely assaulting a drum which {{sat on the floor}} at the right of the door.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time, Miss Keene noticed a slight irony in Senor Perkins' superabundant fluency, {{and that he}} did not conceal his preoccupation over the silent saluting gun he was still admiring. The {{approach}} of Don Miguel and Padre Esteban with a small bevy of ladies, however, quickly changed her thoughts, and detached the Senor from her side. Her <b>first</b> <b>swift</b> feminine impression of the fair strangers was that they were plain and dowdy, an impression fully shared by the other lady passengers. But her second observation, that they were more gentle, fascinating, child-like, and feminine than her own countrywomen, was purely her own. Their loose, undulating figures, guiltless of stays; their extravagance of short, white, heavily flounced skirt, which looked like a petticoat; their lightly wrapped, formless, and hooded shoulders and heads, lent a suggestion of dishabille that Mrs. Brimmer at once resented.|$|E

60|$|Madeline {{looked from}} the gray valley {{at her feet}} to the blue Sierra Madres, gold-tipped in the setting sun. Her vision embraced in that glance {{distance}} and depth and glory hitherto unrevealed to her. The gray valley sloped and widened to the black sentinel Chiricahuas, and beyond was lost in a vast corrugated sweep of earth, reddening down to the west, where a golden blaze lifted the dark, rugged mountains into bold relief. The scene had infinite beauty. But after Madeline's <b>first</b> <b>swift,</b> all-embracing flash of enraptured eyes, thought of beauty passed away. In that darkening desert there was something illimitable. Madeline saw the hollow of a stupendous hand; she felt a mighty hold upon her heart. Out of the endless space, out of silence and desolation and mystery and age, came slow-changing colored shadows, phantoms of peace, and they whispered to Madeline. They whispered {{that it was a}} great, grim, immutable earth; that time was eternity; that life was fleeting. They whispered for her to be a woman; to love some one before it was too late; to love any one, every one; to realize the need of work, and in doing it to find happiness.|$|E
60|$|The {{shade of}} wall and foliage above, and another jumble of ruined cliff, {{hindered}} his {{survey of the}} ground ahead, and he almost stumbled upon a cabin, hidden on three sides, with a small, bare clearing in front. It was an old, ramshackle structure like others he had run across in the canons. Cautiously he approached and peeped around the corner. At <b>first</b> <b>swift</b> glance it had all the appearance of long disuse. But Jean {{had no time for}} another look. A clip-clop of trotting horses on hard ground brought the same pell-mell rush of sensations that had driven him to wild flight scarcely an hour past. His body jerked with its instinctive impulse, then quivered with his restraint. To turn back would be risky, to run ahead would be fatal, to hide was his one hope. No covert behind! And the clip-clop of hoofs sounded closer. One moment longer Jean held mastery over his instincts of self-preservation. To keep from running was almost impossible. It was the sheer primitive animal sense to escape. He drove it back and glided along the front of the cabin.|$|E
60|$|While Mr. Britling was patrolling {{unimportant}} {{roads and}} entertaining Mr. Van der Pant with discourses upon the nearness of victory and the subtle estimableness {{of all that}} was indolent, wasteful and evasive in English life, the war was passing from its <b>first</b> <b>swift</b> phases into a slower, grimmer struggle. The German retreat ended at the Aisne, and the long outflanking manoeuvres of both hosts towards the Channel began. The English attempts to assist Belgium in October came {{too late for the}} preservation of Antwerp, and after a long and complicated struggle in Flanders the British failed to outflank the German right, lost Ghent, Menin and the Belgian coast, but held Ypres and beat back every attempt of the enemy to reach Dunkirk and Calais. Meanwhile the smaller German colonies and islands were falling to the navy, the Australian battleship Sydney smashed the Emden at Cocos Island, and the British naval disaster of Coronel was wiped out by the battle of the Falklands. The Russians were victorious upon their left and took Lemberg, and after some vicissitudes of fortune advanced to Przemysl, occupying the larger part of Galicia; but the disaster of Tannenberg had broken their progress in East Prussia, and the Germans were pressing towards Warsaw. Turkey had joined the war, and suffered enormous losses in the Caucasus. The Dardanelles had been shelled for the first time, and the British were at Basra on the Euphrates.|$|E

The second version is targeted at the North American market and designated K-10(01) or LSA (for the US Light Sport Aircraft category). This has a wingspan increase of 600 mm, greater fuel capacity and a higher maximum take-off weight.|$|R

60|$|At sunset, {{when the}} strong {{wind from the}} sea was {{beginning}} to feel cold, I stood {{on the top of the}} sandhill looking down at an old woman hurrying about over the low damp ground beneath--a bit of sea-flat divided from the sea by the ridge of sand; and I wondered at her, because her figure was that of a feeble old woman, yet she moved--I had almost said flitted--over that damp level ground in a surprisingly swift light manner, pausing at intervals to stoop and gather something from the surface. But I couldn't see her distinctly enough to satisfy myself: the sun was sinking below the horizon, and that dimness in the air and coldness in the wind at day's decline, when the year too was declining, made all objects look dim. Going down to her I found that she was old, with thin grey hair on an uncovered head, a lean dark face with regular features and grey eyes that were not old and looked steadily at mine, affecting me with a sudden mysterious sadness. For they were unsmiling eyes and themselves expressed an unutterable sadness, as it appeared to me at the <b>first</b> <b>swift</b> glance; or perhaps not that, as it presently seemed, but a shadowy something which sadness had left in them, when all pleasure and all interest in life forsook her, with all affections, and she no longer cherished either memories or hopes. This may be nothing but conjecture or fancy, but if she had been a visitor from another world she could not have seemed more strange to me.|$|E

50|$|The lousefly spends {{its entire}} life cycle {{associated}} with swifts. The adult lousefly produce larvae {{in the late}} summer months which then pupate and lie dormant during the winter months inside the vacated swift nest. These parasites have highly aggregated population distribution and high levels of host prevalence. The adult fly then hatch out in spring when the <b>first</b> <b>swift</b> eggs are laid, by the returning adults, and feed on the blood of the nestlings and the adults, sucking about 25 mg of blood every 5 days. They can be a serious pest of adult and nestling swifts.|$|E
50|$|Two further {{variants}} were designed; the PR Mk 6 was {{an unarmed}} photo reconnaissance variant. However, {{it was a}} short-lived program due to ever-present reheat problems. The last variant was the F Mk 7; this model was the <b>first</b> <b>Swift</b> variant to be fitted with guided missiles, having been armed with the Fairey Fireflash air-to-air missile and was powered by {{a new model of}} the Avon engine. Only fourteen F 7 aircraft were built and none of these ever entered service with the RAF, being relegated - along with its prototype missiles - to conducting guided-missile trials duties only.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second and}} current {{westbound}} bridge opened in 1927, replacing the <b>first</b> <b>Swift</b> Island Ferry Bridge. Built entirely in reinforced concrete; the bridge consist of four 210.0 ft arches, at 1,060.1 ft long and 24.0 ft wide. The bridge originally served NC 74 till 1934, {{when it was}} replaced by NC 27/NC 73. In 1963-1964, NC 24 {{was added to the}} bridge. In 1979, after the completion of a second parallel bridge, the Swift Island Ferry Bridge was renamed, with the new bridge, as the James B. Garrison Bridge, serving two-lanes of westbound NC 24/NC 27/NC 73.|$|E
