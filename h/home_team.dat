Bengaluru FC suffered a shock defeat in the home leg as well, as the team went down 2–3 to Aizawl. C.K. Vineeth's first half equalizer and Sunil Chhetri's successful penalty proved insufficient as Bengaluru FC were ousted from the Federation cup on 3–5 aggregate loss.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell {{retired from}} playing {{as a result}} of an eye {{complaint}} and a knee injury. York drew 1–1 away to Burton Albion, with an own goal scored by Shane Cansdell-Sherriff giving York the lead in the 64th minute before the <b>home</b> <b>team</b> equalised eight minutes later through Billy Kee. Atkinson was released after failing to force himself into the first team and signed for Scarborough Athletic, with whom he had been on loan. York drew 0–0 at home with second-placed Oxford United, in which Carson came closest to scoring with a volley that flashed across the face of the goal. This was followed by another draw after the match awa to Accrington Stanley finished 1–1, with the <b>home</b> <b>team</b> equalising 10 minutes after a Fletcher penalty had given York the lead in the 35th minute.

The <b>home</b> <b>team</b> were 2–0 up by the 19th minute, before Michael Coulson scored York's goal in the 73rd minute. This result meant York would begin 2014 in 22nd-position in the table, only out of the relegation zone on goal difference.|$|E
5|$|Game one {{was held}} in Montreal in a very warm Montreal Forum on September 2 before 18,818 fans. The gamesmanship between the teams started before the first faceoff. Canada was {{assigned}} the <b>home</b> <b>team</b> for all games in Canada, while the Soviets would be the <b>home</b> <b>team</b> in Moscow. The Soviets would not release their lineup until they had seen their opponents', the opposite order, considering they were the visitors. The official scorer {{had to return to}} the Soviets' dressing room and demand the lineup. To Sinden, he wanted to put the Ellis-Clarke-Henderson line on against Valeri Kharlamov's line. The Soviets did not start Kharlamov's line and Sinden named Phil Esposito's line for the opening face-off.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the <b>home</b> <b>team</b> were still leading 1–0.

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI, named after H. D. G. Leveson-Gower. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current Test players be allowed {{to play for the}} hosts. After his demands were met, Bradman named a full-strength team. After the tourists dismissed the <b>home</b> <b>team</b> for 177, Morris made 62 in a 102-run opening stand with Barnes before Yardley bowled him. Australia declared at 8/489 and time ran out with Leveson-Gower's XI at 2/75 after multiple rain delays.|$|E
5|$|Baseball writer-scorers usually {{worked at}} the games played at the home stadium of the team which they covered for their newspaper.

5|$|Donald Bradman's 1948 touring {{party to}} England {{has become known}} to cricket history as The Invincibles, {{remaining}} undefeated in its 31 matches.

In the next match against Yorkshire, Miller took 6/42, including the prized wicket of Hutton, as the <b>home</b> <b>team</b> were demolished for just 71.

5|$|Having {{made only}} 5 and 18 in the {{previous}} Test, Jack Crapp was originally dropped from the team but was reprieved by Washbrook's injury. The England selectors were widely condemned for their decisions, which were seen as an investment in youth rather than necessarily picking the best players available at the time. Their frequent changes meant the <b>home</b> <b>team</b> had used a total of 21 players for the five Tests.|$|E
