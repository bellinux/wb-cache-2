25|$|Automobiles play a great role in American culture, {{whether it}} is in the mundane lives of private {{individuals}} or in the areas of arts and entertainment. The rise of suburbs and the desire for workers to commute to cities brought about the popularization of automobiles. In 2001, 90% of Americans drove to work in cars. Lower energy and land costs favor the production of relatively large, powerful cars. The culture in the 1950s and 1960s often catered to the automobile with motels and drive-in restaurants. Americans tend to view obtaining a driver's license as a rite of passage. Outside of a relative few urban areas, it is considered a necessity <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> to own and drive cars. New York City is the only locality in the United States where {{more than half of all}} households do not own a car.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, a {{study by}} the Cato Institute, a free market think tank, found that legalization of low-skilled illegal {{resident}} workers in the US would result in a net increase in US GDP of $180 billion over ten years. The Cato Institute study did not examine the impact on per capita income <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans.</b> Jason Riley notes that because of progressive income taxation, in which the top 1% of earners pay 37% of federal income taxes (even though they actually pay a lower tax percentage based on their income), 60% of Americans collect more in government services than they pay in, which also reflects on immigrants. In any event, the typical immigrant and his children will pay a net $80,000 more in their lifetime than they collect in government services according to the NAS. Legal immigration policy is set to maximize net taxation. Illegal immigrants even after an amnesty tend to be recipients of more services than they pay in taxes. In 2010, an econometrics study by a Rutgers economist found that immigration helped increase bilateral trade when the incoming people were connected via networks to their country of origin, particularly boosting trade of final goods as opposed to intermediate goods, but that the trade benefit weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into American culture.|$|E

Carey told Helford that he thought he would have been employed in a mid-level management job, which was a relatable job <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> at the time. Carey wanted a show that was about regular people. He also wanted to set the show in Cleveland as it was his hometown and it was not getting a lot of attention. Carey and Helford drove to the city together in January 1995 to do some research. They toured the local bars {{to try to get the}} right look for the show's bar the Warsaw Tavern. Carey and Helford also heard the song [...] "Moon Over Parma" [...] in one of the bars and it was used during the title sequence.|$|E

2500|$|The Marine Corps, {{like any}} other branch of the military, is most visible by the public through public affairs organs and several {{presentation}} units. Dedication to proficiency in drill is {{a hallmark of the}} Silent Drill Platoon, Marine Band, and the Drum and Bugle Corps. In addition, the Corps released periodic recruiting commercials, often about one annually. The traditional tagline for the commercials is [...] "The Few, The Proud, The Marines." [...] While Marines do not have installations across the United States (unlike the Army and Air Force, Marine installations are concentrated in California, North Carolina, and the national capitol region), the direct link <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> to the Corps is the Marine recruiter, often recognizable in the Dress Blue uniform.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kinzer, <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans,</b> {{the crisis}} in Iran became {{just part of the}} {{conflict}} between Communism and [...] "the Free world". [...] "A great sense of fear, particularly the fear of encirclement, shaped American consciousness during this period. ... Soviet power had already subdued Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Communist governments were imposed on Bulgaria and Romania in 1946, Hungary and Poland in 1947, and Czechoslovakia in 1948. Albania and Yugoslavia also turned to communism. Greek communists made a violent bid for power. Soviet soldiers blocked land routes to Berlin for sixteen months. In 1949, the Soviet Union successfully tested a nuclear weapon. That same year, pro-Western forces in China lost their Civil War to communists led by Mao Zedong. From Washington, it seemed that enemies were on the march everywhere." [...] Consequently, [...] "the United States, challenged by what most Americans saw as a relentless communist advance, slowly ceased to view Iran as a country with a unique history that faced a unique political challenge." [...] Some historians, including Douglas Little, Abbas Milani and George Lenczowski have echoed the view that fears of a communist takeover or Soviet influence motivated the U.S. to intervene.|$|E
2500|$|Liberal {{historian}} Eric Alterman {{notes that}} barely 20% of Americans {{are willing to}} accept [...] "liberal" [...] as a political label, but that supermajorities of Americans actually favor [...] "liberal" [...] positions time and again. Alterman points out that resistance to the label [...] "liberal" [...] is not surprising due to billions of dollars worth of investment poured into the denigration of the term. A 2004 poll conducted by the National Election Study found only 35% of respondents questioned identifying as liberal compared to 55% identifying as conservative; a 2004 Pew poll found 19% of respondents identifying as liberal, and 39% identifying as conservative, with the balance identifying as moderate. A 2006 poll found that 19% identified as liberal, and 36% conservative. In 2005, self-identifying moderates polled by Louis Harris & Associates were found to share essentially the same political beliefs as self-identifying liberals, but rejected the world [...] "liberal" [...] because of the vilification heaped on the word itself by conservatives. Alterman acknowledges political scientist Drew Westen's observation that <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans,</b> the word [...] "liberal" [...] now carries meanings such as [...] "elite", [...] "tax and spend", and [...] "out of touch".|$|E

[...] He called for one health care system, equal in quality to the coverage received by Senators and other elected officials, and promised to establish a Patients' Bill of Rights. Edwards proposed one public school system for all, arguing that [...] "None of us believe that the quality of a child's education should be controlled by where they live or the affluence of their community." [...] He appealed {{for the end of the}} two economies, [...] "one for people who are set for life, they know their kids and grandkids are going to be just fine, and then one <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans,</b> people who live paycheck to paycheck." [...] Edwards also stated how the Democrats expected to pay for their agenda: [...] "We're going to roll back â€“ we're going to roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. And we're going to close corporate loopholes. We're going to cut government contractors and wasteful spending. We can move this country forward without passing the burden to our children and our grandchildren." ...|$|E
