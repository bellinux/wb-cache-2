The state also collected fees from customs, professional licenses, and judicial fines. Records show horses and salt were taxed as well as commodities (gold, textiles, perfumes) and agricultural produce (black pepper, paddy, spices, betel leaves, palm leaves, coconuts and sugar). Land tax assessment was based on frequent surveys <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> land and the type of produce. Chalukya records specifically mention black soil and red soil lands in addition to wetland, dry land and wasteland in determining taxation rates.|$|E
5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan {{demonstrates that the}} female is continuously <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the male and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered {{by the arrival of}} a new male in a neighboring territory {{at the beginning of a}} new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new maleâ€™s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E
5|$|Operational design {{management}} involves {{the management of}} individual design projects and design teams. Its goal is to achieve the objectives set by strategic {{design management}}. Success of good design management can be measured by <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> operational design management outcomes. It includes the selection and management of design suppliers and encompasses the documentation, supervision, and evaluation of design processes and results. It deals with personal leadership, emotional intelligence, and the cooperation with and management of internal communications. Regular management functions, tools, and concepts can often {{be applied to the}} management of design on the operational level. It is implemented to achieve specific design objectives and manage the judgment of design proposals. It can help to build brand equity through the consistent creation and implementation of high-quality design solutions that best fit the brand identity and desired consumer experience, in the most efficient way. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this role: operational design manager, senior designer, team leader, visual communication manager, corporate design coordinator, and others.|$|E

25|$|Producers {{and sellers}} of popcorn {{consider}} two major factors in <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> popcorn: {{what percentage of}} the kernels will pop, and how much each popped kernel expands. Expansion is an important factor to both the consumer and vendor. For the consumer, larger pieces of popcorn tend to be more tender and are associated with higher quality. For the grower, distributor, and vendor, expansion is closely correlated with profit: vendors such as theaters buy popcorn by weight and sell it by volume. For both these reasons, higher-expansion popcorn fetches a higher profit per unit weight.|$|E
25|$|A drug's {{distribution}} coefficient strongly affects how easily the drug can reach its intended {{target in the}} body, how strong an effect it will have once it reaches its target, {{and how long it}} will remain in the body in an active form. Hence, the log P of a molecule is one criterion used in decision-making by medicinal chemists in pre-clinical drug discovery, for example, in the assessment of druglikeness of drug candidates. Likewise, it is used to calculate lipophilic efficiency in <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> research compounds, where the efficiency for a compound is defined as its potency, via measured values of pIC50 or pEC50, minus its value of log P.|$|E

The bank's structural adjustment programs contributed to urbanization in the Third World by creating incentives to move to cities. The World Bank and UN-Habitat in 1999 jointly established the Cities Alliance (based at the World Bank headquarters in Washington, D.C.) to guide policymaking, knowledge sharing, and grant distribution around the issue of urban poverty. (UN-Habitat plays an advisory role in <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> a locality's governance.)

500|$|BLEU (bilingual {{evaluation}} understudy) is an algorithm for <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> text {{which has}} been machine-translated from one natural language to another.

BLEU {{was one of the first}} metrics to claim a high correlation with human judgements of quality, and remains one of the most popular automated and inexpensive metrics.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a probabilistic framework, QARLA, {{for the evaluation}} of text summarisation systems.

Compared to previous approaches, our framework is able to combine different metrics and <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> a set of metrics without any a-priori weighting of their relative importance. We provide quantitative evidence about the effectiveness of the approach to improve the automatic evaluation of text summarisation systems by combining several similarity metrics. ...|$|R
