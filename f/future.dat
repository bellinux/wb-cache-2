At least seven <b>future</b> U.S. Senators took part, as did four <b>future</b> Illinois governors; <b>future</b> governors of Michigan, Nebraska, and the Wisconsin Territory; and one <b>future</b> U.S. president. The Black Hawk War demonstrated to American officials the need for mounted troops to fight a mounted foe. During the war, the U.S. Army did not have cavalry; the only mounted soldiers were part-time volunteers. After the war, Congress created the Mounted Ranger Battalion {{under the command of}} Henry Dodge, which was expanded to the 1st Cavalry Regiment in 1833.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{undertakes}} {{an investigation}} into the efficiency of the crude oil <b>futures</b> market and the forecasting accuracy of <b>futures</b> prices. Efficiency of the market is analysed in terms of the expected excess returns to speculation in the <b>futures</b> market. Accuracy of <b>futures</b> prices is compared with that of forecasts using alternative techniques, including time series and econometric models, as well as judgemental forecasts. The paper also explores the predictive power of <b>futures</b> prices by comparing the forecasting accuracy of end-of-month prices with weekly and monthly averages, using a variety of different weighting schemes. Finally, the paper investigates whether the forecasts from using <b>futures</b> prices can be improved by incorporating information from other forecasting techniques.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} the long-term dynamic relationship between the <b>futures</b> indexes of Korea and India. Both the Kospi 200 <b>futures</b> index and Nifty <b>futures</b> index are found to be non-stationary and cointegrated, meaning thereby that a long-term dynamic equilibrium relationship exists between them along with a Granger cause bidirectional relationship. The VECM results indicate that a lagged relationship exists between the two indexes. While lag 1 and lag 3 are statistically significant for Kospi 200 <b>futures</b> – Nifty <b>futures,</b> lag 4 and lag 6 are significant for Nifty <b>futures</b> – Kospi 200 <b>futures.</b> It is suggested that while information on Kospi 200 <b>futures</b> is more instantaneously discounted by the Nifty <b>futures,</b> the information on Nifty <b>futures</b> is relatively slowly discounted by the Kospi 200 <b>futures</b> index. The impulse response analysis suggests that the price discovery process is more efficient for Kospi 200 <b>futures</b> index than for Nifty <b>futures</b> index. <b>futures</b> index; cointegration; vector error correction; impulse response; Korea; India; Kospi 200; Nifty futures; price discovery. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{performance}} of three types of commodity price forecasts—those based on judgment, those relying exclusively on historical price data, and those incorporating prices implied by commodity <b>futures.</b> For most of the 15 commodities in the sample, spot and <b>futures</b> prices appear to be nonstationary and to form a cointegrating relation. Spot prices tend to move toward <b>futures</b> prices over the long run, and error-correction models exploiting this feature produce more accurate forecasts. The analysis indicates that {{on the basis of}} statistical- and directional-accuracy measures, futures-based models yield better forecasts than historical-data-based models or judgment, especially at longer horizons.
