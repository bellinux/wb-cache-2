5|$|The now <b>independent</b> <b>association</b> {{maintained}} the racial segregation with four separate associations. After consultation with Baden-Powell, four separate Scouting organisations {{were created in}} 1936. These were The Boy Scouts Association (for whites), The African Boy Scouts Association (for blacks), The Coloured Boy Scouts Association (for coloureds) and The Indian Boy Scouts Association (for Indians). A revision of the 1936 constitution in 1953 even strengthened the whites-only branch: its Chief Scout was now Chief Scout of the three other associations, with each association providing a Chief Scout's Commissioner as executive head under the Chief Scout.|$|E
5|$|The {{headmaster}} is {{a member}} of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and is responsible to the governors for the whole school from 7 to 18, though is primarily based in the Senior School. Housemasters are managed by the principal deputy head, who is accountable to the headteacher for the pastoral care and discipline of the school, as well as for much of the rest of the school's non-academic activity. The governors form the Board of Governors, also known as the Council of Management, which meets each term and is headed by a chairman. Past chairmen have included Donald Dalrymple ON, physician and Liberal MP for Bath (1868–73), J. J. Colman, head of the Colman's mustard company and Liberal MP for Norwich (1890–1898), Augustus Jessopp (1900–1903), James Stuart, founder of the University Extension Movement and Rector of the University of St Andrews (1903–1913), E. E. Blyth, first Lord Mayor of Norwich (1913–1934), David Cranage, Dean of Norwich (1934–1945), and General Manager of Norwich Union E. F. Williamson (1945–1954). The current chairman is P. J. E. Smith. Several governor positions are appointed by organisations closely connected to the school. The dean and chapter of Norwich Cathedral appoint one governor, and the Worshipful Company of Dyers appoint three. The school's historical connection with the Dyers, one of the Livery Companies of the City of London, dates back to 1947 when HH Judge Norman Daynes, an Old Norvicensian, was the Prime Warden of the Company. The charitable trust of the Company continues to be a major benefactor of the school through the funding of building expansion and bursaries. The school is also a member of the Choir Schools' Association and the Lower School {{is a member}} of the <b>Independent</b> <b>Association</b> of Prep Schools.|$|E

500|$|Americans {{have four}} basic ways of solving {{problems}} that are too big for individuals to handle by themselves. One is through the federal government. A second is through state governments and the local governments that the states create. The third is through the private sector– the economic sector that includes business, agriculture, and labor. The fourth method is the independent sector– the voluntary, cooperative action of free individuals and <b>independent</b> <b>association.</b> [...] Voluntary action {{is the most powerful}} of these, because it is uniquely capable of stirring the people themselves and involving their enthusiastic energies, because it is their own– voluntary action is the people's action. ... As Woodrow Wilson said, [...] "The most powerful force on earth is the spontaneous cooperation of a free people." [...] Individualism makes cooperation worthwhile– but cooperation makes freedom possible.|$|E

A new structure of cricket umpiring and scoring qualifications has now been put into place and the ACO provides training and examinations for these.

Roma won the IAW Heavyweight Championship, after beating Brian Costello (aka The Crippler), on July 8, 2006 at IAW Clash at the Cove VIII, in South Bend, IN. He eventually lost the title to The Crippler on March 24, 2007 at IAW Clash at the CAVE II (held in the gym of Mishawaka High School in Mishawaka, Indiana) after receiving a piledriver onto a chair, behind the back of special referee Brandon Trtan, who was attacked and knocked {{out of the ring}} by Roma.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{theory that}} can be tested using cued recall is {{symmetry}} of forward and backward recall. Forward recall is generally assumed to be easier than backward recall, i.e. forward recall is stronger than backward recall. This is generally true for long sequences of word or letters such as the alphabet. In one view, the independent associations hypothesis, the strength of forward and backward recall are hypothesized to be independent of each other. To confirm this hypothesis, Dr. George Wolford tested participants' forward and backward recall and found that forward and backward recall are independent of each other. The probability of correct forward recall was [...]47 for word pair associations and the probability of correct backward recall of word pair associations was [...]25. However, in another view, the associative symmetry hypothesis, the strengths of forward and backward recall are about equal and highly correlated. In S.E Asch from Swathmore College and S. M Ebenholtz's experiment, participants learned pairs of nonsense syllables by anticipation recall. After reaching a certain threshold of learning, the participants were tested by free recall to determine all pairs and single items they could remember. These researchers found that backward association was greatly weaker than forward association. However, when the availability of forward and backward recall were basically the same, there was little difference between forward and backward recall. Some scientists including Asch and Ebenholtz believe in the <b>independent</b> <b>association</b> hypothesis think that the equal strengths of forward and backward recall are compatible with their hypothesis because forward and backward recall could be independent but with equal strengths. However associative symmetry theorists interpreted the data to mean that the results fit their hypothesis.|$|E
