5|$|People {{from small}} {{villages in the}} hills near Genova, Italy {{were among the first}} to settle {{permanently}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> foothills; they brought with them traditional agricultural skills, developed to survive cold winters. A modest number of miners of African ancestry (probably less than 4,000) had come from the Southern States, the Caribbean and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|People {{have used}} {{resources}} on {{and around the}} Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites.|$|E

5|$|The Donner Party, or Donner-Reed Party, was a {{group of}} American pioneers led by George Donner and James F. Reed who set out for California in a wagon train in May 1846. They were delayed by a series of mishaps and mistakes, and spent the winter of 1846–47 snowbound <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada.</b> Some of the pioneers resorted to {{cannibalism}} to survive.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} glaciations further {{modified}} the region starting about 2 to 3 {{million years ago}} and ending sometime around 10,000 BP. At least four major glaciations have occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada,</b> locally called the Sherwin (also called the pre-Tahoe), Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga. The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while later stages produced much smaller glaciers. A Sherwin-age glacier was almost surely responsible for the major excavation and shaping of Yosemite Valley and other canyons in the area.|$|E

5|$|After the 1848 {{finding of}} gold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> and {{dramatic}} gains in new wealth from it, other men {{became interested in}} the potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills. Custer's announcement of gold in the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Lakota and whites seeking to move into the Black Hills.|$|E
5|$|At {{the most}} extreme points of its perceptibility, it was felt with {{intensity}} II or III (Weak) at Healdsburg {{in the north and}} Santa Barbara in the south, Visalia in the central valley and Twain Harte <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> foothills. It was also listed as having been felt (with no specific intensity level given) by residents in high-rise buildings in Reno, Nevada. Closer to the epicenter, several instances of damage were aligned with the highest observed intensity. The structural effects to the gas station's walls and roof at Casa de Fruta, the beam damage {{on the second floor of}} the Ford's department store in Gilroy, and the caved-in roof from the fallen parapet at the law office in Hollister were all considered by the United States Geological Survey to be consistent with intensity VII (Very strong) shaking.|$|E
50|$|David Tilden Brown (August, 1822 - Boston, Massachusetts - September 4, 1889 - Batavia, Illinois) practiced {{psychiatry}} from 1844-1849 {{in various}} asylums in eastern United States. When gold was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada's,</b> Brown decided {{to cash in}} and travel to Central America in 1849, planning to establish a cheaper and faster commercial route west from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans across the isthmus of Nicaragua. He and his associates formed the Compania de Vapores de Nicaragua, but the company eventually was absorbed by Cornelius Vanderbilt's American Atlantic and Pacific Ship Canal Company.|$|R

5|$|Plectania nannfeldtii is {{typically}} found at higher elevations in coniferous forests growing on wet twigs or other rotting woody debris, often {{in or near}} snow. It often begins its development underneath the snow, reaching maturity as the snowbank recedes to expose it; one source suggests that its metabolic heat may help it melt a path through snow as it grows. It may grow singly, scattered or in clusters, and has been noted to have a preference for the wood of Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa {{as well as other}} conifers. In North America, it is found in the Western United States and Canada, where it fruits from late May to early August; it is common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> and in higher elevations of the Pacific Coast Ranges. Its distribution also includes China and Japan.|$|E
5|$|U.S.395 was rebuilt {{on a new}} {{alignment}} on {{the ascent}} to Sherwin Summit and around Crowley Lake. Unlike the highway relocation in southern California, the old alignments have been renamed, now called Lower Rock Creek Road, Old Sherwin Grade, and Crowley Creek Road; not Sierra Highway. From here to Lake Tahoe, the highway crosses mountainous terrain inside the Sierra Nevada, giving the highway its name. While <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada,</b> the road passes by attractions such as Mammoth Mountain, Yosemite National Park and Mono Lake. El Camino Sierra separates from U.S.395, {{just prior to the}} Nevada state line at Topaz Lake, following SR89. This is the only portion of the route not used year-round, as Caltrans closes Route89 over Monitor Pass during winter months. Motorists destined for Lake Tahoe during the winter closures can continue along US395 into Nevada, and return to California via Nevada State Route 88 or Nevada State Route 207.|$|E
5|$|While the cutters {{were being}} shipped to Subic Bay, crew members started {{reporting}} to Coast Guard Training Center Alameda, California on 17 May 1965 for overseas processing and training. The cutter crews received one week of small arms training at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado and Camp Pendleton while Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) training was received at Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center, near Coleville, California, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> Mountains and at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, Washington. Returning to Alameda, they underwent refresher firefighting and damage control training from the Navy at Treasure Island Naval Base. Additional weapons qualifications and live fire exercises {{were held at}} Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, along with refresher training in radar navigation, radio procedures and visual signaling. Gun crews received mortar and machine gun training at Camp Pendleton. Of the 245 personnel assigned to the unit only 131 were present at the squadron commissioning ceremony held at Alameda on 27 May with {{the remainder of the}} crews in the process of completing training elsewhere. For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the normal crew complement of eight to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea. All officers assigned to command cutters were required to be lieutenants and to have previously commanded a Cape-class cutter and had to volunteer for the assignment. The executive officer was either a lieutenant junior grade or ensign.|$|E

30|$|While we {{detected}} {{some changes}} in fir-dominated MC forests, they were far less pronounced than those found in pine-dominated areas in other portions of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> that also used data from early intensive inventories (Stephens et al. 2015; Collins et al. 2017). Historical basal area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most productive areas of MC forests (41.8  m 2  ha− 1) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> was similar to what we found in this work, and tended to have greater fir dominance {{than the rest of}} <b>the</b> landscape.
