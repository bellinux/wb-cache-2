5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The veracity of the message was demonstrated when white lights in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> at a performance in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to {{the backdrop of the}} stage. Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma did exist, and that it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{audience}} is seated in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> {{to the left}} side of the stage, and in the corner front-left of stage; these are in order of decreasing desirability. While the metsuke-bashira pillar obstructs the view of the stage, the actors are primarily at the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where the views of the two main actors would be obscured, ensuring a generally clear view regardless of seating.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stage</b> is open'd, and the Band of 24 Violins, {{with the}} Harpsicals and Theorbo's which {{accompany}} the Voices, are plac'd between the Pit and the Stage. While the Overture is playing, the Curtain rises, and discovers a new Frontispiece, joyn'd {{to the great}} Pylasters, {{on each side of}} the Stage... Behind this is the Scene, which represents a thick Cloudy Sky, a very Rocky Coast, and a Tempestuous Sea in perpetual Agitation. This Tempest (suppos'd to be rais'd by Magick) has many dreadful Objects in it, as several Spirits in horrid shapes flying down amongst the Sailers, then rising and crossing in the Air. And when the Ship is sinking, the whole House is darken'd, and a shower of Fire falls upon 'em. This is accompanied with Lightning, and several Claps of Thunder, to the end of the Storm.|$|E

5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge {{at the back of his}} head, they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E
25|$|At a David Cassidy show on 26 May 1974, 650 {{were injured}} in a crush at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> Thirty were taken to hospital, and one, 14-year-old Bernadette Whelan, died on 30 May from injuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} involves actor-dancers in the front, {{supported by}} musicians {{in the background}} stage on right (audience's left) and with vocalists in the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> (historically {{so they could be}} heard by the audience before the age of microphone and speakers). Typically, all roles are played by male actor-dancers, though in modern performances, women have been welcomed into the Kathakali tradition.|$|E

25|$|The scenic {{stage was}} {{probably}} some 50’ deep and 30’ high. The proscenium arch {{may have been}} some 30’ wide and at least 25’ high to accommodate the scenery in operas such as Dioclesian, The Fairy-Queen, or The World in the Moon. Both the forestage and the scenic stage were raked. The music box above the proscenium arch could hold perhaps 8 to 10 musicians, to provide incidental music. A full orchestra would be sitting in the pit, just in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Systems {{for outdoor}} sports {{facilities}} and ice rinks {{often have to}} deal with substantial echo, which can make speech unintelligible. Sports and recreational sound systems often face environmental challenges as well, such as the need for weather-proof outdoor speakers in outdoor stadiums and humidity- and splash-resistant speakers in swimming pools. Another challenge with sports sound reinforcement setups is that in many arenas and stadiums, the spectators are on all four sides of the playing field. This requires 360 degree sound coverage. This {{is very different from the}} norm with music festivals and music halls, where the musicians are on stage and the audience is seated in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The RSC again staged {{the play}} at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1981, as a double bill with Titus Andronicus, with both plays heavily edited. Directed by John Barton, the {{production}} starred Peter Chelsom as Valentine, Peter Land as Proteus, Julia Swift as Julia and Diana Hardcastle as Silvia. This production saw the actors {{not involved in the}} current on-stage scene sit at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and watch the performance. Leon Rubin directed a performance at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in 1984, where the actors were dressed in modern clothes and contemporary pop music was featured within the play (for example, the outlaws are portrayed as an anarchic rock group).|$|E

25|$|This uses {{low-voltage}} {{electricity to}} transmit {{the action of}} the organ keys to the pipes. Earlier church instruments used a mechanical linkage of rods and wires to connect the keys to the pipes. With the new system, the console (also known as a key-desk) could be placed at virtually any distance from the organ's pipes and could be somewhat portable, as just an electrical cable and flexible wind line connected the console with other parts of the instrument. This also allowed the console to achieve its ubiquitous place—on an elevator platform in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> low in the orchestra pit for accompanying the film, and rising majestically to stage height for organ solos.|$|E
25|$|One {{major event}} in Hells Angels' history {{involved}} the December 6, 1969, Altamont Free Concert at the Altamont Speedway – partially {{documented in the}} 1970 film Gimme Shelter – featuring Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers, and The Rolling Stones. The Grateful Dead were also scheduled to perform but cancelled {{at the last minute}} owing to the ensuing circumstances at the venue. The Angels had been hired by The Rolling Stones as crowd security for a fee which was said to include $500 worth of beer. The Angels parked their motorcycles in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> {{in order to create a}} buffer between the stage and the hundreds of thousands of concertgoers.|$|E
25|$|The Wits is {{also known}} for the {{frontispiece}} by John Chantry. This is often assumed to represent the Red Bull Theatre, although this is disputed as being unlikely; it is not described as such before 1809, and is not consistent with what is known of it. It {{is one of the}} earliest illustrations of a theatre interior, showing chandeliers and lighting at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> a curtained entrance, which may be genuine representations. However, the various characters shown are a catalogue, not an example of a scene as staged. They include Falstaff (by far the most popular theatrical character of the seventeenth century), a hostess, (perhaps Mistress Quickly), Clause (from The Lame Commonwealth), French Dancing Mr, (a dancing fiddler), The Changeling, and Simpleton, a character played by Cox.|$|E
50|$|The {{performers}} {{were never}} paid. They put a hat on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small <b>stage</b> to earn some compensation for their performance. The acoustics were terrible. The clientele included longshoreman and flower children, {{not necessarily a}} good mix.|$|R
50|$|In the 1880s and 1890s {{the area}} was used for public feasts. Today, Ravnedalen is one of Kristiansand's {{cultural}} sites, where concerts and other arrangements are held regularly.

25|$|Head coach Carl C. Taylor, {{seeking an}} indoor home venue for the {{basketball}} team, {{reached an agreement}} with the Ben Hur Temple in downtown Austin to rent the building's theater for basketball games and five hours of practice weekly for the 1913 season for $75. The building was originally constructed in 1872 as an opera house for the Turnverein, a German gymnastics, social, and cultural society, and it had been purchased in 1912 by the Shriners and Scottish Rite Masons. Basketball goals were mounted on the balcony and in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> boundary lines were drawn on the double-layer pine floor, and bleachers were erected {{on each side of the}} diminutive court, bringing seating capacity to roughly 350 people, including spectators in the balcony and on the stage.|$|E
25|$|Glasgow police {{decided to}} use the {{occasion}} of the public address to effect the arrest. However, the WSPU activists anticipated their action and increased security coverage for their leader, including enforcing strict secrecy surrounding her movements and erecting a concealed barbed wire barrier across the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> A short time into Pankhurst's speech, around 160 police officers stormed the hall and began to move toward the stage. They were met by a barrage of thrown chairs and plant pots, and soon fights broke out between the police and members of the audience. During the commotion one of the women present drew a revolver and fired several blank cartridges toward the ceiling. The police attempted to apprehend her, but she managed to slip their grasp and escape. Although not positively identified at the time, many since have stated that Janie Allan was the woman with the revolver.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Giuntoli retired. For {{the next}} 18 years, the {{building}} was mostly closed, available only on a rental basis for private parties. One notable series of dates was in 1975 when local promoter David Allen put The Tubes on stage, extending their show week after week in response to standing-room only crowds. The Stooges also appeared once in early 1974, playing to a sparse crowd, with lead singer Iggy Pop wearing only bikini briefs and boots on stage. During his performance, he jumped into {{a small group of}} fans in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and his bikini briefs were removed by one of them. He regained the stage while yelling in anger at a female fan who had been handling his male member. In 1988, Giuntoli's grandson Michael Cerchiai reopened the property for a run as a live entertainment venue. As of 2014, the club is still there, owned and run by his Cerchiai, who celebrated his eight birthday there with a Batman-themed cake, while Smokey Robinson played live.|$|E
50|$|The Avalon {{occupied}} {{the two top}} floors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multi-story building at 1268 Sutter. An L-shaped, second-floor balcony surrounded the first-floor along the south and western walls, and the dance area was in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elevated <b>stage</b> in <b>the</b> northeast corner where musicians performed. The entrance doors were downstairs, and opened onto Sutter Street.|$|R
50|$|A footlight is a {{theatrical}} lighting device arranged to illuminate a <b>stage</b> from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> floor in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curtain. Originally {{set in a}} row of hooded individual enclosures, electric footlights are presently set in troughs across <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> so that they are not visible to the audience. An indirect footlight uses a light aimed at a reflecting surface to diffuse the illumination.|$|R

25|$|It {{was first}} called the New Bandstand, {{and then the}} Central Bandstand, to {{differentiate}} it from other bandstands in Herne Bay, especially the bandstand which stood {{on the roof of}} the King's Hall and has since been demolished. The north or seaward side of the Central Bandstand was built in 1924, with alterations in 1931. The original architect was Herbert Kempton Dyson, M.I.Struct.E (1880–1944), who was a founder member of the Concrete Institute, and specialised in reinforced concrete structures. The 1924 section has two outside seaward-facing balconies with space for deckchairs, including a cantilevered roof for the lower deck and for covering the stage inside. Metal, glazed screens at the east and west sides of the building crossed the promenade, and could be moved to protect the audience from wind, or retracted into the wings to allow promenaders to cross when no band was playing. The seating area was a railed-off section of the promenade, and the seating on the roof above the stage included two copper-covered domes, plus two domes which doubled as refreshment kiosks. The roof is now inaccessible for safety reasons. By the late 1920s the audience area in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> had extended across Tower Gardens to the edge of the footpath and road.|$|E

500|$|During the Western {{portion of}} the show, Harrison's voice was more {{confident}} this time around, the music [...] "perhaps slightly more lustrous", according to Rolling Stone.

5000|$|... 1965 A {{scene from}} the film The Ipcress File was filmed in Kennington Park. Based on a Len Deighton book it starred Michael Caine and Nigel Green. It shows the park bandstand (the {{concrete}} area in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Prince Consort Lodge)where the Irish Guards are playing a concert, rows of chairs are laid out in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raised <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> bandstand burnt down several years later.|$|R
500|$|In 1985, {{the festival}} grew {{too large for}} Worthy Farm, but {{neighbouring}} Cockmill Farm was purchased. [...] That year saw a wet festival with considerable rain; Worthy Farm is a dairy farm and what washed down into the low areas {{was a mixture of}} mud and liquefied cow dung. This did not prevent festival-goers from enjoying the knee-deep slurry in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid <b>stage.</b>|$|R
