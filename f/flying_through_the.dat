5|$|Jovian Europa Orbiter was an ESA Cosmic Vision concept {{study from}} 2007. Another concept was Ice Clipper, {{which would have}} used an {{impactor}} similar to the Deep Impact mission—it would make a controlled crash into the surface of Europa, generating a plume of debris that would then be collected by a small spacecraft <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> plume.|$|E

Whilst <b>the</b> {{original}} series simply featured Red Dwarf <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> unadorned starscapes, <b>the</b> Remastered version added backgrounds such as burning suns, icy moons and coloured nebulae. A model dust storm was recreated in CG, {{and in addition}} to the typically sedate movement Red Dwarf was shown, in appropriate scenes, racing through space.|$|R
5|$|Three {{different}} gate types {{require a}} specific manner of crossing. Double cone gates must be crossed in level flight, single cone gates must be crossed in a 90° angle, and slalom <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> chicane gates (knife or level flying not mandatory).|$|E
5|$|Elphaba and Fiyero {{are both}} taken by {{surprise}} by {{the strength of their}} feelings for each other, and promise to be together always ("As Long As You're Mine"). Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba suddenly has a vision of a house <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sky and Nessarose being in pain. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle that his family owns that she can stay in.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the hotel, Moon {{started a}} food fight and soon cake began <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air. The drummer knocked out {{part of his}} front tooth; at the hospital, doctors could not give him an {{anaesthetic}} (due to his inebriation) before removing {{the remainder of the}} tooth. Back at the hotel a mêlée erupted; fire extinguishers were set off, guests (and objects) thrown into the swimming pool and a piano reportedly destroyed. The chaos ended only when police arrived with guns drawn.|$|E

5|$|The {{television}} series Jackass {{is referred to}} frequently by Peter and his neighbors, and is the principal reason that they try to do stunts. Johnny Knoxville cameoes and takes a shotgun blast which blows off part of his face. In the episode, while being launched off a ramp and <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air, Peter wears the costume from The Greatest American Hero and sings the series' theme song.|$|E
5|$|Another segment, Debussy's Clair de lune, was {{developed}} {{as part of}} the film's original program. After being completely animated, it was cut out of the final film to shorten its lengthy running time. The animation depicted two Great white herons <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Florida Everglades on a moonlit night. The sequence was later edited and re-scored for the Blue Bayou segment in Make Mine Music (1946). In 1992, a workprint of the original was discovered and Clair de Lune was restored, complete with the original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was included as a bonus feature in The Fantasia Anthology DVD in 2000.|$|E

5|$|As {{with its}} predecessor, {{gameplay}} is centred around Nights <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{dreams of the}} two children. The main objective {{of the game is}} to fly through rings while gathering enough keys to proceed to the next level. Development of Journey of Dreams began shortly after the release of Shadow the Hedgehog in 2005, and was headed by Sonic Team veteran Takashi Iizuka. The team took steps to ensure that the game stayed faithful to the original, while incorporating a variety of new mechanics and features. The game's setting was designed to resemble England, especially parts of London.|$|E
5|$|Cloud, a single-player {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, {{centers on a}} boy who dreams of <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sky while asleep in a {{hospital}} bed. The player assumes control of the sleeping boy's avatar—the projection of the boy into his dream world—and guides him through his dream {{of a small group}} of islands with a light gathering of clouds. The avatar's direction and speed are controlled with a mouse; movement is generally on a horizontal plane, but vertical flight can be attained by holding down the third button of the mouse. The player may interact with clouds only while flying horizontally.|$|E
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> roof of the tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E

5|$|Galactica departs {{the station}} and rises a chain lift hill. The ride's first drop dips to the right, before rising back up and <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ride's centrepiece theming element, a portal, which links to the ride's space theme. Followed by this, riders are turned from the prone {{position}} onto their backs. The coaster then performs a large upward left turn before twisting again, returning riders to the prone position. After exiting from the lie-to-fly element, Galactica passes underneath a small ravine before pitching up, into a tight turn over the plaza area. A 360 degrees inline twist is followed up {{by a series of}} straight flying, and several turns and dips in the track. The train then comes to a stop on the brake run before returning to one of the station's two stations.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the third act, Bart argues that modern writers like Steven Bochco, one of the creators of the television series NYPD Blue, are more talented than Shakespeare. Bochco saw the episode with his children and was so flattered that he sent The Simpsons staff some NYPD Blue merchandise. After the ghost of Homer has spoken to Bart, he leaves Bart's room by <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wall, causing slime to appear on the wall. This is a reference to Slimer, a ghost from the Ghostbusters franchise who has a similar function.|$|E
5|$|The BORAX Experiments were {{a series}} of {{destructive}} tests of boiling water reactors conducted by Argonne National Laboratory in Idaho. The BORAX-1 test was conducted under Zinn's supervision in 1954. He had the control rods removed {{to demonstrate that the}} reactor would shut down without trouble, and it immediately blew up with a loud bang and a tall column of dark smoke, a turn of events that he had not anticipated. He shouted to Harold Lichtenberg to put the control rods back in again, but Lichtenberg pointed out that one was already <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air. Zinn later had to testify on the experiment before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} departed Zurich for Berlin, with stopovers in Stuttgart and Leipzig.

5|$|The Port Said Sector was an {{independent}} military command in the Egyptian Military, unattached to the Second Army. It incorporated Port Said, Port Fouad and their vicinity. The sector contained two infantry brigades. Military operations {{in this area}} were directed against three fortifications: Budapest, Orkal and Lahtzanit. As {{with the rest of}} the front, the offensive here began with a fire preparation. However, high trajectory weapons were not employed because Egyptian aircraft were <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sector's airspace, hence only direct fire guns were used to bombard Israeli positions.|$|E
5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air, which kills Rory.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a limited}} number of effects and, aside from brief {{ballpark}} jingles, there is no real background music present during the game. For example, the charge fanfare is played at random points and the introductory screen begins with a different baseball tune while the player is loading up and selecting his team, along with a home run fanfare. Generic sound effects include the bat cracking upon contact with the ball, the sound of the ball <b>flying</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air during a pitch, bouncing and throwing effects, and a stream of crowd noises.|$|E
