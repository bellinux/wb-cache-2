5|$|Anderson was in {{correspondence}} with the Italian-American Wiccan Leo Martello, who encouraged Anderson to found his own coven. Circa 1960, the Andersons founded a coven, naming it Mahaelani, after the Hawaiian word <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> moon. Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Andersons initiated {{a number of}} individuals into the coven. One of these was Gwydion Pendderwen, a friend of their son who shared their interest in the esoteric. Pendderwen contributed {{to the development of}} what {{came to be known as}} the Feri tradition, with some members of the lineage viewing him as its co-founder. Pendderwen noted that he had first met the family when, aged thirteen, he got into a fight with Victor Elon, although the two later became friends. Pendderwen was particularly influenced by Welsh mythology, and on a visit to Britain he spent time with the Alexandrian Wiccans Alex Sanders and Stewart Farrar, subsequently introducing various Alexandrian elements into Feri Wicca. In the early 1970s, the Andersons established a new coven with Pendderwen and his initiate, Alison Harlow. After Pendderwen married, his wife also joined this coven, although it disbanded in 1974.|$|E

5|$|Behind {{schedule}} and over-budget, the production crew struggled to complete production {{in time for}} the already-announced premiere date that October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into the water with art director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft sank into 40–50 feet (12–15m) of water, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> day's work. A few days later, Bianchi's driver fell asleep during the commute to a 6am shoot and crashed the car. The actress's face was bruised and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed for two weeks while the facial contusions healed.|$|E

5|$|During 2002, the Comanche program {{underwent}} heavy restructuring; consequently, {{the number}} of Comanches that were intended to be purchased was dropped down to 650 rotorcraft. At the time, the projected total cost <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> production of the Comanche in such numbers stood at $26.9 billion. Originally, he EMD phase had been planned to last for six years, as well as having involved {{a total of five}} Comanches being constructed to participate in the testing regime. During 2003, production on the third RAH-66, which was intended to be the first EMD-conformant helicopter, was started. Subsequently, eight RAH-66s were to be constructed for operational testing purposes. As planned, the initial production RAH-66s were to be completed to a Block I configuration, which would have included the majority of the rotorcraft's planned weapons and sensors. From the 16th Comanche onwards, deliveries would have been made to the Block II standard, which was to have all of the planned capabilities included.|$|E
