40|$|An {{autosampler}} <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>liquid</b> injection into a gas chromatographwas {{modified to}} serve as an automatic headspacesampler by replacing the syringe with a 10 O-L gas-tight syringe and shortening the needle that normally enters the vials for sampling. Instead of the usual 1. 0 to 1. 5 mL of liquid sample, the vials contained 200 L of liquid; the vapor above the liquid was injected into the gas chromato-graph. Blood samples from California drivers were analyzed for ethanol by using the modified autosam pIer and the values werecompared with those obtained by two other methods: the Smith modified version of the Widmark diffusion desicca-tion oxidation method (J Lab C/in Med 38 : 762, 1951) and direct injection of diluted blood into the gas chromatograph. The correlation coefficient between the headspace method described in this paper and the titration method was 0. 984...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{and performance}} of wicks for flat heat pipe applications produced by sintering a filamentary nickel powder has been investigated. Tape casting {{was used as an}} intermediate step in the wick production process. Thermogravimetric analysis was used to study the burn-off of the organic binder used and to study the oxidation and reduction processes of the nickel. The wicks produced were flat, rectangular and <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>liquid</b> transport in the upwards vertical direction. Rate-of-rise experiments using heptane were used to test the flow characteristics of the wicks. The wick porosities were measured using isopropanol. The heat transfer limitation constituted by the vapour static pressure and the capillary pressure was discussed. The influence on wick performance by using pore former in the manufacturing was studied. When Pcap/Psat > 1, the use of a pore former to increase the wick permeability will always improve the wick performance. When Pcap/Psat < 1, it was shown that if the effective pore radius and the permeability increase with an equal percentage the overall influence on the wick capacity is negative. A criterion for a successful pore former introduction is proposed and the concept of a pore former evaluation plot is presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn fF-level {{capacitive}} sensor, <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> pL <b>liquid</b> measurements, {{has been}} fabricated with MEMS technology and successfully characterized. The sensor measures liquid level variations in a microfluidic channel. The sensor’s capacitance varies from 1. 5 fF (channel empty) to 12. 8 fF (channel filled with 63 pL of water). To reliably detect such small capacitance changes, a low noise measurement system, {{based on a}} lock-in amplifier, was implemented. The measured sensitivity {{of the system is}} 14. 1 mV/fF, and the capacitance detection limit is 0. 057 aF/Hz 1 / 2, which corresponds to a volumetric resolution of about 0. 22 fL/Hz 1 / 2...|$|R
40|$|In This Issue: Liquid Nitrogen- Herbicide Mixes After Corn/Sorghum Emergence Safened Sorghum Seed Delayed Preemergence Herbicides Liquid Nitrogen [...] Herbicide Mixes After Corn/Sorghum Emergence Corn and sorghum {{in fields}} <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>liquid</b> {{nitrogen}} - preemergence herbicide mixes sometimes emerge before herbicide application. While certain preemergence herbicides {{can be applied}} after crop emergence, they are not labeled for application with fluid fertilizer after emergence, due to risk of injury. Emerged corn is more tolerant than sorghum of fertilizer-herbicide mixtures. Some growers may accept the injury in return for accomplishing two jobs at once. Safened Sorghum Seed Sorghum seed treated with the seed safeners Concep II and Screen, is protected from possible injury from Dual and Lasso. Dual {{is to be used}} with Concep II treated seed and Lasso with Screen treated seed. Both safeners provide protection from either herbicide, however they are not 2 ̆ 2 cross 2 ̆ 2 labeled. Delayed Preemergence Herbicides Timely herbicide application is not always possible in the busy planting season. Some but not all preemergence herbicides can be applied early postemergence with good results. However, most of these treatments are more effective when applied preemergence than postemergence especially against annual grasses. A rain or sprinkler irrigation is required after application for best control. The following table lists herbicides that are commonly used in Nebraska and can be used both preemergence and early postemergence...|$|R

40|$|We coupleda {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatograph}} with a continuous-flow microanalyzer {{to produce a}} system for specifically determining “true ” creatinine in urine and serum specimens. A selective microbore pellicular cat-ion-exchange column and a single eluting sodium citrate buffer are used to separate the noncreatinine but Jaff#{ 233 }-positive constituents from the creatinine in normal and experimental specimens. The effluent is analyzed con-tinuously, on-line, the alkaline picrate complex being de-veloped and measured in the microanalyzer. Physiological samples, reference standards, and internal control spec-imens are assayed in 6 -mm intervals subsequent to the initial injection. The relationship between concentration and peak area is linear for creatinine standards between 5 and 10 mg/liter. Specimen volumes ranging from 1 to 25 tl, and containing creatinine in amounts exceeding 5 ng per injected sample, can be assayed with this sys-tem.

40|$|A {{mechanical}} amplifier {{has been}} devised to multiply {{the stroke of}} a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> use at <b>liquid</b> helium temperatures. Interferometry holds the key to high angular resolution imaging and astrometry in space. Future space missions that will detect planets around other solar systems and perform detailed studies {{of the evolution of}} stars and galaxies will use new interferometers that observe at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths. Phase-measurement interferometry is key to many aspects of astronomical interferometry, and PZTs are ideal modulators for most methods of phase measurement, but primarily at visible wavelengths. At far infrared wavelengths of 150 to 300 m, background noise is a severe problem and all optics must be cooled to about 4 K. Under these conditions, piezos are ill-suited as modulators, because their throw is reduced by as much as a factor of 2, and even a wavelength or two of modulation is beyond their capability. The largest commercially available piezo stacks are about 5 in. (12. 7 cm) long and have a throw of about 180 m at room temperature and only 90 m at 4 K. It would seem difficult or impossible to use PZTs for phase measurements in the far infrared {{were it not for the}} new mechanical amplifier that was designed and built...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of a {{characterization}} study of several types of cryogenic photomultipliers manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics and <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> operation in <b>liquid</b> Ar conditions, namely: compact 2 -inch R 6041 - 506 MOD tubes, 3 -inch R 11065 - 10 and R 11065 -MOD tubes <b>for</b> operation in <b>liquid</b> Ar and 3 -inch R 11410 - 20 tubes originally designed <b>for</b> operation in <b>liquid</b> Xe. These types of PMT are proposed for installation into the future two-phase cryogenic avalanche detector that is developed in the Laboratory of Cosmology and Particle Physics of the Novosibirsk State University jointly with the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics. Eight R 11065 PMTs and seven R 11410 - 20 tubes were tested and all demonstrated excellent performance in liquid Ar in terms of gain and relative single electron efficiency. All 3 -inch PMTs showed a maximal gain in liquid Ar above 5 x 10 ^ 6 and relative single electron efficiency higher than 95 %. Compact R 6041 - 506 MOD tubes have dynode system {{different from that of the}} 3 -inch photomultipliers and thus their single electron energy resolution and relative efficiency is much worse than that of 3 -inch tubes. From 21 2 -inch PMTs only 12 tubes were selected with acceptable, i. e. higher than 75 %, relative single electron efficiency and the maximal gain higher than 5 x 10 ^ 6. However, these PMTs are very attractive because they are the only compact type of tubes that can operate in liquid Ar.
