40|$|During {{the surface}} {{treatment}} of workpieces {{by means of}} electron beams, several areas must often be treated. The energy applied causes the austenitizing of the edge layer of a workpiece. As a result of cooling, the austenite in converted into martensite and causes hardening, this {{is also known as}} self-quenching. During the hardening of several surfaces, the hardening of the next layer requires a high cycle time before it can cool down to ambient temperature. The time required is to be reduced. As is already known, no cooling medium, e. g. water is to be used; this would lead to corrosion or would disturb the vacuum process. According to the invention, the workpieces are exposed to a stream of cooling gas in a cooling station at atmospheric pressure after a surface is hardened by means of the electron beam; at intervals, an atomozing liquid is injected into the stream of cooling gas. In the intermediate time, the next workpiece is supplied to the electron beam system to harden the next su rface.

40|$|AbstractElectrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM) {{is a widespread}} machining method for the die and mold industry. This method can machine all conductive materials, including hard-to-cut metals, because the machining process uses electro-thermal energy without a cutting force. During EDM, discharge sparks remove not only the material of a workpiece but also the material of an electrode. This machining mechanism thereby causes electrode wear, which creates serious problems, including make-shape errors and low productivity. In order to overcome such problems, a new EDM method using a strip electrode (strip EDM) was developed in this study. Strip EDM uses a continuously applied strip electrode similar to the wire electrode in wire EDM. In the suggested strip-electrode method, a conductive strip moves on the electrode <b>guide.</b> The worn <b>strip</b> is removed, and a new one is supplied continuously.

40|$|Department of Electrical EngineeringMany {{molecules}} have unique {{absorption spectra}} {{due to the}} vibrational characteristics of molecular bondings such as C-H, N-H, O-H, C-C, N-O, and C=O. The absorption spectrum {{is located in the}} mid-infrared (mid-IR) range including wavelengths from 2 μm to 10 μm. Since a molecule can be detected through an analysis of its absorption spectrum, {{it is very important to}} develop photonic sensors, especially waveguide-based sensors, operating in the mid-IR. Recently, there have been many researches on waveguide-based sensors made of a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. However, SOI substrates are not suitable for photonic waveguides in the wide mid-IR since SiO 2 strongly absorbs light with a wavelength longer than 3. 6 μm. To overcome this limitation, diverse photonic waveguides in the mid-IR have been demonstrated. In this thesis, a bulk-silicon-based photonic waveguide is theoretically and experimentally studied. It is made of a bulk-silicon wafer by using a simple fabrication process. Light is <b>guided</b> through a <b>strip</b> with an inverted-triangular cross-section, which is supported on a bulk-silicon wafer. The bulk silicon-based photonic waveguide can be used in the wide mid-IR because of no use of SiO 2, and photonic sensors based on it can be realized at a low cost. After brief explanation of the background of this work, the fabrication process of the waveguide is explained. Then, the bulk-silicon-based photonic waveguide is designed and theoretically analyzed.

Many departments of nuclear medicine now pre pare sterile and pyrogren-free radiopharmaceuticals from commercial kits or from reagents prepared in their own laboratories. As part of the quality-control program, an accurate, rapid, and simple chroma tography system is required to assess the radiopurity of these products. We have developed a rapid, simple, chromato graphic method for measuring purity of radiophar maceuticals that uses instrumentation commonly available in most radioisotope laboratories and costs less than $ 1, 000 if purchased new.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{continuous}} galvanizing of rolled sheet steel includes immersion into a bath of molten zinc/aluminum alloy. The steel strip is dipped in the molten bath {{through a series}} of driving motors and rollers which control the speed and tension of the strip, with the ability to modify both the amount of coating applied to the steel as well as the thickness and width of the sheet being galvanized. There are three rolls used to <b>guide</b> the steel <b>strip</b> through the molten metal bath. The rolls that operate in the molten Zn/Al are subject to a severely corrosive environment and require frequent changing. The performance of this equipment, the metallic hardware submerged in the molten Zn/Al bath, is the focus of this research. The primary objective of this research is to extend the performance life of the metallic hardware components of molten Zn/Al pot hardware by an order of magnitude. Typical galvanizing operations experience downtimes on the order of every two weeks to change the metallic hardware submerged in the molten metal bath. This is an expensive process for industry which takes upwards of 3 days for a complete turn around to resume normal operation. Each roll bridle consists of a sink, stabilizer, and corrector roll with accompanying bearing components. The cost of the bridle rig with all components is as much as $ 25, 000 dollars just for materials. These inefficiencies are of concern to the steel coating companies and serve as a potential market for many materials suppliers. This research effort served as a bridge between the market potential and industry need to provide an objective analytical and mechanistic approach to the problem of wear and corrosion of molten metal bath hardware in a continuous sheet galvanizing line. The approach of the investigators was to provide a means of testing and analysis that was both expeditious and cost effective. The consortium of researchers from West Virginia University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory developed several test apparatuses that were designed to work in concert so that the process of developing and evaluating new materials and material combinations could be carried out in the most effective manner. ORNL focused on the long-term effects of static and dynamic corrosion on the hardware. Their efforts have yielded corrosion data in terms of mass loss for a large database of materials for immersion times in excess of 6000 hours. In addition, they have developed a new series of alloy, designated ORNL Alloy 4 -x. Several variants of Alloy 4 were tested for corrosion and wear performance. Another effective method for protecting bearing components is through the use of weld overlays or laser cladding. ORNL worked with several project partners to develop a weld overlay process for cladding of 316 L stainless steel with metallic materials that are much more corrosion and wear resistant. This method provides super-alloy performance that is more affordable. WVU was tasked to study wear of the bearing materials along with mechanisms of dross buildup on the roll surface. A small scale screening test apparatus was developed for the purpose quickly evaluating wear performance of candidate superalloys, ceramics, and coatings {{through the use of a}} ball-and-seat testing combination. This combination uses a fraction of the material used in full-scale bearing applications. With this system, WVU has been able to conduct hundreds of tests on various combinations of materials that mimic a wide variety of operating conditions for the galvanizing lines. The small scale wear tester was used to perform both direct correlation to galvanizing line conditions and to act as a screening mechanism for prototype-scale testing at WVU?s airport bearing materials testing facility. In addition, the studies on the effect of contact pressure and velocity on the bearing wear rate lead to the design and subsequent patent application for a fixed-shaft roll design that has the potential for increasing the bearing life by a factor of 2. The prototype-scale bearing test apparatus was donated by one of our project partners and was relocated to the WVU airport hanger at Morgantown Municipal Airport. This test apparatus uses full-scale sleeve and bushing dimensions and is designed to more accurately mimic the galvanizing line conditions. Through the combination of corrosion, wear, and dross buildup testing, as well as material modeling and thermodynamic analysis, the research team has been able to show that an order of magnitude improvement in material performance is a realistic goal...|$|R
40|$|The final {{quality of}} steel strip is {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} first forming operations. Strip defects caused {{at this early stage}} are difficult or even impossible to remove in downstream lines, and may lead to a reduction of output figures {{as a result of their}} interference with forming and other subsequent processes. This work examined the formation of the so-called camber - the curvature of the strip in the strip plane - during the roughing process, which represents the first forming process in flat steel production. Inextricably linked with the camber phenomenon is the formation of an asymmetrical thickness profile (thickness wedge). The purpose of this work was to gain knowledge about the optimization potential of the roughing process in order to obtain a strip geometry with a maximum freedom from camber and thickness wedge formation. A great number of effects on camber formation is already known and has been described in the relevant literature. What has so far not been examined in detail is the edging effect frequently observed in the industrial practice. For that reason, initial laboratory tests were conducted to determine possible camber-affecting criteria in connection with the edging process. Three particular factors could be identified: different diameters of edging rolls, off-centre position of specimens and oblique head and tail ends of the strip resulted in a camber formation as early as during the edging process or after the subsequent horizontal rolling pass. Varying roughness values of edging rolls did not produce any camber. The main purpose of further tests was to examine the regeneration of a straight form without any camber and thickness wedge. To begin with, wedge-free specimens were rolled to a camber shape with tilted rolls. A restoration of the specimen's original straight shape was attempted a) by tilting the rolls in the opposite direction, b) by an only minor tilting of rolls and c) by their adjustment to a straight position. Test results proved that the straight, non-camber and wedge-free shape could be restored after the third rolling pass with only slightly tilted rolls. In addition to straight initial specimens rolled with tilted rolls, specimens with thickness wedges were rolled with straight rolls. The significant camber formation as a result of the asymmetrical thickness profile may be prevented by tilting the rolls according to the initial thickness wedge. This roll adjustment, however, does not cause a reduction of the thickness wedge. The rolled product exhibits either a camber or a thickness wedge or both defects. To obtain a straight specimen, an additional control element besides the tilting of rolls is required. For this reason, tests were conducted by using side guides. The positive effect of side <b>guides</b> on the <b>strip</b> form is frequently observed in the industrial practice. A comparison of specimens rolled with and without side guides proved that a reduction of both camber and thickness wedge can be achieved by using side guides during the rolling process. The thickness wedge was in part equalized as a result of an asymmetrical spread at both sides of the stand. In addition to laboratory tests, industrial process data were evaluated and analyzed by using data recorded by a strip form measuring system installed at the roughing train of the EKO-Stahl hot-rolling mill. This system measures the position of strip edges at both sides of the stand and at two points each in the entry and exit area of the stand. These data were used to determine the curvature of the strip, which provides a precise information about the size and direction of the strip camber. This calculation allows an online conclusion as to the strip camber at any point along the strip length. The curvature and all other relevant process data of EKO-Stahl were collected in a data base and were analyzed with regard to the strip camber, with various data-based methods being used to determine and evaluate the influential factors of the strip camber. This evaluation and the relevant test results were used to select the input variables of a data-based modelling for a pre-calculation of the strip curvature by means of the neural network technique. The obtained correlation factors between the curvature data determined on the basis of measured edge position data and those calculated by means of the model amount to 0. 7 - 0. 8 in the validation. In conclusion, a procedure for preventing camber and thickness wedge formation during hot roughing was elaborated and submitted to the German Patent Office. This procedure could allow the production of a straight form free from camber and thickness wedge formation for straight slabs as well as for slabs with a thickness wedge. A proposal for the control of the roughing process on the basis of this procedure is included...|$|R
