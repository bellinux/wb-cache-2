His father had {{arranged}} the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of manual labour. His father told him: [...] "If {{you want to do}} manual labour {{for the rest of your}} life you'll <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and – if you decide what you want to do – being good at your craft or your skill." [...] Barrowman worked for the power company for the entire summer, but did not like the job. Eventually, he convinced the company to move him to work in the storeroom.|$|E

2500|$|President Richard Nixon did not {{publicly}} {{comment about the}} decision. In private conversation later revealed {{as part of the}} Nixon tapes, Nixon said [...] "There are times when an abortion is necessary, I <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> have a black and a white" [...] (a reference to interracial pregnancies) [...] "or a rape." [...] However, Nixon was also concerned that greater access to abortions would foster [...] "permissiveness," [...] and said that [...] "it breaks the family." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{young man}} {{pulled up and}} removed his cap, for, idiot though he was, he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{have to do with}} people greater than yourself, a cap is more useful in the hand than on the head. Then, after wishing all kinds of good fortune to the lion and his family, he inquired if he was on the right road to Kerglas.|$|R
2500|$|Grohl's note read, in part, [...] "Though I'm {{halfway around}} the world right now, my heart is with you both, and I want you to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come home, there's two tickets to any Foos show, anywhere, and two cold beers waiting for you. Deal?" [...] In October 2006, one of the miners took up his offer, joining Grohl for a drink after the Foo Fighters {{acoustic}} concert at the Sydney Opera House. Since then, Foo Fighters have written an instrumental tribute song called [...] "Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners" [...] appearing on the album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace.|$|E

6000|$|Bidwell was roused. [...] "If I {{had planned}} to sneak I wouldn't 'a' {{come into the room}} with you a-standin' {{in the middle of the}} floor," [...] he replied, with some firmness. [...] "You ordered me out, didn't you? Well, I'm goin'.

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] she mocked. [...] "You can {{remember}} my name, then? Douglas, I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{you were a}} bad man. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> told me how you meant to cheat your creditors, how you meant to escape over here on the pretext of business, and bring all the money you could scrape together. I <b>knew</b> <b>that,</b> and yet I was willing to come with you, and I should have come. But {{there was one thing}} I didn't reckon upon.

6000|$|... "Why, hardly," [...] he answered, {{leaning back}} luxuriously in his arm-chair, and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe.

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] she said, [...] "I do {{not like}} to hear you talk so. Do you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do, you make me afraid that {{something}} I have always hoped for will never come to pass?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} that you brought me here on a fool's errand?" [...] he asked viciously; [...] "that the Citizen-Deputy Déroulède cannot be sent to the {{guillotine}} on mere suspicion, eh? Did you <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> wrote out that denunciation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ingleby seemed by {{no means}} pleased. [...] "It seems to me," [...] he said severely, [...] "that Tomlinson has been doing a good deal here. Now, you ought to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> want any {{improvements}} made you have only to ask Tom and me." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, Canham later {{denied that}} Elliott was [...] "eased out" [...] of his job. In an {{interview}} with Joe Falls, Canham said: [...] "Bump and I are close personal friends.

We talked about this {{and we talked about}} it openly. If Bump had said to me, ‘Look, give me a couple of more years,’ I would have given it to him. I mean that. I didn’t fire Bump Elliott.

This is solution viscoelasticity. It has been successfully used by industry for drag reduction in pipelines and mist reduction fran spray nozzles. Over the past 3 years it has also been used to efficiently recover hydrocarbon spills on water and land, to clean industrial wastewater of dispersed and dissolved hydrocarbons, and (with foam or a new sorbent formulation) to make gasoline spills simltaneously non-flamnable and recoverable.

"No, she did not," [...] {{answered}} Walkirk; [...] "but not {{wishing to}} put the question too pointedly, I first thanked her, on your behalf, for the kindly consideration she had given the matter.

40|$|In {{the nine}} stories of Let’s Do, various calamities strike {{ordinary}} Midwesterners, who {{cope with a}} mixture of good intentions and ineptitude. Balancing humor with painful clarity, author Rebecca Meacham pulls readers into the lives of characters who struggle with—and more often against—change. “Rebecca Meacham has one of the freshest voices I've encountered in a long time. Blatantly wise, she creates stories that are deliciously subversive, brave and outrageous, reminiscent of a young Alice Hoffman. As the lives of her characters get derailed, they move with the damaged grace of walking through broken glass on tiptoe. This is a writer whose words speak with emotional resonance about the resilience of the human heart—a beautiful, authentic talent who <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> turn life upside down, you get good measures of both trouble and laughter, a lesson the very best writers recognize early. ”—Jonis Agee, judg...|$|R

60|$|No, {{there is}} nothing of that kind in Mrs. Eddy's system. She <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> {{if you wish to}} confer upon a human being {{something}} which he is not sure he wants, the best way is to make it apparently difficult for him to get it--then he is no son of Adam if that apple does not assume an interest in his eyes which it lacked before.

500|$|Although Kidd {{drove his}} dancers hard, {{partly because he}} himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he {{required}} of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. Then he said, 'I wasn't trying to be mean. I just <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> saw it on film, you wouldn't be pleased.'

5000|$|There {{were reports}} during the 1968 season that Elliott {{had been given}} an ultimatum: [...] "Either win or face the {{possibility}} of being kicked upstairs."
