25|$|Unknown to Beast, Belle writes him {{a special}} book which he doesn't see until later on. She also meets Forte {{later on in}} a chance meeting. Forte tells her that Beast's {{favorite}} Christmas tradition was the Christmas tree. Belle becomes <b>frustrated,</b> <b>for</b> no tree she has seen on the grounds has been tall enough to hang ornaments. Forte lies to Belle, saying that a perfect tree {{can be found in}} the woods beyond the castle. Reluctant to go against Beast's orders that she never leave the castle, Belle leaves nonetheless in order to find the perfect tree. When Belle does not arrive to see Beast's Christmas present to her, he begins to suspect that she isn't there at all. When Cogsworth, having been ordered to retrieve Belle, explains that the household cannot find her, Beast becomes enraged. He goes to Forte to ask for advice, and Forte lies that Belle has abandoned him. Beast manages to find Belle and saves her in time from drowning after she fell through thin ice.|$|E
2500|$|Pseudobulbar affect [...] (PBA), or {{emotional}} incontinence, {{is a type}} of emotional disturbance characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays. PBA occurs secondary to a neurologic disorder or brain injury. Patients may find themselves crying uncontrollably at something that is only moderately sad, being unable to stop themselves for several minutes. Episodes may also be mood-incongruent: a patient may laugh uncontrollably when angry or <b>frustrated,</b> <b>for</b> example. Sometimes, the episodes may switch between emotional states, resulting in the patient crying uncontrollably when having sex.|$|E
2500|$|Besides {{the loss}} of Captain Marr, Confederate commanders, {{including}} Brigadier General Milledge Luke Bonham who was in overall command of the area, were unhappy {{about the lack of}} arms and ammunition which precipitated the flight of the Confederate cavalry. Union General-in-Chief Winfield Scott was displeased at Tompkins impetuous charge which Scott thought exceeded his orders to scout the Confederate positions and by the fact that Tompkins spoke to newspaper reporters before he even filed his report on the action. Maj. Gen. McDowell praised Tompkins's gallantry but also criticized Tompkins for exceeding orders, without mentioning Brig. Gen. Hunter's role or what Tompkins's exact orders from Hunter were. He also said Tompkins unintentionally <b>frustrated</b> <b>for</b> a time [...] "a more important movement." [...] He also criticized Tompkins for speaking to the press before he had even filed a report.|$|E

30|$|PBL can be <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> tutors {{who find}} it {{difficult}} to guide discussion. Training and inter-tutor discussion of experiences may avoid this.|$|R
5000|$|Students {{can have}} many {{failures}} during the subsequent years, which is <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> them and {{may increase the}} risk of dropping out.|$|R
2500|$|Peter Shawriz of Seert, {{nephew of}} Mikha'il Shawriz, bishop of Mardin, was consecrated {{metropolitan}} of Seert in 1801 by the metropolitan and natar kursya Hnanisho, nephew of the patriarch Eliya XIII Ishoyahb. [...] He travelled to Rome in 1806 {{to secure the}} confirmation of his appointment, but was <b>frustrated</b> <b>for</b> several years by the French occupation. [...] On his eventual return from Rome he met Henry Leeves of the British and Foreign Bible Society and the British embassy chaplain Robert Walsh in Constantinople in 1822, and the information he provided encouraged Leeves to contact the mountain Nestorians. [...] As {{a result of this}} association he was deposed from his diocese by the Vatican in 1823, and was then employed by Leeves as an agent of the Society, visiting the patriarch Shemon XVII Abraham in 1824 with Syriac copies of the Psalms and the New Testament. [...] He died at Khosrowa in 1831.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} {{served as}} Walford's GP for 14 years. Although {{his first name}} of Harold was revealed by the visiting DI Marsh (Harry Miller) in the final scene of the show's second episode in 1985, {{he has always been}} referred to by the majority of the other characters and in the closing credits as [...] "Dr Legg". Though a regular character with his own storylines throughout the 1980s, for much of the 1990s he was a recurring character, making increasingly sporadic appearances, and only when other characters needed medical assistance. In 1998, the executive producer of EastEnders, Matthew Robinson, announced that he was officially retiring Dr Legg. The character was one of many axed by the producer, who was dubbed the [...] "axeman" [...] by the British press. Speaking of his decision, Robinson commented [...] "Dr Legg is getting on a bit, so we're retiring him. He'll be going to a nice cottage in the country." [...] His place was filled by a younger alternative medicine fan, Dr Fred Fonseca, played by Jimi Mistry. Leonard Fenton has since spoken about his frustration that Dr Legg did not get to practice enough, claiming that he [...] "was <b>frustrated</b> <b>for</b> years by Dr Legg's sporadic appearances". In an interview in 2000, Fenton commented [...] "I told them I wasn't happy about going on once every two months. That's why it ended...". Dr Legg was never given an official exit on-screen, his retirement is mentioned by Dr Fonseca in January 1999, when the character Ruth Fowler (Caroline Paterson) requests to see him.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him. He sat crushed and <b>frustrated</b> <b>for</b> the time being, quite as emotionless and barren as herself. My God! {{this was a}} barren tragedy, barren, barren.|$|E
50|$|According to Michael Ramsey this conciliatory {{presentation}} aroused a great {{readiness to}} discuss reunion, but later declarations were more qualified and therefore <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> Free Churchmen.|$|R
50|$|The {{subsequent}} {{few years}} proved <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> Dunne as Tipperary {{failed to win}} any further Munster or All-Ireland titles. He retired from inter-county hurling in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{conversations with}} Team USA coaches and {{teammates}} about Jason Pierce's {{work ethic and}} attitude. Jason Pierce said that the U.S. training was really <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> him.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Dove's {{intentions}} were <b>frustrated,</b> <b>for</b> the maid {{of the inn}} knocked {{at the door with}} a message that the coach had orders not to wait, but that Miss was to come down immediately.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing {{more was}} said at that time, for a sudden {{shift in the}} wind necessitated a shift of the sail, but Dick Darvall nodded his head significantly, and {{it came to be}} {{understood}} that [...] "Doctor" [...] Brooke had regularly robbed himself of part of his meagre allowance in order to increase the store of the cabin-boy. Whether they were right in this conjecture has never been distinctly ascertained. But all attempts to benefit the boy were soon after <b>frustrated,</b> <b>for,</b> while life was little more than trembling in the balance with Will Ward, a gale burst upon them which sealed his fate.|$|E
60|$|Heavy-hearted and pale-cheeked {{with his}} rigidly {{observed}} fast, Richard armed himself in early morning, and set {{forth to the}} chapel tent, where the previous solemnities had to be observed. He had {{made up his mind}} to make an earnest appeal to the Earl of Gloucester, {{for the sake of the}} old friendship with his father, to become his godfather in the combat, as one whose character stood too high to be injured by connection with him. Even this plan was <b>frustrated,</b> <b>for</b> Hamlyn de Valence entered, led by Earl Gilbert as his sponsor. Should he turn to his one other friend, the Prince himself? Nay, the Prince was umpire and judge. Never stood warrior so lonely. Little John of Dunster crept up to his side; and but for fear of injuring the child, he would almost have asked him to be his sponsor. At that moment, however, the tramp of horses' feet was heard, and Sir Reginald de Ferrieres, with his squires, galloped up to the tent.|$|E
25|$|The {{return of}} cricket proved <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> Park {{particularly}} in 1948 when {{they failed to}} win a single game all season and ended up finishing bottom of the table.|$|R
5000|$|This is <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> me. I'm {{trying to}} keep this show ghetto, and there's a way {{for it to be}} both ghetto and intelligent. But it's not going that way.|$|R
50|$|Howard felt {{strongly}} about individual freedom. School had been <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> Howard, who {{was much more}} literate than his peers and not challenged by the schoolwork on offer. He felt trapped {{by the rules of}} the classroom.|$|R
60|$|A {{few words}} from Erling gave {{the men to}} {{understand}} what was expected of them. It was arranged that while he, Ulf, Glumm, and the hermit should put the girls into the little boat and guide them down the rapid, the men were to leap into the water and swim down. All were to land in the little bay, and then make for the cave on the coast in a body, and fight their way thither, if need be; but it was believed there would be no occasion for that, because before the plan was carried out most of the King's men would probably be assembled above the Crow Cliff at the stede. A few who could not swim were sent off at once by the track to warn Haldor. All these well-laid plans, however, were suddenly <b>frustrated,</b> <b>for,</b> while Erling was still consulting with Ulf and Glumm as to details, and peeping through the underwood, they beheld a sight which caused their hearts almost to stand still.|$|E
60|$|The {{hard times}} of 1912 had already caused a frightful slump {{in the farm}} markets. Prices were now {{deliberately}} pressed down to bankruptcy, while the railroads, with extortionate rates, broke {{the back of the}} farmer-camel. Thus the farmers were compelled to borrow more and more, while they were prevented from paying back old loans. Then ensued the great foreclosing of mortgages and enforced collection of notes. The farmers simply surrendered the land to the farm trust. There was nothing else for them to do. And having surrendered the land, the farmers next {{went to work for the}} farm trust, becoming managers, superintendents, foremen, and common laborers. They worked for wages. They became villeins, in short--serfs bound to the soil by a living wage. They could not leave their masters, for their masters composed the Plutocracy. They could not go to the cities, for there, also, the Plutocracy was in control. They had but one alternative,--to leave the soil and become vagrants, in brief, to starve. And even there they were <b>frustrated,</b> <b>for</b> stringent vagrancy laws were passed and rigidly enforced.|$|E
60|$|The {{dear old}} parsonage garden under the gray walls, the {{honeysuckle}} and monthly roses trailing over the porch, the lake-like creek {{between it and}} green Portsdown Hill, the huge massive keep and towers, and the masts in the harbour, the Island hills sleeping in blue summer haze--Anne's heart clave to them more than ever for {{the knowledge that the}} time was short and that the fair spot must be given up for the right's sake. Certainly there was some trepidation at the thought of the vault, and she had made many vague schemes for ascertaining that which her very flesh trembled at the thought of any one suspecting; but these were all <b>frustrated,</b> <b>for</b> since the war with France had begun, the bailey had been put under repair and garrisoned by a detachment of soldiers, the vault had been covered in, there was a sentry at the gateway of the castle, and the postern door towards the vicarage was fastened up, so that though the parish still repaired to church through the wide court solitary wanderings there were no longer possible, nor indeed safe for a young woman, considering what the soldiery of that period were.|$|E
5000|$|Early exits {{from the}} League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup to Liverpool, Newcastle and Trelleborg {{respectively}} were <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> Rovers in 1994-95, but {{turned out for}} the best as they could concentrate on the league challenge.|$|R
50|$|Electioneering was <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> {{council members}} because Kern County {{officials}} denied their request {{to allow a}} vote {{at the same time}} residents balloted in county elections. The council also tried putting a mail-in ballot in the local newspaper.|$|R
5000|$|There's {{nothing more}} <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> a {{transfer}} student than {{to sit down}} with a four-year school and realize they wasted two years because they didn't take the right classes. Alan Byrd, admissions director at University of Missouri-St. Louis, 2012 ...|$|R
60|$|This was our Lord's purpose; {{this had}} been his purpose for one {{thousand}} years and more: and behold, man's sin and folly had <b>frustrated</b> <b>for</b> a time the gracious will of God. That glorious city, with its temple, its worship, its religion, true {{as far as it}} went, and, {{in spite of all the}} traditions with which the Scribes and Pharisees had overlaid it, infinitely better than the creed or religion of any other people in the old world--all this, instead of being a blessing to the world, had become a curse. The Jews, who had the key of the knowledge of God, neither entered in themselves, nor let the Gentiles enter in. They who were to have taught all the world were hating and cursing all the world, and being hated and cursed by them in return. Jerusalem, the Holy City set on a hill, instead of being a light to the world, was become a nuisance to the world. Jerusalem was the salt of the world, meant to help it all from decay; but the salt had lost its savour, and in another generation it would be cast out and trodden under foot, and become a byword among the Gentiles.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Jordan {{looked away}} from her now--looked, she thought, rather injured and, as if trifled with, even a little angry. The mention of Lady Bradeen had <b>frustrated</b> <b>for</b> a while the {{convergence}} of our heroine's thoughts; but with this impression of her old friend's combined impatience and diffidence they began again to whirl round her, and continued it till one of them appeared to dart at her, out of the dance, as if with a sharp peck. It came to her with a lively shock, with a positive sting, that Mr. Drake was--could it be possible? With the idea she found herself afresh {{on the edge of}} laughter, of a sudden and strange perversity of mirth. Mr. Drake loomed, in a swift image, before her; such a figure as she had seen in open doorways of houses in Cocker's quarter--majestic, middle-aged, erect, flanked on either side by a footman and taking the name of a visitor. Mr. Drake then verily was a person who opened the door! Before she had time, however, to recover from the effect of her evocation, she was offered a vision which quite engulfed it. It was communicated to her somehow that the face with which she had seen it rise prompted Mrs. Jordan to dash, a bit wildly, at something, at anything, that might attenuate criticism. [...] "Lady Bradeen's re-arranging--she's going to be married." ...|$|E
50|$|Discrimination in the {{economic}} and business world. Not only may obtaining and holding a job be difficult, but career and mobility aspirations may be <b>frustrated</b> <b>for</b> both spouses. Securing the most desired housing often proves hard.|$|E
5000|$|Acting in {{university}} student productions was <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> her. She once noted [...] "All the best roles"—those she found interesting {{such as the}} lead in Henry V—"are written for blokes"; this was the catalyst that led her towards directing plays as a career.|$|R
40|$|Repeatedly {{negative}} prostate biopsies {{in individuals}} with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels can be <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> both {{the patient and}} the urologist. This study was performed to investigate if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -guided transrectal biopsy (MRGB) increases diagnostic performance in individuals with suspected prostate cancer (PCa) ...|$|R
50|$|Even {{with all}} of her work, the {{hospital}} was severely neglected, which was <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> Kaiser. In February 1862, Kaiser transferred to the Benton Barracks. Her work load did not decrease, however; Kaiser acted as a supervisor and a nurse, as well as overseeing kitchen and laundry operations.|$|R
5000|$|Jessica Penne gets <b>frustrated</b> <b>for</b> being {{stopped in}} the middle of {{training}} to be critiqued and brings it to Pettis' attention. The rest of the teal team also feels like they are getting [...] "over-coached" [...] by the assistant coaches as they are nitpicking their techniques way too much.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Frustrated</b> <b>for</b> {{being unable}} to harm the JSA, Degaton uses his time-traveling {{abilities}} to [...] "watch life hurting enemies". Sequentially confronting the JSA members, he tells them that he saw them die, and reveals some hints on their final moments. Now equipped with a time disc, Degaton {{has the ability to}} live [...] "between seconds", apparently ageless in an intangible state, which he can only be removed from with the concentrated tachyons found in the hourglass of Hourman.|$|E
5000|$|Dustin Hucks, for Ain't It Cool News, wrote [...] "Love can {{at times}} get very broad with scenes, dialogue, and flow… if you’re keen on clarity and the linear, Love {{is going to}} leave you <b>frustrated.</b> <b>For</b> others, however - the {{challenge}} of understanding what is what may lead to a desire for repeat viewings, which for me - is a lot of fun… This is a film that’s clearly not for everyone - but has a lot to offer the Inception and Moon crowds." ...|$|E
2500|$|E.G. Daily {{who played}} Baby Doll {{says it was}} [...] "a very <b>frustrating</b> thing <b>for</b> me" [...] to not sing in the film [...] "Because Diane Lane was singing, and I {{remember}} thinking, “Ah!” It was so <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> me. It was painful. Because I {{wanted to be on}} that stage singing with those guys... But back then I always played those quirky characters. I didn’t get those fancy leads. I got those best friend of the leads, quirky, funny characters. Hookers with a heart of gold. Weirdos." ...|$|R
25|$|But {{the last}} day was to prove curiously <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> a crowd of 22,000. There were some {{compensating}} thrills: two remarkable catches; a memorable fielding display by O'Neill; the cheap dismissal of Dexter; a highly competent century by that batting tradesman, Ken Barrington, who reached three figures with a hit for six...|$|R
50|$|Hynes {{earned his}} 20th Super Rugby cap in 2005, the last {{season of the}} Super 12 before the {{competition}} expanded to 14 teams. It {{was the middle of}} several lean years for the Queensland team and the backline players being starved of possession under a 10-man rugby gameplan was <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> Hynes.|$|R
