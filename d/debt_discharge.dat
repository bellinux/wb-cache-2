5000|$|For private households, it {{is argued}} to be {{insufficient}} to merely dismiss debts after a certain period [...] It is important to assess the underlying problems and {{to minimize the risk}} of financial distress to re-occur. It has been stressed that debt advice, a supervised rehabilitation period, financial education and social help to find sources of income and to improve the management of household expenditures need to be equally provided during this period of rehabilitation (Refiner et al., 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). In most EU Member States, <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> is conditioned by a partial payment obligation and by a number of requirements concerning the debtor's behavior. In the United States (US), discharge is conditioned to a lesser extent. The spectrum is broad in the EU, with the UK coming closest to the US system (Reifner et al., 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). The Other Member States do not provide the option of a <b>debt</b> <b>discharge.</b> Spain, for example, passed a bankruptcy law (ley concurs) in 2003 which provides for debt settlement plans that can result in a reduction of the debt (maximally half of the amount) or an extension of the payment period of maximally five years (Gerhardt, 2009), but it does not foresee <b>debt</b> <b>discharge.</b>|$|E

Federated failed to file reaffirmation agreements with bankruptcy courts. As a result, {{the changes in the}} agreements were not legally binding.|$|E

50|$|The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act was {{introduced}} in the United States Congress on September 25, 2007, and signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 20, 2007. This act offers relief to homeowners who would have owed taxes on forgiven mortgage debt after facing foreclosure. The act extends such relief for three years, applying to <b>debts</b> <b>discharged</b> in calendar year 2007 through 2009. With the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, this tax relief was extended another three years, covering <b>debts</b> <b>discharged</b> through calendar year 2012. Act further extended until January 1, 2014 at section 202 of American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.|$|R

5000|$|Partial payment {{refers to}} the {{offering}} of a payment by check {{for less than the}} full amount claimed by the creditor. Such an offer for <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> by tender of a [...] "payment-in-full" [...] check is a common practice. If the amount tendered is not grossly insufficient, it presents the creditor with a tough business decision: Will I accept the $9,000 and forfeit the other $1,000 that he really owes me or do I refuse it all in the hope I can collect $10,000 later? Traditional court rulings have treated the tender of the check as the offer of an accord and satisfaction. If the creditor accepts, endorses, and receives payment from the check, he has accepted the contract and so discharged the whole debt owed by the debtor.|$|E

40|$|Discharge of debts {{in case of}} {{community}} property <b>Debt</b> <b>discharge</b> is in Czech legal order relatively new legal institution and its application still {{gives rise to a}} number of questions and doubts. This work primarily focuses on situations when the discharge of debt concerns the community property. It means on one side the common discharge of spouses and on other hand discharge of debts of married debtor, whose spouse did not petitioned to permit <b>debt</b> <b>discharge.</b> We also concentrate on personal scope of <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> institution, mainly because it is not clear, whether the entrepreneur can also take advantage of <b>debt</b> <b>discharge,</b> or not. Further we would {{like to point out that}} present valid and effective articulation of the Insolvency Act does not include institution of common <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> of spouses, which has been created by insolvency courts but its application has not been unified. It is also not clear how would be the spouse of debtor who filed a petition to permit <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> and their community property affected by the discharge procedure, when the spouse of the debtor is not party to a case. We also deal with a problem, how should creditors file the applications of the receivables against the spouses and how to review these receivables, when the statutory regulations are missing and the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|ENG) DISCHARGE OF A DEBTOR - ONE OF MODES OF INSOLVENCY SOLUTION This diploma thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{detailed}} overview of the discharge from debts in the insolvency proceedings. The debt relief was incorporated into the Czech legal system by the Insolvency act, No. 182, 2006 Coll, which entered into force on the January 1 st 2008. The idea of <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> was led by an intention to provide highest possible and proportional satisfaction equally to all creditors {{and in the same}} time, to protect debtor's right to decent living conditions. In the case of successful <b>debt</b> <b>discharge,</b> the debtor is forgiven part of his debts, as long as he performs his good will during entire insolvency process. The debtor must not have any debts originated in his business activities, unless he specifically agrees on an exception with the creditor. This determinates a <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> to be used mainly by individual persons, not by companies. Also, the final creditors' satisfaction must reach at least 30 % of debtor's claims. We distinguish two forms of <b>debt</b> <b>discharge.</b> In the first case, which is called audition, all debtor's assets are sold out and received funds are used for creditors' satisfaction. In the second case, which uses agreed payment schedule, all debtor's income over the minimum base is regularly [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Discharge {{a rescue}} mode of {{resolution}} of insolvency Summary The {{aim of this}} thesis {{is to provide a}} comprehensive analysis of the Institute of debt relief as one of the solution of bankruptcy. The work is divided into three chapters. The first chapter is a historical excursion, describing the evolution of resolving insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings in the world and in the Czech Republic. The second chapter deals with the general interpretation of the concept of bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings and its effects. The third and most extensive chapter then focuses on discharge from debts itself and its nodal points that are crucial in this process. Namely persons entitled to file a petition for permission to discharge debts, including the requirements of this petition, the court's decision on the permit and subsequent approval of discharge from debts, <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> methods and duties of the debtor, and finally the decision of fullfilment of <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> and exemption of debtor from debts. Act no. 182 / 2006 Coll. on bankruptcy and its solution (Insolvency Act) provides two methods of <b>debt</b> <b>discharge.</b> <b>Debt</b> <b>discharge</b> through the realisation of assets or under the schedule payement. Both methods have in common that the debtor must pay at least 30 % of the total value of its unsecured debts and the unsecured [...] ...|$|E

If the subject of the contract is destroyed (such as through merging the contract subject and the contract obligation), then the contract may be made void. Extinguishment occurs in a variety of contracts, such as land contracts (common, copyhold), debts, rents, and right of ways. A right may be extinguished by nullifing that right or, {{in the case of a}} <b>debt,</b> <b>discharged</b> by payment in full or through settlement.|$|R

40|$|The {{key feature}} of the modern U. S. {{personal}} bankruptcy law is to provide debtors a financial fresh start through <b>debt</b> <b>discharge.</b> The primary justification for the discharge policy is to preserve human capital by maintaining incentives for work. In this paper, we test this fresh start argument by providing the first estimate {{of the effect of}} personal bankruptcy filing on the labor supply using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Our econometric approach controls for the endogenous self-selection of bankruptcy filing and allows for dependence over time for the same household. We find that filing for bankruptcy does not {{have a positive impact on}} annual hours worked by bankrupt households, a result mainly due to the wealth effects of <b>debt</b> <b>discharge.</b> The finding is robust to a number of alternative model specifications and sample selections. Therefore, our analysis does not find supporting evidence for the human capital argument for bankruptcy discharge. Bankruptcy...|$|E

We find evidence for this by using plausibly exogenous variations in travel-related entry costs into the Canadian consumer bankruptcy system. Using detailed balance sheet and travel data, we find that higher travel-related entry costs reduce bankruptcies from individuals with lower financial benefits of bankruptcy (unsecured <b>debt</b> <b>discharged,</b> minus secured assets forgone). When compared across filers, each extra kilometer traveled to access the bankruptcy system requires approximately $ 11 more in financial benefits from bankruptcy...|$|R

We find support for the balance sheet channel, in that receipt of the exogenous cash increases the net balance sheet benefits of bankruptcy (unsecured <b>debt</b> <b>discharged</b> minus liquidated assets forgone) required by filers. We also find limited support for the income statement channel, in that exogenous payments reduce bankruptcy filings from individuals whose current expenses exceed their current income...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{explore the}} ways French judges {{respond to the}} {{possibility}} of discharging personal debts in exchange for liquidation of debtors ’ assets. We present empirical results on the determinants of judicial selection between debtors whose debts are wiped out and those who have to reimburse them. We find that French judges tend to disqualify debtors with multiple creditors from <b>debt</b> <b>discharge,</b> and are sensitive to regional labor market conditions. These empirical results help us understand better how French personal bankruptcy laws perform compared to other national systems. Finally, our results serve to fill the gap between bankruptcy rules and judicial practice...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we focus on}} firms’ access to credit under {{different}} sources of asymmetric information. In Chapter 1 we analyze how the institution of <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> of bankruptcy law affects loan contracts. In particular we evaluates the effects of <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> on access to credit and cost of credit by taking into account {{its impact on the}} role of collateral as a signaling device. In the theoretical model we take explicitly into account the fact that borrowers can undo the effects of exemption by posting collateral to secure debt. Using the results of the theoretical analysis we test for the signaling effect of collateral in a sample of US small businesses. In Chapter 2 we study the emergence of the phenomenon of firms’ bor- rowing discouragement. This becomes a relevant issue in the credit market especially when credit worthy firms do not apply causing a po- tential misallocation of financial resources. Regarding this aspect of access to credit, our work aims to give a new theoretical view of bor- rowing discouragement stemming from the interaction between asym- metric information, uncertainty on collateral requirements and cost of applications. In Chapter 3 we study the importance of using trade credit to reduce the information asymmetries between firms and banks. Under this per- spective trade credit is a complementary financing resource. We test the complementarity hypothesis using an empirical methodology that takes into account the relevance of private information in the firm-bank relationship. </br...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of consumer bankruptcy in Slovenian law. In the first part author analyses what are the social purposes and goals of this legal institution. This is done with assistance of the comparative legal method taking into account the relevant comparable legal regulations. In {{the second part of the}} article author presents the function of the consumer bankruptcy and discharge of debt in Slovenian legal regulation. It is followed by the third part with an economic analysis of the debtor incentives for investment of a maximal effort to compensate creditors. This analysis shows how the maximal compensation is achieved in a system where there is no <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> and this is valid as far as the value of the debt does not reach a margin where the debtor has no more motivation for cooperation and he starts actively impeding the process of creditor’s compensation. In such situation the creditors repay from the existing debtor’s property only. Therefore it seems better to have a regulation where the debtor has an option to partially repay his debt and act adequately during a certain period of time, and then to have a discharge of the remaining debt which all give him a possibility for a fresh start. However, even in such situation we cannot expect debtor to invest his maximal effort in a partial compensation. It would therefore be more effective to have a solution where a clear and to debtor position adjusted sum of partial compensation would be set as a condition to achieve a <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> (similar as in Austrian regulation) ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a theory of}} {{unsecured}} consumer credit and personal bankruptcy based on the optimal trade-off between incentives and insurance. We solve a fairly standard dynamic moral hazard problem, in which agents ’ private effort decisions influence the life-cycle profiles of their earnings. We then show how the optimal allocation of individual effort and consumption can be implemented in a market equilibrium in which agents and intermediaries repeatedly trade in secured and unsecured debt instruments, and agents obtain (restricted) discharge of their unsecured debts in bankruptcy. Surprisingly, the structure of this equilibrium and the associated restrictions on <b>debt</b> <b>discharge</b> closely match the main qualitative features of personal credit markets and bankruptcy law that actually exist in the United States. ...|$|E

Sample data consisted of women from the NLSY 79 cohort who completed the age 40 and 50 health modules as of the most recent wave. Results indicated a negative effect of bankruptcy on self-assessed health, whereas prior health history explained its negative relationship with depressive symptoms. Debt liquidation under Chapter 7 was associated with poor physical health relative to those who did not file and with depressive symptoms relative to Chapter 13 repayment plan filers. Poor health is an unintended consequence for women who seek financial relief through bankruptcy...|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} the 2005 {{bankruptcy}} abuse reform (BAR) contributed to the surge in subprime foreclosures that followed its passage. Before BAR, distressed mortgagors could free up income by filing bankruptcy and having their unsecured <b>debts</b> <b>discharged.</b> BAR blocks that maneuver for better-off filers {{by way of a}} means test. We identify the effects of BAR using state home equity bankruptcy exemptions; filers in low-exemption states were not very protected before BAR, so they would be less affected by the reform. Difference-in-difference regressions confirm four predictions implied by that identification strategy. Our findings add to research trying to explain the surge in subprime foreclosures and to a broader literature on household bankruptcy demand and credit supply.

40|$|A large {{literature}} has examined factors leading to filing for personal bankruptcy, but {{little is known}} about household borrowing after bankruptcy. Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, we find that relative to comparable nonfilers, bankruptcy filers generally have more limited access to unsecured credit but borrow more secured debt post bankruptcy, and they pay higher interest rates on all types of debt. We also find that credit access and borrowing costs improve as more time passed since filing. However, filers experience renewed debt payment difficulties and accumulate less wealth, even many years after filing, suggesting that for many bankrupt households, <b>debt</b> <b>discharges</b> fail to generate an effective fresh start as intended by the law. Our estimate also provides empirical guidance for calibrating the equilibrium models of household credit. Bankruptcy; Loans, Personal...|$|R
