5|$|Specifically, the HPP lattice gas model {{consists}} of particles moving at unit velocity {{in the four}} axis-parallel <b>directions.</b> When two particles meet on the same line in opposite <b>directions,</b> they collide and are sent outwards from the collision point on the perpendicular line. This system obeys the conservation laws of physical gases, and produces simulations whose appearance resembles the behavior of physical gases. However, it was found to obey unrealistic additional conservation laws. For instance, the total momentum within any single line is conserved. As well, the differences between axis-parallel and non-axis-parallel <b>directions</b> in this model (its anisotropy) is undesirably high. The FHP lattice gas model improves the HPP model by having particles moving in six different <b>directions,</b> at 60 degree angles to each other, instead of only four <b>directions.</b> In any head-on collision, the two outgoing particles are deflected at 60 degree angles from the two incoming particles. Three-way collisions are also possible in the FHP model and are handled {{in a way that}} both preserves total momentum and avoids the unphysical added conservation laws of the HPP model.|$|E

Principal Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) announces her intention to marry herself, and glee club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) tells fellow member Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) that he loves her {{and would like to}} marry her in the future, by offering her a promise ring.|$|E
5|$|Damage to nerves III, IV, or VI {{may affect}} the {{movement}} of the eyeball (globe). Both or one eye may be affected; in either case double vision (diplopia) will likely occur because the movements of the eyes are no longer synchronized. Nerves III, IV and VI are tested by observing how the eye follows an object in different <b>directions.</b> This object may be a finger or a pin, and may be moved at different <b>directions</b> to test for pursuit velocity. If the eyes do not work together, the most likely cause is damage to a specific cranial nerve or its nuclei.|$|E

Heuveldorp, unable to force the actors to play their roles seriously, shot several scenes with them acting as they wished before showing them the results; upon realising that their acting had been disappointing, the cast began to listen to stage <b>directions.</b> Afterwards they began rehearsing each scene at least twice, with Kartabrata standing behind the cameraman and giving <b>directions.</b>|$|E

50|$|A similar {{concept is}} {{speculative}} execution, where instructions from one <b>direction</b> {{of a branch}} (the predicted <b>direction)</b> are executed before the branch <b>direction</b> is known. When the branch <b>direction</b> is known, the predicted <b>direction</b> and the actual <b>direction</b> are compared. If the predicted <b>direction</b> was correct, the speculatively executed instructions and their results are kept; if it was incorrect, these instructions and their results are erased. Speculative execution, coupled with an accurate branch predictor, gives a large performance gain.|$|R
5|$|Loder {{wrote her}} first song at age 16 about a cousin {{who had died}} in a traffic accident. She was {{studying}} nursing at the Grenfell Campus of Memorial University of Newfoundland when she released The Way in August 2009. Also that year, she won a talent-search contest hosted by YC Newfoundland, a Christian youth conference, and, as part of the award, was given time with music professionals who helped her with Imperfections & <b>Directions,</b> which was released at the 2010 YC Newfoundland. Loder's nursing studies hampered her ability to showcase Imperfections & <b>Directions</b> by touring. Loder was nominated as Female Artist of the Year at the 2010 MusicNL awards, and then as Gospel Artist of the Year in 2011. Imperfections & <b>Directions</b> was nominated as Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the Year at the 2012 Juno Awards.|$|E
