As Batman's nemesis, the Joker {{has been part of}} the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of Jason Todd—the second Robin and Batman's ward—and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon. The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances.

Expressing his disgust over the League lacking the roster he desires, he returns to Earth and kills the Earth-15 Wonder Woman (Donna) and Batman (Jason). Realizing this is not the perfect Earth he is looking for, Superman-Prime dives through the planet and destroys it. He vows to find <b>his</b> <b>perfect</b> universe even if he has to tear apart the entire Multiverse to do so. Building a secret lair in the Source Wall itself, Superman-Prime captures Mister Mxyzptlk and Annataz Arataz, an evil analogue of Zatanna, and forces them to give him their magic powers as a replacement for the energies he temporarily absorbed from a Guardian. After her torture at Superman-Prime's hands, Annataz experiences a change of heart and, as a way to atone for her past, taunts Superman-Prime until he lets Mxyzptlk escape, facing his tantrums alone. Superman-Prime destroys his base, burns Annataz alive, and flees. Mxyzptlk orders Gsptlsnz, his girlfriend, to seal off the Fifth Dimension.

25|$|He was {{the leading}} all-rounder for Derbyshire between the wars and at his peak {{probably}} the most deadly bowler on a sticky wicket Derbyshire ever produced, owing to <b>his</b> <b>perfect</b> length and ability to turn the ball back from the off. His pace was almost medium {{and even the most}} fleet-footed of batsmen could not hit him easily on a bad pitch; however, his lack of flight and variety made him less effective on good pitches.
