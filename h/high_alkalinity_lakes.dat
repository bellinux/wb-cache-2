All samples were collected using a 2 minute kick sweep method with a 670 ? mesh pond net, preserved in situ in 70 % alcohol and subsequently sorted and identified to the lowest level of taxonomic resolution practicable. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS), cluster analysis and TWINSPAN classification methods were used to examine the potential for using the littoral invertebrate fauna to differentiate among sites, among lakes, among seasons and among alkalinity types. Given that the underlying structure in the data was known, the efficacy of three common classification methods was assessed. The effect of sampling effort and the influence of rare species on the classification of biological invertebrate samples were also examined...|$|E
40|$|Phytoplankton {{data from}} 606 lakes {{was used to}} characterise {{indicator}} taxa of near pristine reference conditions in clearwater and humic lowland lakes in Northern and Central Europe. Reference lakes were selected based on low pressure from catchment land-use, low population density and absence of point sources. Reference lakes had low phytoplankton biomass and taxa richness compared to non-reference lakes. In the North European low alkalinitry lakes the reference communities had high biomass proportions of chrysophytes and low proportions of cyanobacteria; in the Central European <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> <b>lakes</b> the biomass was distributed more evenly among algal groups. Indicator Species Analysis and Similarity Analysis listed 5 - 29 taxa for reference conditions. Indicator taxa differed especially between the low alkalinity North European and high alkalinity Central European lakess {{but there were also}} country-specific differences. Most common indicator taxa for the Northern reference lakes were chrysophytes (e. g. Bitrichia, Dinobryon). In the Central European reference lakes diatoms (e. g. Cyclotella) were more characteristic. Despite the differences there was a general finding that taxa present in reference lakes were often also present in non-reference lakes, but typically in lower biomass proportions. Another characteristic of the reference communities is the absence of many taxa typically found in non-reference lakes. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|E
40|$|In Europe {{there is}} a renewed focus on {{relationships}} between chemical determinands and ecological impact {{as a result of}} the Water Framework Directive (WFD). In this paper we use regression analysis to examine the relationship of growing season mean chlorophyll a concentration with total phosphorus and total nitrogen using summary data from over 1, 000 European lakes. For analysis, lakes were grouped into types with three categories of mean depth, alkalinity and humic content. The lakes were also divided into broad geographic regions covering Atlantic, Northern, Central/Baltic and for some types the Mediterranean areas of Europe. Chlorophyll a was found to be significantly related to both total phosphorus and total nitrogen, although total phosphorus was almost always found to be the best predictor of chlorophyll. Different nutrient chlorophyll relationships were found for lakes according to mean depth and alkalinity, although no significant effect of geographic region or humic content was found for the majority of lake types. We identified three groups of lakes with significantly different responses. Deep lakes had the lowest yield of chlorophyll per unit of nutrient, low and moderate alkalinity shallow lakes the highest and <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> <b>lakes</b> were intermediate. We recommend that the regression models provided for these three lake groups should be used for lake management in Europe and discuss the limitations of such model...|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} a lake to become alkalic, a special {{combination}} of geographic, geological and climatic conditions are required. First of all, a suitable topography is needed, that limits the outflow {{of water from the}} lake. When the outflow is completely prevented, this is called an endorheic basin. Craters or depressions formed by tectonic rifting often provide such topological depressions. The <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> and salinity arise through evaporation of the lake water. This requires suitable climatic conditions, in order for the inflow to balance outflow through evaporation. The rate at which carbonate salts are dissolved into the lake water also depends on the surrounding geology and can in some cases lead to relatively <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> even in <b>lakes</b> with significant outflow.|$|R
40|$|The Water Framework Directive (WFD), {{requires}} European Member States {{to assess}} the "ecological status" of surface waters. As part of this, many European countries have developed an ecological quality classification scheme for chlorophyll concentrations {{as a measure of}} phytoplankton abundance. The assessment of ecological quality must be based on the degree of divergence of a water body from an appropriate baseline, or 'reference condition'. It is, therefore, necessary to determine chlorophyll reference conditions for all European lake types. This involves examining how chlorophyll concentrations vary by lake type, {{in the absence of any}} nutrient pressures from agriculture or wastewater. For this purpose, a dataset of 540 European lakes considered to be in a relatively undisturbed reference condition has been assembled, including data on chlorophyll concentration, altitude, mean depth, alkalinity, humic content, surface area and geographical region. Chlorophyll was found to vary with lake type and geographical region, and to be naturally highest in low-altitude, very shallow, <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> and humic <b>lake</b> types and naturally lowest in clear, deep, low <b>alkalinity</b> <b>lakes.</b> The results suggest that light and mineral availability are important drivers of chlorophyll concentrations in undisturbed lakes. Descriptive statistics (median and percentiles) of chlorophyll concentrations were calculated from populations of lakes in this reference lake dataset and used to derive lake-type specific reference chlorophyll concentrations. These reference conditions can be applied, through a comparison with observed chlorophyll concentrations at a site, in the assessments of ecological status and provide a consistent baseline to adopt for European countries...|$|R

40|$|Eutrophication is {{the most}} {{widespread}} pressure impacting on lakes worldwide and, in general, its control is underpinned by the premise that algal biomass is regulated by phosphorus availability. This paper aims to demonstrate that not all lakes will conform to the underlying principle of the Chl:TP relationships using variables collected widely in lake monitoring programmes across the world (i. e. total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chl) concentrations). The ratio of annual mean Chl and TP concentrations in 94 lakes (2007 and 2008) {{was used as a}} measure of the efficiency with which TP is transferred into algal biomass (i. e. as an indicator of P limitation) to investigate the validity of the phosphorus reduction approach. Chl:TP ratios ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 84 in 2007 and from 0. 03 to 0. 96 in 2008. Chl and TP values were positively correlated (p < 0. 05) with alkalinity, and negatively correlated with depth and surface area, in both years. In general, mean annual Chl and TP concentrations increased as alkalinity increased and depth decreased. However, Chl:TP ratio was highest in <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> <b>lakes</b> in 2007, and moderate alkalinity lakes in 2008. Our results indicate that the use of TP water quality targets alone is insufficient to accurately manage eutrophication pressures at the lake specific scale, and that a wider range of ecological and ecosystem service evaluation targets would provide a more comprehensive assessment of management needs. The wide range of Chl:TP ratio values reported in this study suggests that, although reducing TP concentrations in lakes is undoubtedly a sensible approach to eutrophication management in many cases, TP reductions alone may not result in the expected reductions in phytoplankton biomass in all lakes...|$|E
40|$|The European Water Framework Directive {{adopted in}} 2000, despite being prescriptive, has stimulated the {{development}} of a diverse array of biological assessment methods in Europe. The multitude of indicators currently used in biomonitoring lacks consistency and thus constrains the comparability of assessments at an international scale. Therefore, there is an argument to define and validate metrics with more universal application that can be applied EU-wide. We explored two metrics based on macrophyte taxonomic composition, the empirically based Intercalibration Common Metric for lake macrophytes (ICMLM) and the expert-based Ellenberg Index (EI), for their ability to detect eutrophication in different types of European lowland lakes. Data from 1474 unique lake-years from 11 countries were used to explore relationships between these metrics and the seasonal mean concentration of total phosphorus (TP) using linear regression. ICMLM gave a linear and relatively strong (R = 0. 72, p 0. 2 meq L− 1 and significantly weaker in less buffered lakes. EI performed better in lakes with alkalinity < 1. 0 meq L− 1, whereas in <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> <b>lakes</b> the response was significantly weaker. In all the lakes and in lakes from all the size, depth and alkalinity types, ICMLM was more strongly correlated with TP than EI and was proportionally less sensitive to alkalinity. We also tested the effect of including helophytes on the metric response to eutrophication pressure by comparing the strength of the relationships to TP of the Ellenberg Index calculated firstly using only hydrophyte taxa (EI′HYDR) and secondly using all macrophyte taxa including both hydrophytes and emergent vegetation (EI′TOT). The differences in metric performance in all the lakes and all the size, depth and alkalinity types, except for the Nordic lakes, were non-significant. Thus, including helophytes generally did not significantly improve the strength of the EI–TP relationships...|$|E

Not all participants had reference sites against which national methods could be standardised and, therefore, a Generalised Linear Modelling approach was used to control the effect of national differences in datasets. This enabled the high/good and good/moderate status boundaries to be expressed on a common scale and for deviations beyond ? 0. 25 class widths to be identified. Those countries which had relaxed boundaries were required to adjust these to within ? 0. 25 class widths whilst the intercalibration rules allowed those countries with more stringent boundaries to retain these. Despite biogeographical and typological differences between countries, there was broad agreement on the characteristics of high, good and moderate status diatom assemblages, and the exercise has ensured consistent application of Water Framework Directive assessments around Europe...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if aquatic insect production was significantly different between <b>high</b> and low <b>alkalinity</b> mountain streams and if any differences were associated with food availability factors. The major objectives included determining: (1) if annual production differences occur between <b>high</b> and low <b>alkalinity</b> streams; (2) if processing rates of terrestrial detritus differs between <b>high</b> and low <b>alkalinity</b> streams; (3) if detrital processing rates are related to stream insect productivities; (4) if primary productivity varies between <b>high</b> and low <b>alkalinity</b> streams; (5) if toxic effects or micronutrient limitations exist in <b>high</b> or low <b>alkalinity</b> streams that could limit insect survivals. A <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> stream was defined as one having over 150 milligrams per liter average total alkalinity. Six study sites on four <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams were located in the Wasatch National Forest near Logan in northern Utah. Six study sites on four low alkalinity streams were located in the Shoshone National Forest near Yellowstone National Park in northern Wyoming. Sites from each region were shown to not differ significantly for all physical parameters tested. The mean annual production of 22 of the 29 invertebrate taxa analyzed were significantly higher in the <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams, while 2 taxa were significantly more productive in the low alkalinity streams. The mean annual production of all taxa summed was significantly higher in the <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams. All <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> sites had significantly higher production than any low alkalinity site. Alder leaf packs left open to allow invertebrate activity had a significantly higher rate of weight loss in the <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> stream. Alder leaf packs placed inside fine mesh bags to exclude invertebrate activity showed no significant differences in weight loss when the experiments were terminated. The patterns of weight loss for these mesh packs did differ between the two stream types. In the <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> stream, the leaves had a early rapid weight loss phase followed by a period of reduced weight loss. In the low alkalinity stream, the leaves experienced little weight loss during the early phase of the study but lost weight rapidly during the latter phase. The survivorships of all taxa tested did not differ significantly between <b>high</b> and low <b>alkalinity</b> water. Estimates of detrital inputs based on drift measurements and standing crops of detritus collected with invertebrate samples showed no significant differences between regions. The following conclusions resulted from the study. The <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams had a significantly much higher production of aquatic invertebrates than did the low <b>alkalinity</b> streams. The <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams also had significantly higher standing crops of attached algae and faster processing of alder leaves. Algae and processed allochthonous detritus are two major food sources for many aquatic invertebrates. It is concluded that a major reason for the great difference in invertebrate production between the physically similar <b>high</b> and low <b>alkalinity</b> streams in this study was the availability difference of these two food sources. The insects in the <b>high</b> <b>alkalinity</b> streams had much more of both food types available to them so a much higher annal production of aquatic invertebrates was supported...|$|R
