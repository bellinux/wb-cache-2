5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the poly(A) tail of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, {{it can take}} many hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and <b>degradation</b> <b>process</b> can be accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E
5|$|Proteasomes {{are part}} of a major {{mechanism}} by which cells regulate the concentration of particular proteins and degrade misfolded proteins. Proteins are tagged for degradation with a small protein called ubiquitin. The tagging reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called ubiquitin ligases. Once a protein is tagged with a single ubiquitin molecule, this is a signal to other ligases to attach additional ubiquitin molecules. The result is a polyubiquitin chain that is bound by the proteasome, allowing it to degrade the tagged protein. The <b>degradation</b> <b>process</b> yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long, which can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in synthesizing new proteins.|$|E

40|$|The {{strongly}} incised mountain {{landscape of}} northern Thailand {{has changed dramatically}} {{during the last few}} decades due to increased population pressure, agricultural commercialization, limitation to use old fallows and reforestation of upper catchments. The traditional shifting cultivation with fallow periods of 7 years and longer was gradually replaced by 1 to 4 year fallow periods. As a result, in high population areas the landscape became dominated by fields planted to rainfed upland crops, wetland rice terraces, fallow vegetation, and patches of secondary forest. This new land-use system seems to have triggered new land <b>degradation</b> <b>processes</b> that are easy to observe when travelling through this landscape. The objective of this research was to assess the multiple effects of land-use intensification in a tropical steepland environment on land <b>degradation</b> <b>processes.</b> A case studywas conducted at Pakha village (located in Thailand's northern most Chiang Rai province), which is dominated by steepland with average slope gradients ranging from 30 to 70 %. Soil erosion processes were monitored in a selected catchment for 2 years, and informal interviews were conducted to elucidate farmers' perceptions regarding land <b>degradation</b> <b>processes.</b> The rapid land-use changes at the Dze Donglo catchment (164 ha) resulted in severe and accelerated land degradation, including tillage erosion (386 ton/year), inter-rill and rill erosion (502 ton/year), gully erosion (423 ton/year), and landslides (7572 ton during 1994). Water erosion is most common in intensively farmed areas. The combination of runoff-generating areas, runoff-concentrating features and connectivity led to extensive gully erosion. Landslides were most common in steep fallows and in wetland terraces along incising streams. Many of these steepland <b>degradation</b> <b>processes</b> interacted with each other (i. e. rills with gully erosion, tillage erosion with water erosion, gullies with landslides). The observed land <b>degradation</b> <b>processes</b> matched very well with farmers' perceptions.
