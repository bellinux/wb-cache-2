40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) have become popular tools worldwide for ecosystem conservation and fishery management. Fish assemblages {{can benefit from}} protection provided by MPAs, especially those that include fully no-take reserves. Fish response to protection can thus be {{used to evaluate the}} effectiveness of marine reserves. Most target fish are high-level predators and their overfishing may affect entire communities through trophic cascades. In the Mediterranean rocky sublittoral, marine reserves may allow fish predators of sea urchins to recover and thus whole communities to be restored from coralline barrens to macroalgae. Such direct and indirect reserve effects, however, are likely to be related to the enforcement implemented. In Italy, many MPAs that include no-take reserves have been declared, but little effort has been spent to enforce them. This is a worldwide phenomenon (although more common in some regions than others) that may cause MPAs and reserves to fail to meet their targets. We found that 3 of 15 Italian marine reserves investigated had adequate enforcement, and that patterns of recovery of target fish were related to enforcement. No responses were detected when all reserves were analyzed as a whole, suggesting enforcement as an important factor to be considered in future studies particularly to avoid that positive ecological responses in properly managed reserves can be masked by neutral/negative results in paper parks. Positive responses were observed for large piscivores (e. g. <b>dusky</b> <b>groupers)</b> and sea urchin predators at reserves where enforcement was effective.

40|$|The <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus marginatus (Lowe 1834), is a protogynous {{sequential}} hermaphrodite and {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important fish species in the Mediterranean Sea. It is a K-strategist, being slow growing and late maturing, and this, coupled with its reproductive biology and relatively sedentary behaviour, has made it extremely sensitive to overexploitation, leading it to be classified by the IUCN as an endangered fish species. Wild <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> have suffered from disease outbreaks in the past decade, leading to mass mortalities across the Mediterranean Sea, including Libyan coastal waters. These mortalities have mostly been attributed to Nodavirus infections. In Europe and Brazil, efforts are in place to culture this fish for commercial grow-out and stock enhancement programmes. In Libya, the <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> is consumed regularly {{and is considered}} a prime-eating fish. Its importance for the Libyan internal market, as well as its potential for export, makes it an ideal candidate for future Libyan aquaculture activities. Given the scarce literature regarding the <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> in Libya, this study aimed first to assess <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> fisheries, spawning seasons and to identify the main threats that the fishing sector poses for wild stocks. Second this study aimed to determine the health status of wild <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> offered at a local fish market in the capital Tripoli, in order to identify pathogens, pathologies or other health issues that might pose a hazard to cultured populations but also to remaining wild <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> stocks. To achieve these aims, twelve field surveys spanning the period of 2013 - 2015 were conducted. From these surveys, it was established that the <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> is captured throughout the year, including the spawning season. Fish sizes offered for sale ranged between 20 - 92 cm total length (TL), with the fish being sold from local fishing grounds around Tripoli, but also from as far as Benghazi, 1300 km to the east of Tripoli. The <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> is principally caught in artisanal fisheries and by spearfishing, with approximately 300 spear-fishermen serving one particular fish market in Tripoli that was a focus in this study, and with <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> being one of their main targets.

No prior research has been conducted in such man-made habitat and the current study provides a basis for comparative studies on the diet of the <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> populations inhabiting natural vs. man-made rocky habitats.

40|$|Despite {{research}} efforts addressing artificial propagation, <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> aquaculture still relies on experimental trials {{owing to the}} low survival rates of larvae and juveniles, thus rendering mass rearing difficult to attain. Although some authors suggested that the preys offered to the early larval stages represent the major problem facing the rearing of all grouper species, very little information is available in literature on larval development and the behaviour of <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the trophic preferences of larval stages of the <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> by rearing using a semi-intensive technology. Larvae were reared in pilot scale mesocosms (60 m 3) from 3 to 35 days post hatching. The rearing system was supplied with wild zooplankton collected in a natural coastal lagoon in order to augment the chances of satisfying the larvae's feeding requirements; the feeding preferences were analyzed during ontogenesis. The relationship between mouth gape and dimensions of preys, considered as 3 -D objects, was investigated to identify possible critical factor. The results of this study suggested a sequence of suitable food items from the beginning of exogenous feeding until day 35 post hatching.

The present work investigates age structure, growth and reproduction of individuals inhabiting a pair of rocky jetties, about 4. 5 km long each, located {{in the mouth of}} Patos Lagoon in the municipality of Rio Grande, in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. A total of 130 individuals obtained between February 2007 and May 2009 were analyzed, with total length ranging from 260 to 800 mm. The growth coefficient found in the present study (K: 0. 069) was lower than values reported for <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> populations from the Mediterranean Sea (0. 087) and southeast Africa (0. 09). This difference could be related to higher average water temperatures in these regions compared to the current study site or due to poorer habitat quality in terms of the shelters available for <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> individuals to establish their territories. Microscopic ovarian analyses of individuals during three years of sampling revealed only the occurrence of immature and resting females. The absence of ripe or post-spawning individuals, associated with low GSI values (< 0. 2) over the studied months, indicates that the <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> did not use this man-made rocky substrate as a spawning site. The current L 50 estimate of 451. 3 mm indicates that most individuals captured in this area are immature.

The fish assemblages inhabiting the reefs were characterized using underwater visual census (UVC) surveys. Despite some differences in fish species richness, diversity and abundance, both artificial reefs provide suitable feeding resources and shelter opportunities for the settlement of <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> juveniles. A total of 95 <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> juveniles, which were 3 and 4 years old, were released. No stress-related effects on fish swimming or behaviour were observed during the step by step transportation to the sea-bottom at 20 m depth. After release, several groupers showed very low reactivity; freezing and schooling were the most common behaviours. The sighting rate after one month of UVC surveys was 15. 7 % and 20 % at the two artificial reefs. No effect of fish size at release on grouper survival was observed. Some groupers were not recorded on the pyramid of release but elsewhere in the same artificial reef, which demonstrated their ability to move around the reef. The extent of dispersal of the released juveniles largely exceeded the area encompassed by the reefs, which was shown by recaptures of tagged groupers by local fishermen up to 13 km from the release site.

40|$|The Marine Reserve of Cerbère-Banyuls, {{like the}} whole of the Marine Protected Areas (MPA) from the Western Mediterranean, {{represents}} a refuge for <b>dusky</b> <b>grouper</b> populations. Since the installation of the moratorium prohibiting its fishing in 1993, the density of population increase regularly (7 in 1985, 50 in 1998 and 193 in 2001). For a few years, the interest of scientists has been growing (observations of reproductive behaviours, density surveys) (Culioli and Quignard, 1999; Garcia-Rubies et al., 1999; Harmelin et al., 2002; Lenfant et al., 2003).
