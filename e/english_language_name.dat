2500|$|Chișinău {{is known}} in Russian as Кишинёв (Kishinyov [...] ). It is written Kişinöv in the Latin Gagauz alphabet. It was also written as [...] "Chișineu" [...] in pre-20th-century Romanian and as [...] "Кишинэу" [...] in the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet. Historically, the <b>English</b> <b>language</b> <b>name</b> for the city, [...] "Kishinev", {{was based on the}} {{modified}} Russian one because it entered the English language via Russian at the time Chișinău was part of the Russian Empire (e.g. Kishinev pogrom).

2500|$|Several {{explanations}} {{exist for}} {{the origin of the}} name Raheny: one (from Ráth Éanna) is that it means the ringfort of Éanna, an early local chief, another (Ráth Eanaigh) is that the name derives from eanach, an old Irish word for marsh or swamp. Yet another (deriving from Rath Ain Abha) comes from [...] "Noble Fortress of the Sea". It is a matter unlikely ever to be fully resolved, as the origins of names, especially in areas within the Pale, were lost. Locally, most use Ráth Éanna while officialdom now tends towards Ráth Eanaigh. Until the mid-20th century, many local residents pronounced the <b>English</b> <b>language</b> <b>name</b> as something more like Rahenny, or Ratheny.|$|E

2500|$|The settlement's name {{is first}} {{referred}} to between 1135 and 1147 as [...] "Haya"; in 1299 {{the name of}} [...] "La Haye" [...] is used.

In 1215, a Welsh name, [...] "Gelli" [...] was recorded, and [...] "Gelli gandrell" [...] in 1614; the two names may have been used concurrently in 1625. The <b>English</b> <b>language</b> <b>name,</b> [...] "Hay", is derived from Old English [...] "hæg", possibly meaning a [...] "fenced area" [...] and a noun used in late Saxon and Norman times for an enclosure in a forest.
