40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{thesis is}} to make a step forward towards {{teaching}} computers to understand videos in a similar way as humans do. In this work we tackle the video classification and/or action recognition tasks. This thesis was completed in a period of transition, the research community moving from traditional approaches (such as hand-crafted descriptor extraction) to deep learning. Therefore, this thesis captures this transition period, however, unlike image classification, where the state-of-the-art results are dominated by deep learning approaches, for video classification the deep learning approaches are not so dominant. As a matter of fact, most of the current state-of-the-art results in video classification are based on a hybrid approach where the hand-crafted descriptors are combined with deep features to obtain the best performance. This is due to several factors, such as the fact that video is a more complex data as compared to an image, therefore, more difficult to model and also that the video datasets are not large enough to train deep models with effective results. The pipeline for video classification can be broken down into three main steps: <b>feature</b> <b>extraction,</b> <b>encoding</b> and classification. While for the classification part, the existing techniques are more mature, for <b>feature</b> <b>extraction</b> and <b>encoding</b> there is still a significant room for improvement. In addition to these main steps, the framework contains some pre/post processing techniques, such as feature dimensionality reduction, feature decorrelation (for instance using Principal Component Analysis - PCA) and normalization, which can influence considerably the performance of the pipeline. One of the bottlenecks of the video classification pipeline is represented by the <b>feature</b> <b>extraction</b> step, where most of the approaches are extremely computationally demanding, what makes them not suitable for real-time applications. In this thesis, we tackle this issue, propose different speed-ups to improve the computational cost and introduce a new descriptor that can capture motion information from a video without the need of computing optical flow (which is very expensive to compute). Another important component for video classification is represented by the feature encoding step, which builds the final video representation that serves as input to a classifier. During the PhD, we proposed several improvements over the standard <b>approaches</b> for feature <b>encoding.</b> We also propose a new feature <b>encoding</b> <b>approach</b> for deep feature encoding. To summarize, the main contributions of this thesis are as follows 3 : (1) We propose several speed-ups for descriptor extraction, providing a version for the standard video descriptors that can run in real-time. We also investigate the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency;  (2) We provide a new descriptor for extracting information from a video, which is very efficient to compute, being able to extract motion information without the need of extracting the optical flow; (3) We investigate different improvements over the standard <b>encoding</b> <b>approaches</b> for boosting the performance of the video classification pipeline.;(4) We propose a new feature <b>encoding</b> <b>approach</b> specifically designed for encoding local deep features, providing a more robust video representation. ...|$|R

In this paper, we analyze the importance of the pre-processing, and investigate the role of Gaussian Scale Space (GSS) theory as a pre-processing approach for the HEp- 2 cell classification task. We validate the GSS pre-processing under the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and the Bag-of-Words (BoW) frameworks.

We utilize DAISY features associated with key points within images as our local feature descriptor and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) corresponding to an entire image as a global descriptor. We make use of a bag-of-visual-words encoding and apply Mini- Batch K-Means algorithm to reduce the complexity of our feature encoding scheme. A 2 -level pooling procedure is used to combine DAISY and HOG features corresponding to each image.

A new approach called nonnegative tensor principal component analysis (NTPCA) with sparse constraint is proposed for speech <b>feature</b> <b>extraction.</b> We <b>encode</b> speech as a general higher-order tensor in order to extract discriminative features in spectrotemporal domain.

The useful information of each subspace in the higher-order tensor can be preserved. Alternating projection algorithm is used to obtain a stable solution.

Feature hierarchies are discovered considering that higher levels are formed by combining features from lower level. Such a level to level mapping defines our methodology as a deep learning process. The whole analysis can be divided in two major learning steps. The first one regards the Bayesian inference to extract objects and assign basic semantic to the image. The second step models the spatial interactions between the scene objects based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, performing a high level semantic annotation. We used a WorldView 2 image to exemplify the processing results. ...|$|R
30|$|Face {{recognition}} {{has attracted}} lots of attention, but current systems are yet far from human perception capabilities. A critical issue in face recognition is finding apt descriptors for modeling faces. Based on the descriptors, face recognition techniques can be broadly {{divided into three}} categories; holistic, feature-based, and hybrid face matching [17]. In holistic methods, the face is modeled by extracting a set of global features [18]. In this context, principal component analysis (PCA) [18], Mahalanobis cosine PCA (MahCos PCA) [19], linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [20], and 2 D PCA [21] have been explored. On the other hand, local feature-based descriptors have shown robustness to variance in pose and illumination [22]. Biswas et al. [23] described local facial landmarks with the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features. At each landmark, Gabor magnitude factors are extracted as the pose-robust feature. Fischer et al. [24] suggested that extracting landmarks for non-frontal faces had a degrading effect on the recognition results and proposed robust landmark extraction around nose tip and mouth corners. Guo et al. [25] proposed local binary patterns (LBP)-based <b>features</b> <b>extraction</b> for <b>encoding</b> facial landmarks.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTexture {{analysis}} {{is a major}} task {{in many areas of}} computer vision and pattern recognition, including biological imaging. Indeed, visual textures can be exploited to distinguish specific tissues or cells in a biological sample, to highlight chemical reactions between molecules, as well as to detect subcellular patterns that can be evidence of certain pathologies. This makes automated texture analysis fundamental in many applications of biomedicine, such as the accurate detection and grading of multiple types of cancer, the differential diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, or the study of physiological processes. Due to their specific characteristics and challenges, the design of texture analysis systems for biological images has attracted ever-growing attention in the last few years. In this paper, we perform a critical review of this important topic. First, we provide a general definition of texture analysis and discuss its role in the context of bioimaging, with examples of applications from the recent literature.

40|$|Biometrics {{is the use}} of {{physical}} characteristics like face, fingerprints, iris etc. of an individual for personal identification. Some of the challenging problems of face biometrics are face detection, face recognition, and face identification. These problems are being researched by the computer vision community for the last few decades. Considering the large population, the authentication process of an individual usually consumes a significant amount of time. One of the possible solutions is to divide the population into two halves based on gender. This will help to reduce the search space of authentication to almost half of the existing data and save substantial amount of time. Gender identification through face demands use of strong discriminative features and robust classifiers to separate the female and male faces without any ambiguity. In this thesis, an investigation has been made on gender classification through facial images using principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector machine (SVM). PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique, which is used to represent each image as a feature vector in a low dimensional subspace. SVM is a binary classifier for which PCA is the input in the form of features and predicts which of the two possible classes forms the output. Initially face region is extracted using a proposed skin colour segmentation approach. The face region is then subjected to PCA for <b>feature</b> <b>extraction,</b> which <b>encodes</b> second order statistics of data.

The new technique LDTrP is used to alleviate the face recognition rate under real-time challenges. Local derivative pattern (LDP) is a directional <b>feature</b> <b>extraction</b> method to <b>encode</b> directional pattern features based on local derivative variations. The nth -order LDP is proposed to encode the first (n- 1) th order local derivative direction variations. The LDP templates extract high-order local information by encoding various distinctive spatial relationships contained in a given local region. The local tetra pattern (LTrP) encodes {{the relationship between the}} reference pixel and its neighbours by using the first-order derivatives in vertical and horizontal directions. LTrP extracts values which are based on the distribution of edges which are coded using four directions. The LDTrP combines the higher order directional feature from both LDP and LTrP.
