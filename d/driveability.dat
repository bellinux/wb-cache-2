5|$|Fernando Alonso {{received}} a new, revised combustion engine for his car, his third of five allowed {{over the course}} of the season without receiving a grid penalty. Power unit supplier Honda stressed that they had not used any development tokens, a set of limited allowed changes to the units, but had instead only improved reliability. The team also equipped both cars with new batteries and electronics control units, set to improve the reliability of the cars as well. During the two-day testing session that took place after the previous Grand Prix at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Renault introduced an updated version of their power unit, which was used during the test to the satisfaction of driver Kevin Magnussen, who declared that the new unit was a step forward in both power and <b>driveability.</b> He urged the team to pull the introduction of the power unit forward to the Monaco race, instead of the following Grand Prix in Canada as originally planned. Renault chose to do so, however, they were only able to hand out one updated unit to both their works team and Red Bull, who used them under the name TAG Heuer. The two units were eventually given to Magnussen at Renault and Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull.|$|E
5|$|Renault had {{introduced}} turbocharged engines to Formula One in 1977. Brabham had tested a BMW four-cylinder M12 turbocharged engine {{in the summer}} of 1981. For the 1982 season the team designed a new car, the BT50, around the BMW engine which, like the Repco engine 16 years before, was based on a road car engine block, the BMW M10. Brabham continued to run the Cosworth-powered BT49D {{in the early part of}} the season while reliability and <b>driveability</b> issues with the BMW units were resolved. The relationship came close to ending, with the German manufacturer insisting that Brabham use their engine. The turbo car took its first win at the Canadian Grand Prix. In the Constructors' Championship, the team finished fifth, the drivers Riccardo Patrese, who scored the last win of the Brabham-Ford combination in the Monaco Grand Prix, 10th and World Champion Piquet a mere 11th in the Drivers' Championship. In the 1983 season, Piquet took the championship lead from Renault's Alain Prost at the last race of the year, the South African Grand Prix to become the first driver to win the Formula One Drivers' World Championship with a turbo-powered car. The team did not win the Constructors' Championship in either 1981 or 1983, despite Piquet's success. Riccardo Patrese was the only driver other than Piquet to win a race for Brabham in this period—the drivers in the second car contributed only a fraction of the team's points in each of these championship seasons. Patrese finished ninth in the Drivers' Championship with 13 points, dropping the team behind Ferrari and Renault to third in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{race for}} engine {{consumption}} and pollutant emission reduction requires engines development time reduction and optimisation. These problems bring {{engine test bed}} to become measuring systems more and more powerful and versatile. This test bed functionalities enrichment drives automation system evolutions. One {{of these is the}} integration of real time simulation execution in MORPHEE 2 which makes it possible to the engine control engineers to anticipate control strategies development. We will see in this document that real time simulation execution on a test bed from its automation system makes possible to accurately reproduce road load cycles like NEDC, FTP, … This constitutes an essential tool for engine transient calibration. In a second time we will see that the use of a vehicle refined model permits to reproduce on the test bed the transmission dynamics of this vehicle. This kind of simulation in an engine test bed allows evaluating <b>driveability’s</b> engine control strategies...|$|R

25|$|The first {{production}} turbocharger diesel {{passenger car}} was the Garrett-turbocharged Mercedes 300SD introduced in 1978. Today, most automotive diesels are turbocharged, since {{the use of}} turbocharging improved efficiency, <b>driveability</b> and performance of diesel engines, greatly increasing their popularity. The Audi R10 with a diesel engine even won the 24 hours race of Le Mans in 2006, 2007 and 2008.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{changes for}} 1975 {{included}} {{the addition of}} a catalytic converter and electronic ignition to not only meet the stringent 1975 and later emission requirements, but also extended routine maintenance intervals, and improved fuel economy and <b>driveability</b> which was a must in the era immediately following the 1973–74 energy crisis, but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems and mandated the use of unleaded gasoline as the converter could be rendered useless if contaminated with lead. Axle ratios were also numerically lowered to aid in improving gas mileage. The 455 four-barrel V8, now rated at , was retained as the standard and only available engine.|$|E
25|$|In early 1992, an all new Zetec 16-valve {{engine was}} {{launched}} bringing improved <b>driveability,</b> while also marking {{the return of}} the XR3i which was available with two versions of the 1.8L Zetec engine. The 150PS (110kW) RS2000 also appeared in the autumn of 1991 with a 16v version of the Sierra's I4 2.0L engine and also improved ride and handling meaning that this version of the Escort finally delivered on the road. Specifications, however, were also higher than before. The Escort was now available with items such as power steering, electric windows, central locking, electronic antilock brakes, and air conditioning. Some of these options were even available on some of the entry-level models.|$|E
25|$|For the 1991 model year, Mexico enacted new-vehicle {{emission}} regulations {{similar to}} those in the U.S. and Canada. The carbureted leaded-fuel engine was too dirty to comply with the new regulations, so a fully integrated engine management system with fuel injection was added to the Spirit. This was not the TBI system used in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Rather, the Mexican-market Spirits came with a more advanced MPFI setup. The MPFI 2.5 improved performance and <b>driveability,</b> as well as achieved cleaner emissions than its TBI counterpart, but was not used in the U.S., Canadian, or rest-of-world export markets except on turbocharged and FFV models. The Chrysler Spirit with MPFI 2.5L engine was sold in Mexico from 1991 through 1995, and was exported to Argentina and Brazil from 1993 through 1995. It was employed by the Argentine police in Buenos Aires.|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} {{change to the}} VC Commodore of March 1980 was the engine upgrading to [...] "XT5" [...] specification. Now painted blue and thus known as the Blue straight-sixes and Holden V8s, these replaced the Red units fitted to the VB and earlier cars. Changes included a new twelve-port cylinder head, re-designed combustion chambers, inlet and exhaust manifolds, a new two-barrel carburettor and a Bosch electronic ignition system for the inline sixes. Tweaks and changes to the V8s surrounded the implementation of electronic ignition, revised cylinder head and inlet manifold design and the fitment of a four-barrel carburettor on the 4.2-litre variant. These changes brought improved efficiency, increased outputs and aided <b>driveability.</b> In response to increasing oil prices, a four-cylinder variant was spawned in June 1980. Displacing 1.9-litres, this powerplant known as Starfire was effectively Holden's existing straight-six with two cylinders removed. The four's peak power output of [...] and torque rated at [...] meant its performance was compromised. Reports indicate that the need to push the engine hard to extract performance led to real-world fuel consumption similar to the straight-sixes.|$|E
500|$|With Spain {{being the}} first race in Western Europe, and a mid-season test {{coming up after the}} race, many teams {{introduced}} their first major car updates for the Grand Prix. Mercedes ran a new front wing with a [...] "more pointy" [...] nose during first free practice. Other changes were made to the engine cover and the rear wing. McLaren made more significant changes to their MP4-31, most notably on the front wing, which Sky Sports commentator Ted Kravitz called the [...] "most intricate front wing I've ever seen". Force India updated their VJM09 to improve airflow. According to the team, they were looking for improved <b>driveability</b> rather than faster lap times. Renault introduced a new chassis for Jolyon Palmer. More significantly, the French manufacturer debuted a new version of their power unit for both their works team and Red Bull at the two-day test following the race. All other teams except for Sauber also made changes to their cars, with the Swiss team continuing their financial struggles. They also announced that they would be forced to miss the mid-season test, being unable to field a development driver, with regulations demanding that two out of four test days be driven by young driver talents.|$|E

2500|$|The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, {{directed}} DOE {{to assess}} the feasibility of using intermediate ethanol blends in the existing vehicle fleet. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) evaluated the potential impacts on legacy vehicles and other engines. In a preliminary report released in October 2008, NREL described the effects of E10, E15 and E20 on tailpipe and evaporative emissions, catalyst and engine durability, vehicle <b>driveability,</b> engine operability, and vehicle and engine materials. This preliminary report found {{that none of the}} vehicles displayed a malfunction indicator light; no fuel filter plugging symptoms were observed; no cold start problems were observed at [...] and [...] under laboratory conditions; and all test vehicles exhibited a loss in fuel economy proportional to ethanol's lower energy density.

2500|$|The Corvair's {{combination}} {{of power and}} light weight introduced European manufacturers to an American market niche for small popular-priced sedans with more power and <b>driveability</b> than the contemporary European economy sedans and a more versatile and practical design than European sports cars.

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which {{mandates}} an increase in renewable fuels for the transport sector, the U.S. Department of Energy began assessments for the feasibility of using intermediate ethanol blends in the existing vehicle fleet as a way to allow higher consumption of ethanol fuel. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted tests to evaluate the potential impacts of intermediate ethanol blends on legacy vehicles and other engines. In a preliminary report released in October 2008, the NREL presented the results of the first evaluations of the effects of E10, E15 and E20 gasoline blends on tailpipe and evaporative emissions, catalyst and engine durability, vehicle <b>driveability,</b> engine operability, and vehicle and engine materials. This preliminary report found none of the vehicles displayed a malfunction indicator light as {{a result of}} the ethanol blend used; no fuel filter plugging symptoms were observed; no cold start problems were observed at [...] and [...] laboratory conditions; and as expected, computer technology available in newer model vehicles adapts to the higher octane causing lower emissions with greater horsepower and in some cases greater fuel economy.|$|E
2500|$|First {{revealed}} at the 2011 New York Auto Show, the Taurus {{received a}} refresh for the 2013 model year. The body features a new front fascia and slightly updated rear fascia with LED tail lamps, {{as well as}} all-new wheel options. The SHO model features revised styling elements, with unchanged power ratings from its EcoBoost V6. [...] Refinements {{have been made to}} the 3.5 EcoBoost V6. Power in the 3.5L V6, standard in non-SHO models, is up to 288hp and gets 19/29 MPG in FWD models, while getting 18/26MPG in AWD models. There is a new engine option for non-SHO models, a 2.0L EcoBoost Inline 4 developing 240hp and 270lb-ft of torque while delivering a best-in-class 22/32 miles per gallon. All models received upgrades to the steering and braking systems to improve <b>driveability.</b> For example, Torque Vectoring and curve control has been added as standard, and controls the cars ability to glide around corners at higher speeds. Updates to the Instrument dials have been added, they are now fully digital and clearer and more colourful. MyFord Touch will also be part of Taurus's Sync system.|$|E
2500|$|For 1970, the Valiant {{was carried}} over with detail changes, {{including}} a new black plastic grille sculptured differently from 1969's metal item. The central portion protruded flush with the forward edge of the hood, while {{the remainder of the}} grille was set back from the front plane. The two-door sedan was dropped, replaced by the new Duster coupe. For all except export Valiants, the base 170 engine was replaced by a new [...] version of the Slant-6. The 198 gave better performance than the 170, and was less costly to make, since it used the same cylinder block as the 225. The Valiant was virtually unchanged for 1971; small revisions included removal of the center grille emblem and a new kind of finish treatment on the grille surround. It now had a blacked-out look instead of the previous argent silver treatment. For the 1970 and 1971 models, exterior and interior trim were slightly revised, and there were engineering changes for better <b>driveability,</b> improved soundproofing and decreased emissions, the latter in compliance with regulations mandated by the newly created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implementing new devices such as an EGR valve and an activated charcoal evaporative emissions system. The 1971 Valiant eventually set sales records with 256,930 calendar year deliveries, so there was little motivation to change it for 1972. Only details of the taillights and grille were altered for the 1972 Valiants. New surface-mount sidemarker lamp-reflector units replaced the more costly previous flush-mount items.|$|E
