40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a systematic}} approach to underground ring design {{as well as}} a methodology for the continuous improvement of designs as conditions change. The methodology is applicable to designs for prefeasibility and <b>feasibility</b> <b>stages</b> as well as designs for currently producing mines. The proposed method still recognises the role of experiential guidelines but provides additional and novel empirical techniques to improve the first pass approximations such that they better suit the prevailing geotechnical conditions. The strength of this method is that the designer is able {{to assess the impact of}} the design in terms of the expected fragmentation and potential damage to the surrounding rock mass...|$|R
40|$|In {{large scale}} metalliferous mining, there is {{documented}} evidence that by providing an appropriate size distribution to {{crushing and grinding}} circuits, a measurable increased throughput and/or reduced power draw can be obtained. Tailoring blast designs to suit specific fragmentation requirements is becoming common place at both the prefeasibility and <b>feasibility</b> study <b>stages.</b> This is particularly the case when significant increases in ore production rates are being considered. Given the variability associated {{with many of the}} input parameters that are used to estimate fragmentation outcomes, a simple deterministic empirical approach is limited. This is the case at the <b>feasibility</b> <b>stages,</b> where there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the definition of blasting domains. Complex processes, such as explosive rock breakage and fragmentation, are suited to modelling techniques involving stochastic methods. As part of the feasibility study of a large open pit expansion project, there was a requirement to estimate fragmentation envelopes for a set of design parameters and rock mass conditions. This paper gives a description of a stochastic approach to blast fragmentation modelling and uses this expansion project to demonstrate its application. In this particular case study, there was a need to estimate the expected run of mine fragmentation associated with blasting in the deeper and more competent ore domains. Results from several simulations using the proposed modelling approach have shown the importance of including the measured variability of input parameters such intact rock properties and degree of fracturing at the <b>feasibility</b> <b>stages.</b> Modelling results also identified significant differences in ore fragmentation envelopes if current designs were to be applied in the more competent domains as the pit expands. From this analysis, a number of blast design options have been evaluated and recommendations made in order to achieve future ore handling and processing targets. © 2010 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Maney on behalf of the Institute and The AusIM...|$|R

It is shown that these simulation results reproduce analytical economic efficiency conditions, which gives specific insight to the sensitivity of PSH to design choices and wind statistics. It is shown that system marginal cost and total cost can be reduced through operations policies.

40|$|Housing {{development}} involves myriads of interrelated processes {{which include}} series {{of decision making}} functions. Decision making is a multi-level process that influences {{the success of a}} proposed housing project. A housing project may fail or suffer some of serious setback if the decision making function is flawed or has been made on an ad hoc basis or based on unreliable, imperfect or hazy information. Decisions have to be made empirically using scientific methods and tools based on accurate and reliable data and information in today’s business environment. The main aim {{of this study is to}} develop a process model for investment decision making in housing development at the strategic phase of the project that is, initiation and <b>feasibility</b> <b>stages</b> in Malaysia. The objectives of this study are three pronged – one, to identify the decision making practiced among Malaysian housing developers, two to identify the methods and tools used by them to make decisions and three to determine the types of information required for making decisions. This research involved the development of theoretical model by synthesising the models developed by a number of prominent authors and researchers on the subject of decision making. It also uses the Delphi method to collect and analyse the appropriate data and information. For a start of the study, 50 numbers of developers were selected as samples. But only 34 responded to the second stage of the information gathering process. At the final stage of the study only 12 developers or participants were left for the final process of the study. The data was analysed using the descriptive statistical techniques. This study affirms that Malaysian developers tend to make their investment decisions based on simple interpolation of historical data and using simple statistical or mathematical techniques in deciding the investment. This study suggested that the Malaysian housing developers skipped several important decision making functions. These shortcomings were mainly due to time and financial constraints and the lack of statistical or mathematical expertise among the professionals and managers in the organisations. The findings allowed a critical review of the theoretical model which followed by the development of a revised process model of decision making for housing development at strategic phase i. e. at the initial and <b>feasibility</b> <b>stages...</b>|$|R
