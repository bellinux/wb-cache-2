5|$|A {{total of}} thirty-three {{in-flight}} anomalies were eventually reported. As {{well as the}} issues above, STS-8's more minor problems ranged from faulty thermostats to an unusually high amount of dust <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{comfort of}} <b>the</b> {{operators}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> of vehicles is getting {{an increasingly important}} issue. At first glance, <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> of professional machines (earth-moving equipment, busses, harvesting equipment) might look modern and highly comfortable. However, this {{does not imply that}} <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> actually are comfortable, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long term. How to improve comfort in combination with efficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> of vehicles is the topic of this symposium...|$|R
50|$|Energy {{savings from}} {{innovative}} technology was introduced significantly reducing greenhouse gas production. Energy saving LED lighting is used throughout <b>the</b> ship. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> an average energy saving of 25% is achieved. A simple system automatically switches all energy using devices off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins,</b> such as <b>the</b> main light, bathroom light, socket-outlets and hair dryers whenever <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> is empty. A Cabin Monitoring System regulates air conditioning in all cabins allowing guests {{to set their}} own cabin temperature. Centralized air-conditioning control is replaced with local cabin control significantly reducing energy waste. The control extends to when the balcony door isopen or <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> card is not <b>in</b> place <b>the</b> cooling system is switched off.|$|R
50|$|Admiral Nakhimov lacked proper ventilation, {{which was}} the reason all 90 windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> were open during the accident. The {{bulkheads}} that would have prevented the ship from sinking were removed during the conversion.|$|R
5|$|After the fire, the Apollo {{program was}} {{grounded}} for review and redesign. The Command Module {{was found to}} be extremely hazardous and, in some instances, carelessly assembled (for example, a misplaced socket wrench was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin).</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Dallas, {{it rained}} on days that were {{supposed}} to be sunny, while other days of production lacked rain when {{they were supposed to be}} rainy. Goodwin added that the scene of Snow and Charming releasing the birds was freezing because of the heavy rain. Their scene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> took place on the first day of the episode's production. Her near-death scene involved a real cliff, though the height was exaggerated later using CGI and a green screen; a stunt double stood in for some of the shots.|$|E
5|$|As {{the week}} goes on, the people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> {{are running out}} of food, while Satoru is {{subjected}} to multiple attempts on his life by an unknown assailant. As days pass, Satoru notices that he can see the same lunar phase at SPHIA and at the cabin and that both areas are surrounded by a body of water. It is revealed that the Yuni <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> is from the year 2012, while the Yuni at SPHIA is from 2011. Satoru finds a locked room in the basement of SPHIA, where he encounters a man named Enomoto, monitoring the facility through cameras. Enomoto tells Satoru that it is not consciousnesses that are transferred but the entire area within a 110-metre radius that is transported across time and space, with their consciousnesses left behind. Satoru attempts to destroy the facility, and Enomoto tries to stop him. A set of transfers occur, and Enomoto is killed by someone using Satoru's body.|$|E
50|$|During that period, former BUA air hostesses {{still wearing}} that airline's blue uniforms were working {{alongside}} their tartan-clad, former Caledonian counterparts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> of all passenger flights. Eventually, the Caledonian tartan uniforms became BCal's standard for female staff.|$|R
50|$|His father, {{although}} a deist, intended {{that his son}} enter the clergy, but Ouseley {{spent much of his}} childhood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> of peasant neighbours. He was tutored with his cousins Gore and William, and all three had notable careers.|$|R

5|$|Both {{versions}} use {{a common}} airframe, with three Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 engines, their range and endurance using only a two engine cruise option, is , or six hours. However, range {{can be extended}} further when the five underfloor fuel tanks are supplemented with auxiliary fuel tanks fitted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> Armament depends on mission, but includes anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, three door-mounted machine guns, multi-purpose rocket, cannon pods, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles. At least 14 Merlin HM2s will be assigned to the carrier.|$|E
5|$|CV-22B : U.S. Air Force variant for the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).

The fuel capacity is increased by 588 gallons (2,230 L) with two inboard wing tanks; three auxiliary tanks (200 or 430 gal) can also be added <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> The CV-22 replaced the MH-53 Pave Low.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Burns are {{beset by}} cabin fever {{and attempt to}} kill each other. After a vicious struggle, Burns ignites the cabin's propane tank, {{launching}} the building out of the snow and propelling it toward the horrified onlookers. Once {{it comes to a}} halt, Burns reminds everyone of the contest, and all the workers hurry inside. Lenny is the last person <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> and is fired. Burns is informed that the completion time of the competition has set a new record, and decides that no one will be fired after all.|$|E

5|$|Japan Airlines {{operates}} {{a mixture of}} narrow-body and wide-body aircraft. The airline provides economy class service on all routes, business class (J) service with larger seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> front on most major domestic routes, premium economy on some international routes, business class on most long-haul and some short-haul international routes, and first class on some long-haul and domestic routes.|$|E
5|$|Prior to impact, {{passengers}} did {{not assume}} the brace position. When the airplane came to rest, {{many of the}} passengers in the forward portion of the cabin were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped through a hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> floor near the flight attendant’s position. Several passengers reported assisting others out of the cabin and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed up the wall and over an embankment, and slid down a steep hill to the runway. Others were assisted {{out of the water}} by ground personnel.|$|E
5|$|The salvage {{party were}} {{suspicious}} of Keseberg's story, {{and found a}} pot full of human flesh <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> along with George Donner's pistols, jewelry, and $250 in gold. They threatened to lynch Keseberg, who confessed that he had cached $273 of the Donners' money at Tamsen's suggestion, {{so that it could}} one day benefit her children. On April 29, 1847, Keseberg was the last member of the Donner Party to arrive at Sutter's Fort.|$|E

50|$|Flying Colours {{had several}} {{operational}} bases outside of its Manchester Airport headquarters, including London Gatwick Airport and Glasgow International Airport. The airline quickly established a positive reputation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> charter industry, with {{a fleet of}} newly built aircraft and new features; Flying Colours were <b>the</b> first airline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK to have LCD TV screens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> of their 757s.|$|R
5|$|Alan and Alice {{arrive at}} a cabin on {{an island in the}} middle of Cauldron Lake. As they unpack, Alan finds that Alice {{arranged}} this trip to try to break his writer's block, scheduling him to see a Bright Falls psychologist named Dr. Hartman and leaving a typewriter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> for him. Alan is infuriated and takes a short walk, but runs back when Alice cries for help. He returns to the cabin just as Alice is being dragged into the lake's waters by a mysterious force. Alan dives into the water after her, blacking out as he submerges.|$|E
5|$|At 5:24pm Cooper was {{informed}} that his demands had been met, and at 5:39pm the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Cooper instructed Scott to taxi the jet to an isolated, brightly lit section of the tarmac and close each window shade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> to deter police snipers. Northwest Orient's Seattle operations manager, Al Lee, approached the aircraft in street clothes (to avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer) and delivered the cash-filled knapsack and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs. Once the delivery was completed, Cooper permitted all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was fully booked, a passenger {{was allowed to}} sit in the jump seat in the cockpit. The passenger had no connection with the airline, but was granted permission by the captain via acquaintance in the airline. Several of the other passengers were employees in Widerøe and shouldaccording to the airline's rulesinstead have been seated there. From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> but the jump seat passenger continued {{to sit in the}} cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his attention and concentration away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E

5|$|Before Christmas' escape attempt, Hightower {{delivers}} Lena's child <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> where Brown and Christmas {{had been}} staying before the murder, and Byron arranges for Brown/Burch {{to come and}} see her. Brown deserts Lena once again, but Byron follows him and challenges him to a fight. Brown beats the braver, smaller Bunch, then skilfully hops a moving train and disappears. At the end of the story, an anonymous man is talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to Tennessee, recounting that the woman had a child and the man was not the father. This was Lena and Byron, who were conducting a half-hearted search for Brown, and they are eventually dropped off in Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|In May 1997, {{two groups}} of six female sailors were posted to Collins and Farncomb to test the {{feasibility}} of mixed-sex submarine companies. Following the trial's success, eleven female sailors and one female officer commenced submarine training in 1998. Officers and senior enlisted submariners slept in mixed accommodation, but junior enlisted submariners could only be deployed in groups of six: one of the enlisted cabins was set aside, and all six bunks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> had to be filled. Mixed accommodation for all female submariners was approved in June 2011, {{in order to increase}} posting opportunities and help make up shortfalls in submarine complements.|$|E

Watts reveals that a vaccine has been developed by the Group, but only in sufficient quantities for its members; Watts and Black have already been inoculated without having realized at the time. Black tells Watts to locate Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), another Group member, as he hopes to keep them safe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> until the crisis resolves.|$|E
