6000|$|... "Well now, père Briot," [...] said Maurice cheerily, [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> are the {{proprietor}} of this abode of bliss, what about supper?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seemed to}} me {{somewhat}} unusual," [...] Corney replied; [...] "but {{it has always been}} my privilege to dine with the company I am asked to entertain. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> had arranged a little treat for the servants." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He pressed me very hard," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "and I am afraid I made some admissions--well, there were necessary--which, {{to say the}} least of it, were compromising. There was only one way out of it decently for me, and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> don't mind?" ...|$|R
60|$|JAWBONES [He {{takes the}} tray from her.] Not your fault. Tell 'im <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> from <b>you</b> by brute force.|$|R
6000|$|... "I envy you, Reggie. Fancy {{being able}} to make a {{statement}} like that openly and without fear. Then <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> know the Doughnut family?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I be," [...] {{replied the}} girl, [...] "an' from your face <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> have little {{love for a}} De Montfort," [...] she added, smiling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] {{retorted}} Nigel, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> will row her on {{the course}} I direct you, otherwise your chance of payment is but a poor one." ...|$|E
60|$|SCHUTZMACHER. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> myself, <b>you</b> know, when I feel run down. Good-bye. You dont mind my calling, do you? Just {{to congratulate}} you.|$|R
60|$|Jul. My Rodorick shall know, He owes his Julia to you; thank him, love; In faith <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> ill <b>you</b> are so slow.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't mean, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> when <b>you</b> {{talk about}} 'those women,' that Madame Blumenthal is not embalmed, for duration, {{in a certain}} {{infusion}} of respectability?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' I answered, 'next to marrying {{one of its}} women, {{killing one}} of its men makes for pretty close {{intimacy}} with any country. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> killed a British citizen.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In truth I {{might have}} guessed it, Vicomte. Your visit flatters me, for, of course, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> <b>you</b> are come {{to pay me}} your respects," [...] I said ironically. [...] "A glass of wine, Vicomte?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you, Sir Edmund Acour, for <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> are he. Now I {{shall never}} forget you again, for though a man may shift his armour he cannot change his countenance"--a saying at which de Noyon {{coloured}} {{a little and}} looked down uneasily.|$|E
60|$|MRS. G. Yes, but if <b>I</b> hadn't <b>taken</b> <b>it,</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't {{have said}} a word. I think this Harriet Herriott--it's like a {{name in a}} book--is an interfering old Thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose he}} is. That place {{there by the}} road-side is all his own, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> Have <b>you</b> been at him with some of your rusty, rickety tables and chairs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{had this}} mask made at Venice,' he began, in evident embarrassment. 'My darling Barbara--my dearest wife--do you think you--will mind when <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> off? <b>You</b> will not dislike me--will you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's no news, Peter," [...] {{interrupted}} Kitty. [...] "I {{know all}} about Mourner and his wife. They are very nice people, though I must say Mrs. Dove {{is one of the}} poorest housekeepers I know of. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> never have seen her nest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wentworth was {{the very}} name! Mr Wentworth {{was the very}} man. He had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back, {{for two or three}} years. Came there about the year ---5, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> {{remember}} him, I am sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{must you}} tell me? Your coming 'near' doesn't concern me, and <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> don't suppose I'm {{watching}} or sounding you. Mrs. Brook will have come terribly near," [...] Vanderbank continued {{as if to}} make the matter free; [...] "but she won't have done it either. She'll have been distinctly tempted--!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give me this--!" [...] cried Madame, and a flash {{went over}} her face. Then she {{changed into a}} sort of wheedling. [...] "No--no. <b>I</b> shan't <b>take</b> <b>it!</b> <b>I</b> shan't <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> don't want to give away such a thing." ...|$|R

60|$|JOHN. <b>It's</b> noble of <b>you,</b> but I don't deserve <b>it,</b> and <b>I</b> can't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> from <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} enough, Almayer," [...] said the lieutenant, as he lighted a cigar. [...] "Is it not time {{to deliver to}} us your prisoner? <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> have that Dain Maroola stowed away safely somewhere. Still we had better get that {{business}} over, and then we shall have more drink. Come! don't {{look at me like}} this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Treachery!" [...] exclaimed the old man. [...] "We were no {{more than}} that this morning. It is indeed {{fortunate}} that you found us. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> are from Fort Henry, and will guide us there? I am an old friend of Colonel Zane's. He will appreciate any kindness you may show us. Of course you know him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|HUNT. Hold hard, George. Speaking as one lady's man to another, turn about's fair play. You've {{had your}} confab, and now I'm {{going to have}} mine. (Not that I've done with you; you stand by and wait.) Ladies first, George, ladies first; that's the size of it. (To JEAN, aside.) Now, Mrs. Watt, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> ain't a natural fool? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon! A {{thousand}} pardons! I had no idea! I beg you {{to forgive}} this indiscretion! <b>I</b> may <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> resign pretensions then?

6000|$|... "I must be relieved," [...] {{continued}} Atherton, [...] "of {{the sense}} I've had {{that it was}} indelicate in me to keep it, while I felt as I've grown to feel--towards you." [...] He stopped: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> back, <b>you</b> must come with it!" [...] he suddenly concluded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I may perhaps learn it, but I {{am afraid}} I shall {{never do it}} by rote. I have the best will in the world about it, but my genius doesn't lie in that direction. As a loafer I shall never be original, as <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> that <b>you</b> are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear," [...] said Holmes, [...] "that if {{the matter}} is beyond {{humanity}} it is certainly beyond me. Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations before we fall back upon such a theory as this. As to yourself, Mr. Tregennis, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> were divided in some way from your family, since they lived together and you had rooms apart?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{the first}} time," [...] {{returned}} Jack gravely, [...] "that I ever was insulted {{by having a}} whole potato brought to me. I didn't know it was possible before. Perhaps {{in this part of}} the country the vegetables are poor. I'm a stranger to this section. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> are too. But because I am a stranger I don't see why I should be imposed upon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I would submit," [...] {{returned}} Francesco, [...] "that I {{have heard}} no question. I heard a wild statement, extravagant and mad, the accusation of one demented, {{a charge of}} which no proofs can be forthcoming, else <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> had not withheld them. I ask you, sirs, and you, Madonna," [...] he continued, turning to the others, [...] "has his Highness said anything to which an answer can by any means be necessary?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But still men, as <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> And do <b>you</b> not {{see that}} Love is, like all spiritual things, only to be {{understood}} by experience--by loving?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Were it necessary," [...] said he. [...] "For {{truth is}} seldom so {{intrusive}} as to need avoiding. But we are straying. There was a score upon {{which you were}} inquisitive, you said; from which <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> that <b>you</b> sought knowledge at my hands. Pray seek it; I am a well, of knowledge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I quit,' he said pleasantly. 'The {{episode is}} closed. I {{am a man}} of peace, and <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> that <b>you</b> would not keep on lying quietly on that bed while I went {{into the other room}} and {{abstracted}} our young friend? Unless you have changed your mind again, would a fifty-fifty offer tempt you?' ...|$|R
