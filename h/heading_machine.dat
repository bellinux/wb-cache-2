40|$|The mining {{organ of}} the {{longwall}} <b>heading</b> <b>machine</b> KGS- 320 with radial tools {{was the subject of}} the analysis. Cooperation of single knife with the mined solid rock was estimated in order to determine values of the forces and moments that might occur in the mining process and to estimate the energy consumption of the mining process. Analogous determination of forces and moments values as well as energy consumption of the mining process for the whole mining organ with regard to all the knives installed. Following the thorough analysis of the solid rock mining process with the longwall tumble <b>heading</b> <b>machine</b> mining head the PC computer program simulating such organ’s mode of action has been developed. This program presents the simulation of the mining process in the part regarding direct contact of the cutting tool (knife) with the rock mass.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} optimal control of pull manufacturing systems. We study a fluid model of a flow shop, with buffer holding costs non-decreasing along the route. The system is subject to a constant exogenous demand, thus incurring additional shortfall/inventory costs. The objective {{is to determine the}} optimal control for the production rate at each machine in the system. We exhibit a decomposition of the flow shop into "sections" of contiguous machines, where, in each section, the <b>head</b> <b>machine</b> is the bottleneck for the downstream system. We exhibit the form of an optimal control, and show that it is characterized by a set of "deferral times," one for each <b>head</b> <b>machine.</b> Machines which are upstream of a <b>head</b> <b>machine</b> simply adopt a "just [...] in [...] time" production policy.

Based on the statistical examination of <b>heading</b> <b>machine</b> reliability, the authors have worked out a range of parts and assembly units with limited failure-free lifetime and subject to operational control. There have been developed techniques for expeditious diagnostics of executive unit drive technical condition based on values of engine current with measured data presented in frequency domain, diagnostics being performed without interrupting the technological process of underground development. There have been found identification frequencies in current range corresponding to defects and failures of separate parts of the electro-mechanical drive of the executive unit.

40|$|Ventilation {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{presented}} problems during the driving of dog headings. During driving such heading has only one connection with air stream routes, which significantly make difficult the process of its ventilation. In a case of its driving in coal in the methane seam, this heading is endangered also to methane emission. In such case process of its ventilation is much more difficult. In the paper there are presented results of numerical analysis of ventila-tion of blind dog headings using air-duct forcing the air into its mine face.

40|$|Development of a {{high-speed}} and high-yield water-powered fish evisceration system (FES) to efficiently preprocess small fish and bycatch for producing minced fish meat is described. The {{concept of the}} system is propelling fish in a stream of water through an arrangement of cutting blades and brushes. Eviscerated fish are separated from the viscera and water stream in a dual screen rotary sieve. The FES processed head off fish, weighing 170 – 500 g, at the rate of 300 fish/min when used with an automatic <b>heading</b> <b>machine.</b> Yields of mince produced from walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma; and Pacific whiting, Merluccius productus; processed by the FES ranged between 43 % and 58 %. The maximum yield of minced muscle from fish weighing over 250 g was 52 %, and the yield of 250 g was 58 %. Test results indicated that surimi made from minced meat recovered from fish processed with the FES was comparable in quality to commercial grade surimi from conventional systems. Redesigned for commercial operation in the Faeroe Islands (Denmark), the system effectively processed North Atlantic blue whiting, Micromesistius poutassou, with an average weight of 110 g at a constant rate of 500 – 600 fish/min, producing deboned mince feeding a surimi processing line at a rate of 2. 0 t/h. Yields of mince ranged from 55 % to 63 % from round fish.

40|$|When the London Metal Exchange {{figures and}} graphs are {{analyzed}} {{it is clearly}} shown that the steel prices are in a hike. And also China and India are trying to acquire Sri Lankan market. Hence, the steel manufacturers have been facing many difficulties with the price competition and the rising costs. Therefore, waste elimination and productivity improvement methods needed to be introduced to the Hexagonal Nut and Bolt manufacturing Industries in Sri Lanka. This report contains a successful case study carried out at Company X Ltd which represents this industry and shows how to apply these methods to other factories for their future protection. This also contains a literature survey carried out regarding waste elimination, productivity improvement and Nut and Bolts and their manufacturing. Interviews were carried out at Company X Ltd and found out the major problems to the organization which relevant to the industry. Then wastes and losses were found out {{with the support of}} Cleaner production Techniques. After that made a suitable questionnaire and got the details from the other companies. Then found the most important problems to be solved and solutions given with the technical knowledge {{and with the help of}} external expertise.

50|$|Since the 1950s, guitar {{performance}} techniques evolved, {{and aggressive}} usage of a vibrato bar ("tremolo") became widespread. However, the original <b>machine</b> <b>heads</b> couldn't withstand {{the rigors of}} constant string tension changing, and strings could go out of tune after using a vibrato mechanism several times. Several manufacturers, including Grover and Floyd Rose, introduced a new design, commonly named locking <b>machine</b> <b>heads</b> nowadays: a <b>machine</b> <b>head</b> with additional mechanism to lock it in place and stabilize tuning while playing and using a vibrato bar. However, such <b>machine</b> <b>heads</b> reached limited success, mostly because of their price: , locking ones are about 50% more expensive than original. Many break strings when tension is increased while the mechanism is locked and later unlocked, which frequently happens in music stores.|$|R
