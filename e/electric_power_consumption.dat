However, the generation efficiency of the pure spin currents is extremely low at room temperature, giving rise to a serious obstacle for device applications. Here, we demonstrate the generation of giant pure spin currents at room temperature in lateral spin valve devices with a highly ordered Heusler-compound Co$_ 2 $FeSi spin injector. The generation efficiency of the pure spin currents for the Co$_ 2 $FeSi spin injectors reaches approximately one hundred times as large as that for NiFe ones, indicating that Heusler-compound spin injectors enable us to materialize a high-performance lateral spin device.

40|$|Abstract − The paper {{presents}} a stochastic sampling method {{applied to a}} measurement of the mean value of the product of two arbitrary signals.

When measuring electric energy, accuracy better than 0. 01 % is achieved. The measurement uncertainty of the stochastic sampling method is analysed and the influence of dominant factors is quantitatively derived. Special consideration is given to the influence of dispersion of A/D converter outputs and the waveforms of the two input signals as contributors to the measurement uncertainty. As the exact shapes of the waveforms are not known in advance, {{it is not possible to}} determine their influence on the measurement uncertainty. To overcome this issue, a novel additional hardware is designed, which provides the estimate of measurement uncertainty during the experiment- simultaneously with the measurement result, its measurement uncertainty is available on-line...|$|R
