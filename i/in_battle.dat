5|$|Battles use a turn-based battle system, with {{a limited}} number of player units and enemy units each taking turns and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are won by the player {{defeating}} key enemy units such as commanders and other boss characters. <b>In</b> <b>battle,</b> the game transitions to a dedicated battle arena, where the battle plays out in real-time. Each action yields experience points (EXP), and when the character earns 100 EXP, they level up, their health increases, and their class-specified statistics are randomly raised. During missions, towns and secret vendors can be visited, where new items such as healing potions, weapons and armor can be purchased. Weapons and armor are specific to different characters, and each weapon has a limited lifespan before breaking when it reaches its limit. Currency is limited to certain scripted or player-driven events, or wagering on arena battles. If a character falls <b>in</b> <b>battle,</b> they are subjected to permanent death, removing them from subsequent missions {{and the rest of the}} storyline. The game ends if Marth falls <b>in</b> <b>battle.</b>|$|E

5|$|By {{utilizing}} {{a place called}} the Bloom Palace, players can perform two kinds of Unity ritual; Carnage Unity and Radiant Unity, to strengthen their party. Carnage Unity uses Performa, which are obtained <b>in</b> <b>battle</b> by defeating monsters and performing crowd-pleasing techniques, to create new weapons for each character. Each weapon carries four skills which a party member can inherit by earning experience <b>in</b> <b>battle.</b> These include Command Skills, which allow the party member to perform various attacks and spells, Passive Skills, which offer passive stat boosts and effects, and Session Skills, which are used to chain together Session Attacks. Each character can only hold six skills of each type, but if they inherit a skill they already have, it is stacked on top and becomes more effective. Radiant Unity uses Performa that is born from within each party member, either through plot progression and clearing side stories; or by increasing a character's Star Ranking <b>in</b> <b>battle</b> to grant them Radiant Skills, permanent skills separate from those inherited from weapons. These include passive effects, such as increased health or extended Session Attacks, as well as skills that can be performed <b>in</b> <b>battle.</b>|$|E

When the player or their human partner dies <b>in</b> <b>battle,</b> they are granted a Guardian Spirit, who revives them at the last save point and teaches them new skills and alter the player's stats. The Guardian's specialties affect how stats are changed: a higher power ranking will raise the player's strength, but lower magic will decrease their Magic Point meter. The Guardian changes each time the player dies.|$|E

5|$|Each {{character}} can use {{one type of}} weapon, in addition to magical spells.

Upon collecting enough experience points <b>in</b> <b>battle,</b> each {{character can}} increase in level to gain improved character statistics such as strength and evasion. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands—a circular menu which hovers over the controlled party member. The game is paused whenever the Ring Command menu is activated. Within the Ring, the player has nine slots for storing items; additional items can be placed into item storage, which is inaccessible in combat.|$|E

If a unit is defeated <b>in</b> <b>battle,</b> {{they are subject to}} permanent death, being removed from all future encounters and the overall storyline with a few exceptions for story-related characters.
