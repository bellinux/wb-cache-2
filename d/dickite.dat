50|$|<b>Dickite</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in Almwch, Island of Anglesey, Wales, UK. <b>Dickite</b> is scattered across Wales forming occurrences in vein assemblages {{and as a}} rock-forming mineral. This area and others where <b>dickite</b> can be found all share similar characteristics. Pockets in phylloid algal limestones, in interstices of biocalcarenites and sandstone are a suitable environment for <b>dickite.</b> Very low pressure and high temperatures are the ideal environment {{for the formation of}} <b>dickite.</b> The more perfected crystallization of <b>dickite</b> occurs in porous algal limestones {{in the form of a}} white powder. The more disordered dickites can be found in less porous rocks.|$|E
50|$|Another {{occurrence}} spot, {{as indicated}} by Brindley and Porter of the American Mineralogists journal, is the Northerly dickite-bearing zone in Jamaica. The <b>dickite</b> in this zone ranges from indurate breccias containing cream to pinkish and purplish fragments composed largely of <b>dickite</b> with subordinate anatase set in a matrix of greenish <b>dickite,</b> to discrete veins and surface coatings of white, cream and translucent <b>dickite.</b> It appears that <b>dickite</b> in the northerly zone were formed by hot ascending waters from an uncertain origin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dickite</b> {{occurs with}} other clays and {{requires}} x-ray diffraction for its positive identification. <b>Dickite</b> {{is an important}} alteration indicator in hydrothermal systems as well as occurring in soils and shales.|$|E
40|$|D/H and O• 8 /O•ø ratios were measured, after •emoval of any absorbed or {{interlayer}} water, in 34 kaolinites, 3 <b>dickites,</b> 4 halloysites and 16 montmorillonites {{from various}} argillic assemblages in 12 North and South American porphyry copper deposits, and in 7 other hydrothermal mineral deposits. The porphyry copper deposit at Santa Rita, New Mexico was sampled in detail. Supergene clays {{can be distinguished}} from hypogene clays; supergene kaolinires are generally richer in O TM and depleted in D relative to hypogene clays from a given deposit. All montmorillonites and <b>dickites</b> studied appear to be hypogene but kaolinites are common in both supergene and hypogene alteration. The hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of both hypogene and supergene clays from Tertiary porphyry copper deposits show a geographic correlation with isotopic variations displayed by present-day meteoric surface waters. The Tertiary and Mesozoic clays appear to largely preserve their original O• 8 /O• 6 and D/H ratios. However, strongly acidic supergene solutions apparently can alter the isotopic compositions of pre-existing hypogene kao...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The effect ofpH, {{time and}} {{temperature}} onthe interaction ofzinc with acid and base saturated <b>dickites</b> has been investigated. Increase in pH resulted {{in an increase in}} adsorption ofzinc in the higher concentration range. The adsorption increased rapidly and then slowly with increase in the time of interaction. The variation of rate constants and the half times of reaction suggested an exchange process controlled by film and possibly particle diffusion and thereafter fixation processes. The inferences found support from the nature of adsorption isotherms. Temperature affected adsorption with exothermic nteractions. The activation energy of adsorption of zinc on Na-dickite was 14. 0 kcal mole-~...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dickite</b> {{and other}} kaolin {{minerals}} are commonly developed by weathering of feldspars and muscovite. [...] Through its evolution, <b>dickite,</b> a phyllosilicate mineral, maintains the aluminium and silicon elements influencing {{the formation of}} hexagonal sheets common to clay minerals.|$|E
50|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted using a pseudo-hexagonal crystal of <b>dickite</b> {{to determine the}} unit cell information and the layers that exist within <b>dickite.</b> It was found that there are six layers within the kaolin layer within <b>dickite.</b> This is evidenced in the following findings. There is an oxygen atom from the all oxygen layer {{that lies at the}} center. The atoms of the O layer, the Si layer and the O, (OH) layer are situated for the ideal kaolin layer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hexagonal}} {{network of}} Si-O tetrahedra {{along with the}} superimposed layer of Al-O, OH octahedra make up the kaolin layer found in <b>dickite.</b> <b>Dickite</b> is composed of regular sequences of one, two and six kaolin layers. Analysis of the <b>dickite</b> structure reveals the space group to be C4s-Cc. The a and c axis both lie on the glide plane of symmetry. [...] Dickite’s structure {{is made up of}} a shared layer of corner-sharing tetrahedra filled by a plane of oxygens and hydroxyls along with a sheet of edge-sharing octahedra with every third site left empty.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} mistaken {{identity}} arises when comparing <b>dickite</b> to other kaolin minerals {{due to the fact}} that kaolinite, <b>dickite,</b> and nacrite all have the same formula but different atomic structures. The only way to determine the true identity of the mineral is through powdered x-ray diffraction and optical means.|$|E
5000|$|Kaolin {{group which}} {{includes}} the minerals kaolinite, <b>dickite,</b> halloysite, and nacrite (polymorphs of Al2Si2O5(OH)4).|$|E
50|$|<b>Dickite</b> (Al2Si2O5(OH)4) is a {{phyllosilicate}} {{clay mineral}} {{named after the}} metallurgical chemist Allan Brugh Dick, who first described it. It is chemically composed of 20.90% aluminium, 21.76% silicon, 1.56% hydrogen and 55.78% oxygen. It has the same composition as kaolinite, nacrite, and halloysite, but with a different crystal structure (polymorph). <b>Dickite</b> sometimes contains impurities such as titanium, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium and potassium.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dickite</b> {{is found}} {{all over the}} world in {{locations}} such as Ouray, Colorado, US; San Juanito, Chihuahua, Mexico in a silicified zone among the rhyolite area; and in St. George, Utah, US, where the mineral is thought to be associated with volcanic rock. [...] An extensive study was done on <b>dickite</b> pertaining to its location in Pennsylvanian limestones of southeastern Kansas.|$|E
50|$|Al2Si2O5(OH)4 is the {{chemical}} formula of <b>dickite.</b> The calculated percent abundances {{are very close}} {{when compared to other}} kaolin minerals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dickite</b> {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of a white, brown earthy color and is often found embedded in many other minerals such as quartz.|$|E
50|$|According to Richard J. Schroeder and John B. Hayes, <b>dickite</b> {{distribution}} {{is dependent on}} the following: the stratigraphic alternation of limestones and shales, westward regional dip, thick deposits of highly porous algal limestones, and igneous intrusions. It was found that groundwaters substantially heated along with magmatic waters which made its way up-dip and through the intrusions in the conduit-like algal mounds which allowed the <b>dickite</b> to be deposited in this area and it might be conclusive to say that this trend follows elsewhere in other locations around the world.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dickite</b> has perfect {{cleavage}} in the (001) direction. Its color {{varies from}} blue, gray, white to colorless. It usually has a dull clay-like texture. Its hardness on the Mohs scale is 1.5-2, basically between talc and gypsum. This {{is attributed to}} its loose chemical bonds. It is held with hydrogen bonds, which are otherwise weak. It leaves a white streak {{and it has a}} pearly luster. It has a density of 2.6. <b>Dickite</b> is biaxial, its birefringence is between 0.0050-0.0090, its surface relief is low and it has no dispersion. The plane of the optical axis is normal to the plane of symmetry and inclined 160, rear to the normal to (0,0,1).|$|E
50|$|Dickite’s type {{location}} is in Pant-y-Gaseg, Amlwch, Isle of Anglesey, Wales, UK, {{where it was}} first described in 1888. <b>Dickite</b> appears in locations with similar qualities and is well spread among countries like China, Jamaica, France, Germany, UK, US, Italy, Belgium and Canada.|$|E
50|$|Plášilite is {{associated}} with other sulfate minerals: natrozippeite, johannite, blödite, brochantite, chalcanthite, gypsum, hexahydrite, manganoblödite, and tamarugite. Non-sulfate coexisting minerals include atacamite, calcite, <b>dickite</b> and gerhardtite. Plášilite is secondary in origin, being the product of weathering of the primary uranium mineral, uraninite.|$|E
50|$|Advanced argillic {{alteration}} occurs under lower pH {{and higher}} temperature conditions. Kaolinite and <b>dickite</b> occur at lower temperatures whereas pyrophyllite and andalusite occur under high temperature conditions (T > 300°C). Quartz deposition is common. Alunite, topaz, zunyite, tourmaline, enargite and tennantite may also occur. Greisen alteration is similar.|$|E
5000|$|Thiry [...] has {{mentioned}} that the actual geological setting of kaolin depositions cannot be explained with only transportation and sedimentation cycles. He also stated that the mineralogical sequences cannot be interpreted without local geochemical transformations. Kulbicki has proved the existence of vermicular minerals (kaolinite and <b>dickite)</b> incompatible with normal sedimentary sequences.|$|E
50|$|The {{hexagonal}} {{structure and the}} stacking of the atoms influence the physical properties in many ways including the color, hardness, cleavage, density, and luster. Another important factor in influencing physical properties of minerals {{is the presence of}} bonding between atoms. Within <b>dickite</b> there exists dominant O-H bonding, a type of strong ionic bonding.|$|E
50|$|Carlfriesite {{is often}} found in {{cavities}} in hydrothermal gold-tellurium deposits. It is found associated with cerussite, chlorargyrite, argentian gold, cesbronite, calcite, <b>dickite,</b> baryte, bornite, galena, hessite and tlapallite. It was first identified in the Bambollita (La Oriental), Moctezuma, Municipio de Moctezuma, Sonora, Mexico. It {{is also found in}} another nearby mine, namely the Moctezuma mine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dickite</b> has a monoclinic {{crystal system}} and its crystal class is domatic (m). This crystal system {{contains}} two non-equal axes (a and b) that are perpendicular {{to each other and}} a third axis (c) that is inclined with respect to the an axis. The a and c axes lie in a plane. <b>Dickite</b> involves an interlayer bonding with at least 3 identifiable bonds: an ionic type interaction due to net unbalanced charges on the layers, Van der Waals forces between layers and hydrogen bonds between oxygen atoms on the surface of one layer and hydroxyl groups on the opposing surface. A hydrogen bond, as the term is used here, involves a long range interaction between hydrogen of a hydroxyl group coordinated to a cation and an oxygen atom coordinated to another cation. The reaction is predominantly electrostatic; hence an ionic bonding model is appropriate. Its axial ratio is a=0.576, b=1, c=1.6135.|$|E
50|$|Halloysite is an {{aluminosilicate}} {{clay mineral}} with the empirical formula Al2Si2O5(OH)4. Its main constituents are aluminium (20.90%), silicon (21.76%) and hydrogen (1.56%). Halloysite typically forms by hydrothermal alteration of alumino-silicate minerals. It can occur intermixed with <b>dickite,</b> kaolinite, montmorillonite and other clay minerals. X-ray diffraction studies {{are required for}} positive identification. It was first described in 1826 and named after the Belgian geologist Omalius d'Halloy.|$|E
50|$|X-ray {{experiments}} were performed by C. J. Ksanda and Tom F. W. Barth {{and it was}} concluded that <b>dickite</b> is composed of tiny layers of cations and anions which are parallel to the a-b plane stacked {{on top of one another}} which they found to be exactly as Gruner had described. It was also concluded that the two dimensional arrangement of some of the atoms are not as Gruner described.|$|E
50|$|The ash flows are K-rich andesitic-dacitic {{and contain}} {{amphibole}} and biotite. Andesitic lava flows are also found, while the terminal lava domes are dacitic-rhyolitic in composition. One rhyolite lava flow is found at Azufre. Andesites contain quartz and dacites-rhyodacites contain sanidine megacrysts. In hydrothermally altered areals alunite, barite, <b>dickite,</b> kaolinite, pyrite and quartz are also found. Propylite-like degradation {{as well as}} veins contained inside of rock that has been heavily degraded to argillite.|$|E
50|$|The atomic {{structure}} of <b>dickite,</b> being {{very similar to}} that of kaolinite and other kaolin type minerals, has a very specific arrangement that differs slightly enough to set its physical appearance and other physical properties apart from that of its family members kaolinite and nacrite. In a comparison of the family of minerals through experiments examined by Ross and Kerr the similarities between them are clearly evident and can, depending on the samples, be indistinguishable by optical means.|$|E
5000|$|The primary iron-bearing {{minerals}} are {{the iron}} carbonate siderite (FeCO3) and berthierine (formerly known as chamosite, (Fe22+ Al(Si,Al) O5(OH)4). Ancillary components include calcite (as MgCO3 and MnCO3), pyrite (FeS2), collophanite (Ca3P2O8 H2O [...] ), silica (Si), clay minerals and derivatives such as octahedrite (brookite) (TiO2), and <b>dickite</b> (Al2Si2O5(OH)4). The seams are often oolitic, {{especially in the}} north of the district, but vary in constitution across the ore-field. The ooids (on average) comprise ~33% siderite, ~33% berthierine, and a similar proportion of ancillary minerals and demonstrate deformation whilst the sediment was still plastic.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] <b>Dickite</b> and {{kaolinite}} are polymorphs of AI 4 (Si 401 o) (OH) 8. <b>Dickite</b> traditionally isregarded as hydrothermal, {{based on}} field and laboratory evidence. <b>Dickite</b> and kaolinite occur in cavities in phylloid algal imestones, in interstices of biocalcarenites and sandstones, and along joints, fractures, and stylolites, in Pennsylvanian rocks exposed throughout 9600 {{square miles of}} southeastern Kansas. The stratigraphic interval of approximately 1100 ft extends from the Fort Scott Limestone (Desmoine-sian) through the Lecompton Limestone (Virgilian). The best crystallized ickites are found in porous algal imestones as pockets of glistening white powder composed of well developed pseudohexagonal plates up to 40 /x across. Very well crystallized kaolinites occur similarly, except he crystals are much smaller. Less well crystallized ickites and b-axis disordered kaolinites occur in less porous rocks. Variations in crystal size and morphological development are genetically significant. Dickite-kaolinite distribution is related to: (1) stratigraphic alternation of limestones and im-pervious hales; (2) gentle, westward regional dip; (3) thick, mound-like buildups of highly porous algal limestones, miles in length and width; (4) igneous intrusions (early Tertiary?) in Woodson and Wilson counties. <b>Dickite</b> is confined to an elliptical area 125 miles long northeast-southwest, x ending 60 miles eastward from the intrusions. <b>Dickite</b> is associated preferentially with porous algal mounds. Kaolinite occurs in less porous rocks within the <b>dickite</b> area, and also is abundant well beyond. Heated groundwaters, possibly mixed with magmatic waters, moved readily up-dip and along strike outward from the intrusions through the conduit-like algal mounds; <b>dickite</b> was deposited from such solutions. Where water movement was restricted or where water had travelled tens of miles from the intrusions, water temperature f ll below the limit for <b>dickite</b> crystallization, and kaolinite precipitated instead. Kansas <b>dickite,</b> unlike most other eported ickites, formed in rocks that were neither deeply buried nor extensively altered hydrothermally...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Geochemical {{analysis}} for Fe {{was made on}} {{a representative sample of}} dickite-rich hydrothermal clay from Jedlina Zdroj. The mineralogy of the sample is comparatively simple, <b>dickite</b> being the principal component (> 95 wt. % of the total sample), with lesser amounts of goethite and barite. Geochemical fractionation and inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry indicated that most of the Fe (ca. 97 wt. % of the total metal) resides in the <b>dickite.</b> Electron spin resonance showed that some of the Fe in the <b>dickite</b> structure {{is in the form of}} Fe 3 +. A substantial proportion of these ions (as well as Fe) in the <b>dickite</b> matrix were probably contained in the original hydrothermal dickite-forming solution. From the geochemistry of Fe 3 +, it was deduced that the oxidation potential (Eh) and pH of the solution during the formation of <b>dickite</b> from the Jedlina Zdroj were approximately 0. 45 – 0. 95 V (highly oxygenated) and 0 – 4 (highly acidic), respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between the shapes of kaolinite and <b>dickite</b> differential lhermal curves are described. The slope ratios of <b>dickite</b> are distinctly greater than those of kaolinite of equivalent particle size for the endo-thermic peak at about 550 ~ and the same effect is observed for the exothermic peak at about 980 ~ especially in diluted samples. The packing density of <b>dickite</b> does not differ markedly from that of kaolinite and the curve obtained for weight vs. area of the endothermic peak is in agreement with this. The <b>dickite</b> samples, however, give slightly lower areas than those of kaolinite, an effect hat {{is dependent on the}} shape of the particles. The exothermic peak is shown to be influenced con-siderably in shape and size by thermal gradients...|$|E
40|$|Ahstraet [...] Nacrite, <b>dickite</b> and {{intermediate}} dickite-nacfite phases {{have been identified}} from the upper Paleozoic sequences of the Mal~iguide Complex (Betic Cordilleras, Spain). Nacrite developed as euhedral, pseudohexagonal or elongated crystals within sandstones and thin, irregular veins. <b>Dickite</b> developed preferently within extensive zones of fractures as very irregular, compact packets. Intermediate phases occurred in the sandstones and veins similar to the nacfite, or accompanying dick 2 te. The mineral assem-blage of the sandstones includes quartz-muscovite-kaolinite-type minerals, with or without albite, carbon-ates, chlorite and mixed-layers containing chlorite. The metamorphic conditions in which these minerals formed belong to anchizone, as can be deduced from the IC values. <b>Dickite,</b> nacrite {{and intermediate}} phases were studied by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis and micros-copy. The results for <b>dickite</b> indicate a well-ordered mineral and agree {{with most of the}} published ata. Conversely, IR spectra nd DTA curves of uacrite show some differences in relation to the available data for this mineral. Based on the comparison with <b>dickite</b> and nacrite data, intermediate phases can be interpreted either as disordered varieties or as mixed-layered dickite/nacrite...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Three {{samples of}} bluish chromium-bearing <b>dickite</b> and chromium-bearing {{kaolinite}} were examined by X-ray powder diffraction, chemical analysis, electron microprobe, optical, and infrared techniques {{to determine whether}} chromium {{is part of the}} mineral structure or present in an impurity phase. Two of the samples tudied contain a single dominant chromium-bearing phase (either <b>dickite</b> or kaolinite); the third contains equal proportions of both minerals. The optical absorption and infrared spectra re consistent with the presence of octahedrally coordinated chromium. The range of Cra+-AI ~+ substitution is rather limited: up to 0. 06 atoms per unit cell. The electron microprobe study revealed the presence of very rare, minute grains of chromite, as well as a uniform distribution of chromium in <b>dickite</b> and kaolinite, indicating that chromium occupies octahedral sites in the structure of these minerals.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the radiation-induced defects in {{fracture}} filling clay-minerals from the El Berrocal U-deposit (Spain), which is considered as a natural analogue of a high-level nuclear waste repository in granitic rock. Mineralogical analyses shows the widespread occurrence of <b>dickite</b> as a secondary alteration phase, together with various amounts of associated smectite, illite, carbonates and primary minerals. Native radiation-induced defects accumulated in the <b>dickite</b> and smectite structure are identified by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). They are distinguished by their spectroscopic parameters and thermal stability, and can be reproduced by artificial irradiation. The <b>dickite</b> defects {{are similar to the}} well-characterized features in natural kaolinites, including defects stable at the scale of geological periods. <b>Dickite</b> can thus be used as a natural dosimeter to trace radioelement transfer in relevant geological systems. The concentration of stable defects in dickites is related to the present dose-rates, assuming dosimetry parameters from model kaolinites and several scenarii for <b>dickite</b> ages inferred from major tectonic events. This study demonstrates that the El Berrocal dickites correspond to different generations having recorded retention or migration events of radioelements within the whole system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The OH-stretching {{region in}} curve-fitted micro-Raman, photoacoustic and {{transmission}} IR spectra of St. Claire <b>dickite</b> was investigated. Polarized Raman spectra recorded from the (001) and (010) {{faces of the}} <b>dickite</b> crystal displayed six prominent OH bands. The relative intensities depend strongly on both {{the orientation of the}} crystallographic axes and the direction of the electric vector of the laser beam. Four out-of-plane vibrations, AA, Az, CA and Ca, at [...] 3710, 3706, 3654 and 3643 cm J respectively, predominate when the electric vector is perpendicular to the <b>dickite</b> plates. Two in-plane vibrations, Dz and D A at 3627 and 3623 cm-~, intensify when the electric vector is parallel to the plane. The relationship between band intensity and crystal orientation was interpreted in terms of longitudinal optic (LO) and transverse optic (TO) crystal vibration modes.
