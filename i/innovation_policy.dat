5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that human {{resources}} are a pillar of any research and <b>innovation</b> <b>policy,</b> the Medium Term Plan 2011–2015 did not discuss any explicit policy for promoting postgraduate studies {{in science and engineering}}. The scarcity of new PhDs in science and engineering fields from the University of Zimbabwe in 2013 was symptomatic of this omission.|$|E
5|$|Innovation {{policies}} have been excessively focused on the supply of technologies, neglecting the demand side (the user). There have been several initiatives by the European Commission to support and research design and design management in recent years. However, a European-wide policy to support design has never been planned, due to the inconsistencies and differences in design policies in each nation. Nonetheless, there are currently plans to include design in the EU <b>innovation</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E

40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{perception}} of innovation as a multi actor, multi level strategic game, this paper addresses the role of strategic intelligence, more in particular of TA, in systemic <b>innovation</b> <b>policies.</b> First the history of TA in the US and Europe over the last 4 decades are described {{and its role in}} <b>innovation</b> <b>policies</b> discussed. Hereafter the role and (possible) impact of strategic intelligence and systemic <b>innovation</b> <b>policies</b> is analysed. Two recent cases of Constructive TA are used to illustrate how this role is operationalised. The paper is concluded with conclusions on how strategic intelligence may further reinforce systemic <b>innovation</b> <b>policies.</b> Special attention is paid to the role of strategic intelligence in empowering users and other non traditional actors in innovation processes. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a summary {{and a brief}} appraisal of <b>innovation</b> <b>policies</b> in Brazil and China, following {{the changes in the}} legal system, in governmental programs and also in the institutional environment of <b>innovation</b> <b>policies</b> in both countries, mainly during the last decade. Both countries have similar policy measures and fiscal incentives that are considered to be among the most generous in the world. However, whilst China has managed to structurally change its Science, Technology and Innovation figures in the last two decades, Brazil {{has not been able to}} transform its 'scientific boom' into innovation. This may be partly explained by institutional differences regarding their innovation support structure: China has <b>innovation</b> <b>policies</b> that have a clearly defined focus and a bureaucratic structure which stimulates institutional innovations and the dissemination of best practices. In turn, <b>innovation</b> <b>policies</b> are diffuse and biased towards the academic sector in Brazil...|$|R

The second part summarizes important findings from German evaluation research: <b>innovation</b> <b>policies</b> tend to focus on large enterprises; efforts to stimulate private investment in research and development produce relatively little effect; and grants for specific research and development projects and increased research and development personnel are effective in stimulating action that would not have otherwise occurred.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} a general {{vision of the}} main issues on <b>innovation</b> <b>policies</b> in East European new member countries and candidate countries. It is based both on the data taken from the main European benchmarking studies on innovation perspectives, and on the direct experience of advisors who worked in East European pilot countries (Slovenia). This paper focuses on the problems arising from the encounter of European <b>innovation</b> <b>policies</b> and local culture and governance structures in these countries. This situation shows that the innovation phase, following transition, generally calls for a further tuning of EU <b>innovation</b> <b>policies</b> in these countries. In order to develop effective market spin-offs from <b>innovation</b> <b>policies,</b> greater attention {{should be given to}} triggering bottom-up policies at regional level by reducing decision-making centralism; lowering the risk of imitative and trend-oriented policies; supporting the birth of new enterprises besides backing the existing ones; developing mostly software rather than hardware policy components. All of this should fit in a general framework recognising the central role of individuals – and thus of culture, starting from entrepreneurial culture – within a knowledge-based innovation process. The recent Slovenian action plan for innovation is included {{as an example of a}} strategic plan able to spotlight these main issues...|$|R

30|$|Fostering <b>policy</b> <b>innovation</b> at {{the local}} level and {{diffusing}} successful practices to higher administrative level, even nationwide, are pervasive features of policy making in postreform China (Heilmann 2007, 2008; Zhu 2012, 2013). 1 Local <b>policy</b> <b>innovations</b> in China have drawn enormous academic interest.

30|$|<b>Innovation</b> <b>policies</b> are {{considered}} the long-term strategy to overcome the present systemic crisis. But this crisis is questioning such policies, their presuppositions and institutional arrangements. This questioning includes the Triple Helix theory {{and its impact on}} research and <b>innovation</b> <b>policies.</b> The goal is to examine how this theory can respond to theoretical and practical challenges, how the theory needs to evolve in order to fit the present context. The criticism focuses on growing worldwide standardization of research and <b>innovation</b> <b>policies</b> and their long-term impact on innovation. Restoring and increasing research diversity is urgent for sustained innovation. One solution is to add ‘society’ as a fourth helix. The problem is to clarify what ‘society’ stands for in this context. The paper studies three different institutional arrangements, France, Germany, and Japan, because these three cases can learn from each other and contribute to progress in the Helix theory itself. Potential reforms are summarized in some policy recommendations.|$|R
