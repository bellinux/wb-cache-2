Design - Volunteers who were overweight and had elevated plasma lipids were enrolled in a 6 -month dietary intervention trial at Adelaide (n= 50) and Perth (n= 44). A variety of Omega 3 <b>enriched</b> <b>foods</b> and matching control foods including bread, milk, spread, eggs, biscuits, cereals, soups, pancake mix, muffin mix, salad dressing, dips, snacks and chocolates were prepared for the trial by Goodman Fielder Ltd.

40|$|To {{examine the}} effects of 17 -wk {{physical}} exercise and <b>enriched</b> <b>foods</b> on cellular immune response (CIR) in frail elderly. METHODS: A total of 112 independently living, frail elderly men and women (mean age 79. 2 /- 5. 9) received: twice weekly comprehensive, moderate intensity, progressive group exercise (group A, N = 26); daily <b>enriched</b> <b>foods</b> (group B, N = 31); both (group C, N = 29); or neither (group D, N = 26). Exercises focused on skills training. <b>Foods</b> were <b>enriched</b> with micronutrients with a high prevalence of deficiency in older people (at 25 - 100 % the RDA). A social program and identical regular foods were offered as a control. CIR was measured by delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test response (DTH) against seven recall antigens expressed as the total number of positive responses and sum of diameters of all positive responses. RESULTS: No independent or interactive effect of <b>enriched</b> <b>foods</b> was observed. Therefore, exercise (groups A C) was compared with no exercise (groups B D). Nonexercising subjects showed an average decline of 0. 5 responses compared with an unchanged responsiveness among exercising subjects (difference = 0. 5, 95 % CI: 0. 04 - 0. 89, P = 0. 03 adjusted for baseline DTH, activity level, and micronutrient status). Nonexercising subjects had a larger decline in the sum of diameters of all positive responses than exercising subjects but the difference did not reach significance (adjusted difference = 2. 1 mm, 95 % CI:- 1. 0 - 4. 8).

40|$|Summary: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{prevalence}} of eating difficulties and malnutrition among persons in hospitals and among those living in special accommodations (long-term care). In addition the aim was to, within special accommodations, explore how different interventions could affect the precision in nutritional care and the occurrence of underweight/overweight, both from a short as well as a long-term perspective. Methods: Nurse students collected the data during their clinical education at hospitals and in special accommodations in years 2005, 2007, and 2009. Staff and clinical teachers participated also with the data collection. By participating in the study the students got training in how to provide information to the staff and patients/residents, collect data, and compile results and to give feed-back about the findings to the department. Underweight and overweight was assessed from BMI. Undernutrition risk was assessed based on: unintentional weight loss, low BMI, and/or the occurrence of eating difficulties. Assessments were also made regarding what nutritional care the care recipients got. In the special accommodations interventions with study circles (two municipalities), nutritional care policy (one municipality) and in four municipalities no specific intervention was made. The prevalence of overweight was 39 - 42 %. Results: In hospitals the prevalence of moderate/high undernutrition risk was 27 - 28 % and if also those with little risk were included the prevalence was 60 - 63 %. Between 4 - 7 % were provided with protein- and energy <b>enriched</b> <b>food,</b> 25 - 30 % got oral supplements or similar and 12 - 13 % needed eating assistance. In special accommodations the prevalence of moderate/high undernutrition risk was 27 - 35 % and if also those with little risk were included the prevalence was 65 - 70 %. The prevalence og overweight was 30 - 33 %. Between 4 - 14 % were provided with protein- and energy <b>enriched</b> <b>food,</b> 11 - 19 % got oral supplements or similar and 47 - 50 % needed eating assistance.  Within the special accommodations it was shown that the intervention with study circles lead to improvements in the precision of nutritional care (protein- and energy <b>enriched</b> <b>food</b> and/or oral supplements) and a lower prevalence of underweight was seen, at least shortly after that the intervention was finished. In the same way the anchoring and implementation of the nutritional care policy resulted in improvement in the nutritional care. These improvements remained however also a long time after the implementation.   Most of the students (81 %) experienced that they did get better understanding for research by participating in the study, more than half (53 %) thought that their interest in assessment of eating and nutrition increased and 67 % that their knowledge about eating and nutrition increased. Conclusion: Many patients and residents are at risk of becoming undernourished. This demands that adequate measures are taken to prevent or treat undernutrition. Such measures can be protein- and energy-dense food and oral supplements or similar. In the special accommodations can study circles for the staff lead to improvements in the nutritional care for more residents in a short-term perspective and by implementing a nutritional care policy also long-term positive effects are likely to be achieved. Combining study circles with implementation of nutritional care policies can be the focus for new studies. In general the nursing students experience it as positive to participate in a real research project. ...|$|E
30|$|Rice is {{the most}} well known cereal and staple food which serves as major {{carbohydrate}} {{for more than half}} of the world population. Half of the world’s population is suffering from one or more vitamin and/or mineral deficiency (World Food Program 2015).

The developed countries are managing deficiency by adopting fortification programs, but same programs are not affordable to poor countries. Therefore, an alternative and less expensive strategy is to modify the nutritional quality of the major cereals consumed by the people. To improve the nutritional value of rice, research programs should be reoriented to develop high yielding cultivars with nutrient dense cultivars either by selective breeding or through genetic modification (Gearing 2015).

Some conventional foods were exchanged with <b>foods</b> <b>enriched</b> in fibre, calcium, iodine, vitamins A, D, E or n- 3 fatty acids. Setting Nutritional composition of basal and modified diets was derived and compared to the Spanish recommended intakes (RI). Results The basal diet covered the recommendations for fibre and calcium with mean intake of 28 g and 1241 mg, respectively. The current intake of salt, if iodized, or bread elaborated with this salt, allowed reaching the daily intake of iodine every day, with a mean supply of 216 μg/d and 278 μg/d, respectively. The deficient supply of vitamin E in the basal diet (mean = 8 mg/d) was covered by including enriched margarine and dairy products (mean = 15 mg/d). The low n- 3 fatty acids intake in the basal diet (1 · 1 g/d) increased up to 1 · 9 g/d after the use of enriched margarine, butter and biscuits and soya drink instead of milk. Conclusions In order to improve the accomplishment of the RI iodine, vitamin E and n- 3 fatty acids, interesting strategies dealing with the incorporation of <b>enriched</b> <b>foods</b> in the diet were successfully initiated...|$|R
