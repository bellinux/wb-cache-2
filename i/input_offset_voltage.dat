50|$|In the {{specifications}} of operational amplifiers, the PSRR {{is defined as}} the ratio of the change in supply voltage to the equivalent (differential) output voltage it produces, often expressed in decibels. An ideal op-amp would have infinite PSRR. The output voltage will depend on the feedback circuit, as is the case of regular <b>input</b> <b>offset</b> <b>voltages.</b> But testing is not confined to DC (zero frequency); often an operational amplifier will also have its PSRR given at various frequencies (in which case the ratio is one of RMS amplitudes of sinewaves present at a power supply compared with the output, with gain taken into account). Unwanted oscillation, including motorboating, can occur when an amplifying stage is too sensitive to signals fed via the power supply from a later power amplifier stage.|$|R
25|$|A {{thermocouple}} produces small signals, often microvolts in magnitude. Precise {{measurements of}} this signal require an amplifier with low <b>input</b> <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> and with care taken to avoid thermal emfs from self-heating within the voltmeter itself. If the thermocouple wire {{has a high}} resistance for some reason (poor contact at junctions, or very thin wires used for fast thermal response), the measuring instrument should have high input impedance to prevent an offset in the measured voltage. A useful feature in thermocouple instrumentation will simultaneously measure resistance and detect faulty connections in the wiring or at thermocouple junctions.|$|E
25|$|Input current: Due to biasing {{requirements}} or leakage, a {{small amount}} of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes for bipolar op-amps, tens of picoamperes (pA) for JFET input stages, and only a few pA for MOSFET input stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large unmodeled voltage drops. If the input currents are matched, and the impedance looking out of both inputs are matched, then the voltages produced at each input will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the difference between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect. It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a small offset voltage (different from the <b>input</b> <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> below) can be produced. This offset voltage can create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.|$|E

40|$|Fully {{differential}} amplifiers yield large differential {{gains and}} also high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR), provided {{they do not}} include any unmatched grounded component. In biopotential measurements, however, the admissible gain of amplification stages located before dc suppression is usually limited by electrode <b>offset</b> <b>voltage,</b> which can saturate amplifier outputs. The standard solution is to first convert the differential input voltage to a single-ended voltage and then implement any other required functions, such as dc suppression and dc level restoring. This approach, however, yields a limited CMRR and {{may result in a}} relatively large equivalent input noise. This paper describes a novel fully differential biopotential amplifier based on a fully differential dc-suppression circuit that does not rely on any matched passive components, yet provides large CMRR and fast recovery from dc level transients. The proposed solution is particularly convenient for low supply voltage systems.

2500|$|To {{the extent}} that the input bias {{currents}} do not match, there will be an effective <b>input</b> <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> present, which can lead to problems in circuit performance. Many commercial op amp offerings provide a method for tuning the operational amplifier to balance the inputs (e.g., [...] "offset null" [...] or [...] "balance" [...] pins that can interact with an external voltage source attached to a potentiometer). Alternatively, a tunable external voltage can be added to one of the inputs in order to balance out the offset effect. In cases where a design calls for one input to be short-circuited to ground, that short circuit can be replaced with a variable resistance that can be tuned to mitigate the offset problem.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{comparators}} and voltage {{references are}} among the most widely used fundamental building blocks for various types of circuits and systems, such as data converters, PLLs, switching regulators, memories, and CPUs. As thermal constraints quickly emerged as a dominant performance limiter, on-die temperature sensors will be critical to the reliable operation of future integrated circuits. This dissertation investigates characteristics of these three enabling circuits and design strategies for improving their performances. One of the most critical specifications of a dynamic comparator is its <b>input</b> referred <b>offset</b> <b>voltage,</b> which is pivotal to achieving overall system performance requirements of many mixed-signal circuits and systems. Unlike <b>offset</b> <b>voltages</b> in other circuits such as amplifiers, the <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> in a dynamic comparator is extremely challenging to analyze and predict analytically due to its dependence on transient response and due to internal positive feedback and time-varying operating points in the comparator. In this work, a novel balanced method is proposed to facilitate the evaluation of time-varying operating points of transistors in a dynamic comparator. Two types of offsets are studied in the model: (1) static <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> caused by mismatches in mobilities, transistor sizes, and threshold voltages, and (2) dynamic <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> caused by mismatches in parasitic capacitors or loading capacitors. To validate the proposed method, dynamic comparators in two prevalent topologies are implemented in 0. 25 μm and 40 nm CMOS technologies.
