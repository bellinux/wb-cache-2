50|$|The {{interior}} of the school was damaged during the North West Rebellion of 1885. Later that year on November 27 the students {{were taken from the}} school to witness the <b>hanging</b> of 8 <b>leaders</b> of the Cree uprising in Fort Battleford. Most of the students were from the Ahtahkakoop, Mistawasis and John Smith reserves.|$|R
50|$|During the Battle of Cape St Vincent, Bates {{was praised}} by Royals and the Royal Navy's Admiralty in his calm and {{composed}} {{response to the}} near capsizing of the Captain, and the later suppression of the Spithead and Nore mutinies. His suppression of the mutinies has been viewed as detailed and expertly executed resulting in the <b>hanging</b> of the <b>leader</b> of Nore and the conclusion of Spithead, which saw to a royal pardon for all crews, reassignment {{of some of the}} unpopular officers, a pay raise and abolition of the purser's pound.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} rebellions in the 1700s {{attributed}} to Coromantees.According to Long, the first rebellion occurred in 1690 between {{three or four}} hundred enslaved people in Clarendon Parish who, after killing a white owner, seized firearms and provisions and killed an overseer at the neighbouring plantation. A militia was formed and eventually suppressed the rebellion, <b>hanging</b> the <b>leader.</b> Several of the rebels fled and joined the Maroons.Long also describes the incident where a slave-owner was overpowered {{by a group of}} Coromantees who after killing him, cut off his head, and turned his skull into a drinking bowl. However, the [...] "drinking of blood" [...] is more than likely anti-African propaganda, though Coromantee and especially Asante war tactics were known to utilize fear in their opponents.In 1739, the leader of the Coromantee Maroons named Cudjoe (Kojo) signed a treaty with the British ensuring the Maroons would be left alone provided they did not help other slave rebellions.|$|R
25|$|When {{news of the}} atrocity reached Arundell's {{forces a}} new attack took place early on 6 August. Lord Grey was later to comment {{that he had never}} seen the like, nor taken part in such a murderous fray. As he had led the charge against the Scots in the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, this was a telling statement. Some 2000 died at the battle of Clyst Heath. A group of Devon men went north up the valley of the Exe, where they were {{overtaken}} by Sir Gawen Carew, who left the corpses of their <b>leaders</b> <b>hanging</b> on gibbets from Dunster to Bath.|$|R
5|$|Booth was {{strongly}} {{opposed to the}} abolitionists who sought to end slavery in the U.S. He attended the <b>hanging</b> of abolitionist <b>leader</b> John Brown on December 2, 1859, who was executed for leading a raid on the Federal armory at Harpers Ferry in present-day West Virginia. Booth had been rehearsing at the Richmond Theatre when he abruptly decided to join the Richmond Grays, a volunteer militia of 1,500men traveling to Charles Town for Brown's hanging, to guard against an attempt by abolitionists to rescue Brown from the gallows by force. When Brown was hanged without incident, Booth stood in uniform near the scaffold and afterwards expressed great satisfaction with Brown's fate, although he admired the condemned man's bravery in facing death stoically.|$|R
2500|$|A large fresco for {{the customs}} house of Florence, {{that is now}} lost, {{depicted}} the execution by <b>hanging</b> of the <b>leaders</b> of the Pazzi conspiracy of 1478 [...] against the Medici. [...] It was a Florentine custom to humiliate traitors in this way. [...] This was Botticelli's first major fresco commission (apart from the abortive Pisa excursion), and {{may have led to}} his summons to Rome. [...] The figure of Francesco Salviati, Archbishop of Pisa was removed in 1479, after protests from the Pope, and the rest were destroyed after the expulsion of the Medici and return of the Pazzi family in 1494. [...] Another lost work was a tondo of the Madonna ordered by a Florentine banker in Rome to present to Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga; this perhaps spread awareness of his work to Rome. [...] A fresco in the Palazzo Vecchio, headquarters of the Florentine state, was lost in the next century when Vasari remodelled the building.|$|R
