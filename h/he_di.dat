40|$|In {{the late}} 1960 s, the dreaded "problem of transworld {{identity}} " arose within the metaphysics of modality. So, we read David Kaplan in 1967 : I'll even let you peep through my Jules Verne-o-scope [into another possible world G].

The task of locating individuals in other worlds is the problem of determining transworld heir lines. I will flatly assert that this problem is the central problem of philosophical interest in the development of intensional logic. The clearest statements of the "problem " came from those who thought that, ultimately, there was no problem (or at least that it certainly was soluble).

40|$|Durante degli Alighieri, known {{throughout}} the world as simply Dante, was a fourteenth century Italian poet, philosopher, literary theorist, and politician. He {{is best known for}} his epic Commedia, which was later dubbed The Divine Comedy. Commedia is generally considered the greatest Italian literary work and a masterpiece of world literature. 1 Due to the turbulent political atmosphere of his time and place, Dante spent over a third of his life living in exile. This paper will explore the details of Dante's exile and the influence that it had upon his work. Dante was born in Florence around 1265 to an aristocratic family of moderate wealth and status. Dante's father was a notary, and Dante was the only child of his father's first marriage. Dante's mother died when he was about thirteen years old. His father then remarried and his second wife bore another son and two daughters before he too died when Dante was about eighteen. 2 It is thought that at around six years of age Dante entered school. Education was rapidly increasing in importance in Florence in those days. 3 Giovanni Boccaccio, Dante's first biographer, describes Dante's education: I say that from the beginning of his boyhood, when he had learned the first elements of his letters, <b>he</b> <b>di...</b>|$|E
