60|$|To {{begin with}} the first that is known about it, or rather that is guessed. A part of a Roman road has been traced in Otterbourne Park, and near it was found {{a piece of a}} quern, one of the old stones of a <b>hand</b> <b>mill,</b> such as was used in ancient times for {{grinding}} corn; so that the place must have been inhabited at least seventeen hundred years ago. In the last century a medallion bearing the head of a Roman Emperor was found here, sixteen feet beneath the surface. It seems {{to be one of the}} medallions that were placed below the Eagle on the Roman Standards, and it is still in the possession of the family of Fitt, of Westley.|$|E

50|$|Under the {{machinist}} title {{are other}} specialty titles that refer to specific skills {{that may be}} more highly developed {{to meet the needs of}} a particular job position, such as fitter (assembles parts), turning <b>hand,</b> <b>mill</b> hand, and grinder. Some titles reflect further development of machinist skills such as tool and die maker, patternmaker, and mold maker.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, {{the staple}} crop of the Longuda is Guinea Corn (Sorghum bicolor). This {{used to be}} {{grounded}} on stone <b>hand</b> <b>mill</b> and cooked into a thick paste, [...] "tuwo", then eaten with vegetable soup. Today, however, rice, maize, and millet form part of the staple of the Longuda. Guinea Corn still remains the dominant crop grown by the Longuda.|$|E
50|$|The name Kvernberget is {{probably}} a thousand years old, and refers to the mountain's resemblance to a medieval Quern-stone of a form which is still used in North Africa today. Fishermen working in the sea off of the island and fishing village of Grip navigated by the mountain, which they named after the tool they had at home, the <b>hand</b> <b>mill</b> for grinding corn to flour.|$|E
50|$|Rebatching, or <b>hand</b> <b>milling,</b> is a soapmaking {{technique}} used by hobbyists and artisan soapmakers. The commercial equivalent is French milling.|$|R

5000|$|Again, like Mill, Marx {{indicates}} the post-crisis waste of capital which restores profitability, {{but this is}} not mentioned specifically as a counter-tendency until the cyclical nature of the system is demonstrated. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>Mill</b> does not refer to depression of wages below their value, relative overpopulation, or the increase in [...] "stock capital". But on the most important counter-tendencies, that is, the effects of increasing productivity at home in cheapening commodities and of foreign trade in providing both cheaper goods and greater profits, Marx and Mill are in accord." ...|$|E

5000|$|Dedham, Massachusetts {{was first}} settled in 1635 and {{incorporated}} in 1636. The settlers needed a mill for grinding corn. Wind mills had been tried, {{but the wind}} was too unreliable, and <b>hand</b> <b>mills</b> took too much effort. [...] The closest mill was in Watertown, some distance away.|$|R

50|$|Malek-Yonan {{contacted}} the Rice Experimental Station of the State Agriculture College at Biggs in California's Sacramento Valley for paddies of rice with the husks intact. Then he persuaded {{a local hospital}} {{to allow him to}} use a sterilization vat to steam the rice in. The rice was then spread for several hours outdoors to dry before it was ready for milling. He borrowed a <b>hand</b> <b>mill</b> from a scientist who happened to own one from his Asian travels. The final step was to take the rice to the laboratory of a canning company to be canned. When he opened the cans several days later, he discovered that each kernel separated beautifully.|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} {{analysis}} the roasting of the grain and making flour of it by the <b>hand</b> <b>mill</b> symbolizes {{the process of the}} and resurrection of the god. It means {{the beginning of a new}} period. The mill as a cosmic machine produces periods of time. Thus, the mill doesn't mean only worldly, also cosmic and it is often made by a mythological smith like Finnish blacksmith Ilmarinen. He makes a mill which is called Sampo. In Serbian tradition the blacksmith gives the water mill to people. This symbolic and cultural association between the smith and mill is remarkable for the continuity between Kothar and Khidr.|$|E
50|$|Pandav Wada, Before {{the great}} Mahabharata war, the Pandav {{spent some time}} of their year in exile in Ekachakranagari. The area where they lived is known as Pandav wada. Pandav wada is famous {{as a place of}} {{historical}} interest.Bheema slayed the demon Bakasura in Padmalaya, about 15 kilometers from Erandol. To this day, one can find relics like Bheema kund, Bheema's <b>hand</b> <b>mill,</b> Bheema's bowl and the area where Bheema and Bakasura fought. A well close to the wada is known as Draupadikoop (Draupadi's well). The official government gazette even refers to this area as Pandav wada. A few years ago, school texts had a chapter about this place, which resulted in school outings to Pandav wada.|$|E

50|$|The {{establishment}} of the first settlement in Durham is credited to three men, Lucas DeWitt, John Plank, and Hendrick Plank. These pioneers established homes at what was then called DeWittsburg, now Oak Hill. The American Revolution forced the pioneers to temporarily abandon their homes {{until the end of}} the war. Hendrick Plank was abducted by the Native Americans and removed to Canada, where he died in captivity. The two remaining pioneers and Hendrick's widow, who remarried to Leonard Patrie, all returned by about 1782 to reestablish their homes. DeWitt brought with him a small <b>hand</b> <b>mill</b> for grinding grain and was in one respect the first miller in the town as well as being a farmer.|$|E
50|$|Three blockhouses {{had been}} {{constructed}} {{for the military}} garrison, as had a shelter for the <b>hand</b> <b>mill.</b> The ten settler's cabins faced together, A cleared line of fire was begun by removing brush and felled trees, {{but this was not}} completed in time. Another vulnerability had been that the lower edges of the roofs were on the outside and had, for example, become a way into the Fort for their dogs. This was reversed, but there were still open spaces between some of the logs. As per Shaumburgh's Plan, all this was linked with 8' high fencing of log pickets, and then extended to the shore, The total enclosed about one acre.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{music and}} folk dancing are heavily {{influenced}} by the styles of the Beiras and Alentejo regions. Several folk groups have developed on the island that reproduce the clothing styles, the music and traditional dance. Due to {{factors such as the}} climate and insular environment the style of music, songs, dance and instruments used (such as the viola de arame). Many of the dances have curious names, such as Pézinho da Garça (the Herons' Foot dance), Moda do Moinho de Mão (the Style of <b>Hand</b> <b>Mill),</b> Alfinete (the Pin), Balão (the Balloon), and Mouros (Moors). The Museu Etnográfico de Santo Espírito (Ethnographic Museum of Santo Espírito) relates aspects of the history and culture of the island.|$|E

60|$|In viewing {{these various}} ruins, Mr. George {{and the two}} {{students}} seemed most interested in the theatres, and temples, and other great public edifices, while Mrs. Gray and the children seemed to think {{a great deal more}} of the houses and the shops. There was one baker's shop with the oven entire, and three stone <b>hand</b> <b>mills,</b> in which the baker used to grind his corn. There were a great many curious utensils and implements found in this shop, when it was first excavated; but Mr. George said that they had all been removed.|$|R
40|$|Mixtures of {{light-weight}} {{elements and}} hydrides were investigated {{to increase the}} understanding of the chemical reactions that take place between various materials. This report details investigations we have made into mixtures that include NaAlH{sub 4 }, LiAlH{sub 4 }, MgH{sub 2 }, Mg{sub 2 }NiH{sub 4 }, alkali(ne) hydrides, and early third row transition metals (V, Cr, Mn). Experimental parameters such as stoichiometry, heat from ball <b>milling</b> versus <b>hand</b> <b>milling,</b> and varying the temperature of high pressure molten state processing were studied {{to examine the effects of}} these parameters on the reactions of the complex metal hydrides...|$|R
5000|$|Structure 1, being {{underground}} with {{a rounded}} irregular plant and {{section in the}} shape of basin. The base is flat and regular. His dimensions are 0,36 m of maximum depth and a maximum diameter d ' 1,57 m. Two stratigraphic units have differed: the first one, EU 1001, which is formed by numerous blocks, big and average, and some pebble. Stand out 10 fragments of parts of a <b>hand</b> <b>mill.</b> The EU 1002 is formed by a sediment brown very dark color formed by clays by 8 scanty centimeters of average. The sediment is full of remains of possible homes: coals and sediments blackened. The material is almost void, alone a chunk of sílex and an atypical fragment of a hand ceramics.|$|E
40|$|Mill {{scale is}} one of waste {{materials}} which is produced {{as a result of}} hot rolling of steel in all steel companies. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>mill</b> scale is considered a rich iron source with minimum impurities. This work aims at conversion of mill scale by adjusting smelting processes to produce different valuable products. The smelting processes were carried out using carbothermic reduction in a submerged arc furnace. Two carbonaceous reducing agents and different fluxing materials have been used to adapt optimum smelting process condition. A maximum iron recovery of 83 % was obtained by using graphite compared with 76 % obtained by using coke. Low sulphur content (≤ 0. 02 [*]wt%[*]S) can be attained by using graphite as a reducing agent in amount that equals or exceeds the stoichiometric molar ratio. By using coke, the highest degree of desulfurization of 97. 8 % and much lower content of sulphur in the castable metal (0. 0028 [*]wt%[*]S) were obtained by controlling the type and quantity of the flux. The results reveal that mill scale waste can be converted into valuable products such as high purity iron as alternative to Sorelmetal used in ductile iron production, low carbon steel, and free cutting steel...|$|E
40|$|Shipwreck {{archaeology}} in South Asian {{region is}} rather recent when one compares {{with the rest}} of the world and shipwrecks of the Bronze Age are unknown so far. There is also limited information on the shipwrecks of the early historical period. There are however two examples from this region namely Bet Dwarka (in India) and Godawaya (in Sri Lanka). In Bet Dwarka region a large number of antiquities including Roman amphorae, a Roman <b>hand</b> <b>mill,</b> lead ingot and possibly lead anchors have been found close to present a passenger jetty at a water depth of 8 m. The site is located in high energy tidal current thus the chance of survival of any lighter material is low. The quantity of pottery and material indicate the possibility of a shipwreck of foreign origin. Recently a shipwreck of the early historic period has been discovered at Godawaya in Sri Lankan waters and that is lying in 33 m water depth. The important antiquities from this wreck include stone quern, glass ingots, copper nodules and a large number of pottery. The comparative study and a radiocarbon date of this wreck suggest a date to the 1 st century CE. The origin of this ship might have been the Indian Subcontinent region...|$|E

Significant improvement in Jc at high fields is attributed to the upper critical field, Hc 2, enhancement caused by the increased disorder...|$|R
50|$|The corn mill {{existed in}} mediæval times and was {{granted to the}} monastery at Blanchland. It was {{a good source of}} profit because all the tenants had to bring their corn to be ground here and <b>hand</b> <b>mills</b> were {{forbidden}} by law. Since crossing the burn was difficult a pack horse bridge was constructed 1599-1600. In recent times the mill has been converted into a residence, but its appearance has been kept. The 18 ft water wheel was of the overshot type and a dam 500 yd above the mill retained the water for its use.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{agglomeration}} of YAG (Yttrium-Aluminum Garnet Y 3 Al 5 O 12) nanopowders doped {{with various}} rare earth ions {{obtained by the}} coprecipitation and calcination route {{is a major problem}} if it is wished to exploit the nano-size properties such as the transparency of dispersions of the powders or low temperature sintering. Investigations to optimize the preparation process of powders for High Pressure-Low temperature Sintering (HPLS) of semi-translucent pellets was undertaken. The appropriate milling time to decrease the agglomeration was evaluated with the help of ZETA- potential measurement. The dependence of the agglomerate size against the time of <b>hand</b> <b>milling</b> was used to optimize the process...|$|R
