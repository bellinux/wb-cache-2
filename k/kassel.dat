5|$|In 1778, {{he went to}} Germany to take a {{teaching}} position as a Natural History professor at the Collegium Carolinum in <b>Kassel,</b> where he met Therese Heyne, the daughter of classicist Christian Gottlob Heyne. She later {{became one of the}} first independent female writers in Germany. They married in 1785 (which was after he left <b>Kassel)</b> and had three children, but their marriage was not happy. From his time in <b>Kassel</b> on, Forster actively corresponded with important figures of the Enlightenment, including Lessing, Herder, Wieland and Goethe. He also initiated cooperation between the Carolinum in <b>Kassel</b> and the University of Göttingen where his friend Georg Christoph Lichtenberg worked. Together, they founded and published the scientific and literary journal Göttingisches Magazin der Wissenschaften und Litteratur. Forster's closest friend, Samuel Thomas von Sömmering, arrived in <b>Kassel</b> shortly after Forster, and both were soon involved with the Rosicrucians in <b>Kassel.</b>|$|E

5|$|In January 1884, the {{distinguished}} conductor Hans von Bülow brought the Meiningen Court Orchestra to <b>Kassel</b> and gave two concerts. Hoping {{to escape from}} his job in the theatre, Mahler unsuccessfully sought a post as Bülow's permanent assistant. However, {{in the following year}} his efforts to find new employment resulted in a six-year contract with the prestigious Leipzig Opera, to begin in August 1886. Unwilling to remain in <b>Kassel</b> for another year, Mahler resigned on 22 June 1885, and applied for, and through good fortune was offered a standby appointment as conductor at the Royal Deutsches Landestheater in Prague by the theatre's newly appointed director, the famous Angelo Neumann.|$|E
5|$|Only six Molyneux globes {{are known}} to exist today, two {{terrestrial}} globes and four celestial globes. Three celestial globes are in Germany, one each in Zerbst, Nuremberg (at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum (German National Museum)) and <b>Kassel</b> (Hessisches Landesmuseum (Hesse Museum), <b>Kassel).</b> The Hessisches Landesmuseum once had a 1592 terrestrial globe, but it {{is believed to have}} been destroyed during World War II. Three globes remain in England: one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe, is owned by Middle Temple in London and displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex.|$|E
5|$|The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, <b>Kassel,</b> were {{inherited}} {{from the collection of}} William IV (William the Wise), the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), a pioneer of astronomical research. William himself died in 1592, so it has been surmised that his son and successor, Maurice, purchased the globes for the collection. They were first mentioned in 1765 in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the Fürstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in <b>Kassel,</b> during the reign of Landgrave Frederick III. Only a celestial globe survives today; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) {{daylight}} bombing offensive over Europe commenced in January 1943. It {{was having}} an increasing impact. By July, {{they were able to}} reach deep into Germany and demanded more and more attention from the Luftwaffe. At the end of the month, against an 800-bomber raid on <b>Kassel,</b> Graf claimed his first four-engine bomber.|$|E
5|$|Walter Bruce Willis {{was born}} on March 19, 1955, {{in the town of}} Idar-Oberstein, West Germany. His father, David Willis (1929–2009), was an American soldier. His mother, Marlene, was German, born in <b>Kassel.</b> Willis is the oldest of four children; he has a sister, Florence, and a brother, David. His brother Robert died of {{pancreatic}} cancer in 2001, aged 42.|$|E
5|$|After he retired, Caracciola {{worked as}} a Mercedes-Benz {{salesman}} targeting North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) troops stationed in Europe. He died in the German city of <b>Kassel,</b> after suffering liver failure. He was buried in Switzerland, where he had lived since the early 1930s. He is remembered {{as one of the}} greatest pre-1939 Grand Prix drivers, a perfectionist who excelled in all conditions. His record of six German Grand Prix wins remains unbeaten.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from racing, {{he continued to}} work for Daimler-Benz as a salesman, targeting NATO troops stationed in Europe. He organised shows and demonstrations which toured military bases, leading in part {{to an increase in}} Mercedes-Benz sales during that period. In early 1959, he became sick and developed signs of jaundice, which worsened despite treatment. Later in the year he was diagnosed with advanced cirrhosis. On 28 September 1959, in <b>Kassel,</b> Germany, he suffered liver failure and died, aged 58. He was buried in his home town of Lugano.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to continental Europe, Forster turned toward academia. He traveled to Paris {{to seek out}} a discussion with the American revolutionary Benjamin Franklin in 1777. He taught natural history at the Collegium Carolinum in the Ottoneum, <b>Kassel</b> (1778–84), and later at the Academy of Vilna (Vilnius University) (1784–87). In 1788, he became head librarian at the University of Mainz. Most of his scientific work during this time consisted of essays on botany and ethnology, but he also prefaced and translated many books about travel and exploration, including a German translation of Cook's diaries.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after he}} had taken office Meyszner clashed with Kaltenbrunner, {{requiring}} {{the intervention of the}} Chief of the Orpo, SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei Kurt Daluege. Meyszner was transferred to the Sudetenland in early October 1938, after its annexation by Germany, as an Orpo district commander. On 20 April 1939, he was promoted to Generalmajor der Ordnungspolizei. In June 1939, he was again transferred, this time to <b>Kassel,</b> as Inspector of Orpo for the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau. He remained in this role until 10 September 1940, during which time he was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer on 20 April 1940.|$|E
5|$|Cassel (from Flemish; <b>Kassel</b> {{in modern}} Dutch spelling) is a commune in the Nord départment in {{northern}} France. Built on a prominent hill overlooking French Flanders, {{the town has}} existed since Roman times. It {{was developed by the}} Romans into an important urban centre and was the focus of a network of roads, which are still in use today, that converge on the hill. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Cassel became an important fortified stronghold for the rulers of Flanders which was repeatedly fought over before finally being annexed to France in the 17th century. It was the headquarters of Marshal Ferdinand Foch during part of the First World War. In 1940, during the German invasion of France, Cassel was the scene of a fierce three-day battle between British and German forces which resulted in much of the town being destroyed.|$|E
5|$|On Bennett's third trip, from January to March 1842, {{in which}} he also visited <b>Kassel,</b> Dresden and Berlin, he played his Caprice for piano and orchestra, Op. 22, in Leipzig. Despite his then-pessimistic view of music in England, Bennett missed his chance to {{establish}} himself in Germany. The musicologist Nicholas Temperley writes One might guess that the early loss of both parents produced in Bennett an exceptionally intense need for reassurance and encouragement. England could not provide this for a native composer in his time. He found it temporarily in German musical circles; yet, when the opportunity came to claim his earned place {{as a leader in}} German music, he was not quite bold enough to grasp it.|$|E
5|$|Solar power {{tends to}} be {{complementary}} to wind. On daily to weekly timescales, high pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas low pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter. Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat. In 2007 the Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of <b>Kassel</b> pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power around the clock and throughout the year, entirely from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|The Iore {{class was}} a cold-adapted and heavy-haul {{derivation}} from Adtranz's Octeon modular electric locomotive platform, which {{was launched in}} 1998 {{on the basis of}} Adtranz's latest models for Deutsche Bahn at the time. Adtranz and later Bombardier Transportation conducted the final assembly of the locomotives at <b>Kassel,</b> Germany. When Bombardier Transportation introduced the brand name TRAXX for its updated modular locomotive platform, the type designation TRAXX H80AC was applicable to the Iore class, however, it was excluded from the TRAXX family {{by the time of the}} second batch order in 2007. The manufacturer has also referred to the locomotive type as the Bombardier Kiruna.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} {{of wind and}} solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur {{at different times of}} the day and year. The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of <b>Kassel</b> pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{extraordinary}} initial {{success of}} Pinafore in America was seen first-hand by J. C. Williamson. He soon made arrangements with D'Oyly Carte {{to present the}} opera's first authorised production in Australia, opening on 15 November 1879 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney. Thereafter, his opera company played frequent seasons of the work (and the subsequent Savoy operas) until at least 1963. In the U.S., the piece never lost popularity. The Internet Broadway Database links to a non-exhaustive list of 29 productions on Broadway alone. Among the professional repertory companies continuing to present Pinafore regularly in the U.S. are Opera a la Carte, based in California, Ohio Light Opera and the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players, which tours the opera annually and often includes it in its New York seasons. Pinafore is still performed around the world by opera companies such as the Royal Theatre, Copenhagen; Australian Opera (and Essgee Entertainment and others in Australia); in <b>Kassel,</b> Germany; and even Samarkand, Uzbekistan.|$|E
5|$|After its {{removal from}} Operation Varsity, the {{division}} remained in reserve as the Allied armies advanced even further into Germany, moving to Oise, France, on 3 April for supply and administrative tasks. The division {{was scheduled to}} participate in several other airborne operations; however, these were all cancelled before they could take place. The first of these was Operation Arena, which envisioned landing between six and ten divisions into what was termed a 'strategic airhead' in the <b>Kassel</b> region of Northern Germany; the planners of the operations envisioned that the operation would deny a large swathe of territory to the German defenders and give the Allied armies a staging area for further advances into Germany. The 13th was chosen to participate, along with the 17th, 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and the British 6th and 1st Airborne Divisions. A preliminary date for 1 May was set for the operation once all of the required airborne and air-landed infantry divisions had been located and supplied, but it was ultimately cancelled on 26 March due to the rapid movement of Allied ground forces negating {{the need for the}} operation. Two other airborne operations were planned to include the 13th. Operation Choker II was to be an airborne landing on the east bank of the Rhine near Worms, Germany; planning for the operation got to an advanced stage, and the division was only hours from taking off from airfields in France when the operation was cancelled due to Allied ground forces overrunning the proposed landing areas. Operation Effective was designed to land the 13th south of Stuttgart, seize a nearby airfield and create an airhead for further forces to land in near the Black Forest. The operation was scheduled for 22 April, but was cancelled on 18 April due to Allied units encircling the Black Forest region and making it unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|The Hessian War resumed in September 1645, with {{a failed}} <b>Kassel</b> attack on Giessen. <b>Kassel</b> claimed that its troops were seeking winter quarters, however little doubt was left about Amalie Elisabeth's {{intentions}} after <b>Kassel</b> artillery shelled Marburg a month later. In 1646, Geyso returned to Hesse taking Marburg on 15 January, whose defenders {{had put a}} fierce resistance. Darmstadt then hired Ernst Albrecht von Eberstein as their new commander in chief, his counter offensive liberated all lands previously lost to <b>Kassel</b> apart from Marburg. In the meantime, both <b>Kassel</b> and Darmstadt's allies were too preoccupied with other issues, allowing the two {{to fight the war}} in relative isolation. On 20 November, Geyso defeated Eberstein in the Battle of Frankenberg forcing Darmstadt into a truce.|$|E
