In this case, GHG emissions can [...] "leak" [...] (carbon leakage) to another region or sector with less regulation (p.21). Leakages may be positive, where they reduce the effectiveness of domestic emission abatement efforts. Leakages may also be negative, and increase the effectiveness of domestic abatement efforts (negative leakages are sometimes called spillover) (IPCC, 2007). For example, a carbon tax applied only to developed countries {{might lead to a}} positive leakage to developing countries (Goldemberg et al., 1996, pp.27–28).

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it will be}} argued that the {{significant}} potential behind trade in electronic content services (e-services) 1 may not materialize if the regulatory GATS disciplines on <b>domestic</b> <b>regulations</b> are not reformed. The increasing amount and the diversity of national regulatory approaches to electronically delivered content services may be at the origin of this untapped potential. Obviously, the increased “balkanization ” of e-commerce via <b>domestic</b> <b>regulations</b> threatens to disappoint the early hopes for a global trading environment which was to be free of any trade barriers. New <b>domestic</b> <b>regulations</b> may also accommodate protectionist aims of national interest groups that want to avoid the competitive pressure of this new market access possibility (e-protectionism). The argument is developed in two steps. In the first part, it is shown that the increasing electronic delivery of content services creates a significant need for better developed GATS regulatory disciplines. In the second part, light is shed on the weaknesses of the current GATS regulatory disciplines and the ongoing negotiations. A review of the ongoing GATS negotiations on this issue shows that despite of some laudable achievements no tangible results have bee...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{countries}} have been motivated by concern that higher levels of intellectual property protection under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) would involve a substantial commitment of insufficient government resources, producing a significant net outflow of royalties to foreign rights holders and increasing domestic prices. Now those countries {{are more concerned about}} strong patent protection as they believe that this would be harmful for their emerging pharmaceutical industries and for access to affordable medicines. Bangladesh has been taken as a case study as its pharmaceutical industry is now meeting around 97 per cent of total domestic demand, but it must still ensure TRIPS compliance within the extended period ending on 1 January 2016 if it is not to face negative consequences regarding patent protection and access to affordable medicine. Its compliance does not depend only upon the consequential negotiations but mostly upon Bangladesh <b>domestic</b> <b>regulations</b> {{and the role of the}} regulatory agencies responsible for enacting adequate regulations. Based on a qualitative methodology, this article examines the patentability exceptions regarding environmental requirements under TRIPS that might have depressing consequences on Bangladesh pharmaceutical products' market access as a least developed country (LDC).

One critic pointed out that despite Kirk's claim of transparency in the process, public-interest stakeholders have been completely excluded.
