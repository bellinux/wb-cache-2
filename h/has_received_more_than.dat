25|$|Most of Paolo's {{music was}} {{published}} in modern editions in the 1970s, making it easily available, {{and as a result}} he <b>has</b> <b>received</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the usual amount of critical attention.

How much is lost is impossible to guess, but the 14th century saw an explosion of interest in notated secular music in Italy, and the proportional survival of his secular to sacred work may well represent the actual trend.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that {{the area around the}} site <b>has</b> <b>received</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 72 inches of rain since A.D. 1450, which was more than needed to support crop growth there. Because of the large amount of rainfall at Machu Picchu, it was found that irrigation was not needed for the terraces. The terraces received so much rain that they were built specifically to allow for ample drainage of the extra water. Excavation and soil analyses done by Kenneth Wright in the 90's showed that the terraces were built in layers, with a bottom layer of larger stones covered by loose gravel. On top of the gravel was a layer of mixed sand and gravel packed together, with rich topsoil covering all of that. It was proven that the topsoil was probably moved from the valley floor to the terraces because it was much more rich than the soil higher up the mountain.|$|E
