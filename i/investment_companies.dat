5|$|During development, id {{approached}} Sierra Entertainment, {{then one}} of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company. After viewing Commander Keen and an early version of Wolfenstein 3D, CEO Ken Williams offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was excited by the deal, but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front {{as part of the deal}} rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams's seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of Wolfenstein 3D and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable future. By the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, Doom, the success of Wolfenstein 3D led id to receive multiple calls every month from <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down.|$|E

This subject is investigated by concentrating on four primary areas of interest: (1) management and supervision of the <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> portfolio by the <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> adviser, (2) the relationship of <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> size to the management fee paid the investment adviser, (3) the relationship of <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> size to the operating expenses of the company (exclusive of management fees) and, (4) the relationship of <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> performance to the management fee paid the investment adviser.
