A more pragmatic system is proposed which encompasses (1) selecting both the "soft" and the "hard" chemicals, (2) screening chemicals for potential biodegradability in a specified environmental compartment and (3) simulation methods. Methods of level 91) should be applicable to all chemicals, irrespective of their physico-chemical and biological properties. "Soft" chemicals can be recognized by a positive result in a Ready Biodegradability Test (RBT), wheras a negative result in a so-called <b>Inherent</b> <b>Biodegradability</b> Test (IBT) is an indication for persistence of a compound. Although RBT's have been update in 1990, they still suffer from some shortcomings. In this report simple modifications of existing methods are discussed to overcome these shortcomings together with more satisfactory methods, which have been developed the last decade. The limitations of <b>Inherent</b> <b>Biodegradability</b> Tests are evaluated and alternative techniques are proposed to make IBT's applicable to {{a wider range of}} physico-chemical properties. Recently developed useful methods, such as test for sea-water and the anaerobic compartment, proved problematic to place in the current OECD test hierachy but fitt easily in level (2) of the proposed test system...|$|E
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the 'poorly solubles approach' with model compounds, which are used in cosmetics, will contribute to substantiate the approach with data. If the substance to be assessed is a potential PBT-chemical, the approach may allow us {{to conclude that the}} substance is not toxic to the aquatic environment and thus the T-criteria do not apply. Hence the substance may be at the most a vPvB compound (very persistent + very bioaccumulative). Testing its <b>inherent</b> <b>biodegradability</b> and its potential bioaccumulation will exclude or confirm the respective vPvB characteristics; otherwise it will be advisable to substitute this substance.|$|E
30|$|Special {{consideration}} has to {{be given}} to the class of poorly water-soluble substances with log Kow values above about 6, which have a high tendency to adsorb to particulate matter like soil or sediment. These compounds quickly partition from the aqueous phase to pores of the humic matter becoming strongly sorbed or sequestered (type I NER). Even if the <b>inherent</b> <b>biodegradability</b> is high, they become rather persistent in the sequestered state if desorption rates are very slow. Persistence is clearly influenced by partitioning to particulate matrices as has been shown by many examples: even biodegradable substances like proteins persist after immobilization to a solid matrix.|$|E
40|$|Temperature-phased {{anaerobic}} digestion with a 50 - 70 degrees C pre-treatment is widely proposed for sludge. Here, such a sludge pre-treatment (65 degrees C) was studied against the physical, enzymatic and biodegradation processes. The soluble and particulate fractions were analysed {{in terms of}} biochemical composition and hydrolytic enzymatic activities. Two kinetics of organic matter solubilisation were observed: a rapid transfer of the weak-linked biopolymers to the water phase, including sugars, proteins or humic acid-like substances, to the water phase, followed by a slow and long-term solubilisation of proteins and humic acid-like substances. In addition, during the heat treatment a significant pool of thermostable hydrolytic enzymes including proteases, lipases and glucosidases remains active. Consequently, a global impact on organic matter was {{the transfer of the}} biodegradable chemical oxygen demand (COD) from the particulate to the soluble fraction as evaluated by the biological methane potential test. However, the total biodegradable COD content of the treated sludge remained constant. The heat process improves the bio-accessibility of the biodegradable molecules but doesn't increase the <b>inherent</b> sludge <b>biodegradability,</b> suggesting that the chemistry of the refractory proteins and humic acids seems to be the real limit to sludge digestion...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{photothermal}} therapy (PTT) {{which employs}} light-induced heating to destroy cancer tissues/cells has received tremendous attention {{due to its}} improved selectivity and minimal invasion to surrounding healthy tissues. A variety of photothermal conversion agents (PTCAs) with high near-infrared (NIR) light absorbance have been widely explored for NIR light-induced PTT. However, many of them cannot be used directly in vivo owing to their nonbiodegradability, immunogenicity, poor pharmacokinetics, or potential long-term toxicity. Proteins and peptides with <b>inherent</b> biocompatibility and <b>biodegradability</b> {{have been used as}} delivery vehicles for PTCAs or used as biotemplates to direct the synthesis of PTCAs. In this review, we will summarize recent advances in the development of protein/peptide-based photothermal cancer theranostics.

40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{evaluating}} the toxicity and biodegradability of hazardous pollutants (chlorinated compounds, chemical additives and pharmaceuticals) have been studied in this work. Different bioassays using representative bacteria of marine and terrestrial ecosystems such as Vibrio fischeri and Pseudomonas putida {{have been used to}} assess the ecotoxicity. Activated sludge was used to analyse the effect of those pollutants in a biological reactor of a sewage treatment plant (STP). The results demonstrate that none of the compounds is toxic to activated sludge, except ofloxacin to P. putida. The additives tested can be considered moderately toxic according to the more sensitive V. fischeri assays, whereas the EC 50 values of the pharmaceuticals depend on the specific microorganism used in each test. Regarding the biodegradability, respirometric measurements were carried out for fast biodegradability assessment and the Zahn-Wellens test for <b>inherent</b> <b>biodegradability.</b> The evolution of the specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) showed that only diethyl phthalate was easily biodegradable and acetylsalicylic acid was partially biodegradable (98 % and 65 % degradation, respectively). The persistence of dichloromethane, ofloxacin and hidrochlorothiazide was confirmed along the 28 days of the Zahn-Wellens test whereas 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane showed <b>inherent</b> <b>biodegradability</b> (74 % removal). Most of the chlorinated compounds, pharmaceuticals, bisphenol A and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid were partially degraded in 28 d with total organic carbon (TOC) reduction ranging from 21 % to 51 %. Sulphamethoxazole showed certain biodegradation (50 % removal) with TOC decrease around 31 %, which indicates the formation of non-biodegradable by-productsThis work was financially supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad through the project CTM 2013 - 43803 -...|$|E
40|$|Vegetable oils {{are among}} the most {{promising}} renewable raw materials because of their ready availability, <b>inherent</b> <b>biodegradability,</b> and their many versatile applications. Vegetable oils are the fats and lipids containing triglyceride molecules. Due to the increase in environmental issues like waste disposal problems, non-biodegradable resources, greenhouse effect, etc. and the reduction of petroleum oil resources, renewable oils from vegetable origin have become an important issue. The lubricants from renewable resources are a successful reality {{in many parts of the}} world. Vegetable oils have many advantages such as high flash point, high viscosity index, high lubricity and low evaporative loss besides Eco-compatible, renewability and non-toxicity.

40|$|Although {{chitosan}} nanoparticles (CNs) {{became a}} promising tool for several biological and medical applications owing to their <b>inherent</b> biocompatibility and <b>biodegradability</b> features, studies regarding {{their effects on}} cytotoxic and cytostatic properties still remain insufficient. Therefore, in the present study, we decided to perform comprehensive analysis of the interactions between CNs–pKindling-Red-Mito (pDNA) and different cell line models derived from blood system and human solid tissues cancers. The resulting CNs-pDNA was investigated {{in terms of their}} cellular uptake, transfection efficiency, and physico-chemical, cytotoxic and cytostatic properties. The nanoparticles showed high encapsulation efficiency and physical stability for various formulations even after two days time period. Moreover, high gene expression levels were observed after 96 h of transfection. CNs-pDNA treatment, despite the absence of oxidative stress induction, caused cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1 phase and as a consequence led to premature senescence {{which turned out to be}} both p 21 -dependent and p 21 -independent. Also, observed DNMT 2 upregulation may suggest the activation of different pathways protecting from the results of CNs-mediated stress. In conclusion, treatment of different cell lines with CNs-pDNA showed that their biocompatibility was limited and the effects were cell type-dependent...|$|R
40|$|Since poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) is {{inherently}} brittle and possesses poor elastic properties, hollow fibers produced by melt spinning from pure PHB, {{as described in}} our earlier study [Macromolecular Materials and Engineering, 2010, 295 / 6, 585 &# 8211; 594], {{do not meet the}} required needs regarding the mechanical performance. Besides hardly available PHB copolymers, also blend systems are known to enhance material properties and have thus been considered to be eligible to fabricate flexible or rather pliable hollow fibers based on PHB. Blends of PHB and poly-!-caprolactone (PCL) are promising for the application in tissue engineering due to the <b>inherent</b> biocompatibility and <b>biodegradability.</b> A wide range of PHB/PCL compositions have been prepared by melt extrusion. Thermal and mechanical properties of the obtained specimens were analyzed in order to identify miscibility and degree of dispersion as well as to determine the influence on the overall mechanical performance. Even though these constituents are known to be immiscible, PHB/PCL 70 / 30 was proven to be an adequate composition. This blend showed a highly increased elongation and was found to be easily processable by melt spinning compared to pure PHB. From this blend well defined dimensionally stable bendable hollow fibers were fabricated...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Tissue {{engineering}} aims {{to restore}} function and treat disease through the fabrication of a suitable microenvironmental niche to facilitate recovery and repair. Often, a scaffold {{is necessary to}} provide the appropriate spatial, chemical, and mechanical cues {{in place of the}} native extracellular matrix. The cellular microenvironment determines cellular behavior and cell fate via contact, nutrient and waste concentration gradients, soluble signaling factors and cell-cell signaling. Thus, an effective tissue engineering scaffold must recapitulate the native extracellular microenvironment to promote the appropriate cellular behavior, and in turn, restoration of function. Chitosan-based materials are an attractive candidate for tissue engineering scaffolds on account of the <b>inherent</b> biocompatibility, <b>biodegradability,</b> availability, and range of processing techniques available. We first fabricated a porous, 3 D chitosan-alginate scaffold, which we determined is an effective microenvironment for human embryonic stem cell (hESC) renewal to confluency without the use of feeder cells or conditioned media. Additionally, a technique was developed to dissolve the scaffold and recover hESCs while maintaining pluripotency. Thus, we developed an effective system for the high-density propagation of hESCs, which will be necessary for translation to future clinical applications. Subsequently, we developed an in vitro cell culture system for the myogenic induction of hESCs that integrates soluble factors with aligned chitosan-PCL fibrous ECM. In the course of this combinatorial study, it was determined that aligned chitosan-PCL fibers convey unique microenvironmental stimuli that guide cell differentiation. Finally, the aligned chitosan-PCL fibrous ECM was used to address the limitations of existing tendon grafts. Tenogenic differentiation was induced in human bone marrow stem cells more rapidly and with a greater purity than possible with current techniques. These findings demonstrate the potential use of chitosan-based materials for tissue engineering applications, and that specific microenvironmental cues can be conveyed by rational design of the scaffold to maximize the biological performance of a tissue-engineered construct...|$|R
40|$|Surfactant {{enhanced}} bioremediation (SEB) of oil is {{an approach}} adopted {{to overcome the}} bioavailability constraints encountered in biotransformation of nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) pollutants. Fuel oils contain n-alkanes and other aliphatic hydrocarbons, monoaromatics, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

Although SEB {{has the potential to}} increase the degradation rate of oil and its constituents, there are numerous challenges in the successful application of this technology. Success is dependent on the choice of appropriate surfactant type and dose since the surfactant-hydrocarbon-microorganism interaction may be unique to each scenario.

30|$|Simulation {{studies are}} {{preferred}} for {{the determination of}} biodegradation half-lives. However, {{for the vast majority}} of industrial chemicals no data are available from simulation studies. Thus, information from test on ready and <b>inherent</b> <b>biodegradability</b> as well as from (Q)SAR methods (BIOWIN from EPI Suite, [54]) has been recommended for screening substances as being potentially persistent [15]. The screening criteria, laid down in Table R. 11 - 4, are not legally binding whereas the (definitive) P/vP criteria are (see Table  1). Testing on biodegradability is conducted at room temperature and not temperature corrected. BIOWIN generates biodegradation half-lives in water and assigns them to five classes representing half-lives from hours to years. The half-life in water is multiplied by factors of 2 and 9 to obtain a half-life in soil and sediment, respectively. BIOWIN models for primary and ultimate degradation have been developed from expert surveys [6]. Arnot et al. [3] calibrated the models to empirical aerobic environmental half-life data from 40 selected “training set” chemicals and evaluated the outcome of this calibration with environmental aerobic biodegradation data of a set of 115 chemicals. Although it is not explicitly stated at which temperature biodegradation half-lives were determined, room temperature for laboratory and summer temperature for field measurements can be assumed. Regression analysis was undertaken to identify statistical relationships between biodegradability and basic properties. As the QSAR models were trained using data on biodegradation half-lives at room temperature, any predictions will also refer to this temperature. Temperature correction of the results of biodegradability testing and BIOWIN calculations is not required for screening information [15].|$|E
40|$|Hyaluronan (HA) is {{a linear}} {{polysaccharide}} with disaccharide repeats of d-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. It is evolutionarily conserved and abundantly {{expressed in the}} extracellular matrix (ECM), on the cell surface and even inside cells. Being a simple polysaccharide, HA exhibits an astonishing array of biological functions. HA interacts with various proteins or proteoglycans to organize the ECM and to maintain tissue homeostasis. The unique physical and mechanical properties of HA contribute {{to the maintenance of}} tissue hydration, the mediation of solute diffusion through the extracellular space and the lubrication of certain tissues. The diverse biological functions of HA are manifested through its complex interactions with matrix components and resident cells. Binding of HA with cell surface receptors activates various signaling pathways, which regulate cell function, tissue development, inflammation, wound healing and tumor progression and metastasis. Taking advantage of the <b>inherent</b> biocompatibility and <b>biodegradability</b> of HA, as well as its susceptibility to chemical modification, researchers have developed various HA-based biomaterials and tissue constructs with promising and broad clinical potential. This paper illustrates the properties of HA from a matrix biology perspective by first introducing the principles underlying the biosynthesis and biodegradation of HA, as well as the interactions of HA with various proteins and proteoglycans. It next highlights the roles of HA in physiological and pathological states, including morphogenesis, wound healing and tumor metastasis. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the roles of HA in various physiological processes can provide new insights and tools for the engineering of complex tissues and tissue models...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the usage}} of {{chemical}} flocculants especially polyacrylamides is closely related with environmental pollution and health hazards, synthesis of environmental friendly and economic viable bio-flocculants that exhibit high flocculating efficiency is highly desirable. The production of natural bio-flocculants extracted from plant is urgently needed {{as an alternative to}} chemical flocculants due to their <b>inherent</b> low toxicity, <b>biodegradability</b> and low environmental footprint. In this study, a plant-based bio-flocculant was extracted from Hibiscus/Abelmoschus esculentus (okra) with conventional hydrothermal extraction (CHE) and microwave assisted extraction (MAE) processes by using water as solvent. The aims of this work were to produce the bio-flocculant through environmentally friendly and economically feasible process, optimise its extraction yield, optimise its flocculating and sludge dewatering properties, and also minimise its production cost in order to be comparable to chemical flocculants (polyacrylamides) from perspectives of quality and cost. The extraction efficiencies of bio-flocculants were justified by the optimised yields, the flocculating abilities were evaluated by the removal of suspended solids (SS) and turbidity after flocculation process and sludge volume index (SVI) whereas the sludge dewatering abilities were assessed by SS removal after filtration and water recovery. Single factor experimental design was employed to study the effects of extraction temperature, time, solvent loading, and agitation speed and particle size on yield, flocculating and dewatering properties of bio-flocculants. The influence of extraction parameters to yield and the reliability of the experimental data were verified by analysing the single factor experimental results with response surface methodology. Results showed that extraction yields were significantly affected by extraction temperature and time and solvent loading. Prolonged extraction (few hours) at high temperature (60 - 90 ˚C) decreased the yields of bio-flocculants extracted with CHE method. Conversely, extraction at high temperature was favourable for MAE method to raise the yield due to short extraction time in minutes. Flocculating abilities of bio-flocculants were not significantly affected by the extraction conditions whilst the sludge dewatering abilities were mainly influenced by the temperature and particle size. High extraction temperature at ≥ 70 ˚C and the smallest okra particle size at 1 mm were the crucial conditions for extraction of bio-flocculants with high dewatering abilities which showed > 95...|$|R
40|$|Poly ((R) -$ beta$-hydroxybutyrate), PHB, is a naturally-occurring {{thermoplastic}} polyester {{of widespread}} interest {{due to its}} <b>inherent</b> <b>biodegradability.</b> A synthetic racemic analogue, poly ((R,S) -$ beta$-hydroxybutyrate), was prepared via the methylaluminoxane-catalyzed polymerization of (R,S) -$ beta$-butyrolactone, and fractionated to yield a range of tacticities, including new material primarily syndiotactic in nature. Each fraction was characterized, and the syndiotactic crystal structure was examined. An x-ray fibre diagram was recorded, the measured reflections were indexed, and a tetragonal unit cell was assigned. To supplement the initial characterization and probe the polymerization mechanism, high resolution $ sp{ 13 }$C nmr spectra were obtained for the full tacticity range of the racemic PHB and interpreted with regard to several statistical models. A two-site model involving enantiomorphic and first-order Markovian sites was proposed, and the parameters describing each sample were derived. Average isotactic and syndiotactic block lengths were also calculated. The connection between stereoregularity and crystalline morphology was probed through the precipitation of single crystals. Lamellar single crystals {{similar to those of}} bacterial PHB were obtained from isotactic racemic PHB even of low stereoregularity; syndiotactic PHB gave a non-diffracting precipitate of two morphologies apparently differing in tacticity. Cocrystallization of R and S repeat units was implied. In recognition of the important of biodegradation to the interest in this material, the enzymatic degradability of the synthetic PHB was investigated, using extracellular PHB depolymerases of both bacterial and fungal origin. For solvent-cast films of PHB, the rates of weight loss decreased in the order bacterial PHB $>>$ synthetic atactic $>$ synthetic isotactic $>$ synthetic syndiotactic in both enzyme systems. The relative degradation rates of the synthetic samples changed significantly when the single crystals of natural and synthetic PHB were degraded. These observations were interpreted in terms of the opposing effects of crystallinity and stereochemistry, and the assumed normalization of crystallinity differenced in the single crystals of different tacticity. Differenced between the two enzyme systems, preferential enzymatic attack on the edge or fold surfaces of the single crystals, and the implications in terms of chain cleavage mechanism were also examined...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação apresentada no Departamento de Biologia Vegetal da Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa para Doutoramento em MicrobiologiaSeveral {{biological}} methods employ activated sludge (AS) as inoculum to assess toxicity or biodegradability of pollutants, since pollutants that ultimately enter {{the environment are}} often discharged through wastewater treatment plants. The use of AS to evaluate {{the environmental impact of}} chemicals and wastewaters suffers from several drawbacks related with the heterogeneity, absence of standardization and health risk associated with this mixed sewage population. To search for reliable testing inocula alternatives, the potential of several well-defined microbial inocula as reference material, for ready and <b>inherent</b> <b>biodegradability</b> and toxicity screening tests (BOD 5 test, Zahn-Wellens test and respiration inhibition test, respectively), was evaluated and the results were compared with AS’ results. In overall, the most relevant results in terms of environmental application were obtained with bacterial mixtures, namely with three standardized microbial consortia: two commercial inocula (BI-CHEM and BIOLEN M 112) and a designed inoculum (DI, a standardized soil inoculum). A community-level physiological profile (CLPP) analysis was also performed for each inoculum tested, being its metabolic fingerprint compared with AS’ CLPPs. From biodegradability results obtained, DI stands out a good choice as reference material for biodegradability tests, while from toxicity results the BI-CHEM appears as the suitable alternative to AS, since its sensitivity {{is similar to that of}} AS. Moreover, in terms of the overall metabolic potential, DI and BI-CHEM were the most representative inocula of AS’ CLPPs among the consortia tested. In addition, beyond other inocula also studied, DI and BI-CHEM were validated as seed for BOD 5 test, by testing several real samples in a comparative study with a treatment plant inoculum. The use of well-predefined microbial consortia, with simple maintenance and manipulation, can be helpful for the normalisation of biological assays leading to an improvement of the quality of chemical and effluent testing and monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Mesoporous silicon {{has become}} a {{material}} of high interest for drug delivery due to its outstanding internal surface area and <b>inherent</b> <b>biodegradability.</b> We have previously reported the preparation of mesoporous silicon microparticles (MS-MPs) synthe- sized by an advantageous electrochemical method, and showed that due to their inner structure they can adsorb proteins in amounts exceeding {{the mass of the}} carrier itself. Protein release from these MS-MPs showed low burst effect and fast delivery kinetics with complete release in a few hours. In this work, we explored if tailoring the size of the inner pores of the particles would retard the protein release process. To address this hypothesis, three new MS-MPs prototypes were prepared by electrochemical synthesis, and the resulting carriers were characterized for morphology, particle size, and pore structure. All MS-MP prototypes had 90 μm mean particle size, but depending on the current density applied for synthesis, pore size changed between 5 and 13 nm. The model protein α-chymotrypsinogen was loaded into MS-MPs by adsorption and solvent evaporation. In the subsequent release experiments, no burst release of the protein was detected for any prototype. However, prototypes with larger pores (> 10 nm) reached 100 % release in 24 – 48 h, whereas prototypes with small mesopores (< 6 nm) still retained most of their cargo after 96 h. MS-MPs with ∼ 6 nm pores were loaded with the osteogenic factor BMP 7, and sustained release of this protein for up to two weeks was achieved. In conclusion, our results confirm that tailoring pore size can modify protein release from MS-MPs, and that prototypes with potential therapeutic utility for regional delivery of osteogenic factors can be prepared by convenient techniques.

40|$|Polymeric {{materials}} have been prevalent in {{our everyday lives}} {{for quite a long}} time. Most of today's polymeric materials are derived from nonrenewable petroleum-based feedstocks. Instabilities in the regions where petroleum is drilled, along with an increased demand in petroleum, have driven the price of crude oil to record high prices. This, in effect, increases the price of petroleum-based polymeric materials, which has caused a heightened awareness of renewable alternatives for polymeric feedstocks. Cellulose, starch, proteins and natural oils have all been examined as possible polymeric feedstocks. Natural oils are commercially available on a large scale and are relatively cheap. It is projected that the U. S. alone will produce 21 billion pounds of soybean oil in the period 2008 / 2009. Natural oils also have the advantages of <b>inherent</b> <b>biodegradability,</b> low toxicity, high purity and ready availability. Most natural oils possess a triglyceride structure as shown in Figure 1. Most natural oils have a unique distribution of fatty acid side chains, along with varying degrees of unsaturation per triglyceride. Common fatty acid side chains in naturally occurring oils are palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), a 16 carbon fatty acid with no unsaturation; stearic acid (C 18 : 0), an 18 carbon fatty acid with no unsaturation; oleic acid (C 18 : 1), an 18 carbon fatty acid with one double bond; linoleic acid (C 18 : 2), an 18 carbon fatty acid with two double bonds; and linolenic acid (C 18 : 3), an 18 carbon fatty acid with three double bonds. Of course, there are other fatty acids with varying degrees of unsaturation, but their abundance is usually minimal. All of the unsaturated fatty acids mentioned have naturally occurring cis double bonds, which is common for most unsaturated fatty acids. In addition, the afore mentioned fatty acids have the first double bond at the position of carbon 9 (C 9), followed by carbon 12 (C 12), if there are two degrees of unsaturation, then at carbon 15 (C 15), if there are three degrees of unsaturation. In addition, the double bonds are not in conjugation. Table 1 gives the fatty acid make-up of linseed oil. It can be seen that linseed oil has an average of 6. 0 double bonds per triglyceride. Its fatty acid content consists of 5. 4 % palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), 3. 5 % stearic acid (C 18 : 0), 19 % oleic acid (C 18 : 1), 24 % linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) and 47 % linolenic (C 18 : 3). Table 1 also gives the fatty acid composition and varying degrees of unsaturation for various other naturally-occurring natural vegetable oils. The regions of unsaturation in natural oils allow for interesting polymer chemistry to take place. Some of this interesting polymer science, however, involves chemical modification of the regions of unsaturation. Acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) is prepared by epoxidation of the double bonds, followed by ring opening with acrylic acid. The resulting oil has both acrylate groups and hydroxyl groups. Wool and colleagues have further reacted the hydroxyl groups within the oil with maleic anhydride to produce maleated acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (MAESO). The MAESO has been copolymerized with styrene free radically to produce promising thermosetting sheet molding resins. Petrovi? and co-workers have directly ring opened the epoxidized oil to produce polyols that produce promising polyurethanes through condensation polymerization with diisocyanates. Our group's work initially focused on direct cationic copolymerization of the double bonds or conjugated double bonds of natural oils with monomers, such as styrene and divinylbenzene, to produce promising thermosetting resins. The only modification of the oils that was carried out in these studies was conjugation of the double bonds to enhance the reactivity of the oil. This work has been expanded recently with the incorporation of glass fiber to produce promising composites. We have also explored thermal polymerization techniques to make novel thermosets. This dissertation is divided into four chapters. The first chapter discusses the synthesis and characterization of biobased thermosets prepared by the free radical polymerization of conjugated linseed oil with commercially available monomers. The second chapter covers the synthesis and characterization of a chemically modified castor oil and its copolymerization with cyclooctene via ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). The third chapter looks at the ROMP of a commercially available vegetable oil containing an unsaturated bicyclic moiety with dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and characterization of the resulting materials. The fourth chapter discusses the reinforcement of a ROMP resin using short glass fibers to make composite materials...|$|E
