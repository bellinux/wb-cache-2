40|$|The {{reporting}} of leaks from whistleblower Edward Snowden {{has led to}} a global debate about privacy in the Internet era. This article reviews US and UK alleged practices related to surveillance of foreign Internet communications content and “metadata”, and the international human rights law issues they raise. Often, these practices are based on vague laws that are applied on the basis of secret guidance or interpretations—which in international human rights terms is not “law” at all. To the extent that there are specific, published laws, their hallmarks are the sweeping, largely discretionary powers that they grant, a lack of effective oversight, and (often) <b>discrimination</b> <b>between</b> <b>nationals</b> or residents and non-nationals or non-residents. Spying on citizens, politicians and companies in another country, and obtaining data from servers in that other country, without the consent of the target country, furthermore violates the sovereignty of the latter country.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} with male rats investigated perceptual learning involving a tactile dimension (A, B, C, D, E), where A denotes 1 {{end of the}} continuum (e. g., a rough floor) and E the other (e. g., a smooth floor). In Experiment 1, rats given preexposure to A and E learned an appetitive <b>discrimination</b> <b>between</b> them more readily than those not given preexposure. Experiment 2 a showed that rats preexposed to B and D acquired a <b>discrimination</b> <b>between</b> A and E more readily than those preexposed to A and E; and in Experiment 2 b the same preexposure treatments had no effect on the acquisition of a <b>discrimination</b> <b>between</b> B and D. In Experiments 3 a and 3 b, rats given preexposure to C learned a <b>discrimination</b> <b>between</b> A and E more readily than those not given preexposure. Experiment 4 demonstrated that preexposure to a texture (e. g., B) that was adjacent to the to-be-discriminated textures (e. g., C and E) facilitated a <b>discrimination</b> <b>between</b> them relative to preexposure to their midpoint (D). These novel perceptual learning effects are interpreted as reflecting a redistribution of processing between the notional elements of the texture dimension...|$|R

40|$|Human nonverbal {{behavior}} {{recognition from}} multiple cues and modalities {{has attracted a}} lot of interest in recent years. Despite the interest, many research questions, including the type of feature representation, choice of static vs. dynamic classification schemes, the number and type of cues or modalities to use, and the optimal way of fusing these, remain open research questions. This paper compares frame-based vs window-based feature representation and employs static vs. dynamic classification schemes for two distinct problems in the field of automatic human nonverbal behavior analysis: multicue <b>discrimination</b> <b>between</b> posed and spontaneous smiles from facial expressions, head and shoulder movements, and audio-visual <b>discrimination</b> <b>between</b> laughter and speech. Single cue and single modality results are compared to multicue and multimodal results by employing Neural Networks, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and 2 - and 3 -chain coupled HMMs. Subject independent experimental evaluation shows that: 1) both for static and dynamic classification, fusing data coming from multiple cues and modalities proves useful to the overall task of recognition, 2) the type of feature representation appears to have a direct impact on the classification performance, and 3) static classification is comparable to dynamic classification both for multicue <b>discrimination</b> <b>between</b> posed and spontaneous smiles, and audio-visual <b>discrimination</b> <b>between</b> laughter and speech...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} examined {{the impact of}} discrimination difficulty on the acquisition and transfer of strategic visual discrimination slulls for meaningful stimuli. Participants were trained to discriminate between airplane silhouettes that varied in similarity. Some participants were trained to make difficult <b>discriminations</b> <b>between</b> similar airplane silhouettes, whereas others were trained to make easy <b>discriminations</b> <b>between</b> dissimilar airplane silhouettes. Participants were then transferred to making discrimination judgments at all similarity levels. The results suggest that initial training difficulty influences strategic skills even when participants have a priori strategies for processing stimuli. The findings improve our understanding of strategic skill acquisition, and training suggestions are discussed. Visual discrimination is an aspect of everyday life and is important for complex task performance such as discriminating between aircraft. The current research examines how humans optimize their attention to details relevant in the environment {{in order to make}} fast and accurate visual <b>discriminations</b> <b>between</b> target item...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the problem}} of discriminating {{multipartite}} unitary operations by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) has attracted significant attention. The latest work {{in the literature on}} this problem showed that two multipartite unitary operations can always be perfectly distinguished by LOCC when a finite number of runs are allowable. However, in these schemes, local entanglement (an entangled state holden by one party) was required, which seems to imply that local entanglement is necessary for perfect <b>discrimination</b> <b>between</b> unitary operations by LOCC. In this article, we show that a perfect <b>discrimination</b> <b>between</b> two unitary operations acting on a two-qudits can always be achieved without exploiting any entanglement. As a result, we conclude that local entanglement is not necessary for perfect <b>discrimination</b> <b>between</b> unitary operations acting on two-qudits by LOCC.
