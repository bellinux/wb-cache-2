Let's try to work on one song and take it from there -- not spend too much time thinking about the legend, and do something that just makes sense. [...] We did one song and another song, and we were having fun making music. And actually it was a very privileged time. She wasn't under any kind of pressure, she had time to spend on it; {{it was the only thing}} she had to work on.|$|E

Do not {{worry too much about}} me, though anything might happen. I know, Pete, that you are strong and decent. At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that you should not visit me here. I do not know. With the world in turmoil I now feel that a boy your age should experience what is coming his way – fully digest it without getting a [...] "belly ache," [...] so to speak, nor getting off the right track of truth, fact, honesty, fair play, and being above board–never a sneak....|$|E
500|$|In December 1968, Iommi {{abruptly}} left Earth to join Jethro Tull. Although his stint {{with the}} band would be short-lived, Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV show. Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969. [...] "It just wasn't right, so I left", Iommi said. [...] "At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> Tull were great, but I didn't much go for having {{a leader in the}} band, which was Ian Anderson's way. When I came back from Tull, I came back with a new attitude altogether. They taught me that to get on, you got to work for it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2014, {{the parents}} of George Zimmerman, a {{neighborhood}} watch coordinator {{who is known for}} fatally shooting Trayvon Martin but was later acquitted of second degree murder and manslaughter, filed a lawsuit against Barr for tweeting their home address and phone number on March 29, 2012. Barr allegedly tweeted [...] "At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was good to let ppl know that no one can hide anymore ... If Zimmerman isn't arrested I'll rt his address again- maybe go 2 his house myself." [...] Zimmerman's parents allege that Barr sought to [...] "cause a lynch mob to descend" [...] on their home. The Seminole County Circuit Court complaint sought more than $15,000 for emotional distress and invasion of privacy. In August 2015, summary judgment was granted in favor of Barr.|$|E
500|$|Lauren {{is portrayed}} by actress Ashley Fink. She made routine guest {{appearances}} throughout the first season, {{and became a}} member of the McKinley High glee club in the episode [...] "Special Education". Upon receiving the script in which Lauren joins the club, Fink initially reacted with disbelief. She commented, [...] "I didn't quite believe it at <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I was getting Punk'd." [...] She said that being cast in Glee makes her feel like [...] "the luckiest girl in the world". Fink's favorite element of Glee is how series creator Ryan Murphy manages to take the underdogs and make them shine. She said, [...] "In life, there's so much diversity, and it's not necessarily represented on television. I think Glee is one of the few shows that actually displays the diversity and it’s just so inspirational." [...] When asked about her casting process, Fink said: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dog Eat Dog" [...] is a style {{parody of}} the Talking Heads. Described as a [...] "tongue-in-cheek look at office life", the song was {{inspired}} by Yankovic's past experience of working in the mailrooms {{as well as the}} traffic department at Westwood One radio station. He noted, [...] "At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> [...] was kinda cool that I had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own, but after a while I felt like my soul had been sucked out of me." [...] The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song [...] "Once In a Lifetime": [...] "Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful stapler/Sometimes I tell myself this is not my beautiful chair!" [...] This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: [...] "You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful house/You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful wife".|$|E

500|$|Although by {{the early}} 1960s Levin was {{becoming}} a well-known name, his was not yet a well-known face. Meeting him in London the publisher Rupert Hart-Davis did not immediately recognise him: [...] "He looks about sixteen, and at <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he was someone’s little boy brought along to see the fun – very Jewish, with wavy fairish hair, very intelligent and agreeable to talk to". In 1963 Levin was invited to appear regularly on BBC television's new weekly late-night satirical revue, That Was The Week That Was, where he delivered monologues to camera about his pet hates and conducted interviews, appearing as [...] "a tiny figure taking on assorted noisy giants in debate". The programme, which had a short but much-discussed run, was transmitted live; this added to its edginess and impact, but also made it prone to disruption. Levin was twice assaulted on air, once by the husband of an actress whose show Levin had reviewed severely, and once by a woman astrologer who squirted him with water.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), Jozen Cummings from PopMatters {{described}} the song's production and instrumentation: [...] "The track is vintage Neptunes with big drums and intergalactic sound effects, and Carey {{adds to the}} breezy, easygoing feel of the song with a voice that is sexy, but subtle, like a shy woman who doesn’t need to {{say anything at all}} to get a man’s attention." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Say Somethin'" [...] recalls an encounter in which a male expresses interest in having a sexual affair in a bathroom with a female, while she agrees and responds [...] "If its worth you're while / Say somethin' good to me". In an interview with Newsweek, Carey described how she felt regarding the song: [...] "You're right. It is a totally different approach for me musically. When I heard it at <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was a cool and interesting track, but I didn't know if it was very me." [...] Additionally, Carey outed the lines [...] "Something like volcanic / You and me seems organic / Just like stars and planets" [...] as [...] "nonesense", but claimed she [...] "loved it".|$|E
500|$|Goater's trial {{resulted}} in the offer of a professional contract, {{but he did not}} break into the first team. In 1989, Goater signed for Rotherham United in order to play first team football. At this time, Goater suffered homesickness, finding it difficult to adapt to the English climate: [...] "It took me a good two years to get used to life in England. At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the sun never shone and it wasn't for me." [...] However, he gradually got used to living in England, and over the course of seven seasons at Rotherham he gained a reputation as a reliable lower division striker, scoring 86 goals in 262 appearances, with a winner's medal for the 1996 Auto Windscreens Shield the highlight. A 1992 League Cup tie against Everton gave Goater his first experience of playing against a Premier League team. In the first leg, Goater scored the only goal of the game as Rotherham won 1–0. However, Everton won the return leg 3–0 and Rotherham were eliminated. In 1993, Goater also had a brief loan spell at Notts County, though he made only one appearance for the Nottingham club due to a work permit problem. Towards the end of the 1995–96 season, Goater had a disagreement with Rotherham manager Archie Gemmill, and decided his future lay elsewhere.|$|E

500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E
2500|$|British troops torched Washington, burning {{it to the}} ground. The {{conflagration}} lit {{the nighttime}} skies at Falls Church, where a young refugee from Alexandria later recalled being awakened and taken outside to see Washington burn. [...] "At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the world was on fire. Such a flame I have never seen since." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sakharov later {{described}} {{that it took}} [...] "years" [...] for him to [...] "understand {{how much}} substitution, deceit, and lack of correspondence with reality there was" [...] in the Soviet ideals. [...] "At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> despite everything that I saw with my own eyes, that the Soviet State was a breakthrough into the future, a kind of prototype for all countries". Then he came, in his words, to [...] "the theory of symmetry: all governments and regimes to a first approximation are bad, all peoples are oppressed, and all are threatened by common dangers." ...|$|E
5000|$|Caine stated, [...] "The <b>first</b> Sleuth <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{was great}} {{and the second}} Sleuth <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was great until I read the reviews.

2500|$|The show's creators {{claim that}} they weren't {{engaging}} in a product placement strategy for commercial gain. One motivation {{for the use of}} real-world products, quite unrelated to commercial considerations, is the comedy value of funny-sounding phrases and words. [...] "I knew I wanted Kramer to think of watching the operation like going to see a movie", explained Seinfeld writer/producer Andy Robin in an interview published in the Hollywood Reporter. [...] "At <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> maybe a piece of popcorn falls into the patient. I ran that by my brother, and he said, 'No, Junior Mints are just funnier.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|McIntyre {{asked whether}} {{he was to be}} shot. Kelly replied, [...] "No, why should I want to shoot you? Could I not have done it half an hour ago if I had wanted?" [...] He added, [...] "At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you were Constable Flood. If you had been, I would have roasted you in the fire." [...] Kelly asked if the police came out to shoot him. [...] "No", replied McIntyre, [...] "we came to {{apprehend}} you." [...] "What", asked Kelly, [...] "brings you out here at all? It is a shame to see fine big strapping fellows like you in a lazy loafing billet like policemen." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next day, the FA {{confirmed}} {{that they had}} charged Suárez with violent conduct, while Liverpool fined Suárez an undisclosed amount which he requested be donated to the Hillsborough Family Support Group. Suárez declared that he thought a three-match ban would suffice. His previous victim, Otman Bakkal, described it as [...] "unbelievable" [...] that Suárez could bite a second player, and was left flabbergasted at the incident, stating that [...] "at <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> maybe {{it was an accident}} but, apparently, he loses it sometimes". Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chairman Gordon Taylor said that Suárez would be offered anger management counselling. Gus Poyet thought the reaction had been exaggerated, theorising that Suárez could leave English football if he carried on being punished and maligned for his actions, treatment he thought was hypocritical when compared to others.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not yet. I {{wanted to}} consult you <b>first.</b> Besides, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{it might be}} {{possible}} that the thief would put an advertisement in the newspapers, offering to return the bonds for a reward. But so far, I haven't seen any such advertisement." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{character}} of Jenny Harrison was named as a [...] "favourite" [...] to Shortland Street viewers. Harper herself {{did not enjoy}} playing Jenny when the soap began, but influenced the characters development with her own personality, she stated, [...] "At <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> Jenny {{was a bit of}} a victim [...] They've made her a stronger character now. I got sick of her being so passive. It was annoying to play and I don't think she was a good role model, either." [...] Jenny's abortion in 1995 was seen as highly controversial and several complaints were made to the Broadcasting Standards Authority, though none were upheld. A storyline featuring Jenny developing a cyst was introduced to the soap but never continued due to the writers effectively forgetting about it. This later became a codename, [...] "Jenny's cyst", for forgotten or misplaced storylines occurring in the soap. 2011 advertisements for repeats of the soap's original episodes, noted Jenny as one of the featured characters to entice an audience.|$|E
2500|$|At 4.20pm on Sunday 23 May 2010 an {{off-road}} motorcyclist spotted what {{he initially}} described as [...] "a sort of charred tailor's dummy" [...] in woodland at Monkey Hill, near Branchalfield Drive, Cambusnethan, Wishaw. As he approached he realised {{that it was}} actually a corpse. In his subsequent testimony he explained: [...] "At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was a mannequin and what struck me was the leg, possibly the left leg. I could see bone there. Tailor's dummies don't have bones." [...] The body was extensively charred, and he was unable to tell if it was that of a male or female. [...] He immediately went to his nearby home and telephoned the police to report the discovery. When the police arrived he led them to the scene, which Detective Sergeant (DS) Clifford Neil of Strathclyde Police described as [...] "gruesome." [...] The body lay on a makeshift pyre and had heavy duty plastic sheet partly melted on to the facial area. Strathclyde Police launched a murder inquiry, led by Detective Superintendent (D/Supt) Derek Robertson of the force's Major Investigation Unit, on 24 May following the results of a post-mortem examination.|$|E
2500|$|TLC aired {{the last}} episodes of What Not to Wear in Fall 2013. TLC general manager Amy Winter stated, [...] "After 10 {{incredible}} seasons, {{we felt that}} it was the right time to end the series." [...] Stacy London said, [...] "This show changed me and the trajectory of my life... I've learned so much from all of our contributors [...] over the years. I hope we touched them as much as they touched me. I hope we touched our viewers... I will always cherish the time I spent on 'WNTW' and be eternally grateful to TLC for a great co-host, amazing crew and an awesome program." [...] Clinton Kelly said, [...] "When I got the job, I told everyone I knew that we’d probably do 10 episodes, get canceled and I’d go crawling back to my old job in magazine publishing. So, I’m more surprised than anyone that we’ve lasted this long. At <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the essence of the show was making snarky remarks about people’s outfits, but as it turns out, 'WNTW' is about taking stock of who you are and communicating that non-verbally {{to the rest of the}} world. That’s incredibly empowering." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well, dash it all then. Old Bob got {{me out of}} {{an awful}} row the day before yesterday, and he seemed a bit sick at not playing for the <b>first,</b> so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might as well let him. That's how it was. Look here, swear you won't tell him." ...|$|R
