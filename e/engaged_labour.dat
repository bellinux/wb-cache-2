40|$|In {{the recent}} decades, the Danube Region {{countries}} profile their policies towards {{a more efficient}} way of exploiting the natural resources of the Danube basin. The Danube can contribute to a better integration of the countries, enhancing economic opportunities through diversification and promotion of rural development. The trend analysis in the agricultural sector of the Danube Region countries refers to {{the first decade of}} this century, and it begins with the determination of the agricultural importance in the overall economy. The development performances of agriculture in the Danube Region countries are considered according to the production and export performances of this economic sector, using a comparative approach. The agricultural production growth, level and growth of the partial agricultural productivities - labour and land, as well as the value of exports in relation to <b>engaged</b> <b>labour</b> and agricultural land, are analysed in such a context...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} enterprises’ responses to structural {{changes in the}} economy of Serbia caused by both transitional changes and the global economic crisis, {{as well as by}} influences of other accompanying factors. An assessment of the enterprises’ expectations in terms of short-term dynamics of employment needs is provided. Enterprises use different coping strategies, but their potentials for growth and development are particularly tight. The multinomial logit econometric models are employed in order to estimate outcomes in the enterprises’ expectations with respect to changes in job flows. The coefficient estimate of the variable that measures the amount of <b>engaged</b> <b>labour</b> at the level of an average enterprise in Serbia shows a statistically significant influence that this variable has on the enterprises’ decisions about the fluctuations of workers. Taking the decision that would not result in changes in the number of employees as a baseline alternative, the first rational choice of the employers would be to dismiss old or to employ new workers if they expect unfavourable, i. e. favourable, trends, respectively. The estimated multinomial logit model can be used for predictions of employers’ decisions about expected in(out) flows of workers. However, a parsimonious multinomial model was estimated, implying that more accurate predictions would be obtained by using the model with more explanatory variables. For the purpose of the analysis presented in this article, a micro set of the survey data provided by the Public Employment Service of Serbia is used. The survey, with enterprises as primary sample units, was carried out in 2011...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{associations}} between employment history and marital status and unpaid care provision among those aged 40 – 59 in England and Wales. We used {{data from a}} large nationally representative longitudinal study, the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study. Initially based on a sample drawn from the 1971 Census, in 2001 this study included data on 110 464 people aged 40 – 59 of whom 5 % provided 20 or more hours per week of unpaid care. We analysed associations between caregiving of this intensity and current employment, employment history, employment characteristics, marital status, and employment after childbearing. Among men, caregiving {{was associated with a}} history of lower levels of employment. The small group of men with a history of least employment were 70 % more likely to provide care than those with a history of most employment. Among women, caregiving was associated with a history of non-employment, but there were no differences between those with fully engaged and partially <b>engaged</b> <b>labour</b> market histories. Analyses of a subset of data on women who had a child between 1981 and 1991 showed that those who had returned to full-time paid work by 1991 were over 50 % less likely to later become caregivers. Some associations between employment characteristics and propensity to provide 20 or more hours per week of care were also identified. Those in public sector jobs and those previously in employment with a caregiving dimension were 20 – 30 % more likely than other working women to provide unpaid care. These results suggest a continuing gender dimension in care provision which interacts with marital status and employment in gender-specific ways. It also suggests that implementation of strategies to enable those in midlife to combine caregiving and work responsibilities, should they wish to do so, should be an urgent priority...|$|E

Research shows they are generally at increased risk of occupational injury and illness compared to permanent employees. It is proposed {{that one of the}} causal factors is the unique tripartite employment relationship used to <b>engage</b> <b>labour</b> hire. The dynamics and behaviours in this triangular relationship are discussed with reference to the legal and organisational uncertainty that it frequently presents. A model is proposed that suggests the occupational health and safety interdependence between the three parties. The potential occupational health and safety outcomes for the labour hire worker are examined. Apparent gaps in the existing literature are identified, along with future research opportunities...|$|R

It may be assumed that the main principle of the transformation will remain in peace, that the men following such occupations will have guaranteed weekly wages, and that this will lead in due course to the organization of regular {{work as well as}} of regular wages, with men working for a single employing agency or for groups of employers, in place of taking their chance with single employers at a number of separate taking-on places.
