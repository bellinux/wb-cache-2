25|$|When the {{amplification}} {{process is}} complete the laser light enters the experimental chamber, lying {{at one end}} of the building. Here it is reflected off a series of deformable mirrors that help correct remaining imperfections in the wavefront, and then feeds them into the target chamber from all angles. Since the overall distances from the ends of the beamlines to different points on the target chamber are different, delays are introduced on the individual paths to ensure they all reach the center of the chamber at the same time, within about 10picoseconds (ps). The target, a fusion <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet</b> about 1mm in diameter in the case of HiPER, lies at the center of the chamber.|$|E

2500|$|Research on Nova was {{focussed}} on {{the indirect}} drive approach, where the laser shine {{on the inside}} surface of a thin metal foil, typically made of gold, lead, or another high-z metal. When heated by the laser, the metal re-radiates this energy as diffuse x-rays, which are more efficient than UV at compressing the <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet.</b> In order to emit x-rays, the metal must be heated to very high temperatures, which uses up {{a considerable amount of}} the laser energy. So while the compression is more efficient, the overall energy delivered to the target is nevertheless much smaller. The reason for the x-ray conversion is not to improve energy delivery, but to [...] "smooth" [...] the energy profile; since the metal foil spreads out the heat somewhat, the anisotropies in the original laser are greatly reduced.|$|E

A three-year goal announced in 2009 to produce net energy from fusion by 2012 was missed; in September 2013, however, the facility announced a significant milestone from an August 2013 test that produced more energy from the fusion reaction than had been provided to the <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet.</b> This was reported as the first time this had been accomplished in fusion power research. The facility reported that their next step involved improving the system to prevent the hohlraum from either breaking up asymmetrically or too soon.|$|E
50|$|The {{nuclear fuel}} can swell during use, {{this is because}} of effects such as fission gas {{formation}} in the fuel and the damage which occurs to the lattice of the solid. The fission gases accumulate in the void that forms {{in the center of a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet</b> as burnup increases. As the void forms, the once-cylindrical pellet degrades into pieces. The swelling of the <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet</b> can cause pellet-cladding interaction when it thermally expands to the inside of the cladding tubing. The swollen <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet</b> imposes mechanical stresses upon the cladding. A document on the subject of the swelling of the fuel can be downloaded from the NASA web site.|$|E

50|$|PCIOMR {{is a set}} {{of rules}} and limits to prevent {{cladding}} damage due to pellet-clad interaction. During the first nuclear heatup, nuclear fuel pellets can crack. The jagged edges of the pellet can rub and interact with the inner cladding wall. During power increases in the <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet,</b> the ceramic fuel material expands faster than the fuel cladding, and the jagged edges of the <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet</b> begin to press into the cladding, potentially causing a perforation. To prevent this from occurring, two corrective actions were taken.

5000|$|Zirconium diboride {{is used in}} many {{boiling water}} reactor fuel {{assemblies}} due to its refractory nature, corrosion resistance, high-neutron-absorption cross-section of 759 barns, and stoichiometric boron content. Boron acts as a [...] "burnable" [...] neutron absorber because its two isotopes, 10B and 11B, both transmute into stable nuclear reaction products upon neutron absorption (4He + 7Li and 12C, respectively) and therefore act as sacrificial materials which protect other components which become more radioactive with exposure to thermal neutrons. However, the boron in ZrB2|ZrB2 must be enriched in 11B because the gaseous helium evolved by 10B strains the <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet</b> of UO2 creates a gap between coating and fuel, and increases the fuel's centerline temperature; such cladding materials have been used on the uranium oxide fuel pellets in Westinghouse AP-1000 nuclear reactors. The high thermal neutron absorbance of boron also has the secondary effect of biasing the neutron spectrum to higher energies, so the <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet</b> retains more radioactive 239Pu {{at the end of}} a fuel cycle. In addition to this deleterious effect of integrating a neutron absorber on the surface of a <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet,</b> boron coatings have the effect of creating a power density bulge in the middle of a nuclear reactor fuel cycle through the superposition of 235U depletion and faster burning of 11B. To help level out this bulge, ZrB2/Gd cermets are being studied which would extend fuel lifetime by superimposing three simultaneous degradation curves.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order for}} the laser energy applied to the <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet</b> to be nearly uniform and {{orthogonal}} {{to the surface of}} the pellet, the pellet needed to be aligned perfectly. The pellet needed to be placed in the focus point of both of the mirrors. This is achieved by “using a continuous wave YAG laser which is collinear with and is divergence-matched to main laser.” [...] Once the KMS Fusion team had the correct setup, they used small longitudinal displacements to apply the laser energy uniformly. The fuel pellets KMS Fusion used consisted of Deuterium or DT-filled glass pellets. The fuel gas diffused into the glass through heating under pressure. The gas is trapped in the pellet when it is cooled. After KMS Fusion started using government contracts for funding, they primarily became a <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet</b> fabrication facility. They perfected the method to producing fuel pellets to the point where they were able to produce them for less than a hundredth of a cent.|$|E

5000|$|In the oxide fuel, intense {{temperature}} gradients exist which cause fission products to migrate. The zirconium tends {{to move to}} the centre of the <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet</b> where the temperature is highest, while the lower-boiling fission products move {{to the edge of the}} pellet. The pellet is likely to contain lots of small bubble-like pores which form during use; the fission xenon migrates to these voids. Some of this xenon will then decay to form caesium, hence many of these bubbles contain a large concentration of 137Cs.|$|E
5000|$|Like NIF, LMJ {{intends to}} use the [...] "indirect drive" [...] approach, where the laser light is used to heat a high-Z {{cylinder}} made of some heavy metal (often gold) known as a [...] "hohlraum". The hohlraum then gives off x-rays, which are used to heat a small <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet</b> containing a deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion fuel. Although considerable laser energy is lost to heating the hohlraum, x-rays are much more efficient at heating the <b>fuel</b> <b>pellet,</b> making the indirect drive method applicable to nuclear weapons research. The x-rays rapidly heat the outer layer of the pellet so quickly that it explodes outward, causing {{the remainder of the}} pellet to be forced inward and causes a shock wave to travel in through the pellet to the middle. When the shock wave converges from all directions and meets in the middle, the density and temperature briefly reach the Lawson criterion and start fusion reactions. If the rate of reactions is high enough the heat generated by these reactions will be enough to cause surrounding fuel to fuse as well, this process continuing until the majority of the fuel in the pellet is consumed. This process is known as [...] "ignition", and has long been a goal of fusion researchers.|$|E
