40|$|Until recently, Europe was {{dominated}} by state-owned, vertically integrated railroads. Lately, European Union (EU) policies and relevant legislation have introduced the legal separation between railroad operations and infrastructure management. Thus, the railroad infrastructure management companies have started applying charges (termed access pricing) to railroad companies for using infrastructure. Although European policies and legislation set the basic access pricing principles, they did not provide specific rules or methods for deriving <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charging</b> systems. An access pricing system for suburban (commuter) rail services was developed. An overview of practices in EU member states and the United States is presented. The basic principles and economic characteristics of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charging</b> are outlined. The proposed structure of the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charging</b> system is discussed, with {{a distinction between the}} basic charge - which includes costs for train planning and line operations, infrastructure damage and wear and tear costs, and quality of services - and additional components. Each component is mathematically expressed. The proposed charging system does not include costs related to train operations. To test the robustness of the proposed system, it is applied to the suburban rail services provided by the Greek company AMEL, with trains running on the Greek railroads' infrastructure. The proposed <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charging</b> system can be applied to any railroad by changing the variable values...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether the imposition of developer <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges</b> on housing developers affects the price of residential land.

30|$|For example, {{consider}} the electric car as a focal offer {{in the electric}} car ecosystem. The complementarities between electric cars and the <b>charging</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> {{as well as between}} batteries and electric cars, are rather obvious. However, the structure of interdependence between batteries and electric cars is distinct from the structure of interdependence between electric cars and the <b>charging</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Batteries and electric cars are directly connected via a component-product upstream interaction whereas <b>charging</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and electric cars are indirectly connected via the downstream user interaction. Moreover, there are important interdependencies between batteries and <b>charging</b> <b>infrastructure</b> as well as between <b>charging</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and the electricity grid that are typically not revealed based on the analysis of complementarities. Improvements in batteries can enhance the contribution of the <b>charging</b> <b>infrastructure</b> towards an electric car’s value creation, and improvements in the <b>charging</b> <b>infrastructure</b> could hold back the contribution if the electricity grid is not optimized for increased usage especially during peak hours.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} negative effects from traffic {{it has been}} decided that <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges</b> in the European Union (EU) {{should be based on}} short run marginal costs. The Swedish Parliament has legislated that operators in the Swedish railway infrastructure must pay charges based on short run marginal social costs in order to mitigate externalities in railway infrastructure. Internalization of the social cost of noise is of particular interest, since it is the only environmental problem perceived as more troublesome today than in the early 1990 s. Inclusion of a noise component in rail <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges</b> raises two issues: (i) the monetary evaluation of noise abatement, since noise is a non-market good, and (ii) the estimation of the effect on the noise level that one extra train will create. Regarding the latter, we are interested in the marginal noise, since <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges</b> based on the short-run marginal cost principle should be based on the effect from the marginal train, not the noise level itself. Using already existing knowledge, this study shows {{that it is possible to}} implement a noise component in the rail <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges.</b> The values that are used today to estimate the social cost of noise exposure in cost benefit analysis can also be used to calculate the marginal cost.

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Urban Land Development) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. In 2004, the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) {{adopted a}} ???Preferred Growth Scenario??? to guide land use {{decisions}} and shape the region???s growth {{in a manner}} consistent with seven key principles. One of the principles was housing choice and diversity, which focused on providing an assortment of housing types, such as multi-family rental homes, attached condominiums and townhouses, and small single-family detached homes for a variety of household types, income levels, and ages. Using a residual land value calculation, my research tested whether development impact fees and other <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges</b> imposed on new development discourage the construction of multi-family condominiums (for sale) and apartments (for rent) in El Dorado Hills, Rancho Cordova, and Roseville, California. When landowners bear the incidence of the development impact fees and <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges,</b> both multi-family scenarios produced non-positive or inadequate land values in my three study jurisdictions. Shifting the incidence of the development impact fees and <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges</b> forward to the consumer in the form of higher housing prices and rental rates produced positive and acceptable land values under the condominium scenario, but the apartment scenario remained non-positive in each of my study areas. My research has revealed that jurisdictions charging impact fees on a flat fee basis by housing category may discourage the production of multi-family housing. To expand the supply of multi-family dwellings and other types of affordable housing, proportional-share or variable impact fees eliminate the regressive nature of a one-size-fits-all-approach by accounting for variations in product type, unit size, density, and number of bedrooms.

40|$|European {{railways}} {{have been}} immersed since the nineties in a restructuring process {{aimed at improving}} the effectiveness, quality and economic efficiency of the provision of railway services, as well as stimulating the growth of railway markets. This reform has involved a separation between infrastructure management and operation {{and the introduction of}} rail <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges</b> to regulate the use, by railway undertakings, of the infrastructure managed by infrastructure managers. Rail <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges</b> aim, in essence, at recovering costs. Nevertheless, they can have an influence on the usage of the infrastructure, especially in corridors where competition between modes exists. Therefore, special attention should be paid to their definition and amount to ensure that they do not counteract the important effort that the European Union is making to help finance and build a European high speed network aimed at strengthening railways and redressing modal share imbalances. In Europe, legislation requires transparent and non discriminatory rail access charges, based on the principles of short run marginal social cost although mark ups are permitted where necessary to meet financial requirements. However, it does not specify how these principles should be implemented. This dissertation has three main tasks. Firstly, it calculates the amount of rail infrastructure charge for European high speed lines/services based on the marginal cost. Secondly, it characterises the rail infrastructure charging systems applied to European high speed lines/services, in order to detect if mark ups above the marginal cost of wear and tear are being applied to those services and if so, how they are applied. Finally, it quantifies the impacts on traffic volumes and mode split resulting from bringing the current levels of rail <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges</b> (applied in the European high speed network) to the level of marginal cost of maintenance and renewals and to the optimal Ramsey mark up. According to the results obtained, current levels of rail <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges</b> implemented in Europe {{have a negative impact on}} the competitiveness of the high speed passenger services that run on the European railway network, particularly in the cases where the rail market share is currently low (below 80 - 85 %). Thus, mark ups would not have been imposed after careful consideration of their consequences on the market position of railway undertakings in the market segment in question...|$|E
40|$|Whilst {{there is}} a long {{tradition}} of economic analysis of charging for the use of road infrastructure, the situation relating to rail is quite different. In most cases until recently railways have been integrated organisations with the same body responsible for infrastructure and operations. Rail <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charging,</b> if practised at all, has therefore been largely an internal transfer within the organisation. The principal exception to this has been the presence of access rights by one company over infrastructure owned by another in the case of North America. But the dominance of integrated national rail companies in Europe, and the fact that international traffic was operated by cooperation between the national railways rather than by one railway operating over the tracks of another, made the issue of no relevance here. The change in this situation started with the separation of infrastructure from operations in Sweden, which was undertaken with the aim of putting rail infrastructure on an equivalent footing to road. Later on the European Commission began pushing for separation of infrastructure from operations in order to encourage new entry and to promote competition between different rail companies. <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>charging,</b> <b>infrastructure</b> financing, competition, market structure, railways...|$|R
