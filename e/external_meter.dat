The installation procedure is identical anywhere within the satellite service area {{and the use of}} circular polarization further simplifies the setup which permits to reduce the time and cost of the home installation. Although the installation could be done by some advanced users, it is recommended to contact a certified Tooway installer.Poor alignment of the dish system results in higher error rates and a lower broadband speed. The relatively unique transmission system of Turbo Code 8PSK used is not recognized with standard DVB-S or DVB-S2 installation meters.Horizon Global Electronics manufactures a Test and Measurement meter specifically designed to align the Tooway dish. HD-TC8 Applied Instruments also manufactures a Test and Measurement meter, the model Super Buddy 29, designed to align the Tooway dish.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if it was feasible to collect information regarding energy use and hot water delivery from tankless gas water heaters using the sensors and controls built into the water heaters. This could then be used to determine the water heater efficiency ? the ratio of energy out (hot water delivered) to energy in (energy in the gas) in actual residential installations. The goal was to be as unobtrusive as possible, and to avoid invalidating warranties or exposing researchers to liability issues. If feasible this approach would reduce the costs of instrumentation. This paper describes the limited field and laboratory investigations to determine if using the sensors and controls built into tankless water heaters is feasible for field monitoring. It was more complicated to use the existing gas flow, water and temperature sensors than was anticipated. To get the signals from the existing sensors and controls is difficult and may involve making changes that would invalidate manufacturer warrantees. The procedures and methods for using signals from the existing gas valves, water flow meters and temperature sensors will vary by model. To be able to monitor different models and brands would require detailed information about each model and brand. Based on these findings, we believe that for field monitoring projects it would be easier, quicker and safer to connect <b>external</b> <b>meters</b> to measure the same parameters rather than using the sensors and controls built into tankless water heaters...|$|R

However, inconsistent results for BMAA analysis have led to controversy.

We have investigated differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) as an ion filter to improve selectivity in the hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographic (HILIC) 2 ̆ 013 MS 2 ̆ 013 MS determination of BMAA. We obtained standards for two BMAA isomers not previously analyzed by HILIC 2 ̆ 013 MS, 3 ̆b 2 -amino-N-methylalanine and 3, 4 -diaminobutanoic acid, and the typically used 2, 4 -diaminobutanoic acid and N-(2 -aminoethyl) glycine.

The Canadian Prairie Agricultural Machinery Institute (P AMI) suggests a maximum {{coefficient of variation}} (CV) of 15 % among outlets for seeding grain or applying fertilizer. P AMI does not report down-the-row variability of individual outlets. Parameters that influence variability of volumetric measuring external fluted wheels such as rotational speed of the metering wheel, product delivery rate, seed size, and cell collection lengths were examined. In the first study, <b>external</b> fluted wheel <b>meters</b> on four grain drills were tested for seed delivery variability for wheat and soybeans, both among the metering outlets and down-the-row for individual meters. Tests on two additional drills, one an air drill {{and the other with}} <b>external</b> fluted <b>metering,</b> used two sizes of soybean seeds and two travel speeds. For wheat, down-the-row CV ranged from 12. 5 to 22. 5 % and the CV among metering units ranged from 12. 5 to 21 %. For soybeans, the CV ranged from 15. 5 to 41. 5 % with the air drill having the lower CV. A faster travel speed gave a lower CV for both drills metering soybeans. In a second study, when metering wheat, the seeding rate variability due to cell size and seeding rate were evaluated.

50|$|The Mamiya C {{series is}} a line of twin-lens reflex medium-format system cameras {{manufactured}} by Mamiya between 1956 and 1994. It was developed from the Mamiyaflex series of cameras built from 1949 to 1956. The Mamiya C series was initially aimed at the professional market, but some later models were intended for amateurs. Unlike most TLR cameras, the Mamiya C has interchangeable lenses. The upper and lower lenses come off as a unit, and are available in at least seven different focal lengths. The lower lens of each unit has an aperture diaphragm {{as well as a}} leaf shutter. A flash sync terminal is part of the lens unit, and the delay can be set to M or X mode. The camera has an interlocking baffle that enables lenses to be changed without exposing the film. Focusing is done via a bellows system on the front side of the camera. Early models had separate film advance and shutter cocking mechanisms; on later models the shutter was automatically cocked. There is no metering in the camera body, so an <b>external</b> light <b>meter</b> is necessary. Viewfinders with built-in meters were available as accessories with later models.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{escalation}} {{in power}} consumption of networking and communications equipment {{is of concern}} to technologists and environmentalists alike. Understanding how and when networking devices consume power is complicated by their lack of instrumentation. Furthermore, standard networking devices are not typically flexible enough to support experiments with new techniques for reducing power consumption. In this paper, we describe a set of extensions for Linux-based commodity switches that enable {{a wide range of}} power-aware experiments in laboratory testbeds. The extensions are based on the requirements for high fidelity in power measurement and in modulation of key subsystems. Our implementation includes two key capabilities: a flexible power consumption model and a traffic shaper that enable emulation {{of a wide range of}} power-aware hardware and protocols. To validate our power-awareness extension and demonstrate their capabilities and utility, we built a testbed composed of simple, Linux-based switches. First, we show that the most simple configuration of our emulation extensions report power consumption consistent with what can be measured with an <b>external</b> power <b>meter.</b> Next, we conduct a series of experiments on power consumption when bandwidth is scaled directly to performance demands.

Most of the energy study relies on either <b>external</b> power <b>meters</b> or power models, both of these two methods contain intrinsic drawbacks in their practical adoption and measuring accuracy. Fortunately, the advent of Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interfaces has promoted the power measurement ability into next level, with higher accuracy and finer time resolution. Therefore, we argue it is the exact time to conduct an in-depth evaluation of the existing architecture designs to understand their impact on system energy efficiency. In this paper, we leverage representative benchmark suites including serial and parallel workloads from diverse domains to evaluate the architecture features such as Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA), Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) and Turbo Boost. The energy is tracked at subcomponent level such as Central Processing Unit (CPU) cores, uncore components and Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) through exploiting the power measurement ability exposed by RAPL. The experiments reveal non-intuitive results: 1) the mismatch between local compute and remote memory node caused by NUMA effect not only generates dramatic power and energy surge but also deteriorates the energy efficiency significantly; 2) for multithreaded application such as the Princeton Application Repository for Shared-Memory Computers (PARSEC), most of the workloads benefit a notable increase of energy efficiency using SMT, with more than 40 % decline in average power consumption; 3) Turbo Boost is effective to accelerate the workload execution and further preserve the energy, however it may not be applicable on system with tight power budget...|$|R
