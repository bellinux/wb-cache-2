On 4 October, against her doctor's advice, she {{appeared}} at the Empire Music Hall in Edmonton, North London, where she sang [...] "I'm One of the Ruins That Cromwell Knocked About a Bit". [...] Her performance was weak, and she was unsteady on her feet, eventually falling over on stage. [...] Her erratic and brief performance proved hilarious for the audience, who thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> of the act. [...] A week later, while appearing at the Alhambra Theatre, she was taken ill on stage and was found later in her dressing room crippled with pain, complaining of stomach cramps.

[...] More than 50,000 people attended her funeral at Hampstead Cemetery on 12October 1922. [...] Lloyd was penniless {{at the time of her}} death and her estate, which was worth £7,334, helped to pay off debts that she and Dillon had incurred over the years.|$|E

It was, nonetheless, immensely popular with white audiences. He was summoned for a Royal Command Performance at Buckingham Palace and Robeson was befriended by MPs from the House of Commons. Show Boat continued for 350 performances and, as of 2001, it remained the Royal's most profitable venture. The Robesons bought a home in Hampstead.

Jannetty, believing that to be an insult to him challenged Shawn to a fight to which Shawn declined. Marty however, would not take no for answer and attacked Michaels which started the fight. Piper pulled the two apart, and Michaels passed out right after, and wouldn't come to until the next day. The story, told by Jannetty, reveals that police were called to the scene and arrested Jannetty. As they were arresting him though, Randy Savage stepped in and prevented him from going to jail by telling the police that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> of a storyline even though in reality he did not know the cause of the fight in the first place. Michaels almost quit the WWF over the incident, and Jannetty believes that this incident was one of the factors in the WWF's decision to break up The Rockers.|$|E
