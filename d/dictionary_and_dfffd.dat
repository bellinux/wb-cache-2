By introducing “Examine learning”, “Cooperative learning”, and “Gamification”, learners can create “My dictionary”, refer to others’ <b>dictionaries,</b> <b>and</b> write and evaluate comments. Using {{the information in}} “My dictionary”, like the number of registered words in “My dictionary” and comments written in others’ <b>dictionaries</b> <b>and</b> the evaluated points from others, the learners gain points {{as part of a}} cooperative game.

40|$|Abstract: Monolingual <b>and</b> bilingual <b>dictionaries</b> for {{learners}} of English {{as foreign}} language differ {{from each other}} in many aspects. Among the differences are the types of information a dic-tionary provides outside the A–Z word list, especially in its introductory matter. Yet, dictionary in-troductions have been referred to rather peripherally in the literature on <b>dictionary</b> users <b>and</b> uses. Within the context of lexicographic practice, this study aims to outline the differences between EFL learner's <b>dictionaries</b> <b>and</b> bilingual English–Arabic <b>dictionaries,</b> <b>and</b> to determine to what extent a given set of popular <b>dictionaries</b> provide varied <b>and</b> sufficient information in their introductions. Three categories of dictionaries will be the subject of comparison: EFL dictionaries, European bilin-gual <b>dictionaries,</b> <b>and</b> bilingual <b>dictionaries</b> in the Arab world...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{reproduction}} {{of culture in}} dictionaries constitutes {{one of the fundamental}} prob-lems of lexicographers today. What is the nature of cultural data in dictionaries? To what extent should cultural aspects be transferred from one language to another? How should this transfer take place? This article attempts to discuss the relevance of the {{reproduction of}} Gabonese cultural aspects in <b>dictionaries</b> in French <b>and</b> the Gabonese languages. One of the main problems the compilers of these dictionaries encountered was the transfer and the translation of some cultural aspects. In order to discuss {{the nature and extent of}} cultural information in Gabonese dictionaries, this article will restrict itself to the following points: — The translation of different realities — The role of culture in the change of meaning — <b>Dictionaries</b> <b>and</b> cultural activities — <b>Dictionaries</b> <b>and</b> cultural ethics — <b>Dictionaries</b> <b>and</b> language registers — <b>Dictionaries</b> <b>and</b> culture maintenanc...|$|R
