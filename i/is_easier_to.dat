5|$|Many guitar picks {{employ the}} Reuleaux triangle, as its shape {{combines}} a sharp point to provide strong articulation, {{with a wide}} tip to produce a warm timbre.

5|$|Two {{protactinium}} oxides were obtained: PaO2 (black) and Pa2O5(white); {{the former}} is isomorphic with ThO2 and the latter <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> obtain. Both oxides are basic, and Pa(OH)5 is a weak, poorly soluble base.|$|E

On average, the students agreed that they enjoyed learning physics with haptic devices, haptic devices <b>were</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> use and the force feedback <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interpreted. Also, they unanimously disagreed that interacting with haptic devices or interpreting force feedback required a lot of mental effort.|$|R

2500|$|As well, rental {{systems for}} non-professionals need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> use and set up, {{and they must}} <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> repair and {{maintain}} for the renting company. From this perspective, speaker cabinets need to have easy-to-access horns, speakers, and crossover circuitry, so that repairs or replacements can be made. [...] Some rental companies often rent powered amplifier-mixers, mixers with onboard effects, and powered subwoofers for use by non-professionals, which <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> set up and use.|$|R
5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E
5|$|As {{they read}} the end, Joan of Arc is being burnt at the stake, still waiting for God to save her (the real Joan had said several days earlier that her voices had spoken to her of martyrdom). Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death. Marge then interrupts, {{claiming}} that Joan of Arc was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship. She then rips out the last page and eats it, remarking that it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> chew than the video of Bambi.|$|E
5|$|As {{they share}} many {{cross-platform}} games and {{compete for the}} same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce, and analysts expect that a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> develop for.|$|E

5|$|Depending {{on their}} feeding habits, {{termites}} are placed into two groups: the lower termites and higher termites. The lower termites predominately feed on wood. As wood {{is difficult to}} digest, termites prefer to consume fungus-infected wood because it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> digest and the fungi are high in protein. Meanwhile, the higher termites consume {{a wide variety of}} materials, including faeces, humus, grass, leaves and roots. The gut in the lower termites contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa, while the higher termites only have a few species of bacteria with no protozoa.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{radio in}} the United Kingdom is being {{promoted}} by radio stations and the broadcasting industry {{on the premise that}} it provides superior quality sound over AM, a wider choice of radio stations, <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> use, and is resistant to the interference which other broadcast media are susceptible to. On the other hand critics say that coverage is not yet sufficient and the quality can be less than that of FM.|$|E
5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much more so than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E

His designs and name underwent {{major changes in the}} making of his final one which also was modified in later arcs to give Gaara a design that <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> draw. In the Japanese version of the series, Gaara is voiced by Akira Ishida while Liam O'Brien replaces him in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|The Koch {{index is}} the ratio between peak {{steering}} torque {{and the product}} of peak lean rate and forward speed.

It <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> maneuver light scooters than heavy motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air. He must also account for {{the height of the}} ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there exist}} {{polynomial}} time algorithms {{to find a}} matrix having given row and column sums, the solution may be far from unique: any submatrix {{in the form of}} a 22 identity matrix can be complemented without affecting the correctness of the solution. Therefore, researchers have searched for constraints on the shape to be reconstructed that can be used to restrict the space of solutions. For instance, one might assume that the shape is connected; however, testing whether there exists a connected solution is NP-complete. An even more constrained version that <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> solve is that the shape is orthogonally convex: having a single contiguous block of squares in each row and column.|$|E
5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E
