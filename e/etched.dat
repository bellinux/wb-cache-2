40|$|Patterning the group-IH {{nitrides}} {{has been}} challenging {{due to their}} strong bond energies and relatively inert chemical nature as compared to other compound semiconductors. Plasma <b>etch</b> processes have been used almost exclusively to pattern these films. The use of high-density plasma <b>etch</b> systems, including inductively coupled plasmas (ICP), has resulted in relatively high <b>etch</b> rates (often greater than 1. 0 pmhnin) with anisotropic profiles and smooth <b>etch</b> morphologies. However, the <b>etch</b> mechanism is often dominated by high ion bombardment energies which can minimize <b>etch</b> selectivity. The use of an ICP-generated BCl~/C 12 pkyma has yielded a highly versatile GaN <b>etch</b> process with rates ranging from 100 to 8000 A/rnin making this plasma chemistry a prime candidate for optimization of <b>etch</b> selectivity. In this study, we will report ICP <b>etch</b> rates and selectivities for GaN, AIN, and InN {{as a function of}} BCl~/Clz flow ratios, cathode rf-power, and ICP-source power. GaN:InN and GaN:AIN <b>etch</b> selectivities were typically less than 7 : 1 and showed the strongest dependence on flow ratio.
