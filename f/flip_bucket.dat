40|$|Abstract: <b>Flip</b> <b>buckets</b> are {{terminal}} spillway elements, generating free jets {{for energy}} dissipation. Deflectors are {{an alternative to}} <b>flip</b> <b>buckets</b> with constructional ease yet of similar hydraulic features. A first experimental study published at the 33 rd IAHR Congress, Vancouver, investigated deflectorgenerated jets {{in terms of their}} air concentration characteristics. For jet impact onto a movable bed, the scour potential reduces as the jet air content increases. It was demonstrated that the jet air concentration development is a function of its relative black-water core length, depending on the approach flow parameters and the deflector geometry. Jet-generating structures are located at the end of spillways, where high-speed flow with considerable air transport prevails, affecting the jet parameters, such that additional experiments were conducted involving pre-aerated approach flow. The effect of pre-aeration on the air concentration development of deflector-generated jets is discussed and compared with un-aerated approach flow...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHydraulic model {{tests of}} the {{spillway}} of Yukarı Kaleköy Dam and Hydroelectric Power Plant (HPP) were carried out at Hydromechanics Laboratory of Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara. In order to investigate the flow conditions in the approach channel, over the weir structure, around the spillway piers, along the spillway chute channels and after the <b>flip</b> <b>buckets,</b> and also to observe {{the performance of the}} aeration devices, a model of 1 / 70 length scale was constructed. The model area covers an about 400 m × 450 m section of the Yukarı Kaleköy reservoir, the whole spillway structure and a part of the river area of about 150 m × 200 m downstream of the <b>flip</b> <b>buckets.</b> Experiments were carried out at various discharges; QPMF, Q 1000 and Q 100 with fully open radial gates as well as with partly open radial gates at Q 1000. Flow depths, pressure heads of the flows along the spillway structure were measured, cavitation indexes and air concentrations of the flows were determined. From the observations and experimental results, it was concluded that the flow conditions in the approach channel of the spillway, over the weir structure, around the spillway piers, along and after the <b>flip</b> <b>buckets</b> are quite good from the hydraulics point of view. However, the flows were not sufficiently aerated in the spillway chutes, in Channels I and II, after the available aerators presented in the original design of the spillway. After the experiments conducted on the “original model” it was decided that some modifications should be done. In order to improve the performance of the available aerators, the heights of the aerator deflectors were increased by 0. 20 m by keeping their lengths in the flow direction almost as before...|$|R

Usually, so-called <b>flip</b> <b>buckets</b> or ski jumps are provided to generate jets, yet they are rarely issued by deflectors. The application of a theoretical mass point parabola is limited to predict the jet features, because effects related to the take-off angle and the disintegration process affect the jet air transport and trajectories. This research discusses the effect of pre-aeration of the approach chute flow on the jet features. A comparison with a former study indicates that mainly the upper jet portion is affected, that the black water jet core becomes shorter, and that the air transport increases. Although the lower trajectory is less affected and thus remains more coherent, the small effect of pre-aeration is sufficient to reduce the total jet throw length, so that pre-aerated jets tend to be shorter as compared with black-water approach flow jets, in agreement with prototype observations...|$|R

40|$|Risk and {{reliability}} analysis is presently being performed {{in almost all}} fields of engineering depending upon the specific field and its particular area. Probabilistic risk analysis (PRA), also called quantitative risk analysis (QRA) is a central feature of hydraulic engineering structural design. Actually, probabilistic methods, which consider resistance and load parameters as random variables, are more suitable than conventional deterministic methods to determine the safety level of a hydraulic structure. In fact, hydraulic variables involved in hydraulic structures, such as discharge, flow depth and velocity, are stochastic in nature, which maybe represented by relevant probability distributions. Therefore, the optimal design of hydraulic structures needs to be modelled by probabilistic methods. Reliability analysis methods are being adopted for use to develop risk management programs. Implementing the programs will ensure that safety is maintained to a robust and acceptable level. Any simple reliability analysis should include the following steps: The main work carried out relates to three different subjects in the general area of dam structures failure. These included the probabilistic methods work on: o Geometry of plunge pool downstream of <b>flip</b> <b>bucket</b> spillway o Evaluation of superelevation in open channel bends o Hydrodynamic loading on buildings by floods 1. Geometry of plunge pool downstream of <b>flip</b> <b>bucket</b> spillway Extreme scouring can gradually undermine the foundations of structures such as spillway and body dams and the areas downstream of dams. Extensive plunge pools downstream of <b>flip</b> <b>bucket</b> spillway structures, which are caused by jets of different configurations, form an important field of research. The plunge pool mechanism is more complex because of difficulties arising from the modelling of bed rock and sediment load flow {{in and around the}} scour hole caused by the jet effect of the flow downstream of <b>flip</b> <b>bucket</b> spillway. The experimental study of plunge pool has been limited to the consideration of variables involved in the plunge pool geometry. The reliability-based assessment of the geometry of the plunge pool downstream of a <b>flip</b> <b>bucket</b> spillway. Experimental data obtained from a model of a <b>flip</b> <b>bucket</b> spillway has been used to develop a number of equations for the prediction of scour geometry downstream from a <b>flip</b> <b>bucket</b> spillway of a large dam structure. The accuracy of the developed equations was examined both through statistical and experimental procedures with satisfactory results. 2. Evaluation of superelevation in open channel bends The so-called centrifugal force caused by flow around a curve results in a rise in the water surface at the outside wall and a depression of the surface along the inside wall. This phenomenon is called superelevation. The problems associated with flow through open channel bends deserve special attention in hydraulic engineering. Water surface slopes have been frequently reported to be a function of the curvature. But due to the difficulties in operation, the theoretical basis of superelevation has been discussed in depth in the literature. Furthermore, experience indicates that existing theory does not lead to good results at the present status. Superelevation in the Ziaran Flume (Iran) has led to severe erosion of the bank and has undermined the structure. Therefore, this study aims to cast light on the cause of overtopping by superelevation. By means of direct observation on the flume’s hydraulic performance, during full discharge, and from generalization of the field data, a more reliable prediction method of the magnitude of superelevation has become possible. The probabilistic analysis is shown to have several advantages in comparison with deterministic analysis methods. 3. Hydrodynamic loadings on buildings by floods Assessing the vulnerability of buildings in flood-prone areas is a key issue when evaluating the risk induced by flood events, particularly because of its proved direct influence on the loss of life during catastrophes. Hydrodynamic loads are caused by water flowing along, against and around a structural element or system. Hydrodynamic loads are basically of the lateral type and are related to direct impulsive loads by the moving mass of water, and to drag forces as the water flows around the obstruction. Where application of hydrodynamic loads is required, the loads shall be calculated or estimated by recognized engineering and reliable methods. A comprehensive methodology for risk assessment of buildings subjected to flooding is nevertheless still missing. A new set of experiments has been performed in this thesis with the aim of shedding more light on dynamics of flood induced loads and their effects on buildings with state of the art benchmarks. In this research, an overview is given of flood induced load on buildings, the new experimental work is then presented, together with results from preliminary analysis. Initial results suggest that use of existing prediction methods might be unsafe and that impulsive loading might be critical for both the assessment of the vulnerability of existing structures and the design of new flood-proof buildings. The research presented in this thesis is focused on developing and applying probabilistic design, safety, system reliability and risk based design in the field of hydraulic structures design in the open channel bends, plunge pool downstream of <b>flip</b> <b>bucket</b> spillway and dam break analysis. Probabilistic design approach is a powerful tool in reliability assessment of civil hydraulic engineering. Uncertainty and risk are central features of hydraulic engineering. Hydraulic design is subject to uncertainties due to the randomness of natural phenomena, data sample limitations and errors, modelling reliability and operational variability. Uncertainties can be measured in terms of the probability density function, confidence interval, or statistical moment such as standard deviation or coefficient of variation of the stochastic parameters. Outcomes from this thesis are beneficial to the design of hydraulic structures in many ways; not only minimizing cost, but also educating and providing valuable knowledge for structural operators. Probabilistic methods {{and reliability}} analysis can increase the quality and value of the achievements compared to traditional dam engineering approaches. Since the goal is to avoid the dam failures by reducing risk to almost zero with optimum cost, dam safety risk analysis has a key role in modern dam safety programs. It is hoped that illustrations provided in this thesis are applicable to other civil engineering structures of similar concerns. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
