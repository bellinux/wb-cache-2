The demand for transportation is incorporated into the equilibrium conditions of the household, and in turn the equilibrium conditions of the household are incorporated into the existing models of market equilibrium. The resulting relations are used to verify {{the characteristics of the}} prices of housing, rents, velocity, transportation costs, and densities. The implications of the model are consistent with the exponential form of the velocity function observed empirically by Angel and Hyman (1970).

Network administrators have a well-founded aversion to complexity, {{in part because they}} experience failures attributable to design complexity on a regular basis. I argue that IP multicast defines a functional limit-case for deployable complexity in today’s Internet. That limit is relevant to the deployment of QoS, since many flavors of QoS entail equal or greater complexity. The notion of a functional constraint on complexity draws attention to the economic, historical, and institutional forces which influence the fate of networking technologies.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{merits of}} market forces compared with regulations {{as the more}} efficient mechanism for ensuring adequate accountability from business (and non-business) organizations is a subject of keen debate. Britain {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century is regularly cited as an example of how the market will ensure adequate accountability in the absence of regulatory requirements. There is a great deal of speculation but very little hard evidence concerning the precise levels of accountability during this period. This study is designed to penetrate contemporary attitudes and actions by using primary sources to determine the audit arrangements made by quoted companies in the year 1886.

40|$|The Hamiltonian {{dynamics}} of 2 + 1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(2) is reformulated in gauge invariant, geometric variables, as in earlier {{work on the}} 3 + 1 dimensional case. Physical states in electric field representation have the product form Ψ_phys [E^a i] = (i Ω [E] / g) F [G_ij], where the phase factor is a simple local functional required to satisfy the Gauss law constraint, and G_ij is a dynamical metric tensor which is bilinear in E^a k. The Hamiltonian acting on F [G_ij] is local, but the energy density is infinite for degenerate configurations where G (x) vanishes at points in space, so wave functionals must be specially constrained to avoid infinite total energy. Study of this situation leads to the further factorization F [G_ij] = F_c [G_ij] R [G_ij], and the product Ψ_c [E] ≡ (i Ω [E] / g) F_c [G_ij] is shown to be the wave functional of a topological field theory.

It {{is possible that}} they possessed long-lived accretion disks in their T Tauri phase. Magnetic coupling of disk and star leads to rotational braking at {{the surface of the}} star. Microscopic viscosities are extremely small and {{will not be able to}} reduce the rotation rate of the core of the star. We investigate the question whether magneto-rotational instability can provide turbulent angular momentum transport. We <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> whether or not differential rotation is present in CP stars. Numerical MHD simulations of thick stellar shells are performed. An initial differential rotation law is subject to the influence of a magnetic field. The configuration gives indeed rise to magneto-rotational instability. The emerging flows and magnetic fields transport efficiently angular momentum outwards. Weak dependence on the magnetic Prandtl number (~ 0. 01 in stars) is found from the simulations. Since the estimated time-scale of decay of differential rotation is 10 ^ 7 - 10 ^ 8 yr and comparable to the life-time of A stars, we find the braking of the core to be an ongoing process in many CP stars. The evolution of the surface rotation of CP stars with age will be an observational challenge and of much value for verifying the simulations.

The {{first part of the}} article analyses the consequences {{of difference}} in one particularly compelling research encounter where accusations of racism damaged the research relationship. The author argues that we need to examine the researcher-researched relationship in detail and investigate the recognition of difference that structures this relationship in order to analyse material drawn from research. The second part of the article shows how this may be done within a particular social psychological perspective - that of the theory of social representations. This enables an exploration into the relationship between what is said, who said it and to whom, or, in other words, an analysis of the relationship between representations emerging and identities being played out in the research context. The value of this approach is illustrated by studying an example from the author's own research. The final part of the article demonstrates that difference in the researcher-researched relationship is not simply a problem of methodology but needs to be analysed as a feature of human relations.

40|$|This article looks {{closely at}} an {{argument}} {{that took place in}} the 1940 s between the Romanian Surrealists Gherasim Luca and Gellu Naum. This argument centered on the question of whether love can ever act as a transformative social force, or whether it is too fatally embedded within the existing social situation ever to work in this way. In the 40 s Luca had just published a series of texts laying out his “anti-oedipal” theory of love and revolutionary action, and Naum responded to this with his sharply critical “Inventatorii banderolei” (The Inventors of the Banderole), which to my knowledge has never been translated into English or French. I argue that what was really at stake in their argument is despair: Naum’s claim that Luca has misunderstood crucial elements of Surrealist and Marxist thought ultimately resolves into an accusation that Luca has yielded to despair and resignation. Luca, for his part, accuses Naum of the same thing. I show how, despite the fact that they were actually in agreement on many points, each believes that the other has prematurely given up the revolutionary struggle as well as his faith in the transformative power of love as a result of mistaken and pessimistic views about the relationship between the individual and society. In the first part of the article I outline Luca’s anti-Oedipal ars vivendi and trace corresponding attitudes in Naum’s work. In the second part of the article I examine in detail one of Naum’s allegations in “Inventatorii banderolei”: that Luca’s despair is due to his misuse of the Hegelian and Marxist concept of the “negation of negation. ” I show how Luca has not misused but has deeply engaged with this concept, partly through his ideas about “dialectical despair. ” Finally, I show how these ideas <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of love outlined at the beginning...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Ethnicity {{has been}} a focus of socio-scientific {{research}} {{for at least three}} decades, but for the greater part of that period it has been virtually ignored by archaeologists. As a result, many researchers remain committed to an essentialist approach to ethnicity. The reluctance to respond to such views by taking up more explicitly the dynamic and situational approaches to identity, as is currently underway in anthropology and sociology, arise from several sources, which undeniably also include the political. Ultimately, though, the essential reason is practical. The literature demonstrates that ethnicity and ethnic identity are slippery concerns in contemporary societies, let alone in pre-historic social contexts. Rock art presents an opportunity for assessing assumptions about identityconsciousness. It provides a category of material culture for the establishment of historical and chronological records of multi-cultural interaction and ensuing episodes of adaptation and change. Engraved art is a source of information on past societies, subsistence strategies and, most importantly, on the development of cohesive social systems and social consciousness. Artwork is the most obvious example of symbolic storage outside the human mind, yet it is not universally practised by huntergatherers and it cannot therefore be used as the sole criterion for recognising modern symbolism, modern behaviour, and ethnicity. Given this ambiguity with regards the function of rock art in the demarcation of territorial boundaries and in the construction of social and ethnic identities, an exploration of additional spheres of ethnic conception and assertion may <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of how San huntergatherers conceived and conveyed their respective identities. This investigation into the association between art and ethnicity is founded upon the conviction that the complexity of social identity must be explored on a dynamic continuum that allows for interface between varied social factors. Notions concerning the ethnic orientation of social groups are represented, either unconsciously or purposefully, in socio-cultural spheres as diverse as territoriality, subsistence economy, language, religion, and also aesthetic and artistic cultural patterns. This study of the relationship between conceptions of identity and engraved art aspires to augment the existing understanding of the origins of processes of identity-formation, how such processes operate, and how they may be manifest in material cultural contexts...|$|E

Författare: Moritz Gombert Termin: Påbyggnadskursen, vårterminen 2007 Abstract: Blogging {{has become}} a global mass {{phenomenon}} with a currently estimated total number of 70 million registered weblogs worldwide. The development of free blog software has tremendously lowered the barriers for mass amateur publishing. This study seeks to investigate the blogging phenomenon. Critiques refer to blogging as a collaborative form of navel gazing with little use to anyone but the self-important author. Others consider blogging an upcoming democratic mass movement of citizen involvement {{that has the potential}} to create a more egalitarian form of mass communication. This study comes {{to the conclusion that the}} average blogger is motivated to blog by less spectacular and rather mundane social reasons. As a matter of fact the analysis has often suggested the existence of parallels between blogging and offline forms of social interaction. Most of the recent discussion about blogging is focused on the so-called “A-list”. The A-list is a common term used to refer to the most popular weblogs. However the overwhelming majority of blogs are written by the average citizen. From the recently estimated 70 million weblogs worldwide only very few make it on the A-list. It is the private journal blog that represents the essential backbone of the blogosphere. This thesis seeks to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of why people maintain weblogs. It is thereby focused on less frequently visited weblogs written by average citizens in journal style. Concerning methodology this thesis employs a qualitative research approach based upon online interviews that were conducted in German speaking countries. Both primary research and secondary research were used in order to illuminate the research subject. The former type of research is embodied by eight qualitative online interviews while the latter type is represented by the technical literature. The results of the interviews were analyzed in the context of the literature research’s findings. The analysis brought to light that bloggers are neither self-important narcissists nor does blogging represent a global movement of democratic self-expression. Rather blogging is motivated by diverse social motives that are rather mundane and unspectacular. For instance, some bloggers used their blogs for emotional relieve while others engaged with blogging to meet new friends or to work on issues of identity. Most of the time community feelings were only described as relevant in cases where the blogger was interacting with his or her “community“...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{ability to}} work collaboratively with others is {{becoming}} {{an essential component of}} contemporary school reform. This article reviews current trends in school reform that embody collaborative principles and also draws on the literature to provide a theoretical overview of collaboration itself. The article then outlines the findings from a qualitative, self-contained focus group study that involved 16 individuals (parents, teachers, and administrators) who were selected using a purposeful sampling technique. According to Patton (1990), “the purpose of purposeful sampling is to select information rich cases whose study will <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> under study ” (p. 169). Accordingly, because of their experience in collaborative school improvement activities, the participants were able to assist the researcher in addressing <b>the</b> general research <b>question,</b> what are <b>the</b> understandings, skills, and attitudes held by participants in school improvement initiatives that result in successful collaboration. This study allowed the essential nature of collaboration to show itself and speak for itself through participants’ descriptions of their experiences. The findings are presented within a graphic conceptualization that not only represents the large number of issues that participants identified in their collaborations, but also demonstrates the complexity of the interrelations between these issues and school improvement. The model provides a framework for thinking about the school improvement process that is anchored in collaboration...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{involved}} a psychometric investigation of several dysfunctional processes {{that have been}} widely hypothesized to mediate psychological disturbance and change in CBT. They included dysfunctional attitudes, poor self-esteem, thought suppression, difficulty identifying and describing emotions, ineffective problem orientation and experiential avoidance. Much has already been written about these dysfunctional process variables and previous research provides evidence that they each significantly influence emotional wellbeing {{across a variety of}} populations and contexts. However, to date these variables have largely been studied in isolation and often in competing fields of research. This has resulted in major gaps in current understanding of the mechanisms of disturbance and change. It has also raised uncertainty as to whether the hypothesized mediators are actually separate constructs or whether they may be redundant. The present thesis brought together the dysfunctional process variables to explore the extent of their convergence and distinction. It also examined {{the degree to which they}} uniquely predict variance in emotional wellbeing. Measures of dysfunctional processes and emotional wellbeing were completed by two groups of participants, undergraduate psychology students and NSW police recruits. Study One {{involved a}}n exploratory factor analysis of the dysfunctional processes using the student data. It produced a preliminary model of the structure of the dysfunctional process measures that indicated that the measures were largely related and yet minimally redundant. Study Two entailed a confirmatory factor analysis involving structural equation modelling and multiple stepwise regression analyses. It explored the replicability of the initial model using the police data set. It also examined whether the initial model was optimal, by exploring the fit of alternative models on both the student and police data sets. Study Two produced a more parsimonious model of the latent structure of the dysfunctional process variables than the initial model. This model, named The Brief Dysfunctional Processes Measure was unexpectedly brief despite its scope. It consisted of six dysfunctional process variables, namely Dysfunctional Achievement Concerns, Poor Self-Esteem, Thought Avoidance, Difficulty Identifying Emotions, Avoidant Problem Orientation and Experiential Avoidance. These were linked by an overarching factor, Negative Avoidant Dysfunctional Processes. Study Two went on to explore the predictive relationships between variables in The Brief Dysfunctional Processes Measure with aspects of emotional wellbeing. It demonstrated that all dysfunctional process variables significantly contributed to predicting some aspects of emotional wellbeing even after controlling for gender and age. There was some variation in the pattern of predictors across samples and across the measures of emotional wellbeing. However, three variables were notably consistent and pervasive predictors. These were Experiential Avoidance, Avoidant Problem Orientation and Difficult Identifying Emotions. The results of this investigation reveal that the dysfunctional process variables appear related yet largely distinct. Moreover, the variables in The Brief Dysfunctional Processes Measure predict unique variance in wellbeing. These findings point to the value of synthesizing existing research on the hypothesized mediators. This stands to increase understanding of their interrelationships, and may ultimately help <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of‘what works’ in psychotherapy interventions...|$|E
40|$|M. A. According to Edmonds and Wilcocks (1995 : 1 - 2), South Africa is in {{the grip}} of a major drug boom. If this is not taken seriously, South Africa could lose as much as 30 % of its future {{generation}} in terms of health, happiness, functioning and even life. Drug abuse is an important factor that can affect the quality of life of not only the drug abuser, but also all those connected with them (Edmonds and Wilcocks, 1995 : 1 - 2). Substance abuse is a problem that influences the family system. Models such as Bell and Khantzian (1991) and Cooks' (1988) description of the Minnesota model define substance abuse as a disease. This model also known as the medical model, can be attributed to the work of Jellinek (1960). It focuses on individual biological factors with little consideration for familial, social or psychological variables. On the other hand, a family systems perspective indicates that the family system enables the substance abuser towards abusive patterns of behaviour. The family plays an important role in the process of dependency as well as in the rehabilitation process. These models are brought together in the study, as this combination is valuable in understanding the complexity of substance abuse and its effects on the family system. The aim of the study is to explore the families understanding of substance abuse and their role in the treatment process. A qualitative methodology is used to understand the life events, experiences and beliefs of family members, from their point of view. The focus of the research is on family members who have attended the family program at Stepping Stones Rehabilitation Center. Exploring the understanding they have of substance abuse and their role in the treatment process, from their frame of reference. The theoretical basis for the study is formulated within the medical model and a systems perspective. A nonprobability, purposive sample is utilized to seek information rich cases. Eleven respondents are interviewed. Different members within the family system are selected to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> under investigation. An interview schedule formulated from literature, is utilized to create consistency in the face-to-face interviews. The in depth interviews facilitate exploration. Data is gathered by means of a literature review, field notes and audiotapes transcribed by the researcher. Analysis of the data is done manually according to a schedule. The schedule I developed according to coding categories that are identified when working with raw data. The information from the data gathered is analysed and used to identify themes, which are offered as results. An extensive literature control is conducted, in order to further the validity of the research. From the study, methodological and theoretical conclusions can be made. Methodological conclusions indicate the effectiveness of using a qualitative methodology and face-to-face interviews in exploring the question under study. The theoretical conclusions indicate families understanding of substance abuse and their role in the treatment process. Recommendations in terms of intervention with families affected by substance abuse and future research, are drawn from the research process and context of the study ensure the link between results and conclusions and aims and objectives. The research indicates that families have an intellectual understanding of the disease concept of substance abuse. Their searching for alternative solutions and use of defence mechanisms, indicate that this concept has not been internalized.

If this sounds illegitimate or unfeasible, I suggest that it is so because of certain problems in our understanding of ‘colonialism’ and ‘culture’, and that these could be resolved particularly by reflecting further on several histories. My suggestion then is to work to create what I call a postcolonial context, defined by the attempt to minimize the dichotomy between the scholar as subject and her non-scholarly, indeed, unschooled, subjects of study...|$|R

I will do this in reference to the work of Bernard Stiegler and Jacques Derrida, amongst others. While neither Derrida nor Stiegler talk at any length about the face or about cosmetics, their writings on the archive, temporality, and technology as “tertiary memory,” <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> that revolve around the anti-aging industry’s relation to time and the face, in a particularly appropriate manner. With reference to these writings, I will argue that cosmetic anti-aging technologies – frequently understood and marketed as “cosmeceuticals” – constitute the face as an archive {{at the same time that}} they work to limit the functioning of the face as an archive. This constitution of the face as archive occurs in the context of the beauty industry and social expectations about gender, youth and beauty; in the context of medical and technological developments related to the anti-aging industry; and in relation to real-time tele-technologies and the technologies of memory, which are intrinsically related to temporality and archivization. In an era characterized by, on the one hand, a massive industry of anti-aging biomedical and cosmetic interventions into the effects of time and aging on the human body, and on the other, by the profusion of digital echnologies of real-time reportage and recording and information storage and retrieval, and by the concomitant “crises” of format obsolescence and archival preservation brought about by the speed of development and dissemination of such technologies, cosmeceuticals, ironically, preserve the face by not preserving it...|$|R

In this paper, we use formal mathematics to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> general <b>question</b> of what kinds of syntax extensions can be supported without introducing various forms of undesirable parsing behavior into the language. We define a parser as a function that maps each source string, finite set of CFG rules, and start symbol {{to a set of}} syntax trees (usually, a null set or singleton set); and construct well-behavedness criteria for parsers by considering how the behavior of a parser on one set of rules relates to its behavior on other, slightly different sets of rules. Among the results obtained are that there is a unique largest well-behaved completeness property supporting a universal parser, and that whether an ar- bitrary grammar satisfies this property is formally undecidable...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{proposed}} research is to investigate {{the effects of the}} food subsidy offered through the public distribution system (PDS) on childhood malnutrition in India. This has not been done before. It is of immediate policy interest both with respect to the unusually high incidence of malnutrition in India and with respect to the current re-shaping of the PDS. For this, we use a recent household survey that contains information on grain bought on the PDS and on the open market, anthropometric indicators for child health and a rich set of socioeconomic and demographic variables pertaining to rural households in India in the mid- 1990 s. In the course of addressing <b>the</b> main <b>question,</b> our research will <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> following <b>questions.</b> First, there is the interesting and difficult <b>question</b> of estimating <b>the</b> counterfactual: Do users of the PDS buy more food than they would if they did not face 13 - 2 a subsidy? How much more? Second is <b>the</b> often neglected <b>question</b> of inequalities in the within-household distribution of food. This chapter investigates whether there are gender inequalities in the gains accruing to a household on account of a food subsidy. Third, there is <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of how health is produced and, in particular, what the contribution of food expenditure is. ...|$|R
40|$|Although tyre/road noise {{has been}} a {{research}} subject {{for more than three}} decades, there is still no consensus in the literature as to which waves on a tyre are mainly responsible for the radiation of sound during rolling. Even the free vibrational behaviour of a stationary (non-rotating) tyre, not in contact with the ground, is still not well understood in the mid- and high-frequency ranges. Thus, gaining an improved understanding of this behaviour is a natural first step towards <b>illuminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of which waves on a rolling tyre contribute to sound radiation. This is the topic of the present paper, in which a model based on the waveguide finite element method (WFEM) is used to study free wave propagation, on a stationary tyre, in the range 0 - 1500 Hz. In the low-frequency region (0 - 300 Hz), wave propagation is found to be rather straightforward, with two main wave-types present. Both have cross-section modes involving a nearly rigid motion of the belt. For higher frequencies (300 - 1500 Hz) the behaviour is more complex, including phenomena such as 'curve veering' and waves for which the phase speed and group speed have opposite signs. Wave-types identified in this region include (i) waves involving mainly sidewall deformation, (ii) belt bending waves, (iii) a wave with significant extensional deformation of the central belt region and (iv) a wave with a 'breathing' cross-section mode. The phase speed corresponding to found waves is computed and their radiation efficiency is discussed, assuming free-field conditions. In a future publication, the tyre model will be used in conjunction with a contact model and a radiation model to investigate the contribution of these waves to radiated sound during rolling.

30|$|Finally {{the results}} of this paper speak to some of the issues raised by Lich-Tyler (2003) and Clark and Kanbur (2004), respectively. Specifically they show both the {{increasing}} importance of preference-based matching when incomes are higher and the increasing possibility of mismatch when household public goods are relatively more important. The first follows from a de-emphasis on home production in favor of purchasing household goods as incomes rise. Since the specialization motive for matching to a spouse becomes less pronounced, it becomes increasingly important to agree with one’s spouse in terms of shared consumption preferences. The second comes from spousal sorting that emphasizes the distributions of tastes among the two sexes. If the distributions do not overlap sufficiently, the outer tails of the two groups get matched together in Clark and Kanbur’s model, i.e., couples with opposing preferences. These heterogeneous couples are marginally matched and vulnerable to separation. A specification including an interaction between the distance measures and household income may <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> first <b>question,</b> and a version including measures of how idiosyncratic each spouse’s job is may reveal the degree of preference mismatch.|$|R
40|$|An {{event is}} the {{creation}} of new possibilities. It is located not merely at the level of objective possibilities but {{at the level of the}} possibility of possibilities. The State is always the finitude of possibility and the event is its infinitization. These two quotations taken from Alain Badiou’s Communist Hypothesis point to the main issues explored in Jodi Dean’s and Bruno Bosteels’s works on the “horizon ” and the “actuality ” of com-munism. These quotations also <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> main <b>questions</b> that political movements have faced in the past decades—namely, the commune and the state forms, their encounters and missed encounters, and their differential constituencies. However, whereas in Badiou an irreducible dis-tance will forever separate the commune and the state, in Dean and Bosteels there is a call to figure ways of thinking a real change that would con-taminate both, even when the connecting line is that of a horizon. That is a timely line. In Badiou’s Communist Hypothesis, the commune is the irrup-tion of “the possibility of possibilities, ” a nonstate that the state subsequently and necessarily cancels out, in order to affirm itself and maintain its powe...|$|R
40|$|This article takes a fresh {{approach}} to technology adoption, using a detailed comparison between adoption decision-making {{on a variety}} of eID technologies to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> theoretical <b>question</b> of how technology’s characteristics influence the antecedent factors of behavioural intention to use. Selecting four characteristics whose relevance is suggested but not really tested by the existing literature, namely the hedonic or utilitarian ways the technology is used, the familiarity of the technology for the user, the level of state intervention in the implementation or regulation of the technology use and the potential privacy intrusion the technology represents, we investigate whether diversity in these characteristics accounts for variation in the technology-adoption model. The model developed and used in this research is an integration of selected elements from TAM and DOI which enables a precise analysis of the technology adoption process. Using hypothesized scenarios in a survey among 3, 947 people from 4 EU 27 countries, this study provides empirical evidence –through SEM-PLS analysis- of individual decision-making processes, demonstrating that the variables measured in TAM-based models should be taken into account along with the characteristics of the individual technology considered...|$|R
