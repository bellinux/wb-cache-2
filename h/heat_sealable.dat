40|$|The {{maintenance}} of quality was examined of apple, orange and red grape juices in two common consumer packages with high barrier properties against oxygen. Nevertheless, the changes occurring during the one-year storage - especially colour and ascorbic acid were sensitive indicators - {{could only be}} explained by the influence of oxygen. This was much more obvious in the case of <b>heat</b> <b>sealable</b> paper bord aluminium package without headspace than in the case of glass bottles with twist-off cap.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, fabrication {{and testing of}} a new, leak-free, permanently sealable MEMS valve for use in vacuum applications. This device is different from existing MEMS valves {{in that it is}} leak-free in the closed state and has a relatively high flow rate in the open state. This device relies on the surface tension of a molten seal material to establish a permanent seal over its initially-open port upon <b>heating.</b> The <b>sealable</b> port is a through via located {{in the center of a}}n isolated silicon island supported on a thermally-insulating silicon nitride membrane in the center of a die. The through via is surrounded by a moderately high aspect ratio ring of indium solder. To seal the solder over the through via, the island and solder are heated by passing a current through a resistive heater on the back side of the device. Upon thermal actuation, the hollow cylinder of solder reflows into a toroid due to surface tension. For sufficiently high solder aspect ratios, the inner edges of the toroid meet in the center, thereby plugging the via. The heater is then turned off, solidifying the solder and forming a permanent seal. Individual subsystems of the device were first analytically modeled using structural, thermal, electrical and geometrical models to optimize the device features. The sealing and thermal isolation subsystems were then separately fabricated and tested to verify the analytical models and key fabrication processes. The individual subsystems were then combined into the final device. Tests on the final device indicate an open state flow rate of 60 to 400 standard cm³ per minute (sccm), a closed state leak rate not detectable above that of the test jig used (10 -⁴ sccm), and an open-to-closed flow rate ratio of greater than 10 ⁵ to 10 ⁶. by Aalap Dighe.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{nanoparticles}} (nano clay and nano silicon dioxide) on heat sealability, physicochemical, barrier, and mechanical properties of starch films were investigated. Starch films were prepared by casting method with addition of nanoparticles and plasticizers. All film properties were measured under standard conditions. Mechanical properties {{of all types}} of films were increased by incorporation of nanoparticles. Mungbean starch films showed 100 % increment in tensile strength by incorporation of nanoclay. Moisture content, water solubility, and WVP of all starch films decreased whereas decomposition temperature of the films was increased by incorporation of nanoparticles. All films were <b>heat</b> <b>sealable,</b> but nanoparticles-incorporated films exhibited better heat sealability than did control films. In summary, the type of starch governed the heat sealability but nanoparticles have potential to improve seal strength of starch films as well as other functional properties...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} parameters {{that would}} assure sterility of a sealed seam of film for application in “split-seam entry,” spores of Bacillus subtilis var. niger were sprayed onto pieces of Kapton and Teflon film. Short-time, high-temperature (200 to 270 C) exposures {{were made with}} film pieces between aluminum blocks in a hot-air oven, and the D and z values were determined after subculture of surviving spores. The use of Kapton film allowed the study of high temperatures, since it is not <b>heat</b> <b>sealable</b> and {{could be used to}} make thin packages for heat treatment. Spores on Teflon were dry-heat treated in a package designed to simulate an actual seam to be sealed. The z values of 29. 1 C (52. 4 F) for spores on Kapton and 139 C (250. 4 F) for spores on Teflon were calculated...|$|E
40|$|Kapton® FN and Teflon® FEP (fluorinated {{ethylene}} propylene) polymers {{are resistant}} to most chemical solvents, <b>heat</b> <b>sealable,</b> and have low moisture uptake, which make them attractive as packaging materials for electronics and implantable devices. Kapton® FN/Ti and Teflon® FEP/Ti microjoints were fabricated by using focused infrared laser irradiation. Laser-bonded samples were tested with a micro-testing machine under lap shear load and the bond strength was determined. The bond strength for the Kapton® FN/Ti and Teflon® FEP/Ti systems {{was found to be}} 3. 32 and 8. 48 N/mm(2), respectively. The failure mode of the mechanically tested samples was studied by using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Chemical interactions during laser bonding of Kapton® FN to titanium were studied by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS results give evidence for the formation of Ti-F bonds in the interfacial region...|$|E
40|$|The Grace DAKASEP {{separator}} {{was originally}} {{developed as a}} wicking layer for nickel-zinc alkaline batteries. The DAKASEP is a filled non-woven separator which is flexible and <b>heat</b> <b>sealable.</b> Through modification of formulation and processing variables, products {{with a variety of}} properties can be produced. Variations of DAKASEP were tested in Ni-H 2, Ni-Zn, Ni-Cd, and primary alkaline batteries with good results. The properties of DAKASEP which are optimized for Hg-Zn primary batteries are shown in tabular form. This separator has high tensile strength, 12 micron average pore size, relatively low porosity at 46 - 48 percent, and consequently moderately high resistivity. Versions were produced with greater than 70 percent porosity and resistivities in 33 wt percent KOH as low as 3 ohm cm. Performance data for Hg-Zn E- 1 size cells containing DAKASEP with the properties shown in tabular form, are more reproducible than data obtained with a competitive polypropylene non-woven separator. In addition, utilization of active material is in general considerably improved...|$|E
40|$|Shelf-life of frankfurters {{depends on}} various {{factors such as}} its composition, {{packaging}} material and method used as well as the effect of external conditions (temperature). The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the shelf-life of packaged (vacuum, shrink and modified atmosphere, MA) chicken frank-furters during storage at different temperatures. For this purpose regular and with sodium lactate addition chicken frankfurters were produced. For MA packaging (MAP), under gas mixture of 70 % N 2 and 30 % CO 2, a package consisting of container and <b>heat</b> <b>sealable</b> cover was used. Different laminate composition was used for vacuum and shrink packaging of frankfurters. During frankfurters storage physico-chemical (pH, aw), and microbiological (aerobic mesophiles, lactic acid bacteria and total bacterial count) analyses were performed. Packaging materials were analyzed for their barrier characteristic (oxygen permeability). The shelf-life of frankfurters can be extended if packaged in MA (54 days) and shrink (45 days) packaging compared to 36 days of shelf-life in vacuum packaging, at 3 C. Higher shelf-life is obtained for frank-furters with lactate addition, in all packaging conditions, stored at 6 C...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) {{treatment}} of food {{needs to be}} performed prior to packaging, either hygienic or aseptic packaging is necessary. New techniques for PEF treatment after packaging can be considered when plastic conductive (film) electrodes can be integrated within the package, so that the package and the product can {{be treated as a}} whole. This paper describes a newly developed treatment chamber, which can be used to test the ability of any arbitrary plastic packaging film to be used as electrodes for PEF treatment. Tests with a flexible commercially available electrically conductive copolymer film showed that reduction of Lactobacillus plantarum by PEF was possible. This <b>heat</b> <b>sealable</b> film obeys the mechanical properties of a polymer; however it has an electrical conductivity of 0. 75 S m - 1 and approximately 2. 3 % of the surface area is electrically conductive. The maximum obtained inactivation was 2. 1 log 10 with a specific energy of 17 J ml - 1. The microbial experiments gave a consistent outcome compared with finite element simulations and with models from literature. Further research to reach real pasteurisation levels is needed as well as issues concerning utilisation of these film electrodes. Industrial relevance: Stainless steel electrodes, which are widely used as electrode material for Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) treatment systems, have as main disadvantage that they exhibit certain wear. This article showed that polymer composites can be considered as electrode material for newly to be developed PEF treatment concepts. With extensive research on food grade composite films the integration of cheap disposable plastic electrodes in food packages comes within reach. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
