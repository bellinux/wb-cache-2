50|$|A {{differential}} backup is a cumulative backup of all changes made {{since the last}} <b>full</b> <b>backup,</b> i.e., the differences since the last <b>full</b> <b>backup.</b> The advantage to this is the quicker recovery time, requiring only a <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> and the last {{differential backup}} to restore the entire data repository. The disadvantage is that for each day elapsed since the last <b>full</b> <b>backup,</b> more data needs to be backed up, especially if {{a significant proportion of}} the data has changed, thus increasing backup time as compared to the incremental backup method.|$|E
5000|$|Differential : Each {{differential}} backup saves {{the data that}} has changed since the last <b>full</b> <b>backup.</b> It has the advantage that only a maximum of two data sets are needed to restore the data. One disadvantage, compared to the incremental backup method, is that as time from the last <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> (and thus the accumulated changes in data) increases, so does the time to perform the {{differential backup}}. Restoring an entire system would require starting from the most recent <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> and then applying just the last differential backup since the last <b>full</b> <b>backup.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{differential}} backup is a cumulative backup of all changes made {{since the last}} full or normal backup, i.e., the differences since the last <b>full</b> <b>backup.</b> The advantage to this is the quicker recovery time, requiring only a <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> and the last {{differential backup}} to restore the system.

50|$|In Windows Vista, a Complete PC Backup {{could not}} be {{performed}} to a network location. Windows 7 allows performing a <b>full</b> system image <b>backup</b> to a network location. However, subsequent incremental system image backups cannot be performed to a network; all image-based backups to the network must be <b>full</b> <b>backups.</b> <b>Full</b> system image <b>backups</b> to local or removable storage can be incremental.|$|R

50|$|A Synthetic backup is an {{alternative}} method of creating full backups. Instead of reading and backing up data directly from the disk, it will synthesize {{the data from the}} previous <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> (either a regular <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> for the first backup, or the previous synthetic <b>full</b> <b>backup)</b> and the periodic incremental backups. As only the incremental backups read data from the disk, these are the only files that need to be transferred during Offsite Replication. This greatly reduces the bandwidth needed for Offsite Replication.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to use the terms [...] "differential backup" [...] and [...] "incremental backup" [...] correctly. The two terms are widely used in the industry, and their use is universally standard. A differential backup refers to a backup made to include the differences since the last <b>full</b> <b>backup,</b> while an incremental backup contains only the changes since the last incremental backup. (Or, of course, since the last <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> if the incremental backup in questions is the first incremental backup immediately after the last <b>full</b> <b>backup.)</b> All the major data backup vendors have standardized on these definitions, including Microsoft, Acronis, and Symantec. Microsoft, makers of Backup and Restore, defines incremental backups and differential backups as follows: [...] "Incremental: An incremental backup provides a backup of files that have changed or are new since the last incremental backup....Differential: A differential backup provides a backup of files that have changed since a <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> was performed. A differential backup typically saves only the files that are different or new since the last <b>full</b> <b>backup,</b> but this can vary in different backup programs. Together, a <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> and a differential backup include all the files on your computer, changed and unchanged." [...] Microsoft products, such as Exchange Server 2010 use this definition in their literature and support sites.|$|E
50|$|A forward incremental-forever backup {{allows the}} {{synthetic}} operation {{to create a}} new <b>full</b> <b>backup,</b> which is limited {{to the size of the}} incremental file, instead of the complete size of a <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> file as it would happen in a “forward mode with synthetic fulls”. The overall consumed I/O is the same as the Reversed incremental, but during the duration of the backup activity only 1 write I/O is used and the snapshot of the VM is opened for less time than the Reversed incremental; the remaining 2 I/O are used to update the <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> file.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{videogame}} Shadowrun: Hong Kong, {{the supporting}} character Racter has a drone named 'Koschei'. If questioned, Racter will reveal that he named the drone thus {{because he has}} <b>full</b> <b>backups</b> of every aspect of it, allowing him to rebuild the drone no matter {{what might happen to}} it.|$|R
50|$|Backup {{solutions}} generally support differential backups and incremental backups {{in addition}} to <b>full</b> <b>backups,</b> so only material that is newer or changed compared to the backed up data is actually backed up. The effect of these is to increase significantly {{the speed of the}} backup process over slow networks while decreasing space requirements.|$|R
50|$|For Windows 7, {{file backup}} {{to a network}} share is {{available}} only with Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise and Ultimate editions whereas it was included in Windows Vista Home Premium. Manual image-based <b>full</b> system <b>backup</b> (including incremental backup) can be done on local or removable media in Windows 7 Home Premium. <b>Full</b> system <b>backup</b> to a network also requires Windows 7 Professional or above editions.|$|R
5000|$|Reverse delta : A reverse delta type {{repository}} stores {{a recent}} [...] "mirror" [...] {{of the source}} data {{and a series of}} differences between the mirror in its current state and its previous states. A reverse delta backup will start with a normal <b>full</b> <b>backup.</b> After the <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> is performed, the system will periodically synchronize the <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> with the live copy, while storing the data necessary to reconstruct older versions. This can either be done using hard links, or using binary diffs. This system works particularly well for large, slowly changing, data sets. Examples of programs that use this method are rdiff-backup and Time Machine.|$|E
50|$|Backup {{software}} {{may provide}} the option to do a <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> while clearing archive bits - that is, to back up all files regardless of their archive bit status, and to clear the archive bit of all files processed by the backup. This allows {{for the creation of}} an initial <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> that will be supplemented by incremental backups in the future.|$|E

50|$|Shadow copy backups are a {{new high}} speed backup method. Shadow copy backups are {{dramatically}} faster because the copy is virtually made after {{a brief period of}} quiescing an application. As subsequent updates are made to the data, the virtual copy is materialized. In some cases, hardware support for shadow copy backups means that actually saving the virtual copies is unnecessary. Shadow copy <b>backups</b> are always <b>full</b> <b>backups.</b>|$|R
50|$|Zmanda Recovery Manager (ZRM) for MySQL {{is used by}} MySQL DBAs to do backup and {{recovery}} of live MySQL databases, which can be either local or remote. ZRM uses the most appropriate backup method based on the particular storage engine being used by MySQL, or the particular storage infrastructure being used (e.g., it can use snapshots for instant <b>full</b> <b>backups</b> if LVM, ZFS, NetApp or VxFS are being used).|$|R

50|$|A {{differential}} backup {{is a type}} of data backup that preserves data, saving only the difference in the data since the last <b>full</b> <b>backup.</b> The rationale in this is that, since changes to data are generally few compared to the entire amount of data in the data repository, the amount of time required to complete the backup will be smaller than if a <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> was performed every time that the organization or data owner wishes to back up changes since the last <b>full</b> <b>backup.</b> Another advantage, at least as compared to the incremental backup method of data backup, is that at data restoration time, at most two backup media are ever needed to restore all the data. This simplifies data restores as well as increases the likelihood of shortening data restoration time.|$|E
5000|$|BackupAFS is {{a version}} of BackupPC patched to back up AFS or OpenAFS volumes to a backup server's local disk or {{attached}} RAID. It supports all BackupPC features including full and multi-level incremental dumps, exponential expiry, compression, and configuration via conf files or a web interface. Backup speed {{is dependent on the}} underlying hardware, however when performing <b>full</b> <b>backups</b> of multi-gigabyte AFS volumes using modern hardware, speeds of up to 60 megabytes per second are not uncommon over gigabit ethernet.|$|R

50|$|WBAdmin, {{using the}} command line or Graphical User Interface creates a backup {{which can be}} quickly {{restored}} using just the Windows Media install DVD and the backup files located on a removable USB disk without the need to re-install from scratch. WBAdmin uses a clever differencing engine to update the backup files. Once the original backup file is created Volume Shadow Copy Service updates changes, subsequent <b>full</b> <b>backups</b> take a matter of moments rather than many minutes taken to create the original backup file. Automatic backups can be scheduled {{on a regular basis}} using a wizard.|$|R
5000|$|Full Backup: When a <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> is performed, ALL {{files are}} stored in your archive (whether they have been {{modified}} or not).|$|E
5000|$|Differential backup: When a {{differential}} backup is performed, only the files {{which have been}} modified since the last <b>FULL</b> <b>backup</b> are stored in your archive.|$|E
5000|$|Cobian Backup {{supports}} Unicode, FTP, compression (ZIP, SQX, 7z), encryption (including Blowfish, Rijndael, DES, RSA-Rijndael [...] ), incremental and differential backup, {{for example}} a differential backup every night (which backs up user files that {{have changed since}} the last <b>full</b> <b>backup)</b> and a <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> every seventh night (backing up {{a full set of}} user files). Backups can be saved to CD, DVD, USB memory stick, a second hard drive (internal or external), etc. It supports long file names (32,000 characters) for all backup routines.|$|E
5000|$|Partitioning for {{significantly}} less than the full size available when disk space is not needed can reduce the time for diagnostic tools such as checkdisk to run or for <b>full</b> image <b>backups</b> to run.|$|R
50|$|In Windows Vista {{and later}} {{operating}} systems, NTBackup {{was replaced by}} Windows Backup and Restore, which uses the Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) file format, supports backup to modern media such as DVDs and image-based <b>full</b> system <b>backups.</b>|$|R
50|$|A (<b>full)</b> {{database}} <b>backup</b> is only {{a snapshot}} of the data in specific points of time, so we could know the information of each snapshot, but we can know nothing between them. Information in database backups is discrete in time.|$|R
50|$|An {{incremental}} backup {{of the changes}} made between two instances of a mirror is called a reverse incremental. By applying a reverse incremental to a mirror, {{the result will be}} a previous version of the mirror.In other words, after the initial <b>full</b> <b>backup,</b> each successive {{incremental backup}} applies the changes to the previous full, creating a new synthetic <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> every time, while maintaining the ability to revert to previous versions.The main advantage of this type of backup is a more efficient recovery process, since the most recent version of the data (which is the most frequently restored version) is a (synthetic) <b>full</b> <b>backup,</b> and no incrementals need to be applied to it during its restoration. Reverse incremental backup works for both tapes and disks, but in practice tends to work better with disks. Companies using the reverse incremental backup method include Intronis and Zetta.net.|$|E
50|$|When {{browsing}} the backups, incremental backups {{are automatically}} filled {{back to the}} previous <b>full</b> <b>backup.</b> So every backup {{appears to be a}} full and complete set of data.|$|E
50|$|Duplicity devises {{a scheme}} {{where the first}} archive is a {{complete}} (<b>full)</b> <b>backup,</b> and subsequent (incremental) backups only add differences from the latest full or incremental backup. Chains consisting of a <b>full</b> <b>backup</b> {{and a series of}} incremental backups can be recovered to the point in time that any of the incremental steps were taken. If any of the incremental backups are missing then the incremental backups following it cannot be reconstructed. It does this using GnuPG, librsync, tar, and rdiff. To transmit data to the backup repository it can use SSH/SCP/SFTP, local file access, rsync, FTP, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Rackspace Cloud Files, and others.|$|E

50|$|The {{image-based}} <b>full</b> system <b>backup</b> option, called Complete PC Backup in Windows Vista or system {{image in}} Windows 7, {{allows for the}} imaging of the entire system including operating system and data volumes. The backed up image can later be restored through the Windows Recovery Environment either to the same computer or to a new computer of different brand and type. The file format used when doing an image-based backup is VHD. A VHD image can also be mounted for extracting individual files, or booted from (using Windows 7 Enterprise and Ultimate only) after the <b>full</b> system image <b>backup</b> has been done.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} Microsoft Windows {{components}} have been updated {{to make use}} of Shadow Copy.
