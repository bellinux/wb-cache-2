5|$|After {{downloading}} {{that originated}} from Singaporean <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> had been recorded by BayTSP, Odex sent letters of demand to people {{associated with the}} <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> it had tracked. The letters requested monetary compensation for downloads of the company's licensed material. The recipients were asked to contact Odex within one week and pay settlement fees from S$3,000 to S$5,000 or face legal action. The recipients also had to sign a non-disclosure agreement, promise to destroy all copies of the downloaded anime, and stop downloading the copyrighted material.|$|E

30|$|A {{bandwidth}} {{consumption rate}} for each station is calculated by looking up the source/destination <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> and packet length {{information in the}} packets sniffed by the packet-sniffing module. If the source <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> of a packet matches to the <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> of the wireless client, it will be calculated as uplink consumption. Similarly, if the destination <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> of the packet matches to the <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> of the wireless station, it will be calculated as downlink consumption.|$|R
5|$|On August 29, 2011, the Federal Court of Canada {{ordered the}} three Canadian ISPs—Bell Canada, Cogeco, and Vidéotron—to {{disclose}} {{the names and}} addresses of the subscribers whose <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> were suspected to have downloaded {{a copy of the}} film. The ISPs were given two weeks to comply with the order.|$|E
5|$|According to Rajamouli, Eega was {{illegally}} downloaded 655,000 times {{within a}} week of the pirated version being leaked on the Internet. Rajamouli added that a database of <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> of non-resident Indians who frequently download content was shared with immigration authorities which could affect their potential US residence permit applications. The anti-piracy cell delinked more than 2,000 links to the pirated versions of Naan Ee on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} part of the {{confidential}} data stolen in the Sony Pictures hack incident; it was leaked onto peer-to-peer file sharing websites on November 27, 2014, over a month ahead of its scheduled release. Along with it came Fury and three other unreleased Sony Pictures films (Annie, Mr. Turner and To Write Love on Her Arms). Within three days of the leak, Still Alice had been downloaded by an estimated 103,832 unique <b>IP</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Web browsers can {{implement}} DNS pinning: the <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> {{is locked}} {{to the value}} received in the first DNS response. This technique may block some legitimate uses of Dynamic DNS, and may not work against all attacks. However, {{it is important to}} fail safe (stop rendering) if the <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> does change, because using an <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> past the TTL expiration can open the opposite vulnerability when the <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> has legitimately changed and the expired <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> may now be controlled by an attacker.|$|R

5|$|Chrono Resurrection was {{originally}} {{set for a}} Christmas 2004 release. However, Square Enix issued a cease-and-desist letter to Resurrection Games before the release for trademark and copyright infringement. Faced with a threat of legal action, the project was publicly closed on September 6, 2004. According to the development team, the website of the project had received significant hits from Square Enix Japanese <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> {{for a period of}} three months before the letter issuing. They assumed these visits were mostly from employees rather than top executives, and hoped the company would see the demo as how the team sees it, a tribute to Chrono Trigger rather than a replacement.|$|E
5|$|Degrassi: The Next Generation is also {{available}} in various new media formats. Episodes are streamed on the websites of MuchMusic and TeenNick to viewers with Canadian or US <b>IP</b> <b>addresses.</b> Registered users of the Canadian and American iTunes Stores can purchase episodes for playback on home computers and certain iPods. In Canada, Puretracks also offers episodes for download. They are issued as a Windows Media 10 file, and the purchaser owns them forever, although the episodes can only be burned onto a disc three times and copied to a device three times. In the US, Zune and the Xbox Live Marketplace sell every episode of the series.|$|E
5|$|The DDoS {{attacks were}} at first {{carried out with}} the Gigaloader and JMeter {{application}}s. Within a few days, these were supplanted by the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), a network stress-testing application allowing users to flood a server with TCP or UDP packets. The LOIC soon became a signature weapon in the Anonymous arsenal; however, it would also lead {{to a number of}} arrests of less experienced Anons who failed to conceal their <b>IP</b> <b>addresses.</b> Some operators in Anonymous IRC channels incorrectly told or lied to new volunteers that using the LOIC carried no legal risk.|$|E
50|$|When {{a client}} system without an <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> enters a network it will request an <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> from the {{resident}} DHCP server. The DHCP server will reserve an <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> (so anyone else asking for {{one is not}} granted this one) and it will send that <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> to the device along with a lease identifying how long the address will be valid. Normally, from this point, the device will respond by confirming the <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> with the DHCP server and the DHCP server finally responds with an acknowledgement.|$|R

Some previous researches on IP traceback such as [20] and [31] have proposed to use the ingress interface <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> of the first router in the attack path as an identifier for traceback. However, since DFM should be able to trace up to the attacker node even if the attacker is behind a NAT, the ingress interface <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> will be useless in this case. Since the ingress interface <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> is invalid, the victim is unable to trace the source edge router by an invalid <b>IP</b> <b>address.</b>|$|R

Anons had announced an intention to bring down Amazon.com as well, but failed to do so, allegedly because of infighting with the hackers who controlled the botnets. PayPal estimated the damage to have cost the company US$5.5 million. It later provided the <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> of 1,000 of its attackers to the FBI, leading to at least 14 arrests. On Thursday, December 5, 2013, 13 of the PayPal 14 pleaded guilty to {{taking part in the}} attacks.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege {{has both}} a single-player and {{multiplayer}} mode. The single-player mode {{consists of a}} single story and world; players can either create a new character when starting the story or use one created in a prior playthrough. The cooperative multiplayer mode allows for up to eight players to play through either the single-player storyline or in the multiplayer map, which features a central town hub with increasingly difficult enemies as players move away from it. Multiplayer games can be set to different difficulty levels, allowing accommodation of higher-leveled characters. Additional maps can be created by players that can allow for competitive multiplayer instead. Multiplayer matches can be created and joined via local area networks, direct <b>IP</b> <b>addresses,</b> and, prior to its closure in 2006, through the Microsoft Zone matchmaking service.|$|E
5|$|Odex's {{actions against}} file sharing were legal actions against Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and their {{subscribers}} in Singapore by Odex, a Singapore-based company that virtually distributes sub-licensed Japanese anime. From early 2007 to January 2008 Odex took action against {{anyone who had}} downloaded anime through BitTorrent for alleged copyright infringement. Odex tracked their <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> without their consent and sought subpoenas to compel the ISPs to disclose the personal details of these subscribers. After rulings from the Subordinate Courts, Odex took personal data from affected ISPs and sent letters demanding payment in place of litigation. More {{than a third of}} the individuals contacted by Odex opted to settle out of court for at least S$3,000 (US$2,000) to S$5,000 (US$4,000) each.|$|E

50|$|When a DHCP server {{receives}} a DHCPDISCOVER message from a client, {{which is an}} <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> lease request, the server reserves an <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> for the client and makes a lease offer by sending a DHCPOFFER message to the client. This message contains the client's MAC <b>address,</b> the <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> that the server is offering, the subnet mask, the lease duration, and the <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> of the DHCP server making the offer.|$|R
5|$|Other new {{features}} include Internet Worm Protection to block worms, which scan <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> for open ports. It also blocks inbound ports based on known and suspected exploits using signatures and heuristics. The {{addition of the}} feature follows MSBlast in 2003 and Sasser in 2004, worms that exploited vulnerability in Microsoft Windows' operating systems. In response to emerging privacy threats — 75 percent of the threats in the last 12 months attempted to steal confidential information — this version adds phishing protection. Using the firewall component, users can create a whitelist of sites where confidential information can be transmitted. Users are alerted when information is transmitted to a site not on the list. The Outbreak Alert feature warns users of major threats as classified by Symantec, and users can press the Fix Now button to applies a set of changes to close vulnerabilities, such as blocking necessary ports used by a propagating worm. The Browser Privacy can suppress information website generally receive about its visitors, such as the browser and operating system used. The feature can also block advertisements.|$|E
5|$|The {{firewall}} {{makes all}} decisions by itself {{to lessen the}} chance of being weakened by a misinformed decision. Applications known to be safe are allowed Internet access, and vice versa for malicious applications. Unknown ones are analyzed and blocked if they exhibit malicious behavior. In both PC Magazine and PC Pro testing, the firewall did not incorrectly block any safe applications from Internet access. All malware was blocked by the firewall. PC Magazine testing reflected the same results. The firewall also stealthed all ports. Exploits were blocked by the intrusion prevention system, which prevents threats from leveraging vulnerabilities. The system is updated whenever a vulnerability is identified for Windows-based computers. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful; registry changes, process termination, and simulated mouse clicks all failed. Disabling Windows services {{had no effect on}} the firewall since it works at the kernel driver level. This version automatically adjusts configuration for different networks based on the physical address of the gateway rather than <b>IP</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 9 August 2007, an Odex {{representative}} said it {{intended to}} obtain search warrants for illegally downloaded anime if necessary. The company initially believed that, unlike in other countries, mere warning letters {{would not stop}} the downloads in Singapore. Letters were sent mainly to people who had downloaded more popular series, such as Bleach, D.Gray-man, Fullmetal Alchemist and InuYasha. There was speculation from the online community that the company would collect approximately S$15million from 3,000 individuals from out-of-court settlements, but Odex responded {{that it did not}} require each of them to pay a uniform S$5,000. The main factor it considered when deciding the level of compensation to demand was the amount of downloading by each individual. Odex confirmed that more than 3,000 <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> had been disclosed {{as a result of the}} court orders, but estimated that the amount collected would cover less than 20% of its enforcement costs. The company's director, Peter Go, subsequently revealed that most of the compensation payments had been paid to BayTSP and to ISPs for the retrieval of their subscribers' personal data. He justified his company's actions by stating that, according to BayTSP's statistics, Singapore had one of the highest rates of illegal anime downloads in the world and that Odex wanted to reduce this by 85%.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{design a}} V 2 V-based fast handoff scheme using <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> passing for VANETs in this thesis. The {{proposed}} scheme allows a leaving {{vehicle in the}} exit area to pass an <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> which has been identified by the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure to the vehicles in the entry area directly. In addition, the leaving vehicle in the exit area can also pass an <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> to the vehicles in the middle area {{if there is no}} vehicles in the entry area. Therefore, our scheme can reduce the use of DHCP to obtain an <b>IP</b> <b>address.</b> Because DAD results in the largest delay of the whole DHCP procedure, our scheme can thus improve the utilization of <b>IP</b> <b>address,</b> reduce the time of acquiring an <b>IP</b> <b>address,</b> and reduce the whole handoff time. ...|$|R
