25|$|A' Bhuidheanach Bheag’s best {{geographical}} {{feature is the}} remote Cama Choire {{on the eastern side}} of the mountain. This is a steep sided valley which cuts deeply into the hill and is drained by the Allt a’ Chama Choire. The coire is well seen from the hill of An Dun above the Gaick Pass. From a geological point of view the most interesting characteristic of the mountain is Coire Mhic-sith on its south-western flank. The coire is a deeply incised, fault-guided valley which has received the attention of geologists, especially the School of Geoscience at the University of Edinburgh who have concluded that the presence of glacial silt and sand in the valley along with a glacial spillway to the adjacent valley of the Edendon Water means that the coire had a large ice <b>dammed</b> <b>lake</b> during the last Ice age. This Proglacial lake drained away when the ice melted but has left evidence similar, but on a lesser scale, to the “parallel roads” in Glen Roy.|$|E
25|$|Around 9,000 years BC, as the {{ice sheet}} retreated, the modern Lakes Huron, Michigan, {{and much of}} Superior, were a single lake known to geologists as Lake Algonquin. Ice sheets <b>dammed</b> <b>Lake</b> Algonquin to the northeast. Before that, Lake Chicago {{occupied}} {{the southern tip of}} the Lake Michigan basin, {{at the southern end of}} the ice sheet. Lake Algonquin and Lake Chicago both drained south into the Mississippi River watershed. Around 9,500 years ago, new pathways draining the system to the east were opened by the retreat of the ice, and proglacial Lake Stanley (precursor of Lake Huron) was separated from proglacial Lake Chippewa (precursor of Lake Michigan), with Lake Chippewa at a slightly higher level. They were connected by the now-submerged Mackinac Channel, which discharged into Lake Stanley over Mackinac Falls. Ongoing warping of the land by post-glacial rebound due to the retreat of the glacial ice continued to modify the drainage structure of the region, allowing the reunification of all three basins (Superior, Michigan, and Huron) as the Nipissing Great Lakes. This arrangement was probably stable for more than 1,000 years, ending only when lake outlets other than the St. Clair River were cut off around 4,000 years ago. The current configuration of the lakes reflects the latest step in a long history of their post-glacial evolution.|$|E
2500|$|The Monument Geyser Basin [...] has no active geysers, but its 'monuments' are {{siliceous}} sinter deposits {{similar to}} the siliceous spires discovered {{on the floor of}} Yellowstone Lake. Scientists hypothesize that this basin's structures formed from a hot water system in a glacially <b>dammed</b> <b>lake</b> during the waning stages of the Pinedale Glaciation. The basin is on a ridge reached by a very steep one-mile (1.6km) trail south of Artists' Paint Pots.|$|E
