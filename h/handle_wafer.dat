These materials are intended to enable reductions in dark currents and increases in quantum efficiencies, relative to those of comparable imagers made from prior silicon-on-insulator (SOI) starting materials. Some background information is prerequisite to a meaningful description of the improved starting materials and process. A prior SOI starting material, depicted in the upper part the figure, includes: a) A device layer on the front side, typically between 2 and 20 m thick, made of p-doped silicon (that is, silicon lightly doped with an electron acceptor, which is typically boron); b) A buried oxide (BOX) layer (that is, a buried layer of oxidized silicon) between 0. 2 and 0. 5 m thick; and c) A silicon handle layer (also known as a <b>handle</b> <b>wafer)</b> on the back side, between about 600 and 650 m thick.

It has become important {{now more than ever}} to include an environmental impact evaluation of future technologies, before they are introduced into manufacturing, in order to identify potentially environmentally harmful materials or processes and understand their implications, costs, and mitigation requirements. In this thesis, we introduce a methodology to compare alternative options on the environmental axis, along with the cost and performance axes, in order to create environmentally aware and benign technologies. This methodology also helps to identify potential performance and cost issues in novel technologies by taking a transparent and bottoms-up assessment approach. This methodology is applied to the evaluation of the MIT 3 D IC technology in comparison to a standard CMOS 2 D IC approach. Both options are compared on all three axes - performance, cost and environmental impact. (cont.) The "handle wafer" unit process in the existing 3 D IC technology, which is a crucial process for back-to-face integration, is found to have a large environmental impact because of its use of thick metal sacrificial layers and high energy consumption. We explore three different <b>handle</b> <b>wafer</b> options, between-die channel, oxide release layer, and alternative low-temperature permanent bonding. The first two approaches use a chemical <b>handle</b> <b>wafer</b> release mechanism; while the third explores solid liquid inter-diffusion (SLID) bonding using copper-indium at 2000 C. Preliminary results for copper-indium bonding indicate that a sub-micron thick multi-layer copper-indium stack, when bonded to a 300 nm thick copper film results in large voids in the bonding interface primarily due to rough as-deposited films. Finally, we conduct an overall assessment of these and other proposed <b>handle</b> <b>wafer</b> technologies. The overall assessment shows that but the oxide release layer approach appears promising; however, each process option has its strength and weaknesses, which need to be understood and pursued accordingly. by Ajay Somani.
