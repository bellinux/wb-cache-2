40|$|In this seminar I {{examine the}} system of 88 {{classifiers}} that I documented {{being used by the}} <b>inhabitants</b> <b>of</b> Tauwema, <b>my</b> <b>village</b> <b>of</b> residence on Kaile’una Island during my field research in 1982 / 83 and 1989. After a brief outline of their main grammatical and discourse functions point out that on the basis of semantic analyses the 88 classifiers can be seen as operating dynamically within 20 semantic domains, with much potential for substitution of classifiers within and between domains. Then I show that the actual use of this classifier system can be described by variable rules. Finally I develop a network model to adequately describe the dynamics of this system (see Senft 1986; 1987; 1996) ...|$|R

6000|$|Rightly or wrongly, I {{had never}} pretended to a keen {{concern in the}} [...] "social doings" [...] <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>village.</b> Coming to the valley out <b>of</b> regard for <b>my</b> father and mother and not from {{personal}} choice, the only folk who engaged my attention were {{the men and women}} of the elder generation, rugged pioneer folk who brought down to me something of the humor, the poetry, and the stark heroism of the Border in the days when the Civil War was a looming cloud, and the [...] "Pineries" [...] a limitless wilderness on the north. Men like Sam McKinley, William Fletcher, and Wilbur Dudley retained my friendship and my respect, but the affairs of the younger generation did not greatly concern me.

60|$|I began life unluckily {{by being}} the wag and bright fellow at school; and I had the farther misfortune of {{becoming}} the great genius <b>of</b> <b>my</b> native <b>village.</b> <b>My</b> father was a country attorney, and intended that I should succeed him in business; but I had too much genius to study, and he was too fond <b>of</b> <b>my</b> genius to force it into the traces.

40|$|<b>My</b> Mother's <b>Village</b> is a {{personal}} documentary response to The Sri Lanka Series (1980), a series of ethnographic films produced by the author's anthropologist mother, Sharon Bell, and filmmaker father, Geoff Burton. Four women, a community of fishermen, and a dance instructor were the 'subjects' of their three films. The feature length film <b>My</b> Mother's <b>Village</b> revisits the same participants in Sri Lanka and pursues the original themes and issues, such as economic conditions, the status of women, colonialism, religion, ritual, and inter-generational change. <b>My</b> Mother's <b>Village</b> explores how both the filmmaker and participants are navigating heredity and inheritance. Supplementing the film, the exegesis component, Provenance in Personal Documentary interrogates the conceptual underpinnings of the creative research. 'Provenance', the key concept informing the production <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Mother's <b>Village</b> is a fine art term specifically ârepractisedâ and retheorised here. It is hypothesised that cross-disciplinary personal documentary production is a fertile environment that responds to increasingly accessible technologies and progressive interpretations of what contemporary âdocumentaryâ means. This research project responds {{to the lack of}} a critical framework for interpreting and developing inter-disciplinary documentary praxis. The experimental methods employed in the provenance <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Mother's <b>Village</b> extend to the adoption of an auto-ethnographic and autobiographical mode of storytelling in this exegesis. This marriage of creativity and scholarly research is further reflected in the relationship between the exegesis and corresponding personal documentary film production. The provenance <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Mother's <b>Village</b> reveals an historical convergence of 20 th century documentary traditions of photography, cinema, and visual ethnography. The convergence of these traditions in the contemporary art context echoes Walter Benjamin's observations of the shifting nature of art in the 20 th century. Provenance, in Benjamin's revolutionary context, transgresses the 'aura', market valuation, and ownership of art objects to a dynamic understanding of processes, intentions, and storytelling throughout artistic production. This investigation finds that personal documentary modes account for this shifting paradigm in visual arts and offer ethical and creative methodologies for inter-disciplinary visual research. In the current global technological landscape of data-streams and personal media devices, provenance encourages a sensuous topography of encounter, contingency, boredom, and experiment...|$|R

60|$|Thoughts {{something}} like these arose {{in my mind}} as I slowly turned my footsteps from the graveyard <b>of</b> <b>my</b> native <b>village,</b> where I had been wandering after years of absence.

40|$|In 1945, Korea was {{liberated from}} Japanese colonial rule. After {{the end of}} the war, the men <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>village</b> who had been conscripted into service as laborers or {{soldiers}} returned home. We put on a welcoming party in my house for my cousin who had returned from a coal mine in Hiroshima. Next door there was a young man who had evacuated from the South Pacific islands. He told me some memorable tales about his experiences during the war, such as the air raids by B- 29 bombers. Those who returned home never said a word about "war responsibility " or "reparations". It appeared to me that they just considered themselves rather lucky for having safely survived to tell the tale. It didn't seem like the villagers felt any great sense of liberation from Japanese rule. They were able to get a few close encounters with a foreign culture from the English language labels printed on American sugar and candies distributed to them free of charge, but otherwise it did not appear that the power of the United States Army Military Government extended very far into the countryside.
