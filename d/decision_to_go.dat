5|$|As aide-de-camp, Tintin opposes Alcazar's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to {{war with}} {{neighbouring}} Nuevo Rico over the oil-rich Gran Chapo, and is framed as a traitor by the international oil and weapon companies. He escapes imprisonment {{with the aid of}} the mercenary Pablo; and decides to enter the forest and find the Arumbayas, in the hope that they can explain to him why people wish to steal the fetish. From a British explorer, Ridgewell, living among the Arumbaya, Tintin learns that a diamond was stolen and hidden inside the statue.|$|E

In 1150 or 1151, Harald visited Norway with Earl Rognvald, and probably met with King Ingi Haraldsson. During this visit Rognvald made his <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on crusade, as recounted at length in the Saga.|$|E
40|$|The cap on {{tuition fees}} {{will rise to}} £ 9, 000 in 2012. Gill Wyness reviews the {{evidence}} {{on the impact of}} past fee increases on young people’s <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> university and finds that tuition fees, grants and loans have all had limited impacts on participation which is determined more by prior educational attainment. However, current analytical modelling cannot adequately control for the rate of increase set to be ushered in next year and questions remain as to whether debt-aversion will significantly put off bright young people from poor backgrounds...|$|R

5|$|American Philo McGiffin, who was {{on board}} Zhenyuan, {{reported}} after the battle {{that there had been}} a variety of stories about the fate of the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship went down, the captain ended up clinging to a piece of debris. However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the debris, and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died.|$|E
5|$|At the age {{of eight}} the younger Reginald began {{attending}} the local grammar school at Whitchurch, where he remained for five years. In 1796 {{he was sent to}} Bristow's, a small private school in Neasden a few miles north of Central London. This establishment provided intensive learning for around a dozen boys, preparing them for eventual entry to Oxford or Cambridge universities. At Bristow's Reginald met John Thornton, who became a lifelong friend. The pair shared a lively interest in church history and beliefs; a lengthy letter, written by Heber to Thornton, is described by Heber's biographer Arthur Montefiore as being worthy of a learned theologian. In October 1800 Heber entered Brasenose College, Oxford; Thornton's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Cambridge was a matter for Heber's considerable regret.|$|E
5|$|Justinian now had his pretext, {{and with}} peace {{restored}} on his eastern frontier with Sassanid Persia in 532, he started assembling an invasion force. According to Procopius (The Vandalic War, I.10), {{the news of}} Justinian's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war with the Vandals caused great consternation among the capital's elites, in whose minds the disaster of 468 was still fresh. The financial officials resented the expenditure involved, while the military was weary from the Persian war and feared the Vandals' sea-power. The emperor's scheme received support mostly from the Church, reinforced {{by the arrival of}} victims of renewed persecutions from Africa. Only the powerful minister John the Cappadocian dared to openly voice his opposition to the expedition, however, and Justinian disregarded it and pressed on with his preparations.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{allegations}} that <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war in Iraq were motivated {{at least partially}} by oil interests; for example, British newspaper The Independent reported that the [...] "Bush administration is heavily involved in writing Iraq's oil law" [...] which would [...] "allow Western oil companies contracts to pump oil out of Iraq up to 30 years, and the profits would be tax-free." [...] Whether motivated by it or not, U.S. {{foreign policy in the}} Middle East appears to much of the world as to be motivated by an oil rationale.|$|R

5|$|The 1987 {{season was}} a {{disappointment}} for the Giants. They lost their first two {{games of the season}} before the 1987 NFL Players Strike. As opposed to the players strike five years previous, NFL owners made a <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> forward with replacement players. Unlike other teams such as the Washington Redskins and Houston Oilers, who made specific and elaborate plans to deal with the replacement games, the Giants made no plans. This resulted in the Giants losing all three replacement games, putting their record at 0–5 before the strike was over and the regular players returned. Though the Giants went a respectable 6–4 over their final 10 games, they were out of the playoffs at 6–9. A particular disappointment was the running game, which due to injuries to the offensive line (including tackle Karl Nelson missing the entire season due to Hodgkin's disease) struggled all season. Standouts included tight end Mark Bavaro, who led the team in catches with 55, and three of the Giants linebackers making the Pro Bowl—Taylor, Carl Banks (who was voted the team's MVP by the players), and Carson.|$|E

50|$|Fired: Alex Thomason - for not {{contributing}} {{much to the}} task, his five-week losing streak, {{and also}} for saying he had only lost once as Project Manager—Donald Trump viewed Alex's statement as dishonest {{because he has been}} a losing PM twice, although Alex claimed that he had forgotten about being project manager last week with Bren, as they had shared responsibilities on the task (but {{the fact that they were}} disorganized and lost that task badly didn't help Alex's case either). Tana was criticized for making some blatant <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Staten Island. However, although both Tana & Alex failed to mention at marketing in their sales segment, Tana brought up with numerous ideas and did most of the sales.

40|$|Governments are {{aiming to}} expand the intake to higher education, so it is {{important}} to understand what motivates students to enter university and choose a particular programme. The aim of this study was to see whether a motivational orientation framework, developed to explain motivation to study, could also be applied to motivation to enrol in a selected university programme. Data were collected through individual open interviews with 36 undergraduate students at three universities in Hong Kong. Analysis used a grounded theory approach. The motivational orientation framework consists of six continua, labelled: compliance, individual goal setting, university lifestyle, sense of belonging, career and interest. It was possible to interpret data on <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> university and to pick particular programmes with the framework. Students could be allocated to a position on each continuum, which then characterised their initial motivation for study. © 2010 Society for Research into Higher Education. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Traditional pelvimetry for a {{pregnant}} women is mainly {{relied on a}} ruler or estimation based on the vaginal touch, which results a very high measuring error. A new pelvimetry based on electromagnetic tracker is proposed in this paper, and a measure system has been developed. It’s a non-invasive method to measure key parameters of a pelvis because {{of the character of}} high accuracy, without line-of-sight restrictions and non-radiation of electromagnetic tracking technology. Its precise measuring data can well fulfill clinical pelvimetry needs, and be helpful for a physician <b>to</b> make <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on a vaginal delivery or not during a labor. 1...|$|R
