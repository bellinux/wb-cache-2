5|$|Salford has {{a history}} of textile {{processing}} that pre-dates the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> and as an old town had been developing for about 700years. Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians. Other cottage industries prevalent at this time included clogging, cobbling, weaving and brewing. The changes to textile manufacture during the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> {{had a profound effect on}} both on population and urbanisation, as well as the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of Salford.|$|E
5|$|The family symbol in {{advertising}} may be observable before the <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution,</b> {{but it was}} not until after the <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution</b> that advertising boomed and the use of family images {{in advertising}} became prevalent. The <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution</b> changed advertising from informative flyers marking the availability of goods in 17th and 18th century Europe, whose audience were those within physical propinquity, to multimillion-dollar campaigns that attempted to instantly connect and persuade peoples from across the world. After the <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution,</b> large companies emerged as mass-producers, products became branded, and customers began establishing brand loyalties. Thus, persuading customers to purchase one brand rather than another became vital to advertising. An advertisement was responsible for making products and services salient in order to earn consumer attention in competitive industrial markets. During this period, not only did the immensity of the advertising industry drastically change, but so did its marketing strategies as it began to incorporate images and specify an audience. This change from largely informative to largely persuasive strategies and from general to specific audiences explains the increase in presence and usage of symbols, representations, and stereotypes in advertising—including those of the family.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} propositions are argued. Technological advance is {{a necessary}} condition for sustained economic growth. It can be sustained by more then one set of institutions. Technology and institutions co-evolve. Although some institutions inhibit growth while others encourage it, no single institution is either necessary or sufficient to produce either sustained or zero growth. Sustained growth began with the two <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolutions</b> and was solidified by the 'invention of how to invent'. Explaining these events requires studying several trajectories that were established in the medieval period and evolved slowly through the early modern period and were unique to the West. Sustained growth, institutions, technological change, technological trajectories, the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolutions,</b> early modern science, medieval universities. ...|$|R

5|$|Greater Manchester {{is mainly}} urban, {{and is one}} of the most densely {{populated}} regions in Europe. In the second half of the 18thcentury, the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> played an important role in the growth and development of Manchester and its surrounding area, and industry continues to be a major part of the region's economy. There are few buildings surviving from before the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> but many from the 19th and 20thcenturies. The bedrock consists mainly of Carboniferous sandstones, including millstone grit, which is a major source of building material for the region's churches. The superficial deposits are of boulder clay, which provides material for making bricks.|$|E
5|$|In 1516, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, {{adopted the}} Reinheitsgebot (purity law), perhaps the oldest food-quality {{regulation}} {{still in use}} in the 21st century, according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water, hops and barley-malt. Beer produced before the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant {{by the end of}} the 19th century. The development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results.|$|E

50|$|The Victorian era {{was a time}} of {{unprecedented}} population growth in Britain. The population rose from 13.9 million in 1831 to 32.5 million in 1901.

5|$|The listed {{buildings}} can {{be divided}} by date into three groups: ancient structures, structures built during the two centuries before the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> and those built during or after it. Halton Castle and Norton Priory date from the 11th and 12thcenturies, and are now in ruins. Structures built before the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> reflect society as {{it was at that}} time, and the main occupations of farming and fishing. They include farmhouses, such as the building known as the Seneschal's House, which dates from 1598 and is the oldest standing building in the urban area; buildings relating to stately homes, such as the loggia and ice house in the grounds of Norton Priory; domestic buildings, such as Halton Old Hall, and buildings relating to the church, such as Halton Vicarage and the adjacent Chesshyre Library.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} French rule {{coincided with the}} start of the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> in Belgium. Use of {{mechanical}} production techniques was encouraged by the French state.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{so-called}} Digital Revolution, {{which started in}} the 1970 s, is gaining pace. Similar to the Agricultural and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolutions,</b> it is destroying less-skilled jobs and creating new opportunities for higher skilled and self-generated work, for example, {{the rise of the}} freelancer or gig economy. It also increases existing policy concerns about technology skills gaps, and the rise in long-term and youth unemployment.|$|R
