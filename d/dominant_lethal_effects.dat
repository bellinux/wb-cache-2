40|$|Occupational health {{standards}} {{have not been}} established for sulfur mustard (HD) [bis{ 2 -chloroethyl) -sulfide) &#x 27; a strong alkylating agent with known mutagenic properties. Little, however, {{is known about the}} mutagenic activity of HD in mammalian species and data regarding the <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>effects</b> of HD are ambiguous. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the dominant lethal effect in male and female rats orally exposed to HD. The study was conducted in two phases; a female dominant lethal phase and a male dominant lethal phase. Sprague-Dawley rats of each sex were administered 0. 08, 0. 20, or 0. 50 mg/kg HD in sesame oil 5 days/week for 10 weeks. For the female phase, treated or untreated males were mated with treated females and their fetuses were evaluated at approximately 14 days after copulation. For the male dominant lethal phase, treated males cohabited with untreated femal (during 5 days of each week for 10 weeks) and females were sacrificed for fetal evaluation 14 days after the midweek of cohabitation during each of the 10 weeks. The appearance and behavior of the rats were unremarkable throughout the experiment and there were no treatment-related deaths. Growth rates were reduced in both female and male rats treated with 0. 50 mg/kg HD. Indicators of reproductive performance did not demonstrate significant female <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>effects,</b> although significant male <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>effects</b> were observed at 2 and 3 week post-exposure. These effects included increases of early fetal resorptions and preimplantation losses and decreases of total live embryo implants. These effects were most consistently observed at a dose of 0. 50 mg/kg, but frequently occurred at the lower doses. Although no treatment-related effects on male reproductive organ weights or sperm motility were found, a significant increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm was detected in males exposed to 0. 50 mg/kg HD. The timing of these effects is consistent with an effect during the postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis, possibly involving the generally sensitive spermatids...|$|E

Spindle disturbances were induced by Panogen 5, 8 and 15, while chromosomal aberrations were induced by Agrimax M, Granosan, Ceresan M, Betoxin and New Improved Ceresan. (The Working Group noted that the different results may not reflect different properties, as various authors were involved.) ln D. melanogaster, sex-linked recessive lethal mutation was induced by Ceresan and Ceresan M, but not by Agallol 3, and neither Ceresan nor Agallol 3 induced <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>effects.</b> The azo dye, mercury orange, was not mutagenic to strains of S. typhimurium. Considerations with regard to genotoxic mechanisms Mercury has not only a direct effect on chromosomes, resuIting in clastogenic effects in eukaryotes, but also causes disturbance of the spindle mechanism, owing to its high affnity for the sulfhydryl groups contained in spindle fibre proteins. Organomercury compounds inhibit the spindle mechanism even more strongly than colchicine, but, in contrast to colchicine, produce a graduaI transition to c-mitosis at sub-lethal doses, which may resuIt in aneuploidy and/or polyploidy...|$|E
40|$|Induction of {{chromosome}} aberrations in pachytene spermatocytes of mice by 2 mg/kg TEM {{was compared}} with induction by 400 R X rays. These doses induced comparably high <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>effects</b> in pachytene spermatocytes of mice. Cytological analysis at diakinesis–metaphase I stage showed that whereas 76. 4 % {{of the cells}} treated with X rays at pachytene stage had aberrations, the frequencies observed in two TEM experiments were only 0. 8 and 2. 2 %. On the other hand, 5 % of the progeny from TEM-treated pachytene spermatocytes {{were found to be}} translocation heterozygotes. This is the first report on the recovery of heritable translocations from treated spermatocytes of mice. The aberration frequencies observed for TEM in diakinesis–metaphase I were much too low to account for all the lethal mutations and heritable translocations. Thus, the formation of the bulk of aberrations induced by TEM in pachytene spermatocytes was delayed—a marked contrast to the more immediate formation of X-ray-induced aberrations. It is postulated that the formation of the bulk of TEM-induced aberrations in pachytene spermatocytes and in certain postmeiotic stages occurs sometime during spermiogenesis, and not through the operation of postfertilization pronuclear DNA synthesis...|$|E

40|$|An intein-based {{positive}} {{genetic selection}} system {{was developed to}} study protein splicing {{and to provide a}} selection system with the potential for finding splicing inhibitors. Inteins can be novel anti-microbial targetswhen present in essential proteins since blocking splicing would kill the organism. For example, pathogenic mycobacteria encode inteins that interrupt DNA gyrase. The gyrase selection system exploits (1) splicing of inteins out of Gyrase A and (2) the <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>effect</b> of quinolone poisoning of DNA gyrase, which in turn blocks replication. The system was adapted for whole-cell high-throughput screening using green fluorescent protein as an automatable readout of viability. To demonstrate the efficacy of this system, mutations that blocked splicing of the Mycobacterium xenopi Gyrase A intein were isolated. Splicing was then assayed at a second temperature to identify inteins with a temperature-sensitive splicing phenotype. Mutations were mapped onto a structure-based sequence alignment, which led to the rational prediction of a temperature-sensitive splicing mu-tation. GyrA intein subdomain relationships also provided insight into intein evolution...|$|R

After a sterile period of 11 weeks, the treated animals were mated with {{untreated}} females; treated DBA with C 57 and treated C 57 with DBA. A small control group of untreated males was established, and a larger control group from earlier experiments was also used for comparison. Tissue samples removed surgically from the parents and F 1 offspring were examined by electrophoresis. Nine newly arisen mutants attributable to induction by EtNU were found in 22, 512 loci tested for mutation. No mutations were encountered in 290, 252 control locus tests. A preliminary study conducted concomitantly with the electrophoretic analyses for <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>effects</b> and physical malformation showed no increase over background due to EtNU treatment of spermatogonia, which suggests that mutations induced by EtNU tend not to be expressed in this way.

40|$|A special {{challenge}} in the new European Union chemicals legislation, Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals, will be the toxicological evaluation of chemicals for reproductive toxicity. Use of valid quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSARs) is a possibility under the new legislation. This article focuses on a screening exercise by use of our own and commercial QSAR models for identification of possible reproductive toxicants. Three QSAR models were used for reproductive toxicity for the endpoints teratogenic risk to humans (based on animal tests, clinical data and epidemiological human studies), <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>effect</b> in rodents (in vivo) and Drosophila melanogaster sex-linked recessive <b>lethal</b> <b>effect.</b> A structure set of 57, 014 European Inventory of Existing Chemical Substances (EINECS) chemicals was screened.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the structure and properties of a chromosomal product recovered from a rare recombination event between a t haplotype and a wild-type form of mouse chromosome 17. Our embryological and molecular studies indicate that this chromosome (twLub 2) is characterized by both a deletion and duplication of adjacent genetic material. The deletion appears {{to be responsible for}} a <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> maternal <b>effect</b> and a recessive embryonic lethality. The duplication provides an explanation for the twLub 2 suppression of the dominant T locus phenotype. A reanalysis of previously described results with another chromosome 17 variant called TtOrl indicates a structure for this chromosome that is reciprocal to that observed for twLub 2. We have postulated the existence of an inversion over the proximal portion of all complete t haplotypes in order to explain the generation of the partial t haplotypes t wLub 2 and TtOrl. This proximal inversion and the previously described distal inversion are sufficient to account for all of the recombination properties that are characteristic of complete t haplotypes. The structures determined for twLub 2 and TtOrl indicate that rare recombination can occur between nonequivalent genomic sequences within the inverted proximal t region when wild-type and t chromosomes are paired in a linear, nonhomologous configuration...|$|R
40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} H(+) -ATPase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is an essential}} protein that is required to establish cellular membrane potential and maintain a normal internal pH. An Asp- 378 to Asn substitution at the residue phosphorylated during catalysis is <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> when the pma 1 -D 378 N mutation is expressed along with a wild-type {{plasma membrane}} H(+) -ATPase (PMA 1) gene. Several mutations {{in the first two}} putative transmembrane domains are also <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal.</b> However, these <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> mutants often appear to be innocuous, because they are frequently lost by gene conversion to the wild-type sequence during the process of introducing the mutant sequence and subsequently removing the wild-type gene. Loss of the mutation by gene conversion does not occur while introducing recessive lethal mutations. Cells carrying the wild-type PMA 1 gene on the chromosome and a <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> mutation under the control of a GAL 1 promoter on a centromere-containing plasmid exhibit a galactose-dependent lethality.

40|$|Acrylonitrile (ACN) and {{acrylamide}} (AA), structurally similar vinyl monomers, {{are both}} animal carcinogens. ACN is weakly mutagenic in bacteria and induces sister-chromatid exchange, unscheduled DNA synthesis and cell transformation in cells in culture. AA induces chromosomal aberrations in bone mar-row, blood and germ cells in vivo, and dominant lethal mutations in the germ cells of male mice and rats. In the current study, {{the ability of}} AA and ACN to induce domi-nant lethal mutations in the germ cells of male Fischer 344 rats was compared. Three groups of 50 males were gavaged daily for 5 days with ACN (60 mg/kg in normal saline), AA (30 mg/kg in normal saline) or vehicle only; an additional group of 20 males received a single i. p. injection of 0. 2 mg/kg triethylenemelamine (TEM) {{on the afternoon of}} day 5. Start-ing 1 day after exposure, each male was bred to one female per week for 4 weeks (TEM-exposed group) or 10 weeks (ACN, AA and control groups). Mating rates were reduced only during week 1 in the TEM-treated group; pregnancy rates were reduced only during week 2 in the AA-exposed group and week 4 in the TEM-treated group. Females were necropsied 13 days {{after the end of the}} appropriate mating week and the amount of pre- and post-implantation loss calculated. ACN treatment of male rats induced no increases in either pre- or post-implantation loss in females in any of the 10 weeks post-exposure examined. AA induced significant-ly elevated amounts of post-implantation loss for 3 weeks after exposure and pre-implantation loss for 4 weeks post-exposure; both measures returned to control values for the remaining 6 weeks of the study. The positive control TEM caused both indices to increase during all 4 weeks examined. We conclude that AA is a dominant lethal mutagen in male rat germ cells in vivo, specifically in mature spermatozoa and late-stage spermatids. In contrast, the structurally related chemical ACN has neither fertility nor <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>effects</b> in the male Fischer 344 rat after oral administration, and may not pose a significant mutagenic risk to germ cells...|$|E

Several mutant alleles of PMA 1, the gene coding for the plasma membrane H +-ATPase, render misfolded proteins that are subjected to ERAD.

Optimal protection of the cells from the <b>lethal</b> <b>effect</b> of colicin E 2 was achieved with 0. 6 to 0. 8 m NaCl or with 0. 8 m sucrose containing 0. 01 m MgSO 4. Under such conditions, the degradation of deoxyribonucleic acid caused by colicin E 2 was also suppressed markedly. It was concluded that {{a high concentration of}} sucrose with Mg++ might prevent the action of the adsorbed colicin E 2. A similar protection was observed against the <b>lethal</b> <b>effect</b> of colicin K...|$|R

Methyl vinyl sulfone and divinyl sulfone {{were tested}} for the {{induction}} of <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> mutations and micronucleated bone-marrow erythrocytes in male mice. These chemicals were chosen for study because of their similarities in structure and chemical reactivity to acrylamide which is known to induce both effects. Following administration of the test compounds by intraperitoneal injection at the maximum tolerated doses, no evidence of induced <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> mutations or micronucleated bone-marrow cells was observed for either chemical. It is concluded that structures and Michael reactivities similar to acrylamide are not sufficient to impart similar in vivo genetic toxicity to MVS and DVS.
