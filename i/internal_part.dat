A marble torso, {{attributed}} to Antonio Canova and placed besides the main altar, represents Pope Pius VI. {{as well as the}} square, the church was designed by architect Francesco Navone. The church façade reproduces a simple geometry, as well as the <b>internal</b> <b>part,</b> characterized by longitudinal geometry including one nave and lateral chapels. On top of the church main door the coat of arms of Pope Pius VI, made in the laboratories of Antonio Canova, is on view.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} model, the job demands-resources (JD-R) model, {{grew out}} of the DCS model. In the JD-R model, the category of demands (workload) remains {{more or less the same}} as in the DCS model although the JD-R model more specifically includes physical demands. Resources, however, are defined as job-relevant features that help workers achieve work-related goals, lessen job demands, or stimulate personal growth. Control and support as per the DCS model are subsumed under resources. Resources can be external (provided by the organization) or <b>internal</b> (<b>part</b> of a worker's personal make-up). In addition to control and support, resources encompassed by the model can also include physical equipment, software, performance feedback from supervisors, the worker's own coping strategies, etc. There has not, however, been as much research on the JD-R model as there has been on the constituents of the DC or DCS model.|$|E
25|$|The Mailers Trade District Union (MTDU) was an <b>internal</b> <b>part</b> of the ITU. Lawsuits from 1926-1944 were {{fought for}} mailer rights. The MTDU was {{eventually}} abolished by court injunction and referendum vote. In 1929, ITU president Charles P. Howard selected third vice-president C. N. Smith (a printer) {{to represent the}} MTDU. The mailers were allowed to vote in 1930 for their MTDU representative; John Mc Ardle and Harold Mitchell served in 1934. Munro Roberts was elected as MTDU member of the executive council, (19351937) {{but he had no}} voice or vote. After many heated arguments with ITU President Howard and Secretary Randolph, Roberts became committed to a separate mailer union. Moreover, the International Mailers' Union (IMU), was created and many shops would have two boards, ITU and IMU. With the departure of Roberts, Thomas J. Martin represented the MTDU (19381944). The MTDU continued by court order; however, the mailers were again without an observer to the executive council. The 1947 Cleveland convention {{paved the way for the}} demise of the MTDU and the election of a mailer to the executive council. Joe Bailey (San Francisco-Oakland Mailers #M-18), was elected third vice-president before the 1948 Milwaukee convention. ITU President Woodruff Randolph saw a way to appease mailers returning after service in World War II. The agreement made between ITU President Randolph and Joe Bailey: only a Printer would ever be President, first and second Vice-President or Secretary-Treasurer of the ITU. The position of third Vice-President would be held only by a Mailer. The IMU lost much power to draw new membership. The IMU finally was finally fully merged into the ITU only in 1982, only five years before the union's demise. Joe Bailey served on the ITU executive council until 1973. A mailer would remain ITU third vice-president: Robert F. Ameln, (19741975) and the Canadian mailer, Allen J. Heritage, (19761986).|$|E

40|$|Two studies {{investigate}} children’s {{knowledge of}} <b>internal</b> <b>parts</b> and their endorsement of immanent causes for {{the behaviors of}} living and non-living things. Study 1, involving 48 preschoolers, showed that domain-specific knowledge of <b>internal</b> <b>parts</b> develops between ages 3 and 4. Study 2 included 43 4 -year-olds, 30 8 -year-olds, and 35 adults and showed that preschoolers do not endorse these <b>internal</b> <b>parts</b> as causally responsible for familiar biological events (e. g., movement, growth). Like adults and older children, however, preschoolers endorse an abstract cause, “its own energy, ” for animals but not for machines. The results suggest that children recognize domain-specific <b>internal</b> <b>parts</b> as early as age 4 but that their causal attributions are not yet anchored in a detailed biological theory. Findings are {{discussed in terms of}} theory change and an essentialist assumption. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

The {{external}} {{part of the}} main entrance is made of decorated tuff, while the <b>internal</b> <b>part</b> is carved of wood. The convent contains a 16th-century painting of the Annunciation. In front of it, is the 13th-century Madonna del Pilerio attributed to Giovanni da Taranto, while on the walls are four other anonymous 16th-century paintings: the Visitation, the Circumcision, the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Adoration of the Magi. In the apse is the altarpiece Transit of the Virgin (1570). The cymatium houses a painting portraying the Coronation of the Virgin, while {{at the base of}} the two columns are paintings, attributed to Michele Curia, the [...] "Master of Montecalvario", of two unidentified saints.

2500|$|The {{other type}} of {{external}} frame which recently was proposed, is made from composite plastic which is not flexible like current backpack straps and also {{it is a kind}} of material that can be shaped like human spine curvature. In this type of backpack, load directly transfers to the shoulders through the non-flexible straps. This non-flexible structure diminishes the momentum at lumbar region of the back. Strap curvature is shaped close to spine curvature and there are two flexible drawstrings to prevent backpack movement in transverse plane. The straps of this backpack are wide enough to distribute the pressure on shoulders and also a white glass wool layer is added to the <b>internal</b> <b>part</b> of them to absorb dynamic forces, which could be produced through walking. This backpack type is an experimental sample that need further options to be prepared for [...] usage. One of the benefits of backpack with external frame is preventing the spine to incline forward during walking that would be helpful in preventing damage of long term backpack carrying.|$|E

The sack is lined by a most delicate membrane of chitine, under {{which there is a}} double layer of corium; this double layer is united together by short, strong, transverse bundles of fibres, branched at both ends:[14] in some genera, the ovarian tubes extend between these two layers. We have seen, under the head of the Metamorphoses, that the delicate tunic lining the sack is simply a duplicature of the thick membrane and valves forming the capitulum, the whole being the posterior portion of the carapace of the larva slightly modified.|$|E

60|$|Now, as {{he concludes}} from these five reasons {{that not one}} indeed is righteous, so he concludes by five more that none can do good to make him so--1. For that {{internally}} they are as an open sepulchre, as full of dead men's bones. Their minds and consciences are defiled; how then can sweet and good proceed from thence? (v 13). 2. Their throat is filled with this stink; all their vocal duties therefore smell thereof. 3. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; how then can there be found one word that should please God? 4. Their tongue, which should present their praise to God, {{has been used to}} work deceit; how then, until it is made a new one, should it speak in righteousness? 5. The poison of asps is under their lips; therefore whatever comes from them must be polluted (Rom 3:11-14; Matt 23:27; Titus 1:15; Jer 44:17, 17:9). Thus, you see, he sets forth their <b>internal</b> <b>part,</b> which being a true report, as to be sure it is, it is impossible that any good should so much as be framed in such an inward part, or come clean out of such a throat, by such a tongue, through such lips as these.|$|E
6000|$|Less startling perhaps, {{though still}} startling enough, {{is the fact}} that the eye is evolved out of a portion of the skin; and that while the {{crystalline}} lens and its surroundings thus originate, the [...] "percipient portions of the organs of special sense, especially of optic organs, are often formed from the same part of the primitive epidermis" [...] which forms the central nervous system.[59] Similarly is it with the organs for smelling and hearing. These, too, begin as sacs formed by infoldings of the epidermis; and while their parts are developing they are joined from within by nervous structures which were themselves epidermic in origin. How are we to interpret these strange transformations? Observing, as we pass, how absurd from the point of view of the special-creationist, would appear such a filiation of structures, and such a round-about mode of embryonic development, we have here to remark that the process is not one to have been anticipated as a result of natural selection. After numbers of spontaneous variations had occurred, as the hypothesis implies, in useless ways, the variation which primarily initiated a nervous centre might reasonably have been expected to occur in some <b>internal</b> <b>part</b> where it would be fitly located. Its initiation in a dangerous place and subsequent migration to a safe place, would be incomprehensible. Not so if we bear in mind the cardinal truth above set forth, that the structures for holding converse with the medium and its contents, arise in that completely superficial part which is directly affected by the medium and its contents; and if we draw the inference that the external actions themselves initiate the structures. These once commenced, and furthered by natural selection where favourable to life, would form the first term of a series ending in developed sense organs and a developed nervous system.[60] ...|$|E
6000|$|I did not {{at first}} find it at all an easy matter to make test weights so alike as to differ in no other appreciable respect than in their {{specific}} gravity, and if they differ and become known apart, the knowledge so acquired will vitiate future judgments in various indirect ways. Similarity in outward shape and touch was ensured {{by the use of}} mechanically-made cartridge cases; dissimilarity through any external stain was rendered of no hindrance to the experiment by making the operatee handle them in a bag or with his eyes shut. Two bodies may, however, be alike in weight and outward appearance and yet behave differently when otherwise mechanically tested, and, consequently, when they are handled. For example, take two eggs, one raw and the other hard boiled, and spin them on the table; press the finger for a moment upon either of them whilst it is still spinning: if it be the hard-boiled egg it will stop as dead as a stone: if it be the raw egg, after a little apparent hesitation, it will begin again to rotate. The motion of its shell had alone been stopped; the <b>internal</b> <b>part</b> was still rotating and this compelled the shell to follow it. Owing to this cause, when we handle the two eggs, the one feels [...] "quick" [...] and the other does not. Similarly with the cartridges, when one is rather more loosely packed than the others the difference is perceived on handling them. Or it may have one end heavier than the other, or else its weight may not be equally distributed round its axis, causing it to rest on the table with the same part always lowermost; differences due to these causes are also easily perceived when handling the cartridges. Again, one of two similar cartridges may balance perfectly in all directions, but the weight of one of them may be disposed too much towards the ends, as in a dumb-bell, or gathered too much towards the centre. The period of oscillation will differ widely in the two cases, as may be shown by suspending the cartridges by strings round their middle so that they shall hang horizontally, and then by a slight tap making them spin to and fro round the string as an axis.|$|E
