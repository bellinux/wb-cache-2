5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river crossings. At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges. The fords offer visitors {{a chance to}} actually drive through the creek, though high water frequently closes the crossings. Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> exit from the campground. When high water closes the fords, the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E

25|$|Cardiopulmonary {{resuscitation}} (CPR) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> {{procedure that}} combines chest compressions often with artificial ventilation {{in an effort}} to manually preserve intact brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest. It is recommended in those who are unresponsive with no breathing or abnormal breathing, for example, agonal respirations.|$|E
25|$|The ship's {{steering}} gear {{consists of a}} steering unit and twin semi-balanced underhung rudders. There <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> steering station in the superstructure {{in the event of}} damage to the bridge and they can also be operated by hand from the {{steering gear}} compartment. To improve the ship's performance in a seaway, they are fitted with a B+V Simplex Compact stabiliser system.|$|E
25|$|Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, strict {{security}} has been implemented {{at all of}} Boston's airports.

25|$|Usage of {{emergency}} vehicle lighting is restricted in the United Kingdom through the Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989. It is illegal for any vehicle {{to show a}} flashing colored light (with {{the exception of the}} normal direction indicators or a green anti-lock brake warning indicator), unless it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> or other authorized vehicle. However recently pedal cycles can exhibit a flashing rear red lamp and flashing white front lamp.|$|E
25|$|The game is {{controlled}} {{by a number of}} field umpires (at elite level, three), two boundary umpires (now four at elite level) whose main job is to conduct throw-ins when the ball leaves the field of play and two goal umpires who judge which scores are recorded, and are the official score-keepers of the game. In addition, there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> umpire, who can replace any field umpire who becomes injured. Each of the eight umpires may report players, but only field umpires may award free kicks.|$|E
25|$|Ankle weights {{provide a}} large lever arm {{for a small}} amount of weight and are very {{effective}} at correcting head-down trim problems, but the addition of mass to the feet increases the work of propulsion significantly. This may not be noticed on a relaxed dive, where {{there is no need to}} swim far or fast, but if there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> and the diver needs to swim hard, ankle weights will be a significant handicap, particularly if the diver is marginally fit for the conditions.|$|E

25|$|Advanced Emergency Medical Technician - Critical Care (EMT-CC) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>Emergency</b> Medical Services (EMS) {{certification}} {{unique to}} New York. The curriculum for AEMT-CC's in New York {{is similar to}} that of the national standard EMT-I/99 (EMT-Intermediate - I/99) but with a broader scope of practice. EMT-CCs are fully classified as Advanced Life Support (ALS) providers within New York and are trained in advanced airway management, including intubation, IV fluid administration, cardiac monitoring, cardiac pacing, and both synchronized and unsynchronized cardioversion, and medication usage/administration in adult and pediatric patients.|$|E
25|$|Transcutaneous pacing (TCP), {{also called}} {{external}} pacing, {{is recommended for}} the initial stabilization of hemodynamically significant bradycardias of all types. The procedure is performed by placing two pacing pads on the patient's chest, either in the anterior/lateral position or the anterior/posterior position. The rescuer selects the pacing rate, and gradually increases the pacing current (measured in mA) until electrical capture (characterized by a wide QRS complex with a tall, broad T wave on the ECG) is achieved, with a corresponding pulse. Pacing artifact on the ECG and severe muscle twitching may make this determination difficult. External pacing should not be relied upon {{for an extended period}} of time. It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> procedure that acts as a bridge until transvenous pacing or other therapies can be applied.|$|E
25|$|The PT-76 has {{a typical}} tank layout: the {{steering}} compartment at the front, the combat compartment {{in the center}} and the engine compartment at the back. The tank has a three-man crew, with the commander also acting as the radio operator and gunner. This reduces his effectiveness as an observer. The commander and loader stations are located inside the turret, the commander sits {{on the left side of}} the main gun and the loader sits on the right. They have a large oval shaped double hatch, which opens forwards on top of the turret. The driver sits in the center of the front of the hull and has a one piece hatch that opens to the right, with three vision blocks and periscopes located beneath the main gun at the top of the sloping glacis plate. Under the driver's seat, there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> hatch that can be used by all crew members. At night, the center periscope is swapped for a TVN-2B night vision device which gives the driver clear vision up to 60 meters.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{trackway}} {{just east}} of Roosevelt Avenue that diverges away from the Manhattan-bound local track. The trackway ramps up to {{the same level as}} the two trackways coming from the never-used Roosevelt Avenue Terminal, making three trackways on the upper level. The ramp flies over the mainline tracks along with the two other trackways. Between 78th and 79th Streets, the three trackways on upper level curve towards the south and ending at the wall at the edge of constructed subway. There is a diverging bellmouth next to the Jamaica-bound local track several hundred feet north of the station just at the location where the three upstairs trackways are crossing over. This bellmouth also curves towards the south and similarly ends on a concrete wall shortly after the start of the bellmouth. At the end of the unused tunnel there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> exit that opens out to the south side of Broadway across the street from Elmhurst Hospital Center. The four-track subway running south was a plan for a line along the Long Island Rail Road right-of-way to Garfield Avenue and 65th Place. The line, called the Winfield Spur, would have turned along 65th Place to Fresh Pond Road and then along Fresh Pond Road to Cypress Hills Street. The line would have merged with the Myrtle–Central Avenues Line to the Rockaways proposed in 1929. All four trackways end at a concrete wall where they begin to diverge from the excavation for the existing line.|$|E
500|$|The tram is {{propelled}} by three independent drive systems. The primary drive is a 450 kilowatt (600 hp) variable-frequency electric motor. Two hydrostatic diesel engines are {{also part of}} the design: one is a standby drive, permitting operation during a power outage; the other <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> evacuation drive. [...] A 40-ton counterweight offsets the weight of the cars. [...] The tram is capable of operating at speeds up to 22 miles per hour (35km per hour).|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Punitive Medicine (1979) Alexander Podrabinek defined the term [...] "punitive medicine", which is {{identified}} with [...] "punitive psychiatry," [...] as [...] "a {{tool in the}} struggle against dissidents who cannot be punished by legal means." [...] Punitive psychiatry is neither a discrete subject nor a psychiatric specialty but, rather, it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> arising within many applied sciences in totalitarian countries where members of a profession may feel themselves compelled to serve the diktats of power. Psychiatric confinement of sane people is uniformly considered a particularly pernicious form of repression and Soviet punitive psychiatry was one of the key weapons of both illegal and legal repression.|$|E
