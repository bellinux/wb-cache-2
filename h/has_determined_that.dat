5|$|Under Oregon law, Goldschmidt {{would have}} been {{required}} to register as a sex offender, had he been convicted {{of the crime of}} third degree rape.

Oregon case law <b>has</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the registration of offenders whose acts were committed prior to the passage of the law does not violate either Oregon’s Constitution or the United States Constitution’s prohibition on ex post facto laws.|$|E
5|$|Chira Endress, {{a student}} of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on a section of glaciogenic sediments {{immediately}} beneath the same Ice Peak trachyte lava flow sampled and described by Jeff Hungerford during his 2006 studies. Endress ettempted {{to determine if the}} sediments were deposited immediately before the lava flow was emplaced, or if {{they are likely to be}} much older. Endress has quantified the mineralogy of clasts and sand-sized particles from samples in the sediment, and <b>has</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the mineralogy of several of the trachytic clasts is very similar to that in the overlying lava flow, including the minerals clinopyroxene, magnetite, alkali feldspar, and aenigmatite. Endress has also found small lenses of pristine basaltic glass, which could have derived from the Pillow Ridge subglacial mound near Mount Edziza.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for the {{carcinogenicity}} of 1,3-dichloropropene {{in humans}} is inadequate, but results from several cancer bioassays provide adequate evidence of carcinogenicity in animals.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) <b>has</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> 1,3-dichloropropene is possibly carcinogenic to humans.
