Mengele later attempts to recreate the sociological environment of Hitler's youth, beginning with killing the fathers of all the Hitler clones. Mengele's plan is to eventually create a second Hitler who will come of age in the 21st century and establish the Fourth Reich.|$|E

[...] He said the process left him [...] "pretty much burnt" [...] and said his enthusiasm for the show had [...] "eroded as time goes on". It was initially reported that Beatty would not return for the second Homicide season at all because he had accepted a starring role <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Boys,</b> a CBS comedy series also featuring Christopher Meloni. Polito {{said he did not}} believe Beatty's departure would hurt the show because of the ensemble nature of the cast: [...] "I love Ned's work, but the show won't fall apart because of one character."

According to Aaron Bynum from AnimationInsider.net, [...] "the series posted double digit year-to-year gains in May".

500|$|The Alden Tavern is {{well known}} for being the site of the horsewhipping of a captive General Richard Prescott, {{commander}} of the British troops of Rhode Island, by the tavern's owner Captain Alden. Several days after Prescott's capture, he was escorted to General George Washington's headquarters, but on the trip came to dine at Alden's tavern. Several books detail different accounts and portrayals of the exchanges which led to Prescott's whipping, all involving the Prescott being served [...] "the common dish of corn and beans" [...] and throwing the food on the floor. Three of Benson Lossing's books recount this tale, in The Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution Volume 1 (1852), Our Countrymen (1855) and Lives of Celebrated Americans: Comprising Biographies of Three Hundred and Forty Eminent Persons (1869). It also appears in similar wording <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Boys</b> of '76: A History of the Battles of the Revolution by Charles Coffin in 1876, with Prescott's line being: [...] "Do you give me the pigs' feed". The story has persisted and a fictional account was referenced in 2010 in Martha Finley's Elsie Yachting with the Raymonds.|$|E

500|$|Newkirk {{was born}} in New York City on 15 October 1913. One year later {{his family moved to}} Scarsdale, New York, where his father, Louis Hasbrouck Newkirk, worked as an attorney. Newkirk was known within the {{extended}} family as [...] "Scarsdale Jack," [...] to distinguish him from a younger cousin with the same name. At age ten, Newkirk was awarded a vocal scholarship to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine where he sang <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> choir and attended the Cathedral School until age 14. Thereafter, Newkirk attended Scarsdale High School from which he graduated in 1932. During this time he was also active in the Boy Scouts of America and received his Eagle Scout medal from Admiral Richard E. Byrd at a ceremony in White Plains, New York. In the fall of 1932, Newkirk entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, to study aeronautical engineering. However, he was unable to afford tuition {{during the height of the}} Great Depression and dropped out after only one year. Newkirk subsequently worked odd jobs in New York City and served a brief stint in the New York National Guard until the fall of 1937, when he returned to Rensselaer to continue his studies.|$|E
500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh. OK, well, check this out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Former U.S. Marine Drill Instructor Ermey, {{originally}} {{hired as}} a technical advisor, asked Kubrick if he could audition {{for the role of}} Hartman. Kubrick had seen Ermey's portrayal of Drill Instructor Staff Sergeant Loyce <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Boys</b> in Company C (1978) and told the Marine that he was not vicious enough to play the character. Ermey improvised insulting dialogue against a group of Royal Marines who were being considered for the part of background Marines, to demonstrate his ability to play the character, as well as to show how a Drill Instructor goes about breaking down the individuality of new recruits. Upon viewing the videotape of these sessions, Kubrick gave Ermey the role, realizing he [...] "was a genius for this part." [...] Kubrick also incorporated the 250-page transcript of Ermey's rants into the script. Ermey's experience as a Drill Instructor during the Vietnam era proved invaluable.
