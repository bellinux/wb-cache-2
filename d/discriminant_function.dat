These <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> reside in the states of a Finite State Automata, which {{has the ability to}} reason 1 and logically combine the hypersurfaces to generate a complex decision space. An object may be classified by one or many of the <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions,</b> this is decided by the automata. During the evolution of this symbiotic architecture, fea-ture selection for each of the <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> is achieved implicitly, a task which is normally performed before a classification algorithm is trained. Since each dis-criminant function has different features, and objects may be classified with one or more <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions,</b> no two objects from the same class need be classified using the same features.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the notion of discriminatory power of a pattern {{classifier}} acting over a feature space. <b>Discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> are normally used to trace out regions of the feature space corresponding to specific pattern classes. Indeterminate cases occur whenever a pattern lies on a class boundary. The number of occurrences of such indeterminacies measures the relative discriminatory power of a family of <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions.</b> In this paper these concepts are applied to majority voting decisions. It is first shown how regular majority voting leads to <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> with insufficient discriminatory power whenever intransitive social ordering occurs. An (improved) family of <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> is proposed to resolve such cases. ...|$|R

40|$|AimTo develop <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> for sex {{estimation}} on medieval Croatian {{population and}} test their application on contemporary Croatian population. MethodsFrom {{a total of}} 519 skeletons, we chose 84 adult excellently preserved skeletons free of antemortem and postmortem changes and took all standard measurements. Sex was estimated/determined using standard anthropological procedures and ancient DNA (amelogenin analysis) where pelvis was insufficiently preserved or where sex morphological indicators were not consistent. We explored which measurements showed sexual dimorphism and used them for developing univariate and multivariate <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> for sex estimation. We included only those functions that reached accuracy rate 80 %. We tested the applicability of developed functions on modern Croatian sample (n= 37). ResultsFrom 69 standard skeletal measurements used in this study, 56 of them showed statistically significant sexual dimorphism (74. 7 %). We developed five univariate <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> with classification rate 80. 6 %- 85. 2 % and seven multivariate <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> with an accuracy rate of 81. 8 %- 93. 0 %. When tested on the modern population functions showed classification rates 74. 1 %- 100 %, and ten of them reached aimed accuracy rate. Females showed higher classification rates in the medieval populations, whereas males were better classified in the modern populations. ConclusionDeveloped <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> are sufficiently accurate for reliable sex estimation in both medieval Croatian population and modern Croatian samples and {{may be used in}} forensic settings.

The two-group method should be used when the dependent variable has two categories or states. The multiple discriminant method is used when the dependent variable has three or more categorical states. Use Wilks’s Lambda to test for significance in SPSS or F stat in SAS. The most common method used to test validity is to split the sample into an estimation or analysis sample, and a validation or holdout sample.

40|$|International audienceThe {{presence}} of complex distributions of samples concealed in high-dimensional, massive sample-size data challenges {{all of the}} current classification methods for data mining. Samples within a class usually do not uniformly fill a certain (sub) space but are individually concentrated in certain regions of diverse feature subspaces, revealing the class dispersion. Current classifiers applied to such complex data inherently suffer from either high complexity or weak classification ability, due to the imbalance between flexibility and generalization ability of the <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> used by these classifiers. To address this concern, we propose a novel representation of <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> in Bayesian inference, which allows multiple Bayesian decision boundaries per class, each in its individual subspace. For this purpose, we design a learning algorithm that incorporates the naive Bayes and feature weighting approaches into structural risk minimization to learn multiple Bayesian <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> for each class, thus combining the simplicity and effectiveness of naive Bayes {{and the benefits of}} feature weighting in handling high-dimensional data. The proposed learning scheme affords a recursive algorithm for exploring class density distribution for Bayesian estimation, and an automated approach for selecting powerful <b>discriminant</b> <b>functions</b> while keeping the complexity of the classifier low. Experimental results on real-world data characterized by millions of samples and features demonstrate the promising performance of our approach...|$|R
