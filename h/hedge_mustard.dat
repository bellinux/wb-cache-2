50|$|Sisymbrium altissimum is {{a species}} of Sisymbrium. The plant is native to {{the western part of}} the Mediterranean Basin in Europe and Northern Africa and is widely {{naturalized}} throughout most of the world, including all of North America. It was probably introduced into North America by a contaminant crop seed. The plant grows in soils of all , even sand. The plant germinates in winter or early spring. The blooming time is lengthy, and after maturity the plant forms a tumbleweed. Common names of the plant include Jim Hill mustard, after James J. Hill, a Canadian-American railroad magnate, tall tumblemustard, tall mustard, tumble mustard, tumbleweed mustard, tall sisymbrium, and tall <b>hedge</b> <b>mustard.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sisymbrium loeselii is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the mustard family known by several common names, including small tumbleweed mustard, false London-rocket, and tall <b>hedge</b> <b>mustard.</b> It is native to Eurasia, and it is known on other continents as an introduced species and in some areas a common roadside weed. It is an annual herb producing a hairy, erect stem which can exceed a meter in height. The leaf blades are divided into triangular, lance-shaped, and toothed linear lobes, and are borne on petioles. The top of the stem is occupied by a raceme of flowers with bright yellow petals each measuring just under a centimeter long. The fruit is a silique up to 3.5 centimeters in length containing tiny seeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{small white}} will readily lay eggs on both {{cultivated}} and wild {{members of the}} cabbage family, such as Charlock (Sinapis arvensis) and <b>Hedge</b> <b>mustard</b> (Sisymbrium officinale). P. rapae is known to lay eggs singularly on the host plant. The egg {{is characterized by a}} yellowish color and 12 longitudinal ridges. The egg production peaks about a week after adulthood in lab and the female can live up to 3 weeks. Females tend to lay fewer eggs on plants in clumps than on isolated plants. It has been suggested that isothiocyanate compounds in the family Brassicaceae may have been evolved to reduce herbivory by caterpillars of the small white. However, this suggestion is not generally accepted because the small white has later been shown to be immune to the isothiocyanate forming reaction due to a specific biochemical adaptation. In contrast, the small white and relatives seem to have evolved as a consequence of this biochemical adaptation to the isothiocyanate-forming glucosinolates.|$|E

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effect}} of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) sowing density on weed growth and development. In glasshouse and field experiments, perennial ryegrass was sown at rates of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 kg/ha, with 5 kg/haof white clover (Trifolium repens). With increasing seeding density, perennial ryegrass enhanced its competitiveness against all five of the weeds studied, viz. nodding thistle (Carduus nutans), Californian thistle (Cirsium arvense), Scotch thistle (Cirsium vulgare), ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) and <b>hedge</b> <b>mustard</b> (Sisymbrium officinale).

40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} {{to determine whether the}} weed control benefits of high sowing rates of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) continued into the second year after sowing. Seeds of Scotch thistle (Cirsium vulgare), nodding thistle (Carduus nutans), ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) and <b>hedge</b> <b>mustard</b> (Sisymbrium officinale) were sown into established perennial ryegrass and white clover (Trifolium repens) swards both in trays and in the field, in late autumn. The emerging weed seedlings were mapped at intervals to enable their fate to be followed. In the trays, seedlings were mapped at four week intervals, and the experiment continued for four or five months, depending on the species. In the field, weed seedlings were mapped both before and after each grazing and the experiment continued for seven months. The trays with low ryegrass sowing rates had a higher density of white clover than those trays with high ryegrass sowing rates. In the field plots with low sowing rates, both the broad-leaved weed population and volunteer grasses were more abundant than in the high ryegrass sowing rate plots. This resulted in the different treatments having a similar competitive ability against the sown weed seeds, one year after the swards were sown. Both nodding thistle and Scotch thistle emergence was extremely low in the bare ground trays, probably relating to seed predation of these large seeds off bare soil. Scotch thistle and <b>hedge</b> <b>mustard</b> emergence were both reduced by high sowing rates of perennial ryegrass when compared to trays and field plots sown with white clover only. Nodding thistle and ragwort however provided some unusual results. Both of these species experienced an increase in total emergence as ryegrass sowing rate increased. With nodding thistle, this occurred in the field and with ragwort, in the trays. This obviously was unexpected but in reality the increases in emergence, although significant, were small and of little practical importance. The increases probably related to the similar competitive ability of the swards one year after pasture sowing. Emergence of ragwort in the field and nodding thistle in the trays was not affected by ryegrass sowing rate. For all species, in both the field and the trays, emergence was delayed as the sowing rate increased. There was very low mortality in the tray experiment. Mortality was much higher in the field due to the effects of grazing animals and also the longer time frame of the field experiment. All <b>hedge</b> <b>mustard</b> seedlings that emerged in the field were killed, and only one nodding thistle seedling survived {{to the end of the}} experiment. With both Scotch thistle and ragwort, seedlings seemed to have a higher chance of surviving in the high density ryegrass treatments, probably due to the physical protection from grazing animals provided by ryegrass. High mortality in the field experiment rendered seedling size data meaningless. In the trays, for all species, the heaviest seedlings were found in the treatments with either bare ground or where only clover was sown, indicating that competition from ryegrass had a serious negative effect on weed size. Weed size did not vary significantly as ryegrass sowing rate increased. In conclusion it would appear that most of the weed control advantages from higher sowing rates of perennial ryegrass are obtained in the first year after sowing, as all swards that contain perennial ryegrass appear to have a similar competitive ability against invading weeds in the second year after sowing...|$|E
40|$|No - till {{systems have}} been widely adopted by farmers in Australia {{over the past decade}} to reduce soil erosion, improve soil {{physical}} and chemical properties, conserve soil moisture and save on fuel costs. These changes in tillage practices can have a major influence on the ecology and management of weeds. Studies were undertaken on the seed biology of six important Australian weed species to provide underpinning knowledge of their response to tillage. Field studies were also undertaken to investigate the effect of no - till on weed seedling emergence, seed bank persistence and herbicide behaviour. Seed germination of threehorn bedstraw and wild turnip, the latter only at sub - optimal temperatures, was inhibited by light. In contrast, seed germination of common sowthistle and Indian <b>hedge</b> <b>mustard</b> was stimulated by light. Seed germination of small - flowered mallow was not influenced by the light conditions. Seedling emergence of threehorn bedstraw, wild turnip, small - flowered mallow and annual ryegrass was low on the soil surface but increased with shallow burial, which suggests that farming practices that achieve shallow burial of seeds are likely to promote greater seedling emergence of these weed species. In contrast, seedling emergence of common sowthistle and Indian <b>hedge</b> <b>mustard</b> was greatest for the seeds present on the soil surface and emergence decreased with increased burial depth. In field experiments, low soil disturbance tillage systems left more seeds on the soil surface after crop sowing, whereas high soil disturbance systems buried most of the seeds. Seedling emergence of annual ryegrass, threehorn bedstraw and wild radish was greater under minimum tillage than no - till system. In contrast, seedling emergence of Indian <b>hedge</b> <b>mustard,</b> common sowthistle, silvergrass, small - flowered mallow and turnipweed was greater under the no - till system. Seedling emergence of wild oat and wild turnip was not influenced by the tillage system. Even though seedling emergence of annual ryegrass was much lower under no - till, the persistence of residual viable seeds of annual ryegrass from one season to the next was similar between the tillage systems. This was because of much greater seed decay under no - till (48 to 60 %) than that recorded under minimum tillage (12 to 39 %). All dinitroaniline herbicides (trifluralin, pendimethalin and oryzalin) were more effective in reducing the number of plants, spikes, dry matter and seed production of annual ryegrass when incorporated at sowing with tines than with the discs. At Minlaton in 2004 and 2005, bioavailable trifluralin was greater under tillage systems with greater levels of soil disturbance than under lower soil disturbance systems. In the absence of the herbicide, annual ryegrass was less competitive with wheat under the disc - sown systems. The response of grain yield to herbicides was greater under the tine - sown systems than the disc - sown systems. The performance of S - metolachlor on annual ryegrass control was investigated under no - till. The control of annual ryegrass was greater than 80 % when S - metolachlor was applied at sowing (incorporated by sowing or post - sowing pre - emergence). However, application of the herbicide at sowing resulted in phytotoxic effects on crop emergence and grain yield of wheat. Application of S - metolachlor at 20 or 23 days before sowing not only provided effective control (74 to 83 %) of annual ryegrass, it was also safe on wheat. Application of this herbicide at 40 or 46 days before sowing was relatively ineffective in controlling annual ryegrass (33 to 49 % weed kill) but safe on wheat. In conclusion, soil disturbance caused by tillage was found to have a major influence on the behaviour of the seed bank of different species including seedling emergence and decay rates of weed seeds. However, the response to tillage tended to be species - specific and was related to their seed biology. Tillage systems also had a major influence on the efficacy and bioavailability of trifluralin, which is prone to volatilisation losses. The findings of this research program are expected to contribute to the improvement in weed management under no - till systems. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] School of Agriculture, Food and Wine, 2006...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} that flowering herbs, which grow naturally or are sown adjacent to agricultural fields, {{may be an important}} source of nutrients for natural enemies. Many parasitoids readily feed on plant exudates such as floral nectar, which contain different types of sugars that enable the insects to optimize their longevity, mobility and reproductive success. However, leaf tissues of plants grown in the margins of agricultural fields may also provide food for immature stages of insect herbivores, such as caterpillars, that are in turn attacked by parasitoids. Herbivores and their parasitoids may later disperse into the crop, so the nutritional quality of surrounding plants, as this affects herbivore and parasitoid fitness, may also influence the success of biological control programmes, especially later in the season. Here, we compare the suitability of three species of cruciferous plants (Brassicaceae) on the development of Pieris rapae L. (Lep., Pieridae) and its solitary endoparasitoid, Cotesia rubecula Marshall (Hym., Bracondiae). Insects were reared on a feral population of cabbage, Brassica oleracea, on radish Raphanus sativus, which is widely sown in agricultural margins, and on <b>hedge</b> <b>mustard,</b> Sisymbrium officinale, a wild crucifer which often grows in medium to large stands along road verges and field edges. Development time in both the herbivore and parasitoid were extended on R. sativus, compared with the other two species, whereas C. rubecula completed its development most rapidly on B. oleracea. Moreover, adult butterflies and parasitoids were significantly smaller when reared on R. sativus plants. Our results reveal that differences in the quality of plants growing adjacent to agricultural fields can affect the development of key herbivores and their parasitoids. This should be borne in mind when establishing criteria for the selection of floral biodiversity. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} my {{research}} was on the secondary metabolites produced by crucifer plants under stress and their biological activity against fungi. Both cultivated and wild plants were investigated to isolate phytoalexins and phytoanticipins, and determine their metabolite profiles. The first chapter of this thesis describes cruciferous plants and their most important pathogenic fungi. These plants are divided into three groups: oilseeds, vegetables and wild species. The metabolites isolated from these plants and their biosynthetic studies are reviewed. In addition economically important necrotrophic fungi such as Leptosphaeria maculans, Alternaria brassicae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Rhizoctonia solani are also reviewed along with their phytotoxins. The second chapter of this thesis describes the detection, isolation, structure determination, syntheses of stress metabolites and biological activity of these metabolites against L. maculans, S. sclerotiorum and R. solani. The investigation of cauliflower led to the isolation of seven phytoalexins: 1 -methoxybrassitin (55), spirobrassinin (71), isalexin (64), brassicanal C (60), caulilexins A (106), B (107), and C (105). The phytoalexins caulilexins A (106), B (107) and C (105) were reported for the first time. Caulilexin A (106), having a disulfide bridge, showed the highest activity against S. sclerotiorum and R. solani among the known phytoalexins. Similarly four phytoalexins: 1 -methoxybrassitin, brussalexins A (121), B (117) and C (118) along with four metabolites: ascorbigen (51), diindolylmethane (50), 1 -methoxy- 3, 3 ’-diindolylmethane (119) and di-(1 -methoxy- 3 -indolyl) methane (120) were isolated from Brussels sprouts. The phytoalexins brussalexins A (121), B (117) and C (118) are new metabolites. Brussalexin A (121) is the only cruciferous phytoalexins having an allyl thiolcarbamate functional group. The metabolite 1 -methoxy- 3, 3 ’-diindolylmethane (119) is reported for the first time. The investigation of brown mustard for polar metabolites led to the isolation of indole- 3 -acetonitrile (76) and spirobrassinin (71) along with isorhamnetin- 3, 7 -diglucoside (134). Investigation of wild species such as Asian mustard, sand rocket, wallrocket, <b>hedge</b> <b>mustard</b> and Abyssinian mustard for production of stress metabolites led to the isolation of indole- 3 -acetonitrile (76), arvelexin (84), 1, 4 -dimethoxyindole- 3 -acetonitrile (137), rapalexins A (138) and B (142), methyl- 1 -methoxyindole- 3 -carboxylate (59) and metabolites bis(4 -isothiocyanotobutyl) -disulfide (139), 5 -(3 -isothiocyanato-propylsulfanyl) -pentylisothiocyanate (136) and 3 -(methylsulfinyl) -propylisothiocyanate (135). Two metabolites were also isolated from Brussels sprouts and brown mustard; however, these structures are not yet determined.

40|$|Scaptomyza flava Fallén (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is a {{leaf miner}} of Cruciferous plants (Brassicaceae). It occurs {{throughout}} New Zealand {{and in many}} other parts of the world. S. flava attacks living plants but also lays eggs on dead leaves and larvae can develop in dead and decaying plant material. However, survival to the adult stage is greater when larvae develop on live leaves. Females are polygamous and mating begins soon after emergence. Female flies start puncturing leaves with their ovipositor ca. 4 h. after emergence and produce peak numbers of punctures within the first 12 h. of their adult lives. It is during this peak time of puncture production that egg laying begins. Oviposition starts on the day following emergence and lasts for about two weeks. After this oviposition rate declines slowly. Eggs are laid mainly between 06. 00 and 10. 00 h. and between 17. 00 and 20. 00 h. with a peak between 09. 00 - 10. 00 h. and 17. 00 - 18. 00 h. The mean number of eggs laid per female per day is dependent on the availability of host plants and ranges from 20. 9 to 4. 4 eggs per day. Maximum oviposition varies between different host plant species. The total fecundity of some females was as high as 320 eggs (on turnip and in contrast less than 12 eggs on cauliflower) over a lifespan of about 12 days. The larvae destroys the parenchyma of leaves. Although {{only a small portion of}} the lamina is damaged by a single larva - approximately 5 cm 2. Most plant injury is caused by feeding by the third-instar larva which lasts about one week. Sex ratios of adults were close to 1 : 1 with a slight bias in favour of males. Feeding punctures and fecundity of S. flava increase greatly when given honey solution. For both sexes, longevity is affected by adult food source. Caged adult female S. flava lived significantly longer when provided with honey solution and yeast than when confined on glass plates and starved or allowed access to yeast and water only. Virgin females lived only slightly longer than mated females and unmated males lived significantly longer than all other groups. S. flava is an oligophagous insect with host plants restricted to the Brassicaceae. When S. flava adults were given a simultaneous choice of seven plant species for feeding and oviposition, there was a distinct hierarchical ordering in their ovipositional preference, with turnip, Chinese cabbage, and <b>hedge</b> <b>mustard</b> being preferred over all others. Percentage of punctures with eggs for turnip, Chinese cabbage and cauliflower (three main host plants of S. flava) in choice tests were 3. 1, 3 and 6. 4 % and in non-choice tests 6, 5. 4 and 28 % respectively. In non-choice tests, females laid more eggs on Chinese cabbage and turnip than other Brassicaceae. Egg production was also different between host plants. Females oviposited means of 255, 165 and 48 eggs during their lifespan when maintained on turnip, Chinese cabbage and cauliflower, respectively. Peak egg production period varied between host plants; on cauliflower, peak production occurred 3 - 7 days from adult emergence and on Chinese cabbage and turnip between days 7 - 11 from emergence. There were also significant differences in total developmental times of the insect between three Brassicaceous host plants (cauliflower 41 d, Chinese cabbage 33. 7 d and turnip 31 d). There were significant differences in duration of the 3 rd larval instar among the host plant species with the longest duration on cauliflower (8 d). Fecundity of S. flava was positively correlated with female body weight and greater female weights resulted when insects were raised on turnip and Chinese cabbage compared to cauliflower. Although all leaf sizes and/or ages were accepted by the insects (with the exception of the smallest leaves) for egg laying, the number of feeding punctures and eggs per cm 2 leaf increased with increasing leaf size and/or age. Nitrogen content of leaves did not vary significantly with age. Previous larval feeding experience on turnip and Chinese cabbage appeared to modify adult host plant preference, but previous feeding experience as larvae on a poor host, cauliflower, did not increase egg laying on that host by adult females. Recently eclosed adult S. flava may show positive experience effects on turnip (and slightly on Chinese cabbage). Over a two year period in the Manawatu adults and larvae of S. flava were present throughout the year with no evidence of diapause or aestivation. However, there were marked peaks during spring and early summer in numbers of adult flies caught, and again in autumn to early winter with troughs in early autumn and early spring. This pattern, obtained by sampling for adults, was paralleled by sampling for larvae. In a laboratory experiment simulated herbivore injury did not produce the same effect as feeding by S. flava. Total fresh-weight accumulation was reduced significantly with increasing levels of injury by S. flava feeding but this did not occur with artificial clipping. In another laboratory experiment, where individual plants were caged with 4 mated females for 24 h. reduced growth of Chinese cabbage and turnip occurred from ensuing larval damage. In two separate field experiments turnip tolerated low levels of leaf raining without reduction in weight of bulb but the net yield of Chinese cabbage was significantly reduced...|$|E
