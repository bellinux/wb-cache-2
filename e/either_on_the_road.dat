Afterwards he travelled into Italy, he accompanied him, and whensoever any evil was like to happen to him, <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> or in the inn, he was perceived to foretell it by some touch or stroke; he drew off his boots as a servant; if he turned his journey another way, he continued with him, having the same care of him in foretelling evil; at length he was made a canon; and as, on a time, he was sitting and feasting with his friends in much jollity, a vehement stroke was struck on a sudden on the table, so that they were all terrified; presently the canon said to his friends, be not afraid, some great evil hangs over my head. The next day he fell into a great fever, and the fit continued on him for three whole days, till he died, miserably.|$|E

And beyond, with scarcely a break save for the rising of one strangely-shaped hill, was the sea. Gerald pointed with his finger.|$|R
40|$|The real {{standard}} of living {{of much of the}} Mexican population has deteriorated seriously since 1976. In these decades, the economy has been dramatically transformed and people “reassigned ” to new places in the productive structure. Public enterprises were shed, with transnational capital assuming a renewed importance as rector of the economy, making its impact felt in virtually every dimension of national life. Political crises have snowballed, one on top of another, aggravating the series of economic crises from which the country does not seem able to extricate itself. This history can only be understood {{in the context of the}} thorough-going process of institutional reform begun in 1985 as part of the program of neoliberal integration into the world economy. Numerous declarations and celebrations by the Mexican executive attempt to reassure people, at home and abroad, that the country in <b>either</b> firmly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to recovery or has actually joined the ranks of the first world. Even as I write this paper in late 1998, and some are (prematurely?) sounding the death knell of the extreme model of neoliberal deregulation, the team of “técnicos ” that are running the economy are insisting that the country’s current problems are imported from abroad...|$|R
50|$|Skitchin is {{a racing}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} an inline skater who must race against other skaters through various locations such as Denver and Vancouver. Also inspired by Back to the Future character Marty McFly, players accomplish this by skitching, i.e. hanging off the backs of moving vehicles, {{in order to increase}} their speed and pass other riders. By picking up weapons from the ground, the player can attack other players <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> or while skitching on the same vehicle. Players progress through each race by placing in the top five, with each stage adding new obstacles such as trash cans, differing vehicle behavior, and police cars. Cash earned from winning races, performing tricks, defeating enemies, and successfully skitching vehicles can be used to upgrade and repair the player's inline skates and protective gear, which wears as the player takes damage. The game ends if the player runs out of health, gets caught by the police, or cannot afford to replace worn out skates.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRoad {{inventory}} is {{very important}} for effective transportation management. This process is usually done by a technician in the field, manually from obtained aerial/satellite images or semi-automatically by a software application. The first two options are very time consuming, hence expensive. Many companies therefore try to process at least part of this task automatically. The road inventory process comprises an identification of objects that can be found <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> or in the road proximity. Examples include road signs, road markings, guardrails and many more. We can register much information about these objects, such as their position, condition or type. Generally, there are two sources for the extraction of information needed for the inventory. The first source is a set of images captured by a camera. The second source is data captured by a LiDAR. Either of them can provide different information; therefore, the choice of the source must be made with regard to the required information. In our article, we compare information that can be obtained from camera images and LiDAR measurements. This comparison is presented on three example objects: traffic signs, road markings and general pole-shaped objects (e. g. city lights or trees). Further, we describe a process based on our algorithm that detects traffic signs in LiDAR measurement and transforms the results to a common format used in geographic information systems. We test our method on an approximately two-kilometer long road in an urban area...|$|E
40|$|Driver {{intention}} recognition {{reveals an}} enormous potential for automated driving. Current automated emergency braking (AEB) systems warn {{and take over}} vehicle control in case of frontal collision risks. It is of high interest to detect driver’s intention before initiating such transitions to automated driving {{in order to avoid}} annoyance. Also the number of warnings can be reduced when driver intention recognition indicates a safe behavior planning. Especially pedestrian protection systems will benefit in urban environments where pedestrians potentially enter the vehicle trajectory frequently. The paper describes the development of a driver intention detection algorithm for automated emergency braking systems. The data for the development is collected in a driving simulator study with 32 participants, balanced roughly by gender, age and driving style. Every participant circulated in an urban environment with random pedestrian traffic. In six scenarios data were collected where a pedestrian was <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> or walked towards the road. An automated emergency braking system would activate a warning and eventually an automated braking in such situations. This could be adapted or cancelled in case of an existing braking intention by the driver. A fixed base Face Lab Eyetracking device stored gaze patterns in relation to the pedestrians’ position on the presentation screen. Pedal activity was also recorded. The analysis of both data sources allowed the development of a rule based algorithm to detect driver’s intention to brake due to the pedestrian. The algorithm proposes a sequential analysis of eye gaze and pedal activity and is presented and discussed in this paper. The algorithm correlated highly with a driver intention recognition reference method developed earlier by Diederichs & Pöhler [1]. In 94 % of the scenarios the algorithm and the reference method match in their results...|$|E
50|$|With {{the silver}} medal won in 2005 in mind, Vos {{returned}} to Salzburg for <b>the</b> senior <b>road</b> race at <b>the</b> World Championship of road cycling.

From then, the group stayed together apart from attacks <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>the</b> flat <b>road</b> or <b>the</b> second climb. The race went to a sprint of 15 riders, Vos taking another rainbow jersey.|$|R
50|$|As Dolson Avenue, NY 17M {{passes by}} a single {{residential}} block before entering a linear commercial district that follows the highway to an interchange with I-84 roughly 1.5 mi to the south. The route initially remains two lanes wide, but widens to four lanes after crossing the Middletown and New Jersey Railway at-grade. This stretch of NY 17M also features a center left-turn lane to accommodate the traffic turning into the many commercial plazas <b>on</b> <b>either</b> side. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> remains within <b>the</b> Middletown city limits until a block before the intersection where US 6 comes in from the west and joins NY 17M. Together, they cross over I-84 at exit 3, providing access to the cities of Port Jervis and Newburgh in the western and eastern parts of the county, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Just past I-84, the Wawayanda {{hamlet of}} New Hampton begins, with car dealerships and other {{commercial}} establishments <b>on</b> <b>either</b> side. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> narrows to two lanes as the combined highways begin a slow, gentle descent through less developed areas {{to the bridge}} over the Wallkill River, situated at {{the northern tip of}} the county's Black Dirt Region. Short sections of <b>the</b> approach <b>on</b> <b>either</b> side add a passing lane in the uphill direction. The river marks the Goshen town line, and the slight climb out of the river depression is accompanied again with some extra lanes. Past the climb, development aside <b>the</b> <b>road</b> picks up slightly, although most of the land around the highway remains undeveloped as open fields or forests. US 6 and NY 17M continue to the western outskirts of the village of Goshen, where they merge into NY 17 at exit 123.|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} that the rebels were mobilising people for revolt by spreading messages through chapatis in villages. Sikander Begum banned the distribution of these chapatis from village to village. She required undertakings from the balahi and patel (chiefs) of every village, to report any violations to the concerned thana (police station). Sikandar Begum also banned the circulation of any seditious notices <b>either</b> found lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> or stuck <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls. Maulvi Abdul Qayyum, the darogha of Fatehgarh fort distributed 500 copies of a pamphlet issued by the rebels of Cawnpore (now Kanpur). The pamphlet claimed that the British were interfering with the religious sentiments of Hindus and Muslims, and urged them to rebel against the British rule in India. Sikandar Begum instituted an inquiry against the Maulvi, who was charged of collusion with the rebels. She also published a pamphlet from Sikandari press, denying the charges of British interference in the religious affairs of Hindus and Muslims.|$|R
6000|$|That {{night the}} {{travellers}} slept in Gien; {{the next day}} they passed the river and set forth (severally, as their custom was) on a short stage through the green plain upon the Berry side, to Chatillon- sur-Loire. It was {{the first day of the}} shooting; and the air rang with the report of firearms and the admiring cries of sportsmen. [...] Overhead the birds were in consternation, wheeling in clouds, settling and re-arising. And yet with all this bustle <b>on</b> <b>either</b> hand, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> itself lay solitary. The Arethusa smoked a pipe beside a milestone, and I remember he laid down very exactly all he was to do at Chatillon: how he was to enjoy a cold plunge, to change his shirt, and to await the Cigarette's arrival, in sublime inaction, by the margin of the Loire. Fired by these ideas, he pushed the more rapidly forward, and came, early in the afternoon and in a breathing heat, to the entering-in of that ill-fated town.

40|$|The isonymy {{structure}} of Italy was studied using the surname distribution of 5, 043, 580 private telephone users {{selected from a}} 1996 commercial CD-ROM that contains all 24 million users in the country. The users were distributed in 123 towns selected on a geographic basis. The 123 towns were <b>either</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main communication <b>roads</b> of <b>the</b> country or {{at the ends of}} such <b>roads.</b> <b>The</b> shortest distance between nearest neighbor towns was 5. 3 km (Carrara and Massa), and the largest distance was 1, 136 km (Aosta and Castrignano del Capo). The number of different surnames found in the whole analysis was 215, 623. Lasker’s distance, the negative value of the logarithm of random isonymy between localities, was linearly and significantly correlated with the logarithm of geographic distance, with r = 0. 63 ± 0. 008. A dendrogram was built from the matrix of isonymy distances, using UPGMA. It separates the Italian towns into 5 main clusters: 1 in the southern portion of the country, a second cluster toward the center, and 3 in the northern area of Italy. Within each cluster small subclusters with specific geographic distributions could be related to regional borders. Comparisons with the results of a previous analysis of Switzerland and Germany’s structures are given. From the present analysis isolation by distance emerges clearly, although it is less strong than in Switzerland and stronger than in Germany. The random component of inbreeding estimated from isonymy indicates that the southern area of Italy is on average more inbred than the northern area. In fact, the heterogeneity is greater in the northern area, particularly in the plain of the Po River, than anywhere else in Italy...|$|R
5000|$|The {{architecture}} of an AWD/4WD {{system can be}} described by describing its possible operating modes. A single vehicle may {{have the ability to}} operate in multiple modes depending on driver selection. Mohan describes the modes as follows:Two Wheel Drive (2WD) Mode - In this mode only one axle (typically the rear axle) is driven. The drive to the other axle is disconnected. The operating torque split ratio is 0:100. Four Wheel Drive (4WD) Mode - Here, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nature of torque transfer to the axles, we can define three sub-modes (below).:Part-time Mode - The front and rear axle drives are rigidly coupled in the transfer case. Since the driveline does not permit any speed differentiation between the axles and would cause driveline wind-up, this mode is recommended only for ‘part-time’ use in off-road or loose surface conditions where driveline wind-up is unlikely. Up to full torque could go to <b>either</b> axle depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> condition and <b>the</b> weight over the axles. :Full-time Mode - Both axles are driven at all times but an inter-axle differential permits the axles to turn at different speeds as needed. This allows the vehicle to be driven ‘full-time’ in this mode, regardless of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> surface, without fear of driveline wind-up. With standard bevel gear differentials the torque split is 50:50. Planetary differentials can provide asymmetric torque splits as needed. A system that operates permanently in the full-time mode is sometimes called ‘All-the-Time 4WD’, 'All-Wheel-Drive' or ‘AWD’. If the inter-axle differential is locked out then the mode reverts to a ‘part-time mode’. :On-Demand Mode - In this mode the transfer case operates primarily in the 2WD mode. Torque is transferred to the secondary axle as needed by modulating the transfer clutch from ‘open’ to a rigidly coupled state while avoiding any driveline wind-up. The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on wheel slip or wheel torque, as described in <b>the</b> section <b>on</b> traction control systems.In addition to these basic modes there could be implementations that combine these modes. The system could have a clutch across the center differential, for example, capable of modulating the front axle torque from a Full-time mode with the 30:70 torque split of the center differential to the 0:100 torque split of the 2WD mode ...|$|R
