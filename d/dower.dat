5|$|D'Abetot's widow Adeliza granted her <b>dower</b> {{lands in}} the county of Worcestershire to Beauchamp, which was {{confirmed}} by King Henry sometime between 1123 and 1129, although the document cannot be dated more precisely than that. In 1130, at Michaelmas, Henry allowed Beauchamp to not pay geld on his lands in Berkshire, and he is mentioned in the 1130 Pipe Roll as still living.|$|E
5|$|In addition, medieval cases {{referred}} to the clauses in Magna Carta which dealt with specific issues such as wardship and <b>dower,</b> debt collection, and keeping rivers free for navigation. Even in the 13th century, some clauses of Magna Carta rarely appeared in legal cases, either because the issues concerned were no longer relevant, or because Magna Carta had been superseded by more relevant legislation. By 1350 half the clauses of Magna Carta were no longer actively used.|$|E

His widow Ann would raise their son George (then 9) and two younger siblings as co-guardian with lawyer John Mercer.

5|$|The abbey {{church of}} St. Peter's at Exeter became Leofric's cathedral {{and he was}} enthroned as Bishop of Exeter there on St Peter's Day in 1050 with King Edward in attendance. The king, and his wife Edith {{took part in the}} {{ceremony}} of enthronement, with both of them leading the bishop to his cathedra, or episcopal chair. Edith had <b>dower</b> rights to the town of Exeter, which may explain her presence at the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Albany died in 1420, and Doune, the dukedom of Albany, and the Regency all {{passed to}} his son Murdoch (1362–1425). The ransom for James I was finally paid to the English, and the King {{returned}} in 1424, taking immediate steps {{to gain control of}} his kingdom. Albany and two of his sons were imprisoned for treason, and then executed in May 1425. Doune Castle became a royal possession, under an appointed Captain, or Keeper, and served as a retreat and hunting lodge for the Scottish monarchs. It was also used as a <b>dower</b> house by Mary of Guelders (c.1434–1463), Margaret of Denmark (1456–1486), and Margaret Tudor (1489–1541), the widowed consorts of James II, James III and James IV respectively.|$|E

5|$|Edward's opponents {{began to}} gather around Isabella and Mortimer in Paris, and Edward became {{increasingly}} {{anxious about the}} possibility that Mortimer might invade England. Isabella and Mortimer turned to William, the Count of Hainaut, and proposed a marriage between Prince Edward and William's daughter, Philippa. In return for the advantageous alliance with the English heir to the throne, and a sizeable <b>dower</b> for the bride, William offered 132 transport vessels and 8 warships to assist in the invasion of England. Prince Edward and Philippa were betrothed on 27 August, and Isabella and Mortimer prepared for their campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Christians {{were granted}} a {{parliamentary}} annuity of £6000 a year, which the Queen requested in person. In addition, a <b>dower</b> of £30,000 was settled upon, and the Queen gave the couple £100,000, which yielded {{an income of}} about £4000 a year. As {{well as that of}} Ranger of Windsor Park, Christian was given the honorary position of High Steward of Windsor, and was made a Royal Commissioner for the Great Exhibition of 1851. However, he was often an absentee figurehead at the meetings, instead passing his time playing with his dog Corrie, feeding his numerous pigeons, and embarking on hunting excursions.|$|E
5|$|The Marriage Charter {{acts as the}} {{reference}} document for the wedding of the 17-year-old Otto II and the 12-year-old Theophanu. The wedding took place on 14 April 972 in St. Peter's Basilica and was officiated by Pope John XIII. Politically, the marriage marked {{the recognition of the}} Ottonian Empire by the Byzantine Empire. In this document, Otto II granted Theophanu the right to an extensive <b>dower</b> for personal use throughout her life (legitima dos), as well as her entry into a consortium imperii with Otto II, meaning that both would share imperial authority over the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E

5|$|The Marriage Charter of Empress Theophanu (State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, 6 Urk 11) is the <b>dower</b> {{document}} for the Byzantine princess Theophanu. Written in Latin, {{the document}} {{was created in the}} Early Middle Ages after the marriage of Theophanu to Emperor Otto II in 972, which made her the Holy Roman Empress. The document was prepared by Otto II and exemplifies an instance of political and cultural contact between the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire. It serves as an example of Ottonian Renaissance art, and the calligraphy of the manuscript has led it to be {{regarded as one of the}} most beautiful diplomatic documents of the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{rest of the}} 13th {{century was}} {{relatively}} peaceful, and records show that Peveril Castle was maintained by the Crown. In 1235, {{in preparation for the}} king's visit, the north wall and bridge were repaired. After significant work in 1250–52 (£60 spent), 1272–1275 (£40) and 1288–1290 (£151), {{it is likely that the}} castle buildings were complete by 1300. King Henry gave Prince Edward (later King EdwardI) Peveril Castle along with the County Palatine of Chester with the royal holdings in Wales and Ireland. Some of the lands, including Peveril, were made part of Eleanor of Castile's <b>dower,</b> to come into her possession should her husband, Prince Edward, die. At this time, the Peak lordship was worth around £300 a year. At the outbreak of the Second Barons' War in 1264, Peveril Castle was occupied by Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby. Simon de Montfort pressured King HenryIII into giving him Peveril, although it was recovered by the Crown after De Montfort's death in 1265. The castle was returned to Eleanor's <b>dower,</b> and as she predeceased her husband the lordship returned into royal hands. Its income was used to provide for members of the royal family such as King EdwardII's queen, Isabella of France, and their children, and royal favourites such as Piers Gaveston. In 1331 EdwardIII gave the lordship to his wife, Philippa of Hainault. It was given to John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, in 1345. After its return to the Crown, the estate was given to John of Gaunt, EdwardIII's third surviving son, partially in exchange for the Earldom of Richmond.|$|E
5|$|During the reigns of HenryIV (1399–1413) and his {{successor}} HenryV (1413–1422), Rochester Castle was in the guardianship of William, Earl of Arundel and his brother Richard. The castle was given to HenryV's widow, Catherine of Valois, in 1423 {{as part of her}} <b>dower</b> to support her financially. She died in 1437, at which point the castle came under the custodianship of the clerk of the King's works. Despite this, there are no records of building work during the 15thcentury and almost nothing is known about Rochester Castle between then and {{the second half of the}} 16thcentury. The decline of the castle's military significance is marked by the leasing of the surrounding ditch, beginning in 1564 at the latest. Between 1599 and 1601 stone from Rochester Castle was reused to build nearby Upnor Castle, an artillery fort.|$|E

5|$|Edward III's grandson, Richard II, {{made little}} use of Hadleigh, {{and the use}} of the castle was granted to Aubrey de Vere until his death in 1400. The castle was passed amongst a number of high-status owners during the 15th century, but saw little use by the crown. Edmund of Langley and his son Edward of Norwich, the Dukes of York, used the castle in the early years, before passing it on to Humphrey of Lancaster, the Duke of Gloucester. Richard, Duke of York, used the castle next, before it passed to Edmund Tudor in the middle of the century. The {{tradition}} of the castle forming part of the queen's property was then reinstated and it was granted to Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of Edward IV. Henry VIII made no known use of the castle himself, but it formed part of the <b>dower</b> of three of his wives - Catherine of Aragon, Anne of Cleves, and Catherine Parr - and the castle's parks were used as sources of timbers for his navy.|$|E
5|$|Having {{served as}} Garter for 11 years, Bellew retired in 1961 and was succeeded by Anthony Wagner, then Richmond Herald. He then served as Secretary of the Order of the Garter until 1974, which {{included}} {{responsibility for the}} Orders' finances, and received a third knighthood when he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and Knight of the Order of St John. Having been Knight Principal of the Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor from 1957 to 1962, he was its Deputy Knight Principal from then until 1971. In the aftermath of World War II, {{he and his wife}} purchased Woodside <b>Dower</b> House in Old Windsor, Berkshire; then a ruin, he took a keen interest in renovating it and hosting parties there. While Secretary of the Order of the Garter, he entertained friends and colleagues at the house after the order's annual service in June. In later years, he lived at The Grange in Farnham and died on 6 February 1993.|$|E
5|$|In 1308, Edward's {{marriage}} to Isabella of France proceeded. Edward crossed the English Channel to France in January, leaving Gaveston as his custos regni {{in charge of}} the kingdom in his absence. This arrangement was unusual, and involved unprecedented powers being delegated to Gaveston, backed by a specially engraved Great Seal. Edward probably hoped that the marriage would strengthen his position in Gascony and bring him much needed funds. The final negotiations, however, proved challenging: Edward and Philip IV did not like each other, and the French King drove a hard bargain over the size of Isabella's <b>dower</b> and the details of the administration of Edward's lands in France. As part of the agreement, Edward gave homage to Philip for the Duchy of Aquitaine and agreed to a commission to complete the implementation of the 1303 Treaty of Paris.|$|E

5|$|In 677 or 678, Wilfrid and Ecgfrith quarrelled, and Wilfrid was {{expelled}} from his see. Abbess Hilda of Whitby was a leader in a faction of the Northumbrian church that disliked Wilfrid, and her close ties with Theodore helped to undermine Wilfrid's position in Northumbria. Another contributory factor in Wilfrid's expulsion was his encouragement of Æthelthryth's entry into a nunnery; he had personally given her the veil, the ceremony of entering a nunnery, on her retirement to Ely Abbey. Æthelthryth had donated the lands Wilfrid used to found Hexham Abbey, and the historian N. J. Higham argues {{that they had been}} part of the queen's <b>dower</b> lands, which, when Ecgfrith remarried, his new queen wanted to recover. The historian Eric John feels that Wilfrid's close ties with the Mercian kingdom also contributed to his troubles with Egfrith, although John points out that these ties were necessary for Wilfrid's monastic foundations, some of which were in Mercia. Wilfrid not only lost his diocese, he lost control of his monasteries as well.|$|E
5|$|Further {{down the}} hill, along the Military Road, is a two-story house, known as The Stewards House or as Killakee House (not to be {{confused}} with the now-demolished Killakee House that served as the residence of the Massy family who owned the adjacent Killakee Estate). It was built around 1765 by the Conolly family as a hunting lodge. Over the years, it has served as a <b>dower</b> house and as a residence for the agent who managed the Killakee Estate. To the rear is a belfry; this was once a common feature of large farmhouses and was used to call the workers for meals. The Hell Fire Club held meetings here for a time following the fire that damaged Mount Pelier lodge. The house has a reputation for being haunted, particularly by a large black cat. Stories regarding the origin of this spectre either connect it with the account of the priest who exorcised a cat at the Hell Fire Club or with a cat that was doused in whiskey and set alight by members of the Hell Fire Club before escaping across the mountains with its fur aflame.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that Doune Castle was originally built in the thirteenth century, then probably damaged in the Scottish Wars of Independence, before being rebuilt in its present form in the late 14th century by Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany (c.1340–1420), the son of King Robert II of Scots, and Regent of Scotland from 1388 until his death. Duke Robert's stronghold has survived relatively unchanged and complete, and the whole castle was traditionally thought of {{as the result of a}} single period of construction at this time. The castle passed to the crown in 1425, when Albany's son was executed, and was used as a royal hunting lodge and <b>dower</b> house. In the later 16th century, Doune became the property of the Earls of Moray. The castle saw military action during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and Glencairn's rising in the mid-17th century, and during the Jacobite Risings of the late 17th century and 18th century. By 1800 the castle was ruined, but restoration works were carried out in the 1880s, prior to its passing into state care in the 20th century. It is now maintained by Historic Scotland.|$|E
