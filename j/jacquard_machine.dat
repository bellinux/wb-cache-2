50|$|Emanuel Anthony Posselt was an {{authority}} on Jacquard looms and weaving. His book on the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machine</b> {{is considered to be}} a classic.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the chief}} {{advantages}} claimed for the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machine</b> was that unlike previous damask-weaving machines, in which the figuring shed was usually drawn once for every four shots, with the new apparatus, it could be drawn on every shot, thus producing a fabric with greater definition of outline.|$|E
50|$|Motif making:- Making of the motifs for 'pallavs' {{and other}} part of Baluchari is in itself an {{intricate}} process. The design is drawn on a graph paper, it is coloured and punching is done using cards. After punching, these cards are sewed in order and fixed in the <b>jacquard</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Stäubli Textile is the {{division}} of the company's original field of products and has since expanded into multiple countries. It manufactures dobbies and similar products related to textile weaving, including shedding systems, <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machines,</b> carpet weaving machines and weaving preparation systems.|$|R
50|$|In November 2012, {{the brand}} name was sold and came under common {{ownership}} with Thomas Ferguson & Co Ltd, a well known Irish linen Jacquard weaver. Since then John England has added {{a wide range of}} new innovative fabrics woven on looms with <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|A factory {{must choose}} looms and {{shedding}} mechanisms to suit its commercial requirements. As a rule the more warp control required {{the greater the}} expense. So it is not economical to purchase <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machines</b> if one can make do with a dobby mechanism. As well as the capital expense, the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machines</b> are more costly to maintain, as they are complex and require higher skilled personnel; an expensive design system is required to prepare the designs for the loom, and possibly a card-cutting machine. Weaving is more costly since Jacquard mechanisms {{are more likely to}} produce faults than dobby or cam shedding. Also, the looms will not run as quickly and down-time will increase because it takes time to change the continuous chain of cards when a design changes. For these reasons it is best to weave larger batches with mechanical Jacquards.|$|R
50|$|The first {{important}} {{improvement of}} the draw loom took place in 1725, when Basile Bouchon introduced the principle of applying a perforated band of paper. A continuous roll of paper was punched by hand, in sections, each of which represented one lash or tread, {{and the length of}} the roll was determined by the number of shots in each repeat of pattern. The <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machine</b> subsequently evolved from this.|$|E
50|$|Posselt then {{established}} a private textile academy and a textile trade book business. He published his own {{works on the}} <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machine,</b> the technology of textile design, textile calculations, and the cotton, wool and silk industries; as well as works by other authors such as Gardner on wool dyeing. The series Hand Books of the Textile Industry and Posselt's Textile Library, as well as Posselt's Textile Journal that ran between 1907 and 1923, are his own. The last was the immediate forerunner of Textile World.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machine</b> (...) is {{a device}} fitted to a power loom that {{simplifies}} {{the process of}} manufacturing textiles with such complex patterns as brocade, damask and matelassé. It was invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1804. The loom was controlled by a [...] "chain of cards", a number of punched cards, laced together into a continuous sequence. Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card, with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design. Several such paper cards, generally white in color, {{can be seen in}} the images below. Chains, like Bouchon's earlier use of paper tape, allowed sequences of any length to be constructed, not limited by the size of a card.|$|E
5000|$|Originally the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machines</b> were mechanical, and {{the fabric}} design was {{stored in a}} series of punched cards which were joined to form a {{continuous}} chain. The Jacquards often were small and only independently controlled a relatively few warp ends. This required a number of repeats across the loom width. Larger capacity machines, or the use of multiple machines, allowed greater control, with fewer repeats, and hence larger designs could be woven across the loom width.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} past and present {{developments}} and applications of true-colour jacquard textile design from a study that aimed to expand and/or reinvent past and present jacquard design and production methods towards innovative ends. With the aid of sophisticated computer software and advanced electronic <b>jacquard</b> <b>machines,</b> the new method allows images of considerable complication and intricacy to be designed and produced in colourful jacquard textiles by varied arrangement of yarns in four primary colours. Different arrangements of yarns further allow shifts of colour emphasis of the same image. It is envisaged that success of the study is of tremendous creative significance and commercial values, and will enhance further research in this area.

5000|$|Édouard Bovet {{was born}} in Fleurier in Neuchâtel, the son of Jean Frédéric Bovet, in 1797. Although the [...] "Genève" [...] tag is {{virtually}} compulsory for Swiss prestige name watches in the highest price bracket, it is the lesser known place name [...] "Fleurier" [...] that graces the watches from the Bovet company in Geneva: for the Bovet originated from this village in the Val-de-Travers, {{to the west of}} Neuchâtel. Watchmaking was introduced there between 1730 and 1740 by David Vaucher, probably a pupil of the legendary Daniel JeanRichard. The number of watchmakers in the Val-de-Travers grew very rapidly {{in the first half of}} the 19th century. The lace making that had provided work for a good third of the people living in the valley had been replaced by the much lower cost production on <b>jacquard</b> <b>machines</b> in France and Flanders.|$|R
50|$|Bonas Machine Company Ltd. {{launched}} {{the first successful}} electronic Jacquard at ITMA, Milan in 1983. Although the machines were initially small, modern technology has allowed <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machine</b> capacity to increase significantly, and single end warp control can extend to more than 10,000 warp ends. This avoids the need for repeats and symmetrical designs and allows almost infinite versatility. The computer-controlled machines significantly reduce the down time associated with changing punched paper designs, thus allowing smaller batch sizes. However, electronic Jacquards are costly {{and may not be}} required in a factory weaving large batch sizes, and smaller designs. The larger machines allowing single end warp control are very expensive, and can only be justified where great versatility is required, or very specialized design requirements need to be met. For example, they are an ideal tool to increase the ability and stretch the versatility of the niche linen Jacquard weavers who remain active in Europe and the West, while most of the large batch commodity weaving has moved to low cost areas.|$|E

Jacq-Rite {{had developed a}} range of specialist insurance software for the <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machine</b> but transferred to the SDS 400 following the advice of John McCully. Jacq-Rite installed several SDS 400 series networks in Lloyd's Managing and Members Agencies during 1982 and 1983. One of Jacq-Rite's programming staff that worked on the software porting was Justin Hill. Jacq-Rite's hardware sales were managed by David Ensor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{parts of}} a loom are the frame, the warp-beam or weavers beam, the cloth-roll (apron bar), the heddles, and their mounting, the reed. The warp-beam is a wooden or metal cylinder {{on the back of}} the loom on which the warp is delivered. The threads of the warp extend in parallel order from the warp-beam to the front of the loom where they are attached to the cloth-roll. Each thread or group of threads of the warp passes through an opening (eye) in a heddle. The warp threads are separated by the heddles into two or more groups, each controlled and automatically drawn up and down by the motion of the heddles. In the case of small patterns the movement of the heddles is controlled by [...] "cams" [...] which move up the heddles by means of a frame called a harness; in larger patterns the heddles are controlled by a dobby mechanism, where the healds are raised according to pegs inserted into a revolving drum. Where a complex design is required, the healds are raised by harness cords attached to a <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machine.</b> Every time the harness (the heddles) moves up or down, an opening (shed) is made between the threads of warp, through which the pick is inserted. Traditionally the weft thread is inserted by a shuttle.|$|E
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine what part of the 'Jacquard' machine was designed by Jacquard himself. He may have combined the best mechanical elements of other inventors, but - at any rate - the machine he made must have differed from its predecessors in arrangement and minor working details. It was similar in most general principles to Vaucanson's arrangement, except that he made use of Jean-Baptiste Falcon's individual paste board cards and his square prism (or card 'cylinder'), which he is credited with having fully perforated on each of its four sides in lieu of Vaucanson's perforated 'barrel'. <b>Jacquard's</b> <b>machine</b> also contained eight rows of needles and uprights as compared with Vaucanson's double row, of which modifications enabled him to increase the figuring capacity of the machine. In his first machine, he supported the harness by knotted cords, which he elevated by a single trap board.|$|R

40|$|An {{effective}} and proven way to manufacture thermal adaptive cloth is to integrate tubes for {{hot or cold}} media into a fabric by sewing. However, this method requires an extensive amount of manual work, because tubes and fabric are manufactured separately and have been sewn together by hand later. This paper presents {{a new approach to}} enable the manufacture and integration of tubes into a fabric using 3 D weaving and automated machines instead of manual work. A multi-layer fabric woven with a <b>Jacquard</b> <b>machine</b> realizes a 3 D fabric construction with integrated and seamless woven tubes in a one-step process. Paths of the tubes are generated by the so-called FracTherm® algorithm which has originally been developed at Fraunhofer ISE in order to develop fractal-like channel designs for solar thermal absorbers with uniform flow distribution and low pressure drop. After weaving a cost effective finishing of the woven structure by conventional finishing processes tightens the woven tubes to heating or cooling media like air, water or liquid chemicals. As an application of this new technology, a thermal active vest will be presented. This research work is an example for a successful combination of 3 D textiles with smart textiles...|$|E
