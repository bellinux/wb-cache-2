40|$|This {{northern}} Queensland study {{aimed to}} gain feedback on: weather warning courses {{run by the}} weather bureau, upgrades to operator desks in remote Indigenous radio studios in northern Queensland and on the terminology of weather warnings. This indicative study found that Bureau training courses in weather warnings for remote broadcaster radio announcers were appreciated, with suggestions they be expanded. The recent upgrades to remote radio transceiver operator <b>desk</b> <b>equipment</b> were greatly appreciated, while the terminology used in warnings targeted to remote Indigenous communities was generally seen as useful and clear, but lots of translating was usually needed...|$|E
50|$|The {{buildings}} of North Campus had aged over time, and were becoming very run down. Many {{of the buildings}} were over 50 years old, the oldest being over 80 years old. Construction began in 2013 and was completed in 2016. Most of the school was torn down and replaced with new, modern buildings. The portions that were kept were renovated. The construction added many new classrooms, and a new fine arts building including a new band hall, choir room, black box theater, orchestra room and dance studio. One of the 3 gyms, built in 1938 (Originally built for the elementary school, it eventually {{became part of the}} High School when additions were built.) was renovated into the school's library. New chairs, <b>desks,</b> <b>equipment,</b> and other furnishings were purchased as well.|$|R

5000|$|The {{school was}} closed indefinitely {{following}} the shooting, partially because it remained a crime scene. Sandy Hook students returned to classes on January 3, 2013, at Chalk Hill Middle School in nearby Monroe at the town's invitation. Chalk Hill {{at the time}} was an unused facility, refurbished after the shooting, with <b>desks</b> and <b>equipment</b> brought in from Sandy Hook Elementary. The Chalk Hill school was temporarily renamed [...] "Sandy Hook". The University of Connecticut created a scholarship for the surviving children of the shootings.|$|R

50|$|The {{album was}} {{conceived}} during {{a very active}} period in Vangelis' recording career, during which he explored the possibilities of electro-acoustic composing. In 1978 Vangelis had a new mixing <b>desk,</b> 24-track recording <b>equipment</b> - the API-mixer and Scully 16-track from Beaubourg were replaced by Lyrec 24-track and Quad Eight Pacifica mixer, producing much cleaner sound.|$|R
50|$|The memorabilia of President Macapagal and {{exhibits}} on President Estrada were exhibited in this large room, formerly the bedroom of President Marcos. With windows to the Palace {{garden and the}} Pasig River, the room {{used to have a}} large bed with an elaborate headboard and a round canopy that held a mosquito net. The Palace, ironically, needed mosquito nets - it must have been tough to catch even one in such large and high rooms. A <b>desk,</b> video <b>equipment</b> and medical paraphernalia completed the room's furnishings. President Marcos apparently liked to have his grandchildren sleep with him in this room, on mattresses laid out on the floor.|$|R

In 1961 he joined the BBC World Service as a Technical Operator in the Control Room at Bush House, doing recording operations on disk and tape as well as Control Room routing. In 1964 he became a Studio Manager - operating studio mixing <b>desks</b> and playback <b>equipment</b> - at Broadcasting House, {{moving on to the}} BBC Regional studios at Bristol in 1966 where he eventually became the principal Film Dubbing Mixer, responsible for, among many other things, the final mix on David Attenborough's famous wildlife series Life on Earth.|$|R
500|$|At {{the peak}} of its production, 350 animators, artists and {{technicians}} were working on Atlantis at all three Disney animation studios: Walt Disney Feature Animation (Burbank, California), Disney Feature Animation Florida (Orlando), and Disney Animation France (Paris). The film {{was one of the}} few Disney animated features produced and shot in 70mm anamorphic format. The directors felt that a widescreen image was crucial, as a nostalgic reference to old action-adventure films presented in the CinemaScope format (2.35:1), noting Raiders of the Lost Ark as an inspiration. Because switching to the format would require animation <b>desks</b> and <b>equipment</b> designed for widescreen to be purchased, Disney executives were at first reluctant about the idea. [...] The production team found a simple solution by drawing within a smaller frame on the same paper and equipment used for standard aspect ratio (1.66:1) Disney-animated films. Layout supervisor Ed Ghertner wrote a guide to the widescreen format for use by the layout artists and mentioned that one advantage of widescreen was that he could keep characters in scenes longer because of additional space to walk within the frame. Wise drew further inspiration for the format from filmmakers David Lean and Akira Kurosawa.|$|R
40|$|Laser {{scanners}} {{are widely}} used for the modelling of existing buildings {{and particularly in the}} creation process of as-built BIM (Building Information Modelling). However, the generation of as-built BIM from point clouds involves mainly manual steps and it is consequently time consuming and error-prone. Along the path to automation, a three steps segmentation approach has been developed. This approach is composed of two phases: a segmentation into sub-spaces namely floors and rooms and a plane segmentation combined with the identification of building elements. In order to assess and validate the developed approach, different case studies are considered. Indeed, it is essential to apply algorithms to several datasets and not to develop algorithms with a unique dataset which could influence the development with its particularities. Indoor point clouds of different types of buildings will be used as input for the developed algorithms, going from an individual house of almost one hundred square meters to larger buildings of several thousand square meters. Datasets provide various space configurations and present numerous different occluding objects as for example <b>desks,</b> computer <b>equipments,</b> home furnishings and even wine barrels. For each dataset, the results will be illustrated. The analysis of the results will provide an insight into the transferability of the developed approach for the indoor modelling of several types of buildings...|$|R

5000|$|These were {{typically}} long, low rectangular spaces constructed from hard, sound-reflective materials like concrete, {{fitted with a}} loudspeaker {{at one end and}} one or more microphones at the other. During a recording session, a signal from {{one or more of the}} microphones in the studio could be routed to the loudspeaker in the echo chamber; the sound from the speaker reverberated through the chamber and the enhanced signal was picked up by the microphone at the other end. This echo-enhanced signal—which was often used to 'sweeten' the sound of vocals—could then be blended in with the primary signal from the microphone in the studio and mixed into the track as the master recording was being made. Special equipment was another notable feature of the [...] "classic" [...] recording studio. The biggest studios were owned and operated by large media companies like RCA, Columbia and EMI, who typically had their own electronics research and development divisions that designed and built custom-made recording equipment and mixing consoles for their studios. Likewise, the smaller independent studios were often owned by skilled electronics engineers who designed and built their own <b>desks</b> and other <b>equipment.</b> A good example of this is the famous Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles, the site of many famous American pop recordings of the 1960s. Co-owner David S. Gold built the studio's main mixing desk and many additional pieces of equipment and he also designed the studio's unique trapezoidal echo chambers.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Repetitive strain {{injuries}} (RSI) {{are common}} today; about 50 % of all computer users show some physical problems, which may cause {{a decrease in}} work performance, resulting in large costs for individuals, companies and society. Shoulders, neck, arms and hands are especially affected, and thereby the computer work becomes slower and less efficient; productivity decreases up to 25 % have been noticed. In the long run prolonged pain can arise. eLearning is a new effective way of presenting ergonomic information at computer work places. The goal is to prevent computer related problems by improving motivation and understanding of how an optimal workplace should be designed and used, i. e. how an active relaxed working technique could be applied. Objectives Ergonomhuset AB in Göteborg, Sweden has developed a 40 minutes eLearning Computer Ergonomics® programme. It consists of interactive sequences, short films, and practical exercises, and provides advice for computer work preventing RSI. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of the program among computer workers. The aim was to understand if the information resulted in increased awareness of body overload signals and increased motivation for a change. Further interest was to see what changes the participants have done at their computer work places. Method The eLearning program was given to 18 people at a company in Göteborg during 5 weeks. The program contains of 8 short parts (3 - 7 minutes each) and deals with how the body works, discomfort, stress, risks, prevention and advise. The separate parts can be viewed whenever the individual wants, as many times as required. A background questionnaire was given before the programme was introduced about working situation, equipment and physical problems. Each week a questionnaire was filled regarding how many times and which parts of the programme they had seen, workplace changes made and physical problems. In the end, a final larger questionnaire and interviews were performed. Results and conclusion Most participants had seen all parts of the programme, some of them several times. The awareness of body signals related to discomfort, fatigue and pain increased for all participants. They had also changed their overall working situation. The changes made were more frequent breaks, adjustments of chairs, <b>desks</b> and computer <b>equipment,</b> as well as reorganisation of work tasks. To conclude eLearning is an efficient and cost effective way to reach and motivate many people with information on individual basis on how they can prevent muscular skeletal problems during computer work...|$|R
