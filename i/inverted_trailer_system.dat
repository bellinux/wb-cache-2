40|$|A {{truck and}} {{multiple}} <b>trailer</b> <b>system</b> {{consists of a}} wheeled mobile robot that tows multiple <b>trailers.</b> These <b>systems</b> are widely used {{across a variety of}} industries for both indoor and outdoor services. Based on the kinematic model, the truck and multiple <b>trailer</b> <b>system</b> {{is considered to be a}} typical nonlinear system. Thus, controlling a truck and multiple <b>trailer</b> <b>system</b> is a challenging research topic that has received increasing attention from both academics and engineering practitioners. The use of a truck and multiple <b>trailer</b> <b>system</b> is important as it can boost the capacity of land transportation vehicles. However, an insufficient degree-of-freedoms in the available controls means that the steering of such systems remains problematic. Indeed, as the numbers of <b>trailers</b> in any <b>system</b> increases the issues become increasingly complicated. This research studies three intelligent control approaches that progressively improve system performance, such that the requirements of an exact and sophisticated system model can be relaxed. For the first approach, a virtual-robot tracking strategy was employed whereby a truck was directed to follow a specified trajectory. The generation of drive speed and turn-rate was viewed as an intelligent optimisation problem and a particle swarm optimisation algorithm was used for performance and implementation simplicity. Simulation studies in which a truck-and-trailer system moved across irregular paths were conducted using a developed intelligent controller. Satisfactory results supported the feasibility of this approach. For the second intelligent control approach, a hybrid force field controller was developed. Previously, the design of controllers for truck and multiple <b>trailer</b> <b>systems</b> have, for most cases, assumed collision free workspaces; however, for practical applications the linear velocity of the truck had to be adjusted so that it followed an arbitrary reference trajectory and avoided obstacles. A controller was designed hybridising virtual vehicle control strategy, force field approach and the particle swarm optimisation algorithm. A linear velocity was obtained that provided the desired positioning of the truck and multiple <b>trailer</b> <b>system</b> in a practical working space. Finally, a fuzzy logic controller was designed for a truck and multiple <b>trailer</b> <b>system</b> whereby the controller generated the drive velocity and turn-rate for the truck alone. An automatic fuzzy rule and membership tuning approach was developed that eradicated the need to rely solely on human expert inputs. The problem was approached using a particle swarm optimisation algorithm that removed the need for human expert knowledge input while searching for a near optimal solution. Thus, the truck and- multiple <b>trailer</b> <b>system</b> could be driven to a directed position following a trajectory on a two-dimensional terrain. The simulation results of both a one-trailer system and multi-trailer system showed the effectiveness of the derived fuzzy controller. The outcomes reported in this thesis have contributed to the development of intelligent motion controllers for the truck and multiple <b>trailer</b> <b>system.</b> In particular, intelligent design approaches were adopted that mitigated the need for an exact knowledge of a complicated system model...|$|R

The transportation capacity of the truck with multiple trailers can be increased {{in proportion to the}} number of trailers. The cost of the car with trailers is much lower than the cost of multiple cars. However, the major drawback of the <b>trailer</b> <b>system</b> is that the control problem is difficult. We concentrate on the motion control problem of &# 698;pushing&# 698; trailers because pushing is much more difficult than &# 698;pulling&# 698;. In this paper, it is shown how the car with passive trailers can be easily controlled by the use of the proposed driver assist system and the motion control scheme. Since the keypad is the only additional device for the driver assist system, the proposed scheme can be implemented with the conventional trucks without many hardware modifications. The manual control strategy of pushing is established. The kinematic design of the passive trailer is adopted from the prior work (Park and Chung, 2004). The kinematic configuration design of the car with trailers is proposed for pushing control. The usefulness of the proposed scheme is experimentally verified with the small scale car with <b>trailer</b> <b>system</b> for the car parking problem. The parking control requires forward and reverse motion in narrow environment. It is shown that even beginners can easily control the pushing motion with the proposed scheme...|$|R

40|$|The next generation, multi-detector {{active and}} passive {{computed}} tomography (A&PCT) scanner will be optimized for speed and accuracy.

Although the multi-detector scanner design has priority put on speed to increase waste drum throughput, higher speed should not compromise assay accuracy. One way to increase the speed of the A&PCT technology is to use multiple detectors. This yields a linear speedup by a factor approximately equal to the number of detectors used without a compromise in system accuracy. There are many different design scenarios that can be developed using multiple detectors. Here we describe four different scenarios and discuss the trade-offs between them. Also, some considerations are given in this design description for the implementation of a multiple detector technology in a field- deployable mobile <b>trailer</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

The main entities in the model are containers, container terminals and vehicles for transportation of containers.
