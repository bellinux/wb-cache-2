5000|$|Sculptors {{often use}} a high amount of {{detail in the}} figures, and {{painting}} may require the finest brushes, as fine as 00000 (5/0). Most painters will use a range of different brush sizes; 1, 00, and 0000 is a likely minimum set. Good quality brushes like kolinsky sable brushes that take a fine point are preferred, although hog or synthetic brushes are better for [...] "rough" [...] work: undercoating and <b>dry</b> <b>brushing.</b> An airbrush is also a commonly used tool. Airbrushing facilitates leveled painting surfaces and allows for effects like gradients and soft blended edges. Because of the detail work involved, airbrushes with a small tip diameter are considered more useful.|$|E

30|$|The {{selected}} stones, {{including those}} designated to remain untreated {{as well as}} those intended for intervention were first lightly dusted using a dry, soft nylon brush. This procedure is representative of what happens in real restoration projects, where part of the stone cleaning process involves <b>dry</b> <b>brushing</b> with nylon/vegetable fibre brushes to remove superficial deposits and/or soft concretions. Treatment was then applied in a cellulose pulp (300  μm) and consisted of a 5 % ammonium oxalate monohydrate solution utilising deionised water as per established procedure [26]. This poultice was applied for a 24 -h contact time so as to facilitate application practicality and removal logistics on site. This protocol, based on previous research in the laboratory [21], has already been adopted in previous studies using ammonium oxalate treatment on site [22, 23] and is being used again here for comparison purposes. The poultice was applied at an approximate height of 3.0  m above ground level with a mean ambient temperature during application of 26.48  °C and a mean relative humidity of 66.60 %. The poultice was left uncovered and was manually removed after 24  h (conditions during 24  h were 25.77 – 33.69  °C temperature and 45.11 – 75.91 % relative humidity), at which time the poultice was still damp. Excess pulp on the stone’s surface was brushed off with a dry, soft nylon brush and the stone left to air-dry for a period of 5  days at ambient conditions (conditions during 5  days were 24.63 – 39.92  °C temperature and 30.35 – 83.92 % relative humidity) prior to the extraction of cores for subsequent laboratory testing. Three separate cores were extracted for each of the tests described in “Testing methodology” section below, both for untreated stone as well as for treated stone.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUsing {{analytical}} and numerical self-consistent field (SCF) methods we analyze equilibrium structure of <b>dry</b> (solvent-free) <b>brush</b> of branched polymers in {{wide range of}} chain grafting densities. A detailed analysis is performed for starlike polymers end-tethered to planar surface by terminal monomer {{of one of their}} branches. At moderate grafting densities ensuring Gaussian elasticity of tethered stars the brush structure is described by strong stretching SS-SCF theory employing parabolic molecular potential. At high grafting densities an approximate analytical AA-SCF theory is used to describe stratification of <b>dry</b> <b>brush.</b> Analytical predictions are supplemented by results of numerical Scheutjens-Fleer SF-SCF model. Interpenetration between <b>dry</b> <b>brushes</b> is analyzed as a function of grafting density and degree of branching of tethered chains. Comparison of interpenetration and friction between <b>dry</b> <b>brushes</b> with varied chain architectures pointed at optimal lubrication by macrocycles tethered to the surface by branching point. It is demonstrated that shear stress in sliding brushes of starlike macromolecules sharply decreases at high grafting densities corresponding to almost full stretching of the longest elastic path in the polymers...|$|R
