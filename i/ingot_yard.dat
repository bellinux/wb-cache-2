The ladles were manoeuvred by overhead crane into the casting bays over several ceramic runner systems each feeding six preheated one-ton ingot moulds. After cooling the ingot moulds were stripped of the still hot ingots and taken to the <b>ingot</b> <b>yard.</b> In the 1950s the transport from the Open Hearth Casting Bays to the <b>ingot</b> <b>yard</b> was by steam lorry, or on the internal steam railway system. As of 2016, a fully restored original example {{of one of the}} steam lorries carrying the Brown Bayley livery {{can be found at the}} Riverside Museum in Glasgow.|$|E
