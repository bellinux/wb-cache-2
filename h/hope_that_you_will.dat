Romani {{believes}} {{it to be}} very effective, and {{precisely because of the}} all-inclusive character for you, which is that of Norma.

25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> {{be able to read}} it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E
25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E
