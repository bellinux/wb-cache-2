5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal {{animals with}} long hind legs and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs were {{smaller than the}} hindlimbs and {{featured}} three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), the largest of which was for the orbit (eye socket).

5|$|For a given {{topography}} and bathymetry {{the surge}} height is not solely affected by peak wind speed; {{the size of}} the storm also affects the peak surge. With any storm, the area of piled up water can flow out of the storm perimeter, and this escape mechanism is reduced <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surge force (for the same peak wind speed) when the storm covers more area (storm perimeter length per area is inversely proportional to a circular storm's diameter).|$|E
5|$|In April 1903 a {{petition}} objecting to {{the renewal of}} alcohol licences for local inns, signed by 450 people, {{was presented to the}} Brewsters sessions (magistrates court meetings in England where pub licences were renewed or granted). A deputation sent to the session explained that the number of licensed houses was too large <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> population. In 1917, the cattle market moved from the Higher Bullring to a field near the station. The first cinema was opened in the Victoria Hall in 1918 by Bill Terry and in 1977 the town was twinned with Ploudalmézeau in Brittany, France.|$|E

5|$|The bluebuck rock {{paintings}} from the Caledon river valley {{have been attributed}} to Bushmen. They show six antelopes facing a man, and were supposedly inspired by shamanic trance; they may depict a Bushman visiting the spirit-world through a tunnel. The Bushmen possibly believed that the bluebuck had a supernatural potency, like other animals in their environment.

5|$|The {{prosperity}} stimulated {{a building}} boom that was underway by the mid-1830s, {{with the building}} {{of some of the}} most elaborate structures the city had seen up to that point.

5|$|This kiwi {{is highly}} aggressive, and pairs will defend their large territories (49 acres) against other kiwi. Great spotted kiwi are nocturnal, and will sleep {{during the day}} in burrows. At night, they feed on {{invertebrates}} and will also eat plants. Great spotted kiwi breed between June and March. The egg is the largest of all birds <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> size of the bird. Chicks take 75 to 85 days to hatch, and after hatching, they are abandoned by their parents.|$|E

Eugène Lefebvre was the first pilot killed in a power airplane in 1909, while the first fatal mid-air collision occurred on 19 June 1912, near Douai, France, killing the pilot of each aircraft. Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> size and capacity of airplanes.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize {{the tax burden}} on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E

5|$|Local {{churches were}} further {{organized}} into geographically defined presbyteries. A presbytery was {{a convention of}} all ministers within its jurisdiction and one ruling elder chosen by each session. Collegiate churches were entitled to be represented by two or more ruling elders <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> number of its pastors. Presbyteries were responsible for examining, licensing and ordaining candidates to the ministry, as well as judging and removing ministers. They were also responsible for resolving doctrinal or disciplinary questions and also functioned as courts of appeal from sessions. An executive commission was appointed to more efficiently manage the presbytery's work, and judicial cases were referred to a judicial commission.|$|E
5|$|The French {{approach}} to funding memorials also relied mainly on voluntary fundraising, but featured {{a greater role}} for the state. A law passed in 1919 provided for a subsidy from central government to local authorities to assist in building memorials; the money was distributed <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> number of local citizens {{who had died in}} the war. Nonetheless the largest French projects, such as the Ossuary of Douaumont, were still paid for mostly through private fund raising across France and the international community: it could take many years to raise the sums required. The Ossuary cost 15 m francs to build; {{at the other end of}} the scale, more modest urban memorials cost around 300,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|The corps {{was formed}} {{for a second}} time in 1942 under the command of Major General Vasily Koptsov and became part of the 3rd Tank Army. It first saw combat in the {{unsuccessful}} Kozelsk Offensive of late August and early September, a relatively small operation to encircle a German salient, which resulted in the corps taking heavy losses <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> territory gained. After spending {{the rest of the year}} in reserve, receiving new supplies and equipment, the corps was transferred to the southern front in southwestern Russia to fight in the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive during January 1943, in which it played a key role by forming part of the forces that encircled thousands of Axis troops on the Middle Don River.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev's {{answer to}} these {{problems}} was to issue two decrees, one in 1977 and one in 1981, which called {{for an increase in}} the maximum size of privately owned plots within the Soviet Union to half a hectare. These measures removed important obstacles for the expansion of agricultural output, but did not solve the problem. Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they only cultivated 4% of the land. This was seen by some as proof that de-collectivisation was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such drastic measures due to ideological and political interests. The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quantity rather than the quality of their work, and too large farm machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside. In the face of this, Brezhnev's only options were schemes such as large land reclamation and irrigation projects, or of course, radical reform.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E
5|$|States are {{the primary}} subdivisions of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution, such as {{regulating}} intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, and ratifying constitutional amendments. Each state has its own constitution, grounded in republican principles, and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. All states and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, while Representatives are distributed among the states <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each state is entitled to select a number of electors {{to vote in the}} Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators in Congress from that state. Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to the current total of 50, and each new state is admitted on an equal footing with the existing states.|$|E
