5|$|Most of Fielding's plays {{were written}} in five acts, but The Author's Farce was written in three. The opening {{introduces}} the main character, Harry Luckless, and his attempts to woo Harriot, the daughter of his landlady Mrs. Moneywood. The play begins {{in much the same}} way as Fielding's earlier romance-themed comedies, but quickly becomes a different type of play, mocking the literary and theatrical establishment. Luckless is trying to become a successful writer, but lacks the income that would allow him to concentrate on his writing. Although others try to support him financially, Luckless refuses their help; when his friend, Witmore, pays his rent behind his back, Luckless steals the money <b>from</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Moneywood. In the second act, Luckless seeks assistance to help finish his play, The Pleasures of the Town, but is poorly advised, and the work is rejected by his local theatre. Luckless revises his play and succeeds in finding an alternative venue, leading to the third act, in which the work is performed as a puppet show, with actors taking the place of the puppets.|$|E

Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February <b>from</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Murphy, who said that her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body. The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by the organs of their father. The rescuers discovered that three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{received}} the commission for the Reader's Digest Building <b>from</b> <b>Mrs</b> DeWitt Wallace {{on his return}} from Japan in 1949. She wanted a design that would show the best that America could offer. The site acquired for the building was opposite the Hirakawa Gate of the Imperial Palace. Its choice was treated with great resentment by the Japanese who felt that favouritism was shown by the Occupation authorities in allowing an American company to utilise a prominent site that would have served better as a park. Taking influence from Le Corbusier, Raymond responded to this criticism by masterplanning the site by using a Ville Radieuse inspired layout with the building set in gardens with sculptures by the Japanese American sculptor, Isamu Noguchi.|$|E

This technique has shown abnormalities in the phosphocreatine-to-adenosine triphos-phate ratio in patients with severe cardiomyopathies, either dilated or hypertrophic. Data indicate that abnormal metabolic parameters can risk stratifi patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and provide independent prognostic information.

40|$|Management {{of brain}} tumours in {{children}} {{would benefit from}} improved non-invasive diagnosis, characterisation and prognostic biomarkers. Metabolite profiles derived <b>from</b> in-vivo <b>MRS</b> {{have been shown to}} provide such information. Studies indicate that using optimum a priori information on metabolite contents in the construction of linear combination (LC) models of MR spectra leads to improved metabolite profile estimation. Glycine (Gly) is usually neglected in such models due to strong overlap with myo-inositol (mI) and a low concentration in normal brain. However, biological studies indicate that Gly is abundant in high-grade brain tumours. This study aimed to investigate the quantitation of Gly in paediatric brain tumours using MRS analysed by LCModel™, and its potential as a non-invasive biomarker of malignancy. Single-voxel MRS was performed using PRESS (TR 1500 [*]ms, TE 30 [*]ms/ 135 [*]ms) on a 1. 5 [*]T scanner. Forty-seven cases (18 high grade (HG), 17 low grade (LG), 12 ungraded) were retrospectively selected if both short-TE and long-TE MRS (n[*]=[*] 33) or short-TE MRS and high-resolution magic-angle spinning (HRMAS) of matched surgical samples (n[*]=[*] 15) were available. The inclusion of Gly in LCModel™ analyses led to significantly reduced fit residues for both short-TE and long-TE MRS (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). The Gly concentrations estimated <b>from</b> short-TE <b>MRS</b> were significantly correlated with the long-TE values (R[*]=[*] 0. 91, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). The Gly concentration estimated by LCModel™ was significantly higher in HG versus LG tumours for both short-TE (p[*]<[*] 1 e- 6) and long-TE (p[*]=[*] 0. 003) MRS. This was consistent with the HRMAS results, which showed a significantly higher normalised Gly concentration in HG tumours (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) and a significant correlation with the normalised Gly concentration measured <b>from</b> short-TE in-vivo <b>MRS</b> (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). This study suggests that glycine can be reliably detected in paediatric brain tumours using in-vivo MRS on standard clinical scanners and that it is a promising biomarker of tumour aggressiveness...|$|R

For selective enumeration of L acidophilus, four methods were investigated under anaerobic conditions, as follows: MRS agar containing bile solution; MRS agar containing clindamycin solution; and MRS agar containing sorbitol solution, each one incubated at 37 degrees C for 72 h, and MRS agar containing sorbitol incubated at 45 degrees C for 72 h. These methodologies were used for enumeration of both the pure cultures and the microorganisms from probiotic yoghurt and Prato cheese. The results showed that the best selective medium for enumeration of L. acidophilus <b>from</b> yoghurt was <b>MRS</b> agar containing bile incubated at 37 degrees C for 72 h under anaerobic conditions.
