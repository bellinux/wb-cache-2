500|$|In an {{interview}} with The New York Times, Sarsgaard stated that he followed Catholicism, saying: [...] "I like the death-cult aspect of Catholicism. Every religion is interested in death, but Catholicism takes it to a particularly high level. [...] Seriously, in Catholicism, you're supposed to love your enemy. That really impressed me as a kid, and it has helped me as an actor. [...] The way that <b>I</b> <b>view</b> the characters I play is part of my religious upbringing. To abandon curiosity in all personalities, good or bad, is to give up hope in humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|All {{of these}} new things {{entering}} my life are changing the way <b>I</b> <b>view</b> my purpose, but 'Dance in the Dark' in particular is about me wanting to live—but also, the song isn't called 'Dance in the Light'. I'm not a gospel singer trying to cross people over. What I'm saying is, 'I get it. I feel you, I feel the same way, and it's OK.' I {{hope and pray that}} I can inspire some sort of change in people subliminally through the show. They're singing 'Dance in the Dark,' but they're dancing and they're free, they're letting it out. But the songs are not about freedom, they're about [...] I get it. I feel the way you feel.|$|E
500|$|The explicitness of the album's lyrics {{mandated}} a Parental Advisory logo in the United States, {{largely due}} to the lurid nature of the songs as well as their usage of profanity. Derogatory terms such as [...] "bitch", [...] "slut", and [...] "whore" [...] are used prominently in the songs. [...] "I try to place [...] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how <b>I</b> <b>view</b> things", said Love in a 1991 interview with Everett True. [...] "I sometimes feel that no one's taken the time to write about certain things in rock, that there's a certain female point of view that's never been given space." [...] In spite of its graphic lyrics, the underlying female themes in many of the songs led some journalists to tag the band as being part of the riot grrl movement, which Love was not directly associated with.|$|E

500|$|Love's lyrical {{content is}} {{composed}} from a female's point of view, and her lyrics {{have been described}} as [...] "literate and mordant" [...] and noted by scholars for [...] "articulating a third-wave feminist consciousness". According to a 2014 interview, lyrics have remained the most important component of songwriting for Love: [...] "I want it to look just as good on the page as it would if it was in a poetry book". A great deal of her songwriting has been diaristic in nature. Common themes present in Love's songs during her early career included body image, rape, suicide, conformity, elitism, pregnancy, prostitution, and death. In a 1991 interview with Everett True, Love said: [...] "I try to place [...] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how <b>I</b> <b>view</b> things... I sometimes feel that no one's taken the time to write about certain things in rock, that there's a certain female point of view that's never been given space".|$|E
500|$|Fred [...] "Curly" [...] Morrison, {{a former}} Browns running back {{who worked as}} an {{advertising}} executive for CBS television, learned in 1960 that Dave Jones was looking to sell the Browns and told the story to Art Modell, a 35-year-old advertising and television executive from Brooklyn. Modell was intrigued, {{partly because of the}} potentially lucrative television rights that one of the NFL's most successful franchises could bring as football began to challenge baseball as America's biggest sport. Having borrowed as much money as he could, Modell completed the purchase in March 1961 for $3.925 million. Bob Gries, who had a share in the Browns from the beginning, agreed to buy in again at the new valuation and take a stake of almost 40%, defraying Modell's costs substantially. As the previous owners did when they took over, Modell quickly assured Cleveland fans that Brown would [...] "have a free hand" [...] in running the organization and awarded him a new eight-year contract. [...] "As far as I'm concerned Paul Brown can send [...] in by carrier pigeon", Modell said. [...] "In my opinion he has no peer as a football coach. His record speaks for itself. <b>I</b> <b>view</b> our relationship as a working partnership." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1970s, {{some conservatives}} called the {{newspaper}} [...] "Pravda on the Potomac" [...] {{because of its}} perceived left-wing bias in both reporting and editorials.
