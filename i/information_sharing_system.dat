These age sets were used to record time. Once the young men of a particular ibinda came of age, they were tasked with protecting the tribal lands and the society, the period when they were in charge of protection of the society was known as the age of that ibinda. There were eight ages in general though this varied between sections as an age-set would temporarily be dropped from use if a disastrous incident occurred during the age of the ipinda.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a traffic <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>system</b> based on Floating Car Data (FCD). FCD {{is one of}} the methods used to gather traffic information; it uses vehicles as sensor nodes that transmit their speed to the server. The traffic <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>system</b> broadcasts speed information updated by such transmission. Vehicles receiving broadcasted speed information can calculate travel time and select a minimum time route. The communication cost and the load of the server are issues, because such a traffic <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>system</b> can generate a lot of wireless communication between the vehicles and the server [2][3]. However, reducing the amount of communication lowers the accuracy of information provided by the server. In this paper we propose an Information Cost Model to quantify a trade-off relationship between the communication cost of the system and the accuracy of information. Additionally, we propose a randomized method {{to reduce the number of}} messages from clients to the server by avoiding redundant transmissions. We compared the performance of our proposed method with that of a conventional method, using real traffic data from Chicago highways.
