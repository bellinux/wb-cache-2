5|$|M-124 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan that runs {{on the north side}} of Vineyard and Wamplers lakes near Brooklyn in Jackson County near the Irish Hills area. The highway travels directly through W. J. Hayes State Park before ending in Lenawee County. The designation was created in 1929 for a road that accessed the state park, connecting <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> Highway 112 (US112, now US12). It was later extended westward to M-50 in Brooklyn in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|US 50 {{was created}} in 1926 {{as part of the}} {{original}} U.S. Highway system. The original route planned in 1925 ran from Wadsworth, Nevada east to Annapolis, Maryland along several auto trails including the Lincoln Highway, Midland Trail, and the National Old Trails Road. The final 1926 plan had US 50 running from Sacramento, California east to Annapolis with a gap in west Utah that was bridged by running the route north via Salt Lake City before rerouting <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 6 in the 1950s. US 50 was extended west from Sacramento to San Francisco in the 1930s, replacing U.S. Route 48; this was reversed in 1964 when Interstate 580 replaced much of the route between the two cities. In addition, US 50 was extended east from Annapolis to Ocean City prior in 1949, replacing a portion of U.S. Route 213. US 50 had two split configurations into U.S. Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S, one in Kansas and another in Ohio and West Virginia; both of these instances have been removed.|$|E
5|$|All of SR 198 {{was added}} to the state highway system in the three bond issues floated to pay for the {{construction}} of the system. The first bond issue, approved by the state's voters in 1910, included the road from Visalia west to Hanford, connecting the two county seats with the central northsouth highway (Route 4, now SR 99). As part of the 1916 bond issue, the route was extended west from Hanford through Coalinga to the coast trunk highway (Route 2, now US 101) near San Lucas, and assigned it the Route 10 designation. The third bond issue, passed in 1919, included a further extension east from Visalia to Sequoia National Park. The entire length of Route 10 was marked as Sign Route 198 in 1934, and this number was adopted legislatively in the 1964 renumbering. The portion east of Interstate 5 near Coalinga {{was added to}} the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959, and parts of it have been built as such. The construction of the freeway east of Visalia to Road 192 was approved in January 1961, with the remainder of the freeway unplanned at that time as contingent on the routing of SR 65. The projected cost in 1958 of the entire freeway east of Visalia was $13million ($ in today's dollars) and was scheduled to be completed by 1964. The freeway through Visalia was completed by 1965, with an expressway connecting <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> 99. Also completed was the expressway heading west out of Hanford, with part of it access-controlled west of Lemoore.|$|E

500|$|... "Your Body" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Christina Aguilera {{from her}} seventh studio album, Lotus (2012). It was written by Savan Kotecha, Max Martin, Shellback and Tiffany Amber, while its {{production}} was done by Martin and Shellback. RCA Records premiered the song on September 14, 2012 on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, and later sent <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> contemporary hit and rhythmic radio stations two days later as the lead single from Lotus. [...] "Your Body" [...] is a dance, electropop and R number with elements from dubstep and Eurodance. Its lyrics express Aguilera's desire {{to have sex with}} an anonymous partner.|$|E

Columbia Records attempted to suppress the song because it was an unofficial release, and because Jennifer Lopez (another artist on the label) had expressed interest in recording the song for her own album, Rebirth. [...] Radio stations refused to retract the song from their playlists, and Columbia eventually began promoting [...] "1 Thing" [...] as a single, making it a last-minute addition to the Hitch soundtrack. Lopez settled on another Harrison-produced, funk-infused track, the Usher outtake [...] "Get Right".|$|E

500|$|American {{television}} comedian Stephen Colbert {{coined the}} term truthiness in this meaning as {{the subject of a}} segment called [...] "The Wørd" [...] during the pilot episode of his political satire program The Colbert Report on October 17, 2005. By using this as part of his routine, Colbert satirized the misuse of appeal to emotion and [...] "gut feeling" [...] as a rhetorical device in contemporaneous socio-political discourse. He particularly applied <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>U.S.</b> President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court and the decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Colbert later ascribed truthiness to other institutions and organizations, including Wikipedia. Colbert has sometimes used a Dog Latin version of the term, [...] "Veritasiness". For example, in Colbert's [...] "Operation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando" [...] the word [...] "Veritasiness" [...] can be seen on the banner above the eagle on the operation's seal.|$|E

500|$|... "Touch My Body" [...] {{experiences}} strong commercial success, becoming Carey's eighteenth chart-topping single on the Billboard Hot 100, {{as well as}} placing {{within the}} top-five in several European countries. As a result, E=MC² debuted at number one in Canada and the United States, with the highest first-week sales of Carey's career, and {{in the top three}} in Australia and the United Kingdom. Following in a similar formula as her last album, Carey chose a ballad to be the follow-up single, [...] "Bye Bye". Though receiving praise from music critics, and strong speculation that it would become another worldwide hit for Carey, the song stalled at number nineteen on the Hot 100, and achieved weak international charting. Subsequently, Carey's label, Island Records, decided to release an up-tempo and dance-able number that would be easily a [...] "summer hit". They chose [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time", and released <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> radio stations on July 1, 2008, and to several European markets throughout August.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stones Caryn Grant {{wrote that}} [...] "the album {{is at its}} strongest when Madonna shoves {{everyone}} {{to the side and}} just tells <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> straight. So it's fitting that she wraps up the deluxe edition with the title track [...] Deep down, she does have a rebel heart— and you can't fault her for reminding us that pop music is all the better for it". Of the leaked demo, Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post, wrote that [...] "it’s taken the best parts of Avicii’s sound and blended them with Madonna, rather than giving us an ear-assaulting [...] "Avicii feat. Madonna" [...] number about 'putting your drinks up' and 'getting down on the floor'". Spin said it was the singer's [...] "sweetest melody since 'What It Feels Like for a Girl', with her register dropped an octave or two until it resembles the Liz Phair of 2005's (underrated) Somebody's Miracle". Q magazine called it a [...] "movingly autobiographical title track, where Madonna reflects at length on her career and her motivation. It makes you wonder what she thinks she has to prove in 2015 with a song like 'Bitch I'm Madonna' when she proved it all and we’ve been paying attention for years".|$|E

500|$|Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani, Joe Levy of Billboard, and Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone each {{awarded the}} album 3.5 out of 5 stars.

Levy wrote that the album was [...] "subtle" [...] compared to [...] "current standards", adding that: [...] "These songs unfold slowly, building through foreplay-like intros before hooks are displayed over a shifting series of textures". Ganz felt that Rebel Heart [...] "is at its strongest when Madonna shoves everyone {{to the side and}} just tells <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> straight", and added: [...] "Deep down, Madonna does have a rebel heart– and you can't fault her for reminding us that pop music is all the better for it". Jamieson Cox of Time commended the album for its consistent production and sound, and for Madonna's vocals and songwriting. Giving it a rating of [...] "B", Kyle Anderson and Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly called the album [...] "Madonna's best outing since 2000's Music". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian and Time Out writer Nick Levine gave the album 3 out of 5 stars. Petridis felt that the two contrasting sides of the album did not [...] "quite gel", reasoning that: [...] "the former might represent the music Madonna wants to make, while the latter is the music she feels obliged to make". Levine wrote: [...] "'Rebel Heart' may lack cohesion, but she's definitely not down for the count: this contains some of the best music Madonna's made in a decade".|$|E
