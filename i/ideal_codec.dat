30|$|The SBR {{technology}} {{in combination with}} AAC as standardized in MPEG under the name High Efficiency AAC (also known as aacPlus) offers a substantial improvement in compression efficiency compared to previous state-of-the-art codecs. It is the first audio codec to offer full bandwidth audio at good quality at low bit-rate. This makes it the <b>ideal</b> <b>codec</b> (and enabler) for low bit-rate applications such as Digital Radio Mondiale and streaming to mobile phones.|$|E

In most cases, {{it is very likely}} that very remote areas and disaster struck areas lack telecommunication infrastructure. Telemedicine system operating in such areas must have advanced wireless technology supporting it. Our approach is on MANET combined with Mobile IP and MIPV 6, is the basis of infrastructure for the mobile telemedicine system. Our evaluation is based on simulating the various codecs of VoIP over MANET and presenting the <b>ideal</b> <b>codec</b> for real world implementation. In our simulations we found that G 723. 1 worked well in the three performance metrics, packet delivery fraction it delivered 92. 4 % traffic with 6 connections. For the increasing number of connections, the performance decreased from 62. 5 % at 12 connections to 24. 4 % at 30 connections and decreased to 19. 4 % at 36 connections. For packet delivery fraction, G. 723. 1 is the best performer against the other two CODECs. The delay suffered for 6 connections is 0. 001 seconds and for 12 and 18 connections is 0. 002 seconds. For 24 connections, the delay increases steeper than for lower number of connections. The normalized routing load for all CODECs vary within 1. 022 to 1. 082, hence the performances for all CODECs are almost similar for all connections. The project’s primary objective is to create a prototype of mobile telemedicine system including hardware and software that can be rapidly deployed in remote areas or in disaster condition where telecommunication infrastructures are lacking or destroye...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Claude Shannon’s {{pioneering}} work quantified the performance limits of communications systems operating over classic wireline Gaussian channels. However, his source and channel coding theorems were derived {{for a range}} of idealistic conditions, which may not hold in low-delay, interactive wireless multimedia communications. Firstly, Shannon’s ideal lossless source encoder, namely the entropy encoder may have an excessive codeword length, hence exhibiting a high delay and a high error sensitivity. However, in practice most multimedia source signals are capable of tolerating lossy, rather than lossless delivery to the human eye, ear and other human sensors. The corresponding lossy and preferably low-delay multimedia source codecs however exhibit unequal error sensitivity, which is not the case for Shannon’s <b>ideal</b> entropy <b>codec.</b> There are further numerous differences between the Shannonian lessons originally outlined for Gaussia...|$|R

The corresponding lossy and preferably low-delay multimedia source codecs however exhibit unequal error sensitivity, {{which is not the}} case for Shannon’s <b>ideal</b> entropy <b>codec.</b> This paper proposes a jointly optimised turbo transceiver design capable of providing unequal error protection for MPEG- 4 coding aided wireless video telephony. The transceiver investigated consists of space-time trellis coding (STTC) invoked for the sake of mitigating the effects of fading, in addition to bandwidth efficient trellis coded modulation or bit-interleaved coded modulation, combined with a multi-level coding scheme employing either two different-rate non-systematic convolutional codes (NSCs) or two recursive systematic convolutional codes for yielding a twin-class unequal-protection. A single-class protection based benchmark scheme combining STTC and NSC is used for comparison with the unequal-protection scheme advocated. The video performance of the various schemes is evaluated when communicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels. It was found that the proposed scheme requires about 2. 8 dBs lower transmit power than the benchmark scheme {{in the context of the}} MPEG- 4 videophone transceiver at a similar decoding complexity...|$|R

This paper elaborates on these intriguiging lessons {{in the context of a}} few turbo-transceiver design examples, using a jointly optimised turbo transceiver capable of providing unequal error protection in the context of MPEG- 4 aided wireless video telephony. The transceiver investigated consists of Space-Time Trellis Coding (STTC) invoked for the sake of mitigating the effects of fading, Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) or Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) as well as two different-rate Non-Systematic Convolutional codes (NSCs) or Recursive Systematic Convolutional codes (RSCs). A single-class protection based benchmarker scheme combining STTC and NSC is used for comparison with the unequal-protection scheme advocated. The video performance of the various schemes is evaluated when communicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels. It was found that the achievable performance of the proposed scheme is within 0. 99 ~dB of the corresponding capacity of the Rayleigh fading channel...|$|R
