5|$|All {{thirteen}} known Ruisdael <b>etchings</b> {{come from}} his early period, {{with the first}} one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of etching. No <b>etchings</b> exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His <b>etchings</b> show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five <b>etchings</b> survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out Grainfield at the Edge of a Wood and The Travellers as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.|$|E

Of his surviving drawings, 140 in total, the Rijksmuseum, the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, Dresden's Kupferstich-Kabinett, and the Hermitage each hold significant collections. Ruisdael's rare <b>etchings</b> are spread across institutions.

30|$|The <b>etching</b> process {{comprises}} two steps, {{which are}} [10] (1) {{the diffusion of}} the chemical <b>etching</b> solution {{to the surface of}} the material that is to be etched and (2) the reaction of the chemical <b>etching</b> solution with the materials. Wet <b>etching</b> is divided into mask-associated <b>etching</b> and mask-free <b>etching</b> [10 – 12]. Mask-associated <b>etching</b> utilizes a circular array of SiO 2 on the surface of a sapphire substrate as an <b>etching</b> barrier layer. The mask-free <b>etching</b> process uses the by-product of the reaction between the chemical <b>etching</b> solution and the etched material as the <b>etching</b> mask. However, the use of a patterning process without an additional photolithographic step can reduce manufacturing cost.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an {{isotropic}} dry plasma <b>etching</b> {{was used}} to release the suspended SiO 2 microcantilever from the substrate of SOI wafer. Employing the plasma dry <b>etching</b> technique, the frontside <b>etching</b> for the SiO 2 microcantilever release is done using the Oxford Plasmalab System 100. To obtain the optimum condition for the microcantilever release using the plasma etcher, the <b>etching</b> parameters involved are 100 sccm of SF 6 flow, 2000 W of capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) power, 3 W of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) power, 20 ºC of <b>etching</b> temperature and 30 mTorr chamber pressure. The optimum parameters yield lateral etch rate of about 5 μm/min and vertical etch rate of about 8 μm/min. Two <b>etching</b> methods have been considered in this study. The first method employs only the isotropic <b>etching</b> to realize the microcantilever release while the second method utilizes both the anisotropic <b>etching</b> and the isotropic <b>etching.</b> For the second method, the process starts with the anisotropic <b>etching</b> from the deep reactive ion <b>etching</b> (DRIE) system which is then followed by the isotropic <b>etching</b> to complete the microcantilever releasing process. The purpose of the anisotropic <b>etching</b> {{is to create an}} <b>etching</b> window for the subsequent isotropic <b>etching</b> process. By using double-step <b>etching</b> method which combines both isotropic and anisotropic plasma <b>etching</b> for the microcantilever release process, the releasing process of suspended microcantilever is significantly improved...|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} date that appears on Ruisdael's paintings and <b>etchings</b> is 1646. Two years after this date he {{was admitted to}} membership of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke.

3000|$|The {{results in}} Figure  3 also {{suggested}} that different from the continuous <b>etching</b> in traditional lithography, the selective <b>etching</b> of the scanned area mainly occurred before the turning point.

40|$|A novel <b>etching</b> system termed aerosol jet <b>etching</b> (AJE) is {{described}} {{and used to}} etch silicon dioxide films. The method combines the directionality ofdry <b>etching</b> with the selectivity of wet <b>etching.</b> Contrary to most <b>etching</b> processes, in AJE the etch rate decreases with increasing substrate temperature, indicating that the residence time of etchant on the substrate can be a rate determining factor.

Over fifty paintings and thirty-five drawings and <b>etchings</b> were exhibited, first at the Mauritshuis in The Hague, then, in 1982, at the Fogg Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

30|$|During {{the gold}} wet <b>etching</b> with the {{potassium}} iodide (KI) solution, glass {{will not be}} etched and keep intact, this is another advantage over dry <b>etching,</b> because dry <b>etching</b> tends to leave some over-etched trenches on the glass substrate [8] which will introduce some scattering loss. We consider two kinds of nanospheres: wet <b>etching</b> endurable and unendurable nanospheres. For example, polystyrene nanospheres will become waxy in the gold etchant, cover the gold and stop its <b>etching,</b> thus {{they have to be}} removed prior to wet <b>etching.</b> On the other hand, silica nanospheres keep intact during the wet <b>etching,</b> {{but it is difficult to}} be removed after <b>etching.</b> This paper simulated the obtainable gold nanostructure profiles after wet <b>etching</b> for both kinds of nanosphere masks, thus the fabrication process is designable and controllable by simulations.|$|R
