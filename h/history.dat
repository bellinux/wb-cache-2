5|$|After {{the rise}} of philosophy, <b>history,</b> prose and rationalism in the late 5th century BC, the fate of myth became uncertain, and mythological genealogies gave place to a {{conception}} of <b>history</b> which tried to exclude the supernatural (such as the Thucydidean <b>history).</b> While poets and dramatists were reworking the myths, Greek historians and philosophers were beginning to criticize them.|$|E
5|$|Another {{surviving}} {{work for}} the period is Justin's epitome of Pompeius Trogus's Philippic <b>History.</b> Justin's epitomised <b>history</b> is also much condensed from the no-longer-extant original and covers not only Philip's reign, but also the <b>history</b> of Macedon before him, the exploits of Philip's son, Alexander the Great, and his diadochi successors during the Hellenistic period. These surviving histories are complemented by fragments of other histories, including Theopompus's 58-volume <b>history</b> of Philip (which was the source for much of Trogus's Philippic <b>History)</b> and by contemporary epigraphic sources.|$|E

40|$|In the {{traditional}} approaches to branching-time, <b>histories</b> are dened as linearly ordered and maximal sets of moments.

In the a topological approach the original perspective is inverted: only <b>histories</b> are primitive entities and moments are dened as sets of <b>histories.</b> Moreover, these particular sets of <b>histories</b> can be dened also {{by means of a}} relative closeness relation among <b>histories...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} claims of some historians that we cannot {{consider}} <b>histories</b> composed in Latin and the vernacular Anglo-Norman as part of one corpus of historical narratives, due to their linguistic differences. Historians often perceive Latin <b>histories</b> to be scholarly and religious, seeing vernacular <b>histories</b> as more influenced by lay aristocratic culture. This study investigates if this separation is justified. To do this, it compares three vernacular <b>histories</b> and three Latin <b>histories</b> composed in twelfth century England. It focuses specifically on the patronage of these <b>histories</b> and the literary trend for ‘courtly’ writing which some scholars have seen as reflecting lay aristocratic culture. This comparison demonstrates that these <b>histories</b> were influenced by networks of both lay and religious aristocrats. It discusses how so called ‘courtly elements’ in vernacular <b>histories,</b> which are seen {{as the result of}} lay aristocratic influence, were also present in Latin <b>histories.</b> Vernacular <b>histories</b> could also include classical references, pious asides, and an extensive use of Latin source material. They are thus the product of many influences, including the historian’s education, their piety {{and the way in which}} they intend to use the past. They cannot be defined by the language they are composed in...|$|R
