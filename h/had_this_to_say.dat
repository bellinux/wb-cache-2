25|$|Nothing about a {{personal}} connection between Gertrude Lawrence and Daphne du Maurier was published during Lawrence's lifetime. Two years after Lawrence's death, her widower Richard Aldrich <b>had</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in a best-selling biography of his late wife, Gertrude Lawrence as Mrs. A.:All her ingenuous traits, {{which could be}} annoying as well as endearing, would be swept away by her courage, her clear perception of truth, and the divine compassion which could flood her heart and lift her to the heights of nobility.|$|E
25|$|In 1732 Lord Cobham's nephew Gilbert West wrote {{a lengthy}} poem, The Gardens of the Right Honourable Richard Viscount Cobham, that is {{actually}} {{a guide to the}} gardens in verse form. Charles Bridgeman commissioned 15 engravings of the gardens from Jacques Rigaud which were published in 1739. In 1744 Benton Seeley published A Description of the Gardens of Lord Cobham at Stow Buckinghamshire. In 1748 William Gilpin produced the Views of the Temples and other Ornamental Buildings in the Gardens at Stow followed in 1749 by A Dialogue upon the Gardens at Stow. Unlicensed copies of all three books were published in 1750 by George Bickham as The Beauties of Stow. To cater to the large number of French visitors, a French guidebook, Les Charmes de Stow, was published in 1748. In the 1750s Jean-Jacques Rousseau had visited the gardens and his writings about the gardens helped spread their fame and influence throughout Europe. He <b>had</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'Stowe is composed of very beautiful and very picturesque spots chosen to represent different kinds of scenery, all of which seem natural except when considered as a whole, as in the Chinese gardens of which I was telling you. The master and creator of this superb domain has also erected ruins, temples and ancient buildings, like the scenes, exhibit a magnificence which is more than human'. Georges-Louis Le Rouge published in 1777 Détails de nouveaux jardins à la mode that included engravings of buildings at Stowe as well as at other famous gardens in Britain. In Germany Christian Cay Lorenz Hirschfeld published Theorie der Gartenkunst in 5 volumes in Leipzig 1779–1785, that included Stowe. The last edition of the Seeley guide was published in 1827. In 1805-9 John Claude Nattes painted 105 wash drawings of both the house and gardens.|$|E

500|$|The Natives next {{defeated}} both Northamptonshire and Kent, before defeats by Moseley and Burton-on-Trent.

The team recovered to win their next game, against Midlands Counties in Birmingham. Their next fixture was against Middlesex in a match not open to the public, and hosted by the Earl of Sheffield at Sheffield Park, Uckfield. The Middlesex side contained a number of international players, including Arthur Gould. Middlesex won easily, with the Natives play characterised by poor tackling.

McCartney <b>had</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on the group's formation: [...] "Wings were always a difficult idea... any group having to follow [...] success {{would have a hard}} job...

Kentucky Wildcats coach John Calipari <b>had</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about White: [...] "Here's a kid that would rather pass and get 15 assists than score a basket. It's amazing.

500|$|Infamous was {{released}} {{a few weeks}} before Radical Entertainment's Prototype, a game with many similar concepts including a character finding himself with super powers, a large open-world environment that can be traveled by climbing up buildings and gliding about the city, and several other comparisons. This led many game critics to compare and contrast the games. In his sarcastic Zero Punctuation review of Prototype, Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw (who had initially praised Infamous as [...] "huge, creative and fun,") compared the two games point for point, and determined that he could not tell which was the better game, and challenged the respective studios to [...] "produce the best image of the rival game's main character wearing a women's bra" [...] as a tiebreaker. To his surprise, both development teams rose to the challenge, producing said images, and forcing Croshaw to call it a near-tie, edging out in favor of Infamous, though still noted that, like their games, both images created independently were nearly equal in the assets that they included. This rivalry highlighted {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} exclusivity over a multiplatform release. Gaming analysts Jesse Divnich <b>had</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Due to near identical game play and quality scores, the Infamous vs. Prototype case study presents interesting data to publishers when considering the sales bump a title could receive by choosing exclusivity over a multiplatform release." ...|$|E
