Using sputtered anhydrous RuO thin-film electrodes as prototypes, μ-SCs are fabricated using Hilbert, Peano, and Moore fractal designs, and their performance {{is compared to}} conventional <b>interdigital</b> electrode <b>structures.</b> Microsupercapacitor performance, including energy density, areal and volumetric capacitances, changes with fractal electrode geometry. Specifically, the μ-SCs based on the Moore design show a 32 % enhancement in energy density compared to conventional <b>interdigital</b> <b>structures,</b> when compared at the same power density and using the same thin-film RuO electrodes.
