5|$|I {{called to}} him to turn hard opposite, so I could {{sandwich}} the Red fighters, but in his standard-rate bomber turn he got hit. I saw {{the whole thing and}} ordered him to dive and bail out immediately. To my intense relief I saw him leave the aircraft and his parachute blossom. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> get this Airacobra, but I was mad at myself for not harkening to my intuition not to fly with Günther Capito.|$|E
500|$|... "Spit & Eggs" [...] {{features}} the reveal that Mercer Hayes, played by Ryan Devlin, is the Hearst serial rapist. Devlin was unaware {{that he would}} be the perpetrator until reading the episode's script; he stated, [...] "To tell you the truth, I'm not even sure the writers knew where my story was headed. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> do it – it's way more fun being bad than good!" [...] The episode also marks the final appearance by Ed Begley, Jr., after his character is killed. The mystery surrounding his murder would be the next major story arc.|$|E

Shumlin {{stated that he}} was [...] "grateful {{for the opportunity to}} continue serving this state I love. I expect this will be a productive session addressing the issues Vermonters care about so deeply." [...] Milne said that it was [...] "a good day for Vermont... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> be a part of it. I think the road that's led us here has a lot of people feeling like one person can make a difference." [...] Milne did not rule out running again in 2016, although he later declined and instead ran for the United States Senate.|$|E

500|$|B in the Mix: The Remixes {{received}} little promotion compared to Spears' standards. A promotional extended play (EP) titled Key Cuts from Remixed with several remixes from {{the album was}} released in September 2005. A contest was launched on Spears' paid fan site for those who pre-ordered the album. The winner received a copy of , a bottle of Spears' fragrance Fantasy with an additional lotion and make-up kit, and a personalized autographed picture of Spears. On November 22, 2005, the day the album was released, a release party was held at an unspecified nightclub in Los Angeles, California, organized by Spears' management and the webmaster of the fansite WorldOfBritney.com. It was a limited event to five hundred people, including members of the fansite or her official fan club. Spears commented: [...] "I {{just wanted to say}} that I love the idea of all my fans getting together to celebrate the release of my new album. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> help! I hope you have a great night out at the club and dance all night long!".|$|E
500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was at home}} to Charlton Athletic. The team conceded four {{goals in}} 20 minutes and blew several chances to [...] "kill the game", in what was the club's biggest home defeat in the league under Wenger. An away trip to local rivals Tottenham Hostpur became {{magnified}} with interest, given it marked the return of Campbell following his move to Arsenal. An 81st-minute goal scored by Pirès put Arsenal into the lead, before a lapse by Wright in goal allowed Gus Poyet‘s shot to squirm from his grasp and enter the goalnet. Arsenal then faced league champions Manchester United {{and in spite of}} conceding inside 14 minutes through a Paul Scholes’ strike, Ljungberg equalised for them [...] "with a wonderful chipped finish, following Gary Neville's wretched error." [...] Arsenal improved in the second half but scored in unforeseen fashion: United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez passed the ball directly into the feet of Henry, who profited from the error and scored. Five minutes later, Barthez's failure to grasp the ball presented Henry the chance to score his second, which he did. Both Henry and Wenger defended the opposition goalkeeper, with the former, his international teammate saying: [...] "Of course <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> score the goals but it was strange. He's my good friend and I feel sorry for him; I would rather have got them another way." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Society Hill" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{questioned whether}} in real life, medical examiners [...] "do this much investigation on case", but then further saying, [...] "I always assumed that detectives did the field work {{but if that}} were the case on Body of Proof then I suppose we wouldn't have much of a show". She praised Neal Bledsoe's portrayal of Stephen Burkett, saying that he did a [...] "wonderful job of playing a chronic hair puller". She also praised the character of Curtis, stating that he was [...] "adorable". Of the storyline she said, [...] "The actual murder by electrocution was an interesting twist and one I didn't see coming. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> see Bud jump in and read the murderer her rights before she said anything further. That certainly seemed like something a detective should do". She finished in saying that she [...] "enjoyed" [...] the song played at the end of the episode, 'Maybe' by Ingrid Michaelson [...] "was both cheery and melancholy enough to fit the moment". Michelle Carlbert from TV Equals praised the scene in which Megan pulls Colin's hair, calling it one of her [...] "favourite bits", another being when it showed Ethan, Peter, Curtis and Bud going out on a [...] "Boy’s Night" [...] stating it was [...] "awesome" [...] and that she [...] "love(s) it when they show the team bonding like that". She also commented on Megan and Peter's clothes, stating that [...] "Megan looked great in her dress" [...] and Peter in a tux was [...] "whoa".|$|E

2500|$|... "Last autumn I spent {{a couple}} of months in the Balkans. Things are not rosy in these countries, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> find our people of good courage in the Lord. The work is growing in Jugoslavia. ... The dismemberment of Rumania {{deprived}} that Union of thousands of its members, and it worked havoc with our organization.|$|E
2500|$|Nimoy {{said he had}} {{returned}} to the role because of the script and the enthusiasm shown by Abrams alongside Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman explaining what they wanted from the script and the Spock character. He added, [...] "I had felt marginalized for a long time. I hadn't been asked to be involved with Star Trek for something like 17 or 18 years. And this felt like somebody said, 'There's a value to you, that we'd like to take advantage of and do something with.' And it felt good. It felt good. It felt like being, frankly, appreciated. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> go back to work." [...] Nimoy subsequently befriended Quinto. Although Quinto watched some episodes of The Original Series during breaks in filming, he said Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock.|$|E

2500|$|... "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" [...] is {{credited}} to Lennon–McCartney, but Lennon {{said he had}} written it entirely himself. McCartney disagrees; in a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, he said: [...] "I read, occasionally, people say, 'Oh, John wrote that one.' I say, 'Wait a minute, what was that afternoon I spent with him, then, looking at this poster?' He happened to have a poster {{in his living room}} at home. I was out at his house, and we just got this idea, because the poster said 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite' – and then we put in, you know, 'there will be a show tonight,' and then it was like, 'of course,'… The song just wrote itself. So, yeah, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> kind of reclaim it as partially mine.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|To be honest, I wasn't {{very smart}} about things. At that stage I was still {{averaging}} 40 after nine Tests {{or so and}} with the Packer players away, {{most of the other}} guys in the Aussie Test team were very new to the team. I thought {{it was up to me}} to compete with the Packer boys. When the Packer catchcry was [...] "Lillee getting wickets and Hookesy clearing pickets" [...] I felt that anyone who was coming to watch me play needed to be entertained. I probably played more aggressively than I should have. My feeling was I wanted to give the crowd something to look at when they came in the gates. I should have been more circumspect. In a lot of cases <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> get out for 30 or 40. But I felt we needed to compete with WSC boys.|$|E
2500|$|Westbrook did {{not return}} and made her final {{appearance}} as Sam on 24 January 2000. She has since confessed that her drug taking was the reason why she was written out. In her autobiography she comments, [...] "I wasn't fired this time, but let's just say when they {{gave me the opportunity}} to walk I took it. I was no longer interested in acting and that had become blatantly obvious to everyone on set. The soap was now being shown four times a week and it was impossible to balance the workload with my addiction [...] Not only had [...] destroyed my nose, but it was about to destroy my career again as well [...] The producers were tiring of my behaviour [...] When I did leave the production at the end of 1999 it was in fact a fairly mutual decision. I admit that had I begged the producers to let me stay this time I doubt if they would have allowed me to. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> go [...] Looking back to that point now it fills me with shame that I could have behaved in that way and let down so many people". Following her axing, Westbrook's eroded nasal septum was revealed to the public by the press, after she was photographed at the 2000 British Soap Awards.|$|E

60|$|Acland, my old {{and kind}} friend. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> see him. He may be {{considered}} now {{as the head of}} the religious party in the House of Commons, a powerful body which Wilberforce long commanded. It is a difficult situation; for the adaptation of religious motives to earthly policy is apt--among the infinite delusions of the human heart--to be a snare. But I could confide much in Sir T.
