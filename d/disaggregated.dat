5|$|In February 1992, European Union {{countries}} {{signed the}} Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the European Monetary Institute which was ultimately dissolved {{in tandem with}} the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank (ECB) and European System of Central Banks. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the Euro, adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they <b>disaggregated</b> their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. , the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses <b>disaggregate</b> {{inflation}} data spanning all {{of consumption}} to examine: (i) {{the persistence of}} <b>disaggregate</b> inflation relative to aggregate inflation; (ii) the distribution of persistence across consumption sectors; and (iii) whether persistence has changed. Assuming mean inflation to be unchanged within samples, the average persistence of <b>disaggregate</b> inflation is consistently below aggregate persistence. Taking into account an early 1990 s shift in mean inflation identified by break tests—including tests applied to systems of <b>disaggregate</b> equations—yields much lower estimates of both aggregate and <b>disaggregate</b> persistence for 1984 - 02. But with the mean break taken into account, average <b>disaggregate</b> persistence is actually as great as aggregate inflation persistence. A factor model provides a natural framework for interpreting the relationship between aggregate and <b>disaggregate</b> persistence. Consumer price indexes...|$|R

Our ensemble predictive methodology utilizes a linear mixture of experts framework {{to combine the}} forecast densities from potentially many component models. Each component represents the univariate dynamic process followed by a single <b>disaggregate</b> variable. The ensemble produced from these components approximates the many unknown relationships between the <b>disaggregates</b> and the aggregate by using time-varying weights on the component forecast densities. In our application, we use the <b>disaggregate</b> ensemble approach to forecast US Personal Consumption Expenditure in°ation from 1997 Q 2 to 2008 Q 1.

40|$|To {{forecast}} an aggregate, {{we propose}} adding <b>disaggregate</b> variables, instead of combining forecasts of those <b>disaggregates</b> or forecasting by a univariate aggregate model. New analytical results show {{the effects of}} changing coefficients, mis-specification, estimation uncertainty and mis-measurement error. Forecastorigin shifts in parameters affect absolute, but not relative, forecast accuracies; mis-specification and estimation uncertainty induce forecast-error differences, which variable-selection procedures or dimension reductions can mitigate. In Monte Carlo simulations, different stochastic structures and interdependencies between <b>disaggregates</b> imply that including <b>disaggregate</b> information in the aggregate model improves forecast accuracy. Our theoretical predictions and simulations are corroborated when forecasting aggregate US inflation pre- and post 1984 using <b>disaggregate</b> sectoral data.

25|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} a modern economy is diversification and an advanced division of labor. By the mid-17th century under 40 percent {{of the labor force}} was employed in agriculture, whereas 30 percent was engaged in a highly diversified industrial sector, the balance of the labor force being engaged in commerce and other service industries. The numerous cities formed a complex web of interdependencies, with the lesser ports performing specialized functions to the major ones; the industrial towns specializing in specific types of production; the countryside becoming highly differentiated by agricultural specialization, with the villages evolving into service centers (or later sometimes centers of outsourced industrial production). However, the integration of specialized agriculture and industry with the growing entrepôt functions of the ports (at least before these functions became <b>disaggregated</b> again in the 18th century) imparted a special dynamism to the Dutch economy during the Golden Age economy.|$|E

2500|$|This {{worldwide}} primacy {{in trade}} {{would not have}} been possible if it only rested on Dutch primacy in the carrying trade. After all, one has to trade something.

A surplus in [...] "invisibles", like shipping services, would not suffice to cover the enormous financing requirement of the spice trade. At first, the Dutch had little indigenous to offer, beyond herring and dairy products. But the industrial revolution of the early 17th century brought an industry into being that by the 1640s had matured enough to play an important part in Dutch exports. This industrial growth was partly innovation driven, stimulating all kinds of heretofore not seen mechanization, that greatly enhanced labor productivity, thereby driving down prices for Dutch products, even while nominal wages rose steeply at the same time. But the commerce-engendered Dutch control of many raw-material markets (like Spanish and Turkish raw wool, Swedish iron and copper, Ibero-American dyestuffs, Portuguese salt, French wine, Baltic grain, Scandinavian tar and wood, Caribbean sugar, American tobacco etc.) was an important factor in stimulating the booms of the industries that used those materials: textiles, guns, vinegar, shipbuilding, sugar and salt refining, tobacco blending, to name only a few. [...] The Dutch entrepot was therefore supplied by an important domestic industrial sector, and not limited to reexporting wares obtained abroad. Industry and commerce were in this period closely integrated (though in later stages of the Dutch economy they would become <b>disaggregated</b> again, when foreign protection and a structurally high real-wage level forced the decline of the Dutch industrial sector).|$|E
