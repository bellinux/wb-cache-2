40|$|In my {{response}} to the commentaries made about my article, I observe that the commentators find no obvious errors with my estimates {{of the size of}} the signing deaf community. However, most of them are not as pessimistic as I am partly because of the position they take on a number of issues. Namely, the supposed uniqueness of Australia in its treatment of deaf people and deafness; the relevancy of different types of signers to the fate of signed languages; the inevitability or reversibility of declining numbers; the ethics of reproductive technology; and, finally, the responsibilities of linguists vis-à-vis the communities they work with. In {{my response}}, I show how we <b>differently</b> <b>interpret</b> these issues and argue for my perspective on them. 19 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Treball Final de Grau en Estudis Anglesos. Codi: EA 0938. Curs acadèmic: 2016 / 2017 This {{assignment}} has as {{main point}} {{to explain the}} process in which metaphors are understood as a cognitive linguistic process. Having several theories that <b>differently</b> <b>interpret</b> this procedure, two different theories are chosen to be tested. These theories are Blending theory and Conceptual Metaphor theory. Firstly, in this work, both theories are explained, and the differences and equalities between them are discussed. In a {{second part of the}} assignment, a set of metaphors are analysed in order to find which theory best accounts for how metaphors are structured as a cognitive process. Finally, results from the previous analysis are discussed in order to find a conclusion...|$|R
60|$|Again: if {{rights of}} {{property}} {{over the same}} things are of different extent in different countries, so also are they exercised over different things. In all countries at a former time, and in some countries still, the right of property extended and extends to the ownership of human beings. There has often been property in public trusts, as in judicial offices, and a vast multitude of others in France before the Revolution; {{there are still a}} few patent offices in Great Britain, though I believe they will cease by operation of law on the death of the present holders; and we are only now abolishing property in army rank. Public bodies, constituted and endowed for public purposes, still claim the same inviolable right of property in their estates which individuals have in theirs, and though a sound political morality does not acknowledge this claim, the law supports it. We thus see that the right of property is <b>differently</b> <b>interpreted,</b> and held to be of different extent, in different times and places; that the conception entertained of it is a varying conception, has been frequently revised, and may admit of still further revision. It is also to be noticed that the revisions which it has hitherto undergone in the progress of society have generally been improvements. When, therefore, it is maintained, rightly or wrongly, that some change or modification in the powers exercised over things by the persons legally recognised as their proprietors would be beneficial to the public and conducive to the general improvement, it is no good answer to this merely to say that the proposed change conflicts with the idea of property. The idea of property is not some one thing, identical throughout history and incapable of alteration, but is variable like all other creations of the human mind; at any given time it is a brief expression denoting the rights over things conferred by the law or custom of some given society at that time; but neither on this point nor on any other has the law and custom of a given time and place a claim to be stereotyped for ever. A proposed reform in laws or customs is not necessarily objectionable because its adoption would imply, not the adaptation of all human affairs to the existing idea of property, but the adaptation of existing ideas of property to the growth and improvement of human affairs. This is said without prejudice to the equitable claim of proprietors to be compensated by the state for such legal rights of a proprietary nature as they may be dispossessed of for the public advantage. That equitable claim, the grounds and the just limits of it, are a subject by itself, and as such will be discussed hereafter. Under this condition, however, society is fully entitled to abrogate or alter any particular right of property which on sufficient consideration it judges to {{stand in the way of}} the public good. And assuredly the terrible case which, as we saw in a former chapter, Socialists are able to make out against the present economic order of society, demands a full consideration of all means by which the institution may have a chance of being made to work in a manner more beneficial to that large portion of society which at present enjoys the least share of its direct benefits.|$|E

50|$|Oliver Heaviside (1893):”What is Maxwell's theory? The first {{approximation}} is to say: There is Maxwell's book as {{he wrote}} it; there is his text, and there are his equations: together they make his theory. But {{when we come to}} examine it closely, we find that this answer is unsatisfactory. To begin with, it is sufficient to refer to papers by physicists, written say during the first twelve years following the first publication of Maxwell's treatise to see that there may be much difference of opinion as to what his theory is. It may be, and has been, <b>differently</b> <b>interpreted</b> by different men, which is a sign that is not set forth in a perfectly clear and unmistakable form. There are many obscurities and some inconsistencies. Speaking for myself, it was only by changing its form of presentation that I was able to see it clearly, and so as to avoid the inconsistencies. Now there is no finality in a growing science. It is, therefore, impossible to adhere strictly to Maxwell's theory as he gave it to the world, if only on account of its inconvenient form.|$|E

In this article we introduce a new concept of incorporating Human Visual System (HVS) into blind restoration of degraded images. Since the image quality is subjective in nature, human observers can <b>differently</b> <b>interpret</b> the same iterative restoration results. This research also attempts {{to address this problem}} by quantifying some of the evaluation criteria with significant improvement in the consistency of the judgment of the final result. We have modified some image fidelity metrics such as MSE, Correlation Value and Laplacian Correlation Value metrics to be used in iterative blind restoration of blurred images.

5000|$|The words [...] "They {{looked after}} Moses" [...] (Exodus 33:8) are <b>differently</b> <b>interpreted.</b> According to one opinion the people praised Moses, saying: [...] "Hail {{to the mother}} who has borne him; all the days of his life God speaks with him; and he is {{dedicated}} to the service of God." [...] According to another opinion they reproached and reviled him: they accused him of committing adultery with another man's wife; and every man became jealous and forbade his wife to speak to Moses. They said: [...] "See how fat and strong he has grown; he eats and drinks what belongs to the Jews, and everything that he has is taken from the people. Shall a man who has managed the building of the Tabernacle not become rich?" [...] (Sanhedrin 110a; Ḳid. 33b; Exodus Rabba 51.4; SheḲ. v. 13). Yet Moses was the most conscientious of superintendents (Ber. 44a), and although he had been given sole charge of the work, he always caused his accounts to be examined by others (Exodus Rabba 51.1). He was always among the workmen, showing them how to do the work.|$|E
5000|$|Peculiarities of {{architectural}} {{structure of the}} mausoleum indicate that masters of various architectural professions were involved in its construction. Despite a generality of the composition and architectural appearance of the portals, detailed representation of the arches’ archivolts is also original. There are patterns which aren’t met in other portals. Ligatures common for style are <b>differently</b> <b>interpreted</b> and placed on planes; decorations included in images of the ligatures are diverse; butts of the ornament’s band are authorized differently, which are common for some portals for their images. Characterizing architecture of the mausoleum, its corrugated surface, determining architectural expressiveness of its appearance in a significant level should be especially mentioned. This method acquired extremely wide propagation both timely and territorially. This method was initially met and widely used mainly in pre-feudal defense constructions of Trans-Caspian. Distribution of this method to memorial (Mausoleums of Garabaghlar, Radkan and Kishmar) and cultic (Jar-Kurgan) constructions {{dates back to the}} earlier time. In the history of Azerbaijani architects the architect Badraddin from Tabriz applied it in Konia (1273-74), building a mausoleum to Jalal ad-Din Rumi. Architect Ahmad shah - another native of Tabriz also successfully applied this method to tholobate of cupola of Mirjaniyya Mosque (1356-57) in Baghdad. Later (1535-1536) this method was met in under cupola tholobate of Osman Khan-Sultan’s palace in Ardabil. Barda mausoleum is the most similar to Garabaghlar mausoleum by analogy.|$|E
