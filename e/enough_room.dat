5|$|After {{many years}} of success under head coach Dan McGugin and an undefeated 1921 season, Vanderbilt had outgrown its old stadium. Since there was not <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> to expand old Dudley Field at its site near Kirkland Hall, the Vanderbilt administrators {{purchased}} land adjacent to the present 25th Avenue South for the new facility. The steel-and-concrete structure cost about $200,000 and could seat 22,600. It was the first dedicated college football stadium in the South.|$|E
5|$|In 1780, {{the society}} moved again, {{this time to}} Somerset House. The {{property}} was offered to the society by His Majesty's Government and, as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778, he began planning the move. Somerset House, while larger than Crane Court, was not satisfying to the fellows; the room to store the library was too small, the accommodation was insufficient {{and there was not}} <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> to store the museum at all. As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms, one of which was used for council meetings.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{at what point}} among the extant fragments the division between books 1 and 2 fell, but {{at least some of}} the Aeolid families were covered in the second book. The families of Perieres, Deion and Sisyphus (in that order) were most likely found in the 2nd book because there does not appear to be <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> left in book 1 to accommodate them as a group after the children of Neleus and Pelias. It was once thought that the Ehoie of Atalanta opened the book, but recently published evidence casts doubt upon this view (see Book 3, below).|$|E

5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with {{fluttering}} interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do not {{look as if they}} are walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is <b>enough</b> <b>room,</b> the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} the second crewman was an obvious problem with the Mk. XII, {{especially}} as few bombers of the era had <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> for the operator. Working with Henry Braddick, Blackett developed {{a new version of}} the calculator that included aircraft instruments inside the computor, eliminating the {{need for the}} needle-on-needle matching and completely automating the calculations. After the initial design was complete, Blackett moved onto other matters with RAF Coastal Command, where he continued development of his theories of operational research.|$|E
5|$|In Stevenson's first {{message to}} the legislature, he called on legislators to finally decide whether the state capital would remain at Frankfort or be moved to Lexington or Louisville, as some had wanted. His address {{made it clear that}} he favored keeping the capital at Frankfort, but he noted that {{additional}} space was needed at the present capitol building because the existing building could not continue to house <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> both the state treasurer and auditor. He laid out a vision for an addition to the capitol that would make it more spacious and more grandiose. To pay for the expansion, the fiscally conservative Stevenson pressed the federal government to pay claims due Kentucky from Civil War expenses. By the end of his term, the state had collected over $1.5 million in claims. The legislature, however, disregarded his plan for expanding the capitol, instead opting to construct a separate executive office building next to the capitol.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} {{was not an}} easy place to defend without artillery, as the plains made surprise attacks difficult. Except for the convent itself, the terrain did not offer any natural barriers that the patriots could exploit. Nevertheless, the flat terrain was ideal for cavalry manoeuvres, and the distance between the church and the west gully gave <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> for a cavalry charge. The royalists, on the other hand, could support their troops with their ships from the river. Without a supporting navy, or local batteries, San Martín had no means to attack the ships. Although the small path allowed them passage to the ships, it could force the royalist forces to bottleneck during a retreat while the long range guns of the ships protected them. San Martín studied the battlefield and readied the plan for the operation during the night, when the grenadiers were hidden inside the convent.|$|E
5|$|When Maximus {{eventually}} {{catches up}} with Rapunzel, Flynn and Pascal, the horse attempts to apprehend Flynn only to be charmed by Rapunzel, who convinces him to leave Flynn alone until they have arrived at their destination while Pascal ensures that the two maintain a healthy relationship. In the kingdom, Flynn, Rapunzel and Pascal embark on a canoe ride to see the floating lights, revealed to be lanterns, up-close, while Maximus is forced to wait ashore as there is not <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> for him. In a friendly gesture, Flynn gives him a bag of apples. Realizing that he is {{falling in love with}} Rapunzel, Flynn attempts to hand off the crown he was promised to the Stabbington Brothers, two colleagues of his, only to be kidnapped and handed over to the police. Mistaking this for abandonment, Rapunzel is taken back to the tower by Gothel, who has caught up with them.|$|E
5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} the {{propulsion}} plant, {{which was to be}} built in the Netherlands, was taking shape. Requirements sent out in August 1939 mandated that the ships have eight boiler rooms, four sets of geared turbines, and 180,000shp. After further improvements, Nevesbu and two German firms (Germaniawerft was responsible for the turbines and Deschimag for the boilers) began sketching preliminary plans. These were then incorporated into two different design studies, one by Nevesbu and the other by NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS). IvS was purportedly a Dutch company linking Dutch and German designers, but in reality functioned as a front company for German interests. Their design was probably based upon a set of plans drawn up by the Ship Construction Office of the German Navy and received in the Netherlands on 31 August. It did not give the propulsion machinery enough space, and it was thought that this design did not provide <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> for magazines. Nevertheless, it was taken into discussions with the Dutch, where the 11 July design was merged with it. IvS came out with one further plan on 11 March 1940, the merits of which were discussed with the Dutch in April of that year.|$|E
5|$|Much of the post-race debate {{centred on}} the Red Bulls' clash {{at the front}} of the field on lap 40. Both Webber and Vettel blamed each other for the crash. Team {{principal}} Christian Horner implied Webber remained partially responsible for failing to give Vettel <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> on the run to the corner, and he was noticeably frustrated and angry at both of his drivers for wasting a potential 1–2 finish. Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko insisted the team did not favour Vettel through their strategy and also offered the perspective that Vettel had to attack for fear of backing off into the clutches of Hamilton behind. McLaren chief engineer Tim Goss said the crash had prevented Red Bull from securing a 1–2 finish, but understood why Webber switched to a different engine mode as he noted that one of Vettel's engines had failed earlier in the season. He felt that the battle between both McLaren and Red Bull drivers for both championships would continue unabated. Red Bull held a meeting at their factory in Milton Keynes four days after the race, and all people in attendance believed the situation had been dealt with. The incident between Webber and Vettel is widely seen by the media as a key moment in the rivalry between the two drivers, which had started when Vettel collided with Webber at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix and both drivers were forced to retire.|$|E
