2500|$|Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have a {{limit on}} the maximum sized loan they will guarantee. This {{is known as the}} [...] "{{conforming}} loan limit". The conforming loan limit for Fannie Mae, along with Freddie Mac, is set by Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the regulator of both GSEs. OFHEO annually sets the limit of the size of a conforming loan based on the October to October changes in mean home price, above which a mortgage is considered a non-conforming <b>jumbo</b> <b>loan.</b> The conforming loan limit is 50 percent higher in Alaska and Hawaii. The GSEs only buy loans that are conforming to repackage into the secondary market, lowering the demand for non-conforming loans. By virtue of the law of supply and demand, then, it is harder for lenders to sell these loans in the secondary market; thus these types of loans tend to cost more to borrowers (typically 1/4 to 1/2 of a percent). Indeed, in 2008, since the demand for bonds not guaranteed by GSEs was almost non-existent, non-conforming loans were priced nearly 1% to 1.5% higher than conforming loans.|$|E
5000|$|A Super Jumbo Mortgage is {{classified}} in the United States as a residential mortgage or other home-equity secured loan in an amount greater than $650,000, although lenders differ on just what constitutes a super jumbo mortgage subject to their own internal investment criteria. Super Jumbo mortgages are made available to borrowers whose loan requirements exceed the guidelines {{commonly referred to as}} <b>Jumbo</b> <b>loan</b> limits, which apply to mortgage loan amounts in excess of the FNMA / FHLMC ("Fannie Mae" [...] or [...] "Freddie Mac") conforming loan limits of 417,000. Unlike <b>Jumbo</b> <b>loan</b> limits, the super jumbo mortgage category is not directly defined, controlled, or regulated by any of these aforementioned agencies. Instead, mortgage lenders internally and independently define their own parameters and criteria for what defines a Super Jumbo mortgage. The minimum loan amount for some lenders to classify a loan as Super Jumbo ranges from $500,000 (with the exception of Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands where <b>jumbo</b> <b>loan</b> limits on single family residences are $625,000, or 50% higher) to $1,500,000, with maximum super <b>jumbo</b> <b>loan</b> amounts generally running into the $10,000,000 to $20,000,000 range.|$|E
50|$|In general, any loan {{which does}} not meet {{guidelines}} is a non-conforming loan. A loan {{which does not}} meet guidelines specifically because the loan amount exceeds the guideline limits {{is known as a}} <b>jumbo</b> <b>loan.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{delinquency}} rate on <b>jumbo</b> <b>loans</b> rose dramatically, tripling {{over the}} course of 2009, and by February 2010, almost one in ten jumbo mortgages were 'seriously delinquent' (i.e. in arrears by at least 60 days).|$|R
40|$|After a home buyer secures a {{loan from}} a bank (i. e., a mortgage), the bank often securitizes the loans, which means they package them for sale to investors. This process is much easier if the loans are backed by Fannie and Freddie, the {{government}} sponsored mortgage agencies. Fannie and Freddie, however, will only back loans below certain values [...] the so-called <b>jumbo</b> <b>loans.</b> This amount has generally been capped at $ 417, 000 (although higher in certain high-cost areas). Regulators plan to lower these caps, which means <b>jumbo</b> <b>loans</b> may be {{harder to come by}} since it will be more difficult to securitize such loans. See article here, LA Times...|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} new loans were 40- or 50-year amortization, or had an interest-only option, similar to {{subprime}} loans. That meant that the <b>jumbo</b> <b>loan</b> borrower would pay the loan back {{over a longer period}} of time, or could defer any repayment of principal for a few years (thereby also increasing the total amount to be paid back).However from 2007, as prices fell and the number of foreclosures rose, lenders turned away from providing jumbo mortgages. Lenders that did remain in the <b>jumbo</b> <b>loan</b> market increased rates sharply, with rates up to 1.5 percentage points higher than for conforming loans. This withdrawal from the market led to a lack of lending available to fund the purchases of expensive homes, thus putting further downward pressure on house prices and completing a vicious circle.|$|E
50|$|As house {{prices rose}} {{as part of}} the United States housing bubble, there was a large {{increase}} in the number of <b>jumbo</b> <b>loan</b> applicants. Due to rising prices, many consumers had to take out jumbo mortgages in order to buy modest homes in big-city areas; this option was no longer limited to high-end luxury residences.|$|E
50|$|The GSEs {{are allowed}} to buy only {{conforming}} loans, which limits secondary market demand for non-conforming loans. The relationship between supply and demand typically renders the non-conforming loan harder to sell (fewer competing buyers); thus it would cost the consumer more (typically 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point, and sometimes more, depending on credit market conditions). OFHEO, now merged into the new FHFA, annually sets the limit {{of the size of}} a conforming loan in response to the October to October change in mean home price. Above the conforming loan limit, a mortgage is considered a <b>jumbo</b> <b>loan.</b> The conforming loan limit is 50 percent higher in such high-cost areas as Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and the US Virgin Islands, and is also higher for 2-4 unit properties on a graduating scale. Modifications to these limits were made temporarily to respond to the housing crisis, see <b>Jumbo</b> <b>loan</b> for recent events.|$|E
2500|$|Jumbo {{mortgage}} {{when the}} size of the loan is bigger than the [...] "conforming loan amount" [...] as set by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. [...] As such, the mortgage rates on <b>jumbo</b> <b>loans</b> are somewhat higher than for conforming loans.|$|R
5000|$|Hudson City was {{successful}} in avoiding the mortgage and banking meltdown made by prudent lending. However, [...] "actions taken {{by the government to}} rescue the banking system proved to be Hudson City's undoing." [...] It borrowed at 4% in 2005 and successfully avoided the rise in interest rates in 2006 but suffered from an unprecedented reduction in interest rates implemented by the Fed to bail out the banking system. Its portfolio of <b>jumbo</b> <b>loans</b> was previously ineligible to refinance into a conforming loan, giving the bank a stable long-term asset base. After the housing crisis, the rules changed raising the conforming limit, which enabled the high credit quality <b>jumbo</b> <b>loans</b> to refinance to the lower rate available to GSE-purchased mortgages. The lengthy foreclosure process left Hudson City with a large number of non-performing loans. A loss of high-quality borrowers, an inability to issue new mortgages at reasonable rates, and a portfolio of non-performing loans encouraged the bank to accept a buy-out.|$|R

50|$|Jumbo {{mortgage}} loans are {{a higher risk}} for lenders, mainly due to their larger size rather than credit quality. This is because if a jumbo mortgage loan defaults, it may be harder to sell a luxury residence quickly for full price. Luxury prices are more vulnerable to market highs and lows in some cases. That is one reason lenders prefer {{to have a higher}} down payment from <b>jumbo</b> <b>loan</b> seekers. Jumbo home prices can be more subjective and not as easily sold to a mainstream borrower, therefore many lenders may require two appraisals on a jumbo mortgage loan.|$|E
50|$|While Interest Rates {{are rarely}} {{the focal point}} of a typical Super Jumbo {{mortgage}} borrower's shopping list (most focus on cash flow and tax benefits), lenders routinely charge higher interest rates on super jumbo mortgage products than they would for a borrower with similar qualifying criteria in a conventional <b>jumbo</b> <b>loan,</b> in large part to account for their risk and reduction of liquidity. Below $1,000,000, super jumbo mortgage rates are generally within 50 basis points (half of a percent) of an equivalent jumbo mortgage interest rate, but above $2,000,000 rates can be 1% to 2% higher or more.|$|E
5000|$|The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) publishes annual {{conforming}} loan limits which dictates the mortgages that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy. The maximum {{loan amount}} is set {{based on the}} October-to-October changes in median home price, above which a mortgage is considered a <b>jumbo</b> <b>loan,</b> and typically has higher rates associated with it. This is because both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac only buy loans that are conforming, to repackage into the secondary market, making the demand for a non-conforming loan much less.

50|$|The {{complexity}} of many mortgage-backed securitization structures has heightened the overall risk aversion of investors, resulting {{in what has}} become a broader illiquidity in global credit markets. These disruptions have led to a precipitous decline in sub-prime lending, a significant reduction in the availability of Alt-A loans, and higher interest rates on <b>jumbo</b> <b>loans</b> (see Chart 3). The tightening in mortgage credit has placed further downward pressure on home sales and home prices, a situation that now could derail the U.S. economic expansion.|$|R

50|$|The {{interest}} rate charged on jumbo mortgage loans is generally higher than a loan that is conforming, due to the higher risk to the lender. The spread, or {{difference between the two}} rates, depends on the current market price of risk. While typically the spread fluctuates between 0.25 and 0.5%, at times of high investor anxiety, such as August 2007, it can exceed one and a half percentage points.It can be more expensive to refinance a <b>jumbo</b> <b>loan</b> due to the closing costs. Some lenders will offer the service of an extension and consolidation agreement, so that a jumbo refinancer will not have to pay for mortgage tax again on the same principal balance. In other cases, title insurance companies will offer up to a 50% discount, often required by law for those refinancing within 1 year to 10 years. The largest discount is for refinancing within one year.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{unconventional}} requirements of many super jumbo mortgage applicants, {{the popularity of}} unconventional mortgage programs amongst the wealthy is understandable. The popularity in particular of cash flow option ARM loans with super jumbo mortgage applicants is {{due in large part}} to the difference in perception of negative amortization in the context of their primary residence not being an asset but a liability. When home equity is substantial as required by the more stringent LTV requirements of super jumbo mortgage underwriting, negative amortization allows a borrower to extract more of the cash locked in the home's equity than would otherwise be possible, short of selling the property, due to the ability to defer interest above and beyond the Loan To Value stipulated on the note. In a conventional mortgage with principal and interest or interest only amortization, the borrower would be required to take out a second mortgage or line of credit to accomplish the same goal, but CLTV guidelines from most super jumbo lenders preclude the use of most of these products for this purpose. This is not to say that second mortgages and lines of credit are uncommon in super jumbo lending, in fact quite the opposite is true, but [...] "piggyback" [...] or [...] "80/20" [...] transactions which are common in conforming and <b>jumbo</b> <b>loan</b> financing are not as prevalent. Another popular application for the use of negative amortization loans by super jumbo mortgage borrowers is to shift as much of their taxable income to long term capital gains as possible by taking advantage of the lower monthly carrying costs and the ability to make lump sum payments at annual or semi-annual intervals. Super Jumbo Option ARM mortgages are also available in hybrid form, with fixed rate and fixed payment periods of 3, 5, 7 or 10 years, although they are relatively new on the super jumbo mortgage scene and not necessarily available to 8-figure loan amounts ($10 Million and up).|$|E

The relative drop in non-judicial states using the S&P CS publicly available data is 12 %, and the relative drop using FHFA is 3 %.

2500|$|In {{order for}} Fannie Mae to provide its {{guarantee}} to mortgage-backed securities it issues, it sets {{the guidelines for}} the loans that it will accept for purchase, called [...] "conforming" [...] loans. Fannie Mae produced an automated underwriting system (AUS) tool called Desktop Underwriter (DU) which lenders can use to automatically determine if a loan is conforming; Fannie Mae followed this program up in 2004 with Custom DU, which allows lenders to set custom underwriting rules to handle nonconforming loans as well. The secondary market for nonconforming <b>loans</b> includes <b>jumbo</b> <b>loans,</b> which are mortgages larger than the maximum mortgage that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will purchase.

5000|$|In the United States, a jumbo {{mortgage}} is {{a mortgage}} loan {{that may have}} high credit quality, but is in an amount above conventional conforming loan limits.This standard is set by the two government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and sets the limit on the maximum value of any individual mortgage they will purchase from a lender. Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) are large agencies that purchase the bulk of U.S. residential mortgages from banks and other lenders, allowing them to free up liquidity to lend more mortgages. When FNMA and FHLMC limits don't cover the full loan amount, the loan {{is referred to as}} a [...] "jumbo mortgage". Traditionally, the interest rates on jumbo mortgages are higher than for conforming mortgages, however with GSE fees increasing, <b>Jumbo</b> <b>loans</b> have recently seen lower interest rates than conforming loans.|$|R
40|$|Keys, Mukherjee, and Vig (2010 a) {{argue that}} the {{evidence}} presented in Bubb and Kaufman (2009) {{is based on an}} inappropriate pooling of loans sold to private-label securitizers with loans sold to the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs). In this paper we investigate the issues raised by the authors and conclude that they do not change our basic analytical approach or conclusions. We examine samples that do not pool together loans sold to these two types of purchasers - a sample of loans bought by the GSEs, a sample of loans originated in 2008 - 2009 after the private-label market collapsed, and a sample of <b>jumbo</b> <b>loans</b> - and find discontinuities in the number and default rate of loans at credit score cutoffs in the absence of corresponding discontinuities in the securitization rate. We also examine a key assumption underlying their estimates - that no loans are both at risk of being sold to the GSEs and at risk of being sold to private-label securitizers - and show that the data are inconsistent with that assumption. We find that 18 percent of conforming loans in our sample at some time switched between GSE and private-label ownership, demonstrating that the GSEs and private-label securitizers competed for the same loans. Additionally, we show that lender screening cutoffs grew steadily over the period 1997 - 2010 during which the private-label market rose and collapsed...|$|R
50|$|Securities collateralized by {{home equity}} loans (HELs) are {{currently}} the largest asset class within the ABS market.
