As the ISO 14001 standard is mostly directed for the prevention and control of environmental commitments at the Earth surface, it does not deal with environmental problems in the subsurface environment, although its extended range would be highly regarded for this particular application. Under these trends for the extension of standards to underground mines important aspects have to be considered besides the minimization of environmental impacts, namely in terms of improving efficiency and cost reduction.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the <b>economic</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> crop rotations and to determine the economic implications of including forages and livestock during the transition to organic agriculture in Nova Scotia. The rotation systems were distinguished by: (i) frequency of forage in the rotation, (ii) source of nutrient supply, and (iii) type of farming operation. The economic analysis was divided in two parts. The first part analysed data from a four-year crop rotation experiment, using enterprise budgeting and statistical methods to compare differences among rotations under different treatments. The second part involved the development of a multi-period linear programming (LP) model to simulate a commercial operation. The results from the statistical analysis suggest that crop enterprise net returns tended to be higher in forage-based rotations and in the livestock systems compared to cash crop rotations and the stockless system. Results from the LP model suggest that including forages and beef cattle during the transition to organic agriculture can provide considerable economic benefits, especially when crops were grown under ruminant compost...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the technical and <b>economic</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> an <b>alternative</b> energy system in which the urban water system functions as a source for sustainable energy supply. It is demonstrated that aquifer thermal energy storage supplemented with surface water heat collection in summer, yields sufficient heat to compensate total heat demand of a residential district. Using the urban water system as energy source makes natural gas supply obsolete, provides a CO 2 reduction of 60 % and is preferable in terms of costs compared to conventional gas based central heating installations. The <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> the urban groundwater system, urban surface water system, and the <b>economic</b> <b>feasibility</b> are determined in this paper. The local groundwater feasibility to supply the design discharge is determined by soil and aquifer characteristics from the national groundwater database, reference projects, and bore-hole data. A heat balance model is used to quantify effects on the water system. Internal rate of return calculation for the investments and full lifetime exploitation costs are used to determine the <b>economic</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> the concept. In summer, there is a net water temperature decrease of 1. 5 - 1. 6 °C. Water quality and ecological improvement take place because a lower temperature results in increasing oxygen content.

Many different methods to control brush problem encroachment have been used in the last 50 years, but no conclusions regarding the most economically viable method have been reached. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the <b>economic</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> three <b>alternative</b> mesquite control methods: aerial spray rootkill herbicide ($ 59. 28 /ha), aerial spray topkill herbicide ($ 37. 05 /ha), and controlled topkill fire ($ 6. 18 /ha). The objective was accomplished by collecting herbaceous production data in response to the alternative mesquite control treatments. This data was quantified and used to estimate the net present values and internal rates of return for each scenario from a deterministic standpoint. It was also used as a method of validating PHYGROW; a hydrologic based range plant growth simulation model. This model produced stocking rates for each year over the planning horizon, which was used as the source of variability for the stochastic analyses. The stochastic analyses returned probabilistic values for the net present values and internal rates of return for each scenario. The deterministic analyses and stochastic analyses produced similar results. Both indicate that brush management using prescribed fire was the "best" alternative followed by the rootkill herbicide treatment. They also agree that the topkill herbicide treatment was not an economically feasible brush management alternative...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Ranchers in {{the high}} desert area of Eastern Oregon {{traditionally}} market their calves when they are weaned in late fall. This {{is the time when}} the market prices for calves are at a seasonal low. In this study the <b>economic</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> various <b>alternative</b> management and marketing strategies for the utilization of range forage with a spring calving operation is determined. The operational objectives were (1) to determine the most profitable time and weight to market the spring-born calves, (2) to determine whether supplementary feeding of yearlings is economically feasible, (3) to explore the competitive relationship between cows and yearlings for limited range forage, and (4) to determine the combination of beef production and growing activities which will provide the highest net returns. Linear programming was used to determine the combination of activities that would maximize net returns subject to the constraint of forage quality and quantity. The quality and quantity of the range forage was determined by using data provided by the Squaw Butte Experiment Station, Burns, Oregon. All the basic data pertaining to the high desert area were obtained from Squaw Butte. The initial L. P. solution indicated the heifers should be sold March 1 at 600 pounds having been fed to gain 1. 5 pounds per day while the steers were sold April 16 at 780 pounds, gaining 2. 0 pounds per day. The cows earned a higher MVP for the limited resource, range forage, than could the yearlings either with or without supplementary feeding. In the second solution barley price was reduced from 50 to 45 per ton and the steers were sold April 16 at 780 pounds (same as initial solution). The heifers were sold June 16 weighing 900 pounds having been fed to gain 2. 0 pounds per day. Supplementary feed was provided on the range for these heifers from April 16 to June 15. The study shows that the traditional management and marketing practice is not the most profitable alternative.

For new buildings, Member States shall ensure that, before construction starts, the technical, environmental and <b>economic</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> high-efficiency <b>alternative</b> systems are considered and taken into account, such as, among others, decentralised energy supply systems based on energy from renewable sources, cogeneration, district or block heating or cooling. However, {{the reduction of the}} heat needs of the buildings causes a partial utilization of the district heating (DH) capacity with a consequent possible reduction of the distribution efficiency. How to combine the reduction of energy needs and their duration with the technical and economical sustainability of DH and cogeneration systems is an open question. This paper aims to define the cost-optimal solutions of refurbishment for buildings connected to a DH considering the impact on both the heat demand reduction and network distribution losses. The possibility to shift to a low-temperature DH is considered a feasible solution to reduce thermal losses and hence increasing the network efficiency that is connected with a systematic approach to the refurbishment of the connected buildings. For this purpose, an integrated model has been developed and calibrated on real data of a DH system based on biomass and located in northern Italy. The energy performance of the coupled DH - buildings system has been assessed taking into account different measures for the improvement of the existing buildings and different numbers of refurbished buildings. The improvements involve building envelope, heating system and strategies of heating management. A multi-objective optimization has been carried out considering the minimization of the energy needs, the minimization of the net present value (NPV) for the final user and the maximization of the distribution efficiency of the DH, in terms of distribution temperature. The optimization has been also carried out considering different prices policies for heat sales according to its temperature level to assess how it can promote the efficiency of the DH. The results highlight the optimal measures that allow the minimum NPV of the building refurbishment and the highest efficiency of the considered DH system...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Productivity {{gains in}} the {{manufacturing}} sector have generally been credited to investments in production facilities that supplemented or replaced manual labor. Insertion of circuit boards is a key activity in the electronics industry. Improvements in productivity of circuit board manufacture may be achieved by replacing manual component insertion with automatic machine insertion. However, automatic insertion requires high capital expenditure; the capital must be invested in production alternatives {{that will result in}} the largest productivity improvement for every dollar invested. A critical decision regarding capital investment in component insertion is centralized versus decentralized insertion. This study is primarily concerned with the problem <b>of</b> evaluating the <b>economic</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> three production <b>alternatives</b> for circuit board manufacture [...] centralized production, in which all manufacturing operations are performed at one location; decentralized production, in which each business unit has an independent production cell; and satellite production, which uses a mixed production strategy whereby machine insertion is centralized but all other operations involved are decentralized. The approach used in this study is to examine the different cost parameters involved in circuit board manufacture and identify those factors which will differ significantly for the three production alternatives. Procedures are developed to estimate these cost parameters. The dollar values so obtained are then reduced to an annual worth basis for comparison purposes. The methodology developed is then applied to analyze this problem at Tektronix, Incorporated. Based on the cost factors quantified in this study, the analysis showed that centralized circuit board manufacture results in the least capital expenditure, smaller operating and maintenance costs, and higher machine and manpower utilization...|$|R
40|$|Risk Analysis is a {{collection}} of methods widely used in many industrial sectors. In the transport sector it has been particularly used for air transport applications. The reasons for this wide use are well-known: risk analysis allows to approach the safety theme in a stochastic - rather than deterministic - way, it forces to break down the system in sub-components, last but not least it allows a comparison between solutions with different costs, introducing de facto an element <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> the project <b>alternatives</b> in the safety field. Apart from the United Kingdom, in Europe the application of this tool in the railway sector is relatively recent. In particular Directive 2004 / 49 /EC (the "railway safety directive") provides for compulsory risk assessment in relation to the activities of railway Infrastructure Managers (IMs) and of Railway Undertakings (RUs). Nevertheless the peculiarity of the railway system - in which human, procedural, environmental and technological components have a continuous interchange and in which human responsibilities and technological functions often overlap - induced the EC to allow wide margins of subjectivity in the interpretation of risk assessment. When enacting Commission Regulation (EC) No 352 / 2009 which further regulates this subject, a risk assessment is considered positive also if the IM or RU declare to take safety measures widely used in normal practice. The paper shows the results of a structured comparative analysis of the rail sector and other industrial sectors, which illustrate the difficulties, but also the opportunities, of a transfer towards the railway system of the risk analysis methods currently in use for the other systems...|$|R

Occasions of successive complete crop failures and heavy financial losses have also occurred.
