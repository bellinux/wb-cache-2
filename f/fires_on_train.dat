50|$|Scarred also {{captures the}} trauma of the Sabarmati Express survivors, those hit by a mystery <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> a <b>train</b> that killed nearly 58 Hindu pilgrims, and was blamed by some as {{triggering}} off the anti-Muslim violence. This has also been called the Godhra Train Burning. But this book is also an intense portrait of refugees scarred by the prolonged anti-Muslim violence, people fighting for justice amidst fear and turmoil, unable to return home.|$|R

500|$|Rival clubs {{occasionally}} {{refer to}} Aberdeen [...] "The Sheep" [...] {{and their supporters}} [...] "The Sheep Shaggers". The term was eventually accepted by the club's supporters, and fans began chanting [...] "the sheep are [...] " [...] at games. The song was originally sung by away fans poking fun at an Aberdeen fan set <b>on</b> <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> a <b>train</b> while wearing a homemade sheep costume. This in turn led to specialised merchandise being sold by the club and local businesses.|$|R

2500|$|The {{train was}} {{carrying}} around 50 British {{soldiers of the}} Essex Regiment, who were mingled with civilian passengers throughout the train's carriages. The IRA party was therefore quite heavily outnumbered and out-gunned. However they were not warned of this, as two IRA scouts, {{who were supposed to}} have been <b>on</b> the <b>train</b> and signalled to them of British numbers, never turned up. They also wrongly believed that the British troops were all in the central carriage. As a result, when the IRA opened <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> the <b>train,</b> there were heavy civilian casualties. The New York Times reported that [...] "a shower of bullets was rained <b>on</b> the <b>train,</b> practically every compartment being swept".|$|R

50|$|The first fight {{took place}} on the field called Törökugrató (Turk Jumper).

However, he didn't wanted any bloodshed, therefore he waited and attended a holy mass in Bicske, waiting for Lt. General Hegedűs with the news, in the faith that the city is free for him to go.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the ground surface {{makes it difficult to}} calculate the propagation of impulse noise from Army-type blasts such as that produced by heavy-weapons <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> <b>training</b> ranges. This study developed the computer program gtdcom, which extends the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD) propagation model to include realistic, three-dimensional terrain, broadband sounds (blast waves), and frequency weighting factors. This report describes the theoretical basis used to broaden the GTD model, and briefly outlines the use of gtdcom. The new program was interfaced with the Geographic Re-sources Analysis Support System (GRASS) to calculate sound exposure levels (SELs) from blast sources using map elevation contour data. A user specifies the source position of the blast, a charge size, and an expected frequency weighting factor; the program calculates the SEL for each terrain cell, displays the results on the screen, and prepares a contour map for printer output. 93 - 18241 Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.

40|$|AbstractA {{three-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} of the smoke movement in tunnel fires was established. Finite volume method was used to discretize the governing equations and the SIMPLE algorithm was employed to solve the governing equations. A scaling model (1 : 8) of the subway tunnel was built up based on similarity theory. Not only different positions of <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> the <b>train,</b> but also the different starting times of exhaust fan in the tunnel were considered. The disciplines of smoke temperature, smoke diffusion and wind velocity have then been compared under different the fire situations. The study is useful to analyze evacuating and controlling fire in emergent project of tunnel fire in a subway system...|$|R
25|$|Since grade-crossing {{accidents}} {{typically do}} {{not lead to}} fatalities <b>on</b> board the <b>train,</b> investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were particularly interested in determining why the fatalities occurred. They believed that fuel from the SUV may have combined with sparks from the dislodged third rail to cause a <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> board the <b>train.</b> They were interested in finding out how the SUV driver got into the position she did in the first place; the detour caused by the earlier road accident may also have played a role.|$|R
5|$|On October 15, 1976, an {{arsonist}} lit a <b>fire</b> <b>on</b> {{a subway}} <b>train</b> at Christie station. The fire destroyed four subway cars and some wall tiles, {{and resulted in}} {{a section of the}} subway being closed for a few days. On September 19, 2007, the station modernization program was started. This program would result in making the subway system more accessible, add new bus and streetcar platforms, and improve the connections to regional buses and GO trains.|$|R

While keeping watch <b>on</b> Cole's <b>train,</b> Elam confides to Cullen that Eva is carrying his baby. Lily and Joseph find Ruth at church and explain the situation.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the current pattern of land ownership for military {{training in the}} UK. The main component-armytraining areas-is considered in detail. Recent historical trends are reviewed {{in the context of}} changes in force size and weapons systems. Problems and benefits arising from the primary use of land for military training are defined. Relevant literature is reviewed. Comparisons are made with training systems in other countries, in particular the USA, the Netherlands,Switzerland, France and Australia. Recent developments in government policy are described and analysed. Possible future requirements are explored. This information is used to construct an argument that the current training system in the UK is outmoded and unsustainable. The authors contend {{that there is a need}} for a strategic review of military training, encompassing a thorough assessment of alternatives to traditional live <b>firing</b> <b>on</b> dedicated <b>training</b> areas. ...|$|R
