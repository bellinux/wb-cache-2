25|$|<b>Forkhead</b> box protein P2 (FOXP2) is {{a protein}} that, in humans, is encoded by the FOXP2 gene, {{also known as}} CAGH44, SPCH1 or TNRC10, and is {{required}} for proper development of speech and language. Initially identified as the genetic factor of speech disorder in KE family, its gene is the first gene discovered associated with speech and language.

500|$|The 5' {{region of}} the NEDD9 {{promoter}} is regulated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and contains a retinoic acid response element (RARE) that is specifically bound by a retinoid X receptor (RXR)/retinoic acid receptor (RAR) heterodimer. NEDD9 is also induced by the environmental pollutant dioxin, based on regulation through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). One study has found NEDD9 repressed by estrogen, based on binding of the SAFB1 co-repressor. NEDD9 is induced by Wnt signaling in colon cancer, based on binding to T-cell factor (TCF) factors in the promoter region. NEDD9 is induced by hypoxia and loss of VHL, based on binding of hypoxia-induced factor (HIF) transcription factors to the NEDD9 promoter. Prostaglandin E2 induces NEDD9 transcription. [...] The Fox transcription factor <b>Forkhead</b> box C1 (FoxC1) [...] and PAX5 transcription factor [...] {{have been reported to}} induce NEDD9 transcription. TGF-beta induces NEDD9 transcription. [...] Based on inspection of sequence, the NEDD9 promoter also has potential binding sites for a number of additional transcription factors, including STAT5A and NF-kappa B.|$|E
2500|$|... α-Parinaric acid is {{cytotoxic}} {{to human}} leukemia cells in cell culture at concentrations of 5 μM or less, by sensitizing the tumor cells to lipid peroxidation, the process where free radicals react with electrons from cell membrane lipids, resulting in cell damage. It is similarly cytotoxic to malignant gliomas grown in cell culture. Normal (non-tumorous) astrocytes grown in culture {{are far less}} sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of α-parinaric acid. This preferential toxicity towards tumor cells {{is due to a}} differential regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and <b>forkhead</b> transcription factors between malignant and normal cells.|$|E
