5|$|Williams' {{popularity}} {{is said to}} be unmatched in Canadian political history; his high approval ratings lasted right up until his retirement. Although Williams' premiership was considered quite controversial in Canada at large, except for <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> office, his own provincial approval ratings and those of his government have been consistently in the seventy to eighty percent range {{for the majority of the}} time he was in office. According to polling organisation Corporate Research Associates (CRA), Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country.|$|E

He sometimes has had anxiety attacks before games, struggled to sleep, and considered suicide. Owumi received an offer to play another season with El-Olympi. The contract, two times that from <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> Egypt, would have been the biggest contract of his career and would have made him the best-paid player to ever play in the Middle East. Initially accepting the deal, he later decided against it because he wanted to take a break from his basketball career. Instead, he began working at a community center in his hometown in Atlanta for seven months, making $9.25 per hour.|$|E
5|$|During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, {{if given}} the {{opportunity}}, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice. That opportunity came in <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> office when he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice, and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987. Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued. Bork's nomination was rejected 58–42. Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use. Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place. Along with his three Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to the United States courts of appeals, and 290 judges to the United States district courts.|$|E

Tony Mowbray took charge of the club in June 2009, and he was succeeded a year later by Neil Lennon.

Lennon went on to win three league titles in a row, then announced his departure from the club in May 2014 after four years in the role.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, {{the rival}} American League {{declared}} major league status {{and set about}} raiding National League rosters. Young left St. Louis and joined the American League's Boston Americans for a $3,500 contract ($ today). Young would remain with the Boston team until 1909. In <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> the American League, Young was dominant. Pitching to Criger, who had also jumped to Boston, Young {{led the league in}} wins, strikeouts, and ERA, thus earning the colloquial AL Triple Crown for pitchers. Young won almost 42% of his team's games in 1901, accounting for 33 of his team's 79 wins. In February 1902, {{before the start of the}} baseball season, Young served as a pitching coach at Harvard University.

5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> office, Clarke {{established}} {{good order}} in the colony. Unlike Osborn, who treated Colenso's presence at the trials in 1888 as an affront, Clarke took up Colenso's cause and recommended to the Colonial Office in London that Dinuzulu and his uncles be allowed to return from exile, having been sufficiently punished for his supposed offences. Clarke, persuaded by Colenso, argued that Dinuzulu would not cause further trouble {{so long as the}} policy of fomenting intertribal strife were discontinued and Dinuzulu be appointed induna. He began the process for the return of Dinuzulu and sought to harness the authority of the Zulu leader to the administration. In January 1895, the exiles received notice of their return to Zululand with an official position for Dinuzulu. Their departure was set for February 1895 but was delayed after Ministers in London recommended that Zululand first be annexed to Natal.|$|E
5|$|On January 1, 1994, Clinton {{signed the}} North American Free Trade Agreement into law. Throughout <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> office, Clinton {{consistently}} supported {{ratification of the}} treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton {{and most of his}} allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.|$|E
5|$|Under Morales, Bolivia {{experienced}} unprecedented economic strength, {{resulting in}} the increase in value of its currency, the boliviano. <b>His</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> office ended with no fiscal deficit; {{the first time this}} had happened in Bolivia for 30 years, while during the global financial crisis of 2007–08 it maintained some of the world's highest levels of economic growth. Such economic strength led to a nationwide boom in construction, and allowed the state to build up strong financial reserves. Although the levels of social spending were increased, they remained relatively conservative, with a major priority being placed on constructing paved roads, as well as community spaces such as soccer fields and union buildings. In particular, the government focused on rural infrastructure improvement, to bring roads, running water, and electricity to areas that lacked them.|$|E
