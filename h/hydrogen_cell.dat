2500|$|The Italian {{catalyst}} manufacturer Acta {{has proposed}} using hydrazine {{as an alternative}} to hydrogen in fuel cells. The chief benefit of using hydrazine is that it can produce over 200 mW/cm2 more than a similar <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cell</b> without the need to use expensive platinum catalysts. As the fuel is liquid at room temperature, it can be handled and stored more easily than hydrogen. By storing the hydrazine in a tank full of a double-bonded carbon-oxygen carbonyl, the fuel reacts and forms a safe solid called hydrazone. By then flushing the tank with warm water, the liquid hydrazine hydrate is released. Hydrazine [...] has a higher electromotive force of 1.56 V compared to 1.23 V for hydrogen. Hydrazine breaks down in the cell to form nitrogen and hydrogen which bonds with oxygen, releasing water. Hydrazine was used in fuel cells manufactured by Allis-Chalmers Corp., including some that provided electric power in space satellites in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|One way new {{processors}} {{can overcome}} {{the dangers of}} transporting hydrogen is to produce it as necessary. The microreactors can be joined to create a system that heats the hydrocarbon under high pressure to generate hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide, a process called steam reforming. This produces up to 160 gallons of hydrogen/minute and gives the potential of powering hydrogen refueling stations, or even an on-board hydrogen fuel source for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cell</b> vehicles.

Most of the world's supply of helium comes from natural gas {{fields in the}} United States, which had banned its export under the Helium Control Act (1927) {{in an effort to}} conserve helium for use in US Navy airships. Eckener expected this ban to be lifted, but to save helium the design was modified to have double gas cells (an inner <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cell</b> protected by an outer helium cell). [...] The ban remained however, so the engineers used only hydrogen despite its extreme flammability. [...] It held [...] of gas in 16 bags or cells with a useful lift of approximately 232 t.

40|$|The thermoneutral {{potential}} of a nickel cadmium or nickel <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cell</b> is the potential at which the cell charge or discharge process puts out zero heat, and thus is the potential corresponding to the enthalpy change of the charge/discharge reaction, delta H.

Particularly in the nickel <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cell,</b> the pressure of hydrogen can often vary over an order of magnitude or more {{during the course of a}} charge or discharge. In a nickel cadmium cell, although significant changes in oxygen pressure can occur during charge or discharge, since oxygen does not enter into the charge/discharge reaction, these pressure changes are related to the heat generated from oxygen evolution and recombination.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model of the}} nickel hydrogen battery cell has been utilized to describe the chemical and physical changes during charge and overcharge in a recirculating stack nickel <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cell.</b> In particular, the movement of gas and electrolyte have been examined {{as a function of}} the amount of electrolyte put into the cell stack during cell activation, and as a function of flooding in regions of the gas screen in this cell design. Additionally, a two-dimensional variation on this model has been utilized to describe the effects of non-uniform loading in the nickel-electrode on the movement of gas and electrolyte within the recirculating stack nickel <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cell.</b> The type of nonuniform loading that has been examined here is that associated with higher than average loading near the surface of the sintered nickel electrode, a condition present to some degree in many nickel electrodes made by electrochemical impregnation methods. The effects of high surface loading were examined primarily under conditions of overcharge, since the movement of gas and electrolyte in the overcharging condition was typically where the greatest effects of non-uniform loading were found. The results indicate that significant changes in the capillary forces between cell components occur as the percentage of free volume in the stack filled by electrolyte becomes very high. These changes create large gradients in gas-filled space and oxygen concentrations near the boundary between the separator and the hydrogen electrode when the electrolyte fill is much greater than about 95 percent of the stack free volume. At lower electrolyte fill levels, these gaseous and electrolyte gradients become less extreme, and shift through the separator towards the nickel electrode. Similarly, flooding of areas in the gas screen cause higher concentrations of oxygen gas to approach the platinum/hydrogen electrode that is opposite the back side of the nickel electrode. These results illustrate the need for appropriate pore size distributions, and the maintenance of both convective electrolyte and gas flow paths through the stack, if the recirculating stack nickel <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cell</b> design is to work properly...|$|E
