5|$|The ages of {{globular}} clusters place a bound {{on the age}} limit of the entire universe. This lower limit {{has been a significant}} constraint in cosmology. Historically, astronomers were faced with age estimates of {{globular clusters}} that appeared older than cosmological models would allow. However, better measurements of cosmological parameters through <b>deep</b> <b>sky</b> surveys and satellites such as the Hubble Space Telescope appear to have resolved this issue.|$|E
5|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>sky</b> {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Canis Minor {{contains}} only two stars {{brighter than the}} fourth magnitude, Procyon (Alpha Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 0.34, and Gomeisa (Beta Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 2.9. The constellation's dimmer stars were noted by Johann Bayer, who named eight stars including Alpha and Beta, and John Flamsteed, who numbered fourteen. Procyon is the seventh-brightest star in the night sky, {{as well as one}} of the closest. A yellow-white main sequence star, it has a white dwarf companion. Gomeisa is a blue-white main sequence star. Luyten's Star is a ninth-magnitude red dwarf and the Solar System's next closest stellar neighbour in the constellation after Procyon. The fourth-magnitude HD 66141, which has evolved into an orange giant towards the end of its life cycle, was discovered to have a planet in 2012. There are two faint <b>deep</b> <b>sky</b> objects within the constellation's borders. The 11 Canis-Minorids are a meteor shower that can be seen in early December.|$|E

25|$|Although not a large constellation, Scutum {{contains}} several open clusters, {{as well as}} a {{globular cluster}} and a planetary nebula.

25|$|Because of its {{position}} {{away from the}} galactic plane, the majority of deep-sky objects in Aquarius are galaxies, globular clusters, and planetary nebulae.

25|$|The {{telescope}}s amateur telescope makers build {{range from}} backyard variety to sophisticated instruments that make meaningful {{contributions to the}} field of astronomy. Instruments built by amateurs have been employed in planetary study, astrometry, photometry, comet and asteroid discovery to name just a few. Even the “hobbyist” end of the field can break down into several distinct categories such as: observing <b>deep</b> <b>sky</b> objects, observing the planets, solar observing, lunar observation, and astrophotography of all those classes of objects. Therefore, the design, size, and construction of the telescopes vary as well. Some amateur telescope makers build instruments that, while looking crude, are wholly suited to the purpose they are designed for. Others may strive for a more aesthetic look with high levels of mechanical “finish”. Since some amateur telescope makers {{do not have access to}} high-precision machining equipment, many elegant designs such as the Poncet Platform, Crayford focuser, and the Dobsonian telescope have evolved, which achieve functionality and stability without requiring precision machining.|$|E
500|$|Lynx's {{most notable}} <b>deep</b> <b>sky</b> object is NGC 2419, {{also called the}} [...] "Intergalactic Wanderer" [...] as it was assumed to lie outside the Milky Way. At a {{distance}} of between 275,000 and 300,000 light-years from Earth, {{it is one of}} the most distant known globular clusters within our galaxy. NGC 2419 is likely in a highly elliptical orbit around the Milky Way. It has a magnitude of 10.3 and is a Shapley class II cluster; this classification indicates that it is extremely concentrated at its center. Originally thought to be a star, NGC 2419 was discovered to be a globular cluster by American astronomer Carl Lampland.|$|E
500|$|The land {{developed}} for the permanent capitol buildings was Salem block 84, sold to the state for this purpose by pioneer and Salem founder W. H. Willson. Construction of the first capitol building began in 1854, shortly after Congress confirmed Salem as the capital city. However, with the capital moving to Corvallis the next year, construction was temporarily halted. After the capital's return to Salem, the building was nearly completed by late 1855. This territorial capitol, of Greek Revival-style, stood [...] wide and [...] long (15 by 23 m), with a stone facade and a 10-foot (3 m) portico. Built of native ashlar blocks, the exterior walls, two stories high, ranged in color from a <b>deep</b> <b>sky</b> blue to white. [...] The first floor was [...] tall and the second [...] tall with an eight-foot (2.4 m) entablature. The building was decorated with four Ionic columns on the front (west) end. The building housed a variety of rooms, including a federal courthouse with a chamber measuring 20 by 27 feet (6 by 8 m) and an executive office of 18 by 20ft (5.5 by 6 m) {{on the first floor}}. Also on the first floor was the House chamber, measuring 36 by 46 feet (11 by 14 m) and having three entrances. The first floor also held the main hall, which included an entrance [...] wide. On the second floor was the Senate chamber, 26 by 36 feet (8 by 11 m). Additionally, the Territorial Library was housed in a room that was 20 by 36 feet (6 by 11 m). The second story also had a gallery viewing area for the House, three committee rooms, and several rooms for government clerks. The capitol was designed by Captain Charles Bennet, who participated in the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in 1848, and construction supervised by William H. Richter at a total cost of $25,000.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 March 2013, the European-led {{research}} team behind the Planck cosmology probe released the mission's all-sky map ( [...] , [...] ) {{of the cosmic}} microwave background. The map suggests the universe is slightly older than researchers thought. According to the map, subtle fluctuations in temperature were imprinted on the <b>deep</b> <b>sky</b> when the cosmos was about 370,000 years old. The imprint reflects ripples that arose as early, as {{the existence of the}} universe, as the first nonillionth of a second. Apparently, these ripples gave rise to the present vast cosmic web of galaxy clusters and dark matter. Based on the 2013 data, the universe contains 4.9% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter and 68.3% dark energy. On 5 February 2015, new data was released by the Planck mission, according to which {{the age of the universe}} is 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years old and the Hubble constant was measured to be 67.74 ± 0.46 (km/s)/Mpc.|$|E
