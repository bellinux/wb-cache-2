40|$|Since 2007, {{several studies}} have been {{conducted}} by international and national role players to establish whether the recent efforts to improve <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> have been successful. The respondents to the surveys used as part of these studies have indicated that more concise and less complex <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> would be more understandable to users of <b>financial</b> <b>reports.</b> In view of the call for shorter and simpler <b>financial</b> <b>reports,</b> the fact that the understandability of <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> appears to be a problem, as well as the fact that a limited amount of research on the understandability of <b>interim</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> has been done thus far, it was decided to investigate whether individual shareholders understand the context and content of <b>interim</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> which, per se, are supposed to be more concise and less complex <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> presented by companies. The study entailed using a postal questionnaire in a survey of a sample of individual shareholders of three large South African listed retail companies to determine whether individual shareholders understand the context and content of <b>interim</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reports,</b> and whether they use these reports, among other sources, to make investment decisions. The study is based loosely on the high profile studies of Lee and Tweedie in respect of individual shareholders performed in the late 1970 s. The primary research objective of the current study was to determine whether individual shareholders of South African listed retail companies understand the context and content of <b>interim</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reports.</b> It was found that understanding of these reports was generally limited. However, there is evidence that experience and training in the field of financial accounting improve shareholders’ understanding of the content of <b>interim</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reports.</b> Apart from questions on the demographics and investment objectives of individual shareholders, a number of other questions were also included in the questionnaire to address several secondary research objectives. The questions relating to the secondary research objectives were designed to gather information, inter alia, on how individual shareholders make investment decisions, sources of information used by individual shareholders when making investment decisions, additional information that should be included in <b>interim</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reports,</b> as well as the medium of communication through which individual shareholders would prefer to receive <b>interim</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reports.</b> The study has shown, amongst other things, that the majority of respondents to this study initiated their own investment decisions, that articles in the financial press are the most popular source of information when making investment decisions, and that individual shareholders still prefer to receive interim reports by post.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{employed for}} the communication of accounting {{information that is}} necessary for users in their economic decision-making process consist of the financial statements of an entity. All legal entities, no matter the domain of their activity, have the obligation to draw up annual financial statements for every completed financial year. For certain categories of entities, reporting obligations are also required for periods other than the annual reporting, throughout the financial year. It {{is the case of}} <b>interim</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> At the level of the international accounting framework, the aspects related to <b>interim</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> are the subject of a separate standard, namely, IAS 34 <b>Interim</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Reporting.</b> In Romania, the current system of accounting regulations concerning the annual financial statements comprises accounting regulations that comply with the European directives and which apply to the various categories of entities, on the one hand and, on the other, accounting regulations in line with the IFRS, which are applicable to other classes of entities from certain activity sectors. The accounting regulations that apply to each category refer to, among other things, the contents and the format of financial statements that have to be presented.

40|$|Event {{studies on}} {{quarterly}} (<b>interim)</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> have {{found evidence that}} contradicts the semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis. Normative studies and regulatory body statements on interim reporting have emphasized the predictive function; estimating annual earnings, making forward projections and identifying turning points. With the growth in sophistication of financial markets many investors have abrogated their investment analysis to surrogates, investment sophisticates such as analysts and brokers. There is compelling evidence that sophisticates estimate annual earnings {{on the basis of}} interim disclosures and that individual investors, receiving investment advisory services, bring the results of professional analysis to bear on the investment decisions. ^ This study surveyed New Zealand sophisticates to identify the interim accounting stimuli which sophisticates used in their investment analysis. ^ This study was designed to make a significant contribution to a theory for interim reporting which will make subsequent event studies more meaningful. ^ New Zealand sophisticates manifest an awareness of the predictive function of <b>interim</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reports.</b> The respondents preferred more timely, credible and frequent interim reports prepared on a basis consistent with annual reports and with disclosure of seasonal factors. These preferences should be accorded the urgency they deserve if accounting information is to continue to be considered reliable by investors. The anachronism is that the glossy annual reports, having little significant information content, continue to draw the attention of standard setting bodies while the <b>financial</b> <b>report</b> replete with information of value [...] the interim [...] generally escapes the attention of standard setting bodies. This is alarming because analysts and brokers use interim data to re-cast projected annual earnings and perhaps this interim data has not been prepared on a consistent and comparable basis between periods and between firms. ^ The accounting profession has a duty, perhaps a fiduciary responsibility, to ensure interim reports are reliable, as the impact of investors making investment decisions based upon projections of earnings which in turn were calculated using possibly unreliable interim reports is extremely serious. ...|$|R

40|$|Mandating interim {{reporting}} is lively discussed in Europe, {{especially since the}} European Union has set up mandatory quarterly reporting on the agenda. By examining the Swiss stock market, in which interim reporting became mandatory in 1997, we find that tightening disclosure frequency by mandating <b>interim</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> has a very limited and thus not convincing impact on information asymmetry. We suspect that firms that did not provide interim reports {{on a voluntary basis}} prior to the new rules potentially anticipated the insignificance of a greater information environment in their specific situation and thus reasonably chose not to publish costly interim reports. Further analysis supports this hypothesis and documents that firms affected by the new rules did not experience an enhancement in their information environment simply because they have already been characterized by lower information asymmetry before the regulation became effective. They thus obviously chose other disclosure channels possibly more appropriate in their specific situation in order to decrease information asymmetry. The question whether firms should really be obliged to provide <b>financial</b> <b>interim</b> <b>reports</b> must therefore be further challenged by asking for the objectives of the regulation.
