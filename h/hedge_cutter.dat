2500|$|The {{invention}} of a hedge-breaching device is generally credited to Curtis G. Culin, a sergeant in the 2nd Armored Division's 102nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron. However, military historian Max Hastings notes that Culin {{was inspired by}} [...] "a Tennessee hillbilly named Roberts", who during a discussion about how to overcome the bocage, said [...] "Why don't we get some saw teeth {{and put them on}} the front of the tank and cut through these hedges?" [...] Rather than joining in the laughter that greeted this remark, Culin recognized the idea's potential. A prototype tusk-like assembly was created by welding steel scrap (from destroyed [...] "Czech hedgehogs") to the front of a tank to create a <b>hedge</b> <b>cutter.</b> The teeth helped prevent the vulnerable underside of the tank from being exposed while it knocked a hole in the hedgerow wall. On 14 July, Lieutenant General Omar Bradley inspected the tank and [...] "watched in awe as a hedgerow exploded... to make way for the Sherman bursting through". According to Hastings, Culin, [...] "an honest man", attempted to give credit to Roberts, but this was forgotten in the publicity surrounding the invention. Hastings concludes: [...] " [...] became a very American kind of national hero".|$|E
5000|$|The GX25 is {{used for}} commercially {{produced}} mini-tillers, water pumps, <b>hedge</b> <b>cutters,</b> strimmers. A stripped down version of the engine has also been used by hobbyists in model aircraft ...|$|R
50|$|Flail mowers {{may also}} {{be used in a}} more or less upright {{position}} for trimming the sides of hedges. They are often called <b>hedge</b> <b>cutters</b> (or sometimes also hedge trimmers) then. Especially in forestry (agroforestry) some very robust variants of flail mowers - called flail mulchers, flail shredders, or flail choppers - are used.|$|R
50|$|In 1932, Beesly joined Guest Keen and Nettlefolds, a {{firm with}} which he had strong family {{connections}} on his mother's side. During World War II he served with the Ministry of Supply. In 1945 he bought a controlling interest in a light engineering firm which produced mechanical <b>hedge</b> <b>cutters</b> and mobile forestry saws. He lived at Ashford Hall, Shropshire where he had a farm. He met his death there when he was attacked and killed instantly by a bull.|$|R
50|$|Such large hedge {{trimmers}} {{are often}} confused with tractor-mounted reach flail mowers (booms with flail mower attachments), which appear similar {{due to the}} use of booms. And in colloquial language both, tractor-mounted hedge trimmers and reach flail mowers, are imprecisely called <b>hedge</b> <b>cutters,</b> or brush cutters. In contrast to tractor-mounted hedge trimmers, reach flail mowers have a different cutting mechanism, and are not only used for trimming hedges, but also in several other fields of application (mowing taller grass, road verge cutting, ditch maintenance, etc.).|$|R
50|$|Aria and Emily find a {{room with}} an open window and prepare {{to leave the house}} and get help. As they hear Alison’s screams, the girls retreat and the window’s jagged glass shuts behind them. Meanwhile, Spencer walks into a {{greenhouse}} where she discovers the masked man waiting for her. They wrestle before Spencer picks up <b>hedge</b> <b>cutters.</b> She slices the man’s hand and knocks him out. She reaches for his mask, but he awakens and grabs her. She breaks free before hitting her head against a wooden ledge. He picks up the hedge cuts ad stands over her.|$|R
50|$|On 15 July, the {{battalion}} relieved the 745th Tank Battalion {{in the vicinity}} of Sallen, France and their assault gun platoon fired the unit’s first combat mission supporting the division’s artillery. Over the next several days {{the battalion}} trained for action in the French bocage and fitted <b>hedge</b> <b>cutters</b> to their tanks. With the start of Operation Cobra, the battalion went on the offensive on 26 July, with Company A attacking Vidouville in support of the 2nd Infantry Regiment and losing seven tanks to enemy action, to a combination of mines and anti-tank gun fire. The tankers and the infantry they were supporting battled through the end of July {{to break out of the}} bocage against dogged German defense by the crack 9th and 15th Parachute Regiments. However, by the beginning of August 1944, the German resistance began to crumble, and the 735th began to race south with Companies D and B assisting the 10th Infantry Regiment in taking Angers on 11 August.|$|R
