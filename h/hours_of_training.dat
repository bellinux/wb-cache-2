On 1 May, he embarked for Europe to join the New Zealand Division. However, during transit his transport ship was unexpectedly diverted to Egypt. For two months, his contingent was based at the training camp of the Australian Imperial Force at Tel-el-Kebir but had {{very little to do with}} only a few <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> each day. The 12th Reinforcement left in July for Sling Camp in England, where it underwent more intense training.|$|E
5|$|Between {{this action}} and February 19, 1945, Davis flew another 47 missions, most escorting bombers or ships, in {{addition}} to a few ground-attack missions, but saw little or no aerial combat in that time. On February 19, he was withdrawn from the front to begin certification on the P-51 Mustang, logging 45 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> time on the aircraft through the end of March. He returned to combat duty only briefly in April, flying in three combat missions as a copilot aboard a B-25 Mitchell bomber. On May 3, 1945, he was reassigned to Goodfellow Field at San Angelo, Texas, helping to train new pilots and serving as an operations officer for the base {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the increasingly diverse population, several states (WA, CA, CT, NJ, NM) have passed legislation requiring or strongly recommending cultural competency training for physicians. In 2005, New Jersey legislature enacted a law requiring all physicians to complete at least 6 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> in cultural competency {{as a condition for}} renewal of their New Jersey medical license, whether or not they actively practice in New Jersey. Physicians' responses to this CME requirement varied, both positively and negatively. But the overall feedback was positive towards the outcomes of participation in and satisfaction with the programs.|$|E
25|$|While the {{evolution}} of paramedicine described above is focused largely on the US, many other countries followed a similar pattern, although often with significant variations. Canada, for example, attempted a pilot paramedic training program at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, in 1972. The program, which intended to upgrade the then mandatory 160 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> for ambulance attendants, {{was found to be}} too costly and premature. The program was abandoned after two years, and {{it was more than a}} decade before the legislative authority for its graduates to practice was put into place. An alternative program which provided 1,400 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> at the community college level prior to commencing employment was then tried, and made mandatory in 1977, with formal certification examinations being introduced in 1978. Similar programs occurred at roughly the same time in Alberta and British Columbia, with other Canadian provinces gradually following, but with their own education and certification requirements. Advanced Care Paramedics were not introduced until 1984, when Toronto trained its first group internally, before the process spread across the country. By 2010 the Ontario system involved a two-year community college based program, including both hospital and field clinical components, prior to designation as a Primary Care Paramedic, although it is starting to head towards a university degree-based program (for example, the joint degree in paramedicine offered by Centennial College and the University of Toronto). Some services, such as Toronto Paramedic Services, continue to train advanced care paramedics internally.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the minimum}} {{standards}} for paramedic training is considered vocational, but most 2 year colleges offer a paramedic associate degree option. Paramedic education programs typically follow the U.S. NHTSA EMS Curriculum. While many regionally accredited community colleges offer paramedic programs and 2 year associate degrees, {{a handful of}} universities also offer a 4-year bachelor's degree component. The national standard course minimum requires didactic and clinical hours for a paramedic program of 1,300 or more <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> to be accrediated and nationally recognized. Calendar length typically vary from 12 months to upwards of two years, excluding degree options, EMT training, work experience, and prerequisites. It is required to be a certified Emergency Medical Technician prior to starting paramedic training. Entry requirements vary from program to program, but many paramedic programs also have prerequisites such as one year required work experience on an ambulance, or anatomy and physiology courses from an accredited college or university.|$|E

He graduated from aviation training at Brooks Field near San Antonio, Texas on April 25, 1941, reaching the rank of second lieutenant and was assigned to class 41C.

500|$|On April 16, 2012, Microsoft {{announced}} that Windows on ARM would be officially branded as Windows RT.

Steven Sinofsky stated that Microsoft would ensure the differences between Windows RT and 8 were adequately addressed in advertising. However, reports found that promotional web pages for the Microsoft Surface tablet had contained confusing wording alluding to the compatibility differences, and that Microsoft Store representatives were providing inconsistent and sometimes incorrect information about Windows RT. In response, Microsoft stated that Microsoft Store staff members would be given an average of 15 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> prior to the launch of Windows 8 and Windows RT to ensure consumers are able to make the correct choice for their needs. The first Windows RT devices were officially released alongside Windows 8 on October 26, 2012.|$|E
