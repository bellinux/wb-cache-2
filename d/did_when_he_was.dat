25|$|Kelly {{tendered}} {{drawings of}} plants and flowers from the late 1940s on. Ailanthus (1948) is the first plant drawing that he executed in Boston, Hyacinth (1949) {{was the first one}} he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in Paris. Beginning in 1949, while living in Paris (and influenced in this choice of subject by Henri Matisse and Jean Arp) he began to draw simple plant and seaweed forms. The plant studies are, for the most part, contour drawings of leaves, stems and flowers done in clean strokes of pencil or pen and centered on the page.|$|E
25|$|When Camille {{was twelve}} his father {{sent him to}} {{boarding}} school in France. He studied at the Savary Academy in Passy near Paris. While a young student, he developed an early appreciation of the French art masters. Monsieur Savary himself gave him a strong grounding in drawing and painting and suggested he draw from nature {{when he returned to}} St. Thomas, which he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> seventeen. However, his father preferred he work in his business, giving him a job working as a cargo clerk. He took every opportunity during those next five years at the job to practise drawing during breaks and after work.|$|E
25|$|Since Macpherson {{had long}} {{served as the}} coach for the Bryan brothers, it was {{inevitable}} that the twins would want to follow him just as they <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> hired as the Aviators' head coach in 2014. Consequently, prior to the WTT draft on March 16, 2015, the Aviators traded Bob and Mike Bryan to the Dream for financial consideration. The Aviators did not protect 2014 WTT Female Most Valuable Player Daniela Hantuchová in the marquee portion of the draft. Madison Keys was assigned to the Aviators as a league-designated player, and they selected her as their only marquee draft pick. In the roster portion of the draft, the Aviators protected Raven Klaasen and Květa Peschke. They did not protect 2014 WTT Male Rookie of the Year Somdev Devvarman. The Aviators selected amateur Taylor Fritz and Chanelle Scheepers in the roster portion of the draft. Fritz was the only amateur player selected in the 2015 WTT Draft.|$|E

500|$|In August 1974, Jenner persuaded Barrett {{to return}} to Abbey Road Studios in hope of {{recording}} another album. According to John Leckie, who engineered these sessions, even at this point Syd still [...] "looked like he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> younger..long haired". The sessions lasted three days and consisted of blues rhythm tracks with tentative and disjointed guitar overdubs. Barrett recorded 11 tracks, {{the only one of}} which to be titled was [...] "If You Go, Don't Be Slow". Once again, Barrett withdrew from the music industry, but this time for good. He sold the rights to his solo albums back to the record label and moved into a London hotel. During this period, several attempts to employ him as a record producer (including one by Jamie Reid on behalf of the Sex Pistols, and another by The Damned, who wanted him to produce their second album) were all fruitless.|$|E
500|$|Bottomley's obituaries dwelt on {{the common}} theme of wasted talent: a man of {{brilliant}} natural abilities, destroyed by [...] greed and vanity. [...] "He had personal magnetism, eloquence, {{and the power to}} convince", wrote his Daily Mail obituarist. [...] "He might have been a leader at the Bar, a captain of industry, a great journalist. He might have been almost anything". The Straits Times of Singapore thought that Bottomley could have rivalled Lloyd George as a national leader: [...] "Though he deserved his fate, the news of his passing will awaken the many regrets for the good which he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Bottomley the reformer and crusader and the champion of the bottom dog". A later historian, Maurice Cowling, pays tribute to Bottomley's capacity and industry, and to his forceful campaigns in support of liberty. In his sketch for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Morris delivers a different judgement: [...] "e claimed to serve the interests of others, but sought only his own gratification".|$|E
500|$|Boston re-signed Stivetts for $2,100despite {{the view}} of some in the press who {{believed}} Boston would continue to sink in the standings if they didn't rid themselves of him and the team's manager. Shortly after Stivetts' first start of the season, a 10–5loss on April23 in Baltimore, Selee commented that Stivetts will not be pitching much into the future, saying that [...] "he is growing rather stiff, and will not let himself out as he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at his best, some years ago." [...] His weight was now at 217lbs, so as the team departed on May10 for a western road trip, Selee sent him back to Ashland {{to get back into}} proper game condition. Although he was told not to report back to the team until his weight was below 200lbs, he had re-joined the team and played right field in the second game of a doubleheader on May15. His place in the rotation fell behind Nichols, Fred Klobedanz, and Ted Lewis. He made a relief appearance on May18, before having to take some time off for a sore arm. His next start occurred on May31, when Boston defeated St. Louis by a 25–5score. He earned his second consecutive victory on June11, a 12–4win over Louisville.|$|E

500|$|Boyce {{clashed with}} James E. West, the BSA's Chief Scout Executive, over {{a program for}} boys who lived too far from town to join a troop. Boyce offered to publish a {{magazine}} for the BSA, {{as long as it}} was published in Chicago. The National Executive Board of the BSA turned this offer down and shortly thereafter Boyce ceased being active in administrative activities of the BSA, though he remained a staunch supporter of the program. As a result of this and his desire to serve boys who had limited opportunities as he himself <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> young, Boyce started a new Scouting-related venture: the Lone Scouts of America (LSA) on January 9, 1915. Reliance on Native American themes gave LSA a distinct Native American flavor: Lone Scouts could form small groups known as [...] "tribes", the tribe's treasurer was known as the [...] "wampum-bearer", and LSA taught boys to respect the environment. Boyce's annual contribution to the LSA grew to $100,000. In both the BSA and the LSA, Boyce was a manager and had little direct contact with the Boy Scouts. Upon his return from reporting on World War I, Boyce immediately began expanding the LSA by starting Lone Scout magazine and hiring Frank Allan Morgan, a noted Chicago Scoutmaster, to lead the LSA. By November 1915, the LSA had over 30,000 members. Warren conferred upon Boyce the title Chief Totem. Youths could join the LSA simply by mailing in some coupons and five cents. By 1916, the BSA and the LSA were in direct competition for members. In the summer of 1917, during his annual Dakota hunt, the Gros Ventres Indian tribe made Boyce an honorary chief with the name [...] "Big Cloud" [...] during a three-day ceremony. With America at war, Boyce agreed to the creation of a Lone Scout uniform in late 1917. Though he had a uniform made for himself, he stipulated that no Lone Scout was required to purchase one.|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff's death {{shocked the}} {{football}} world. Within {{a week after}} his death, there were numerous individuals (including players and managers) and organizations (including clubs) paying tribute to him, especially via social media. Thousands of Barcelona fans passed through the memorial to Cruyff, opened inside the Camp Nou stadium, to pay tribute. Cruyff's greatness was even respected by his rivals. Former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell, {{who did not have}} a good relationship with Cruyff, was among the early visitors to the memorial. Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez led a Real Madrid delegation to the memorial, including former players Emilio Butragueno and Amancio Amaro. Former Real Madrid president Ramón Calderón said of Cruyff: “He {{can be seen as a}} revolutionary, a dreamer, a visionary, and an innovator who changed the idea of a game in which strength was the primary consideration to another one based, and focused, on ability and technique, giving birth to what has been called “tiki-taka.” He used to say that football should be played with the brain... I met him a few times after he left football, always playing golf, a sport he loved. He would always talk about football in the same way he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> playing and coaching—with plenty of passion and excitement. A legend has gone but he has left an important legacy.” ...|$|E
2500|$|You scold {{me so much}} in {{the nice}} long letter which I have this moment {{received}} from you, that I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together. I can expose myself however, only once more, because he leaves the country soon after next Friday, on which day we are to have a dance at Ashe after all. He is a very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man, I assure you. But as to our having ever met, except at the three last balls, I cannot say much; for he is so excessively laughed at about me at Ashe, that he is ashamed of coming to Steventon, and ran away when we called on Mrs. Lefroy a few days ago.[...] [...]After I had written the above, we received a visit from Mr. Tom Lefroy and his cousin George. The latter is really very well-behaved now; and as for the other, he has but one fault, which time will, I trust, entirely remove — it is that his morning coat is a great deal too light. He is a very great admirer of Tom Jones, and therefore wears the same coloured clothes, I imagine, which he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> wounded.|$|E
