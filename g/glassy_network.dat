The influence of water: TEOS mole ratio, metal ion concentration, and the reaction temperature has been investigated. The overall activation energy for gel formation has been determined from the temperature dependence of the time of gelation for each system. The activation energy for -Si-O-Si- network formation is found to be 54. 5 kJ/mol. The gel formation time as well as the activation energy sharply increase in the presence of Cu(2 +), Al(3 +), La(3 +) and Y(3 +). In contrast, the presence of Li(+), Na(+), Mg(2 +), Ca(2 +), or, Sr(2 +) lowers the gelation time, but has no appreciable effect on the activation energy.

Two sets of AsxSe 1 -x samples aged for 8 years were compared, set A consisted of slow cooled samples aged in the dark, and set B consisted of melt quenched samples aged at laboratory environment. Samples of set B in the As concentration range, 35 % < x < 60 %, display a pre-Tg exotherm, but the feature is not observed in samples of set A. The aging behavior of set A presumably represents intrinsic aging in these glasses, while that of set B is extrinsic due to presence of light. The reversibility window persists in both sets of samples but is less well defined in set B. These findings contrast with a recent study by Golovchak et al., which finds the onset of the reversibility window moved up to the stoichiometric composition (x = 40 %). Here we show that the upshifted window is better understood as resulting due to demixing of As 4 Se 4 and As 4 Se 3 molecules from the backbone, i. e., Nanoscale phase separation (NSPS). We attribute sub-Tg endotherms to compaction of the flexible part of networks upon long term aging, while the pre-Tg exotherm to NSPS. Finally, the narrowing and sharpening of the reversibility window upon aging is interpreted as the slow 'self-organizing' stress relaxation of the phases just outside the Intermediate phase.

40|$|It is {{a common}} goal in {{biophysics}} to understand protein structural properties {{and their relationship to}} protein function. I investigated protein structural properties using three coarse graining methods: a rigidity analysis method First, a geometric simulation method Froda and normal mode analysis as implemented in Elnemo to identify the protein directions of motion. Furthermore, I also compared the results between the coarse graining methods with the results from molecular dynamics and from experiments that I carried out. The results from the rigidity analysis across a set of protein families presented in chapter 3 highlighted two different patterns of protein rigidity loss, i. e. "sudden" and "gradual". It was found that theses characteristic patterns were in line with the rigidity distribution of <b>glassy</b> <b>networks.</b> The simulations of protein motion by merging flexibility, rigidity and normal mode analyses presented in chapter 4 were able to identify large conformational changes of proteins using minimal computational resources. I investigated the use of RMSD as a measure to characterise protein motion and showed that, despite it is a good measure to identify structural differences when comparing the same protein, the use of extensive RMSD better captures the extend of motion of a protein structure. The in-depth investigation of yeast PDI mobility presented in chapter 5 confirmed former experimental results that predicted a large conformational change for this enzyme. Furthermore, the results predicted: a characteristic rigidity distribution for yeast PDI, a minimum and a maximum active site distance and a relationship between the energy cutoff, i. e. the number of hydrogen bonds part of the network of bonds, and protein mobility. The results obtained were tested against molecular dynamics simulations in chapter 6. The MD simulation also showed a large conformational change for yeast PDI but with a slightly different minimum and maximum inter-cysteine distance. Furthermore, MD was able to reveal new data, i. e. the most likely inter-cysteine distance. In order to test the accuracy of the coarse graining and MD simulations I carried out cross-linking experiments to test the minimum inter-cysteine distance predictions. The results presented in chapter 7 show that human PDI minimum distance is below 12 Å whereas the yeast PDI minimum distance must be above 12 Å as no cross-linking structures where found with the available (12 Å long) cross-linkers.
