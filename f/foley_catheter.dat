A <b>Foley</b> <b>catheter</b> was inserted and the urethra was sutured onto the catheter, about 5cm distally from its passage through the skin. No skin suture {{was used in the}} urethral meatus, and some kind of scar contraction was always foreseen. Two sutures were bilaterally passed through the perianal skin and the levator ani muscles and served to tightly and firmly support an obstetric stent, placed in the neovagina to provide support for the inverted skin flap. A drain was left in the posterior commissure and, finally, excess scrotal skin was resected to obtain a good appearance of the major labia.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{departments}} in the military benefit from the added support of enlisted personnel {{who are capable of}} performing a wide variety of tasks they have been trained for through specialized military schooling. For example, in United States Military Hospitals, Air Force Aerospace Medical Technicians and Navy Hospital Corpsmen perform tasks that fall under the scope of practice of both doctors (i.e. sutures, staples and incision and drainages) and nurses (i.e. medication administration, <b>foley</b> <b>catheter</b> insertion, and obtaining intravenous access) and also perform splinting of injured extremities, nasogastric tube insertion, intubation, wound cauterizing, eye irrigation, and much more. Often, some civilian education and/or certification will be required such as an EMT certification, in case of the need to provide care outside the base where the member is stationed. The presence of highly trained enlisted personnel in an Emergency Departments drastically reduces the workload on nurses and doctors.|$|E

Other methods of inducing labour include stripping of the amniotic membrane, artificial rupturing of the amniotic sac (called amniotomy), or nipple stimulation.

A randomized clinical trial was carried out at Dhaka Medical College Hospital during the period from March 2002 to November 2002. Ninety patients, who were chosen for induction, were selected for this study, 45 patients were randomly selected for <b>Foley’s</b> <b>catheter</b> group and 45 patients for misoprostol group by using lottery. The baseline characteristics like age, parity, socioeconomic condition, gestational age; Bishop’s score and indication of induction of labor were almost same in both groups. Mean duration of onset of labour was 13. 60 ± 5. 0 and 15. 26 ± 3. 58 hours, induction-full dilatation was 18. 83 ± 2. 94 and 20. 03 ± 2. 46 hours and induction-delivery interval was 20. 04 ± 2. 82 and 21. 18 ± 2. 32 hours in the misoprostol and <b>Foley’s</b> <b>catheter</b> groups respectively. The differences were not significant. Mode of delivery and fetal outcome were also same in both group. Complications like vomiting and hyperstimulation appeared in few cases in misoprostol group but not significant. From this study, {{it was found that the}} safety and efficacy of <b>Foley’s</b> <b>catheter</b> is comparable to misoprostol. In addition, <b>Foley’s</b> <b>catheter</b> is free from some side effects of misoprostol, like vomiting and hyperstimulation.

30|$|In our routine practice, {{we follow}} several basic steps that {{may differ from}} other {{surgeons}} who perform hypospadias repair. First, we only use TIP urethroplasty in distal hypospadias repair. We use 3 / 0 or 4 / 0 polyglactin sutures in adults and 4 / 0 or 5 / 0 polyglactin sutures in children. We prefer 8 or 10 F latex <b>Foley</b> <b>catheters</b> in children and 14  F latex <b>Foley</b> <b>catheters</b> in adults. We remove the catheter {{two or three days}} postoperatively, because we believe that early catheter removal reduces cuff formation (Polat et al. 2015).|$|R
30|$|<b>Foley’s</b> <b>catheters</b> or intrauterine {{balloons}} were {{suggested as}} another mechanical method that could prevent the immediate reformation of adhesions during the postoperative period. Patients {{may need to}} be hospitalised {{for a couple of days}} [42, 43] or to preserve the catheter for longer periods as outpatients [44]. The removal of the catheter can be done safely in the gynaecological outpatient clinic. In case of long-term use of an intrauterine catheter in situ, patients need to take long-term antibiotic therapy with possible side effects (gastrointestinal, bacterial resistance). Recently, it was advocated that the use of a <b>Foley’s</b> <b>catheter</b> in comparison with IUCD may have better results concerning postoperative menstrual pattern [44].|$|R
50|$|Fistula {{cases can}} also be treated through {{urethral}} catheterization if identified early enough.

40|$|Background: <b>Foley’s</b> <b>catheter</b> {{indwelling}} gives temporary {{relief for}} lower urinary tract obstruction, especially {{in case of}} severely symptomatizing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Several complications of long-term or frequent catheter indwelling {{have been reported in}} catheter dependent patients, specifically to those who are unfit for operative intervention. Objectives: Our aim was to find a safe, non-invasive relief from symptom severity, as well as, incapacitating complications of <b>Foley’s</b> <b>catheter</b> in catheter-dependent patients. Methods: A total of 107 catheter-dependent men, or who had frequent <b>Foley’s</b> <b>catheter</b> indwelling in case of BPH, participated in the present study. Preliminary estimation of the post-micturition residual urine was obtained. Ultrasound elastography was used to assess the transurethral balloon pressure of the double balloon silicon-coated catheter, adjudicated by ureteromat, and maintained in situ for 6  days in all patients. Basic follow up once-a-month has been performed up to 6  months. Results: Effectual urethral patency was noted in 89. 7 % patients {{at the end of the}} third month. The procedure was repeated for 11 patients shortly after 3  months, for 7 patients after 4  months and for 28 patients after 5  months, with no reported prostatic urethral injury. No stricture recurrence was noted in 61 patients up to 6  months. Conclusions: Preliminary results indicate that prostatic urethral balloon dilation in BPH catheter-dependent patients is inexpensive, safe, and would be a potentially effective option in maintaining the prostatic urethral patency. Elastographic justification of the transurethral balloon has proved to be helpful...|$|R
