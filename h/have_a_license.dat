5|$|The game {{began as}} the private {{development}} of Seow Zong Hui who presented an early build to Christian Svensson, Capcom's Senior VP of consumer software, at EVO 2012. Svensson showed the build to several staff {{members in the}} Capcom office (including senior community manager Brett Elston), and Capcom later decided {{to assist in the}} development of the game. While Zong Hui continued to develop the game based on his original design, Capcom took over tasks such as funding, marketing, and quality assurance. Capcom decided to distribute the game on PC instead of gaming consoles because Zong Hui did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>license</b> for console development. Svensson has noted that Capcom will consider console releases in the future, but chose to initially distribute the game on PC to keep the game free for fans and meet its December 17 target release date.|$|E

According to court documents the AP did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>license</b> to publish, display or relicense the photographs. The case was settled in November 2006.|$|E

When the group visits a police station, he upgrades to a Benelli M4 Super 90 combat shotgun.

25|$|The Department of Natural Resources issued new {{regulations}} in March 2009, for daily bushel limits for mature female hard crabs and periods of closure for harvest of mature female hard crabs. Mature female hard crab bushel limits were assigned based on license type. The regulation further provided the DNR {{with the authority}} to establish and modify a season or catch limit by public notice based on continuous monitoring of stock conditions and harvest rates.

25|$|Although he {{went through}} a {{difficult}} five-year period (according to an interview with TV Guide {{before his death in}} 1984), Barry moved to Los Angeles, eventually finding work on local television. He would later admit in an article in TV Guide that, in order to determine if he still had a bad reputation (because of the requirement to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>license</b> with the FCC), he raised money to buy a Redondo Beach radio station. Barry returned to hosting with The Generation Gap in 1969 and had success with The Joker's Wild, which premiered in 1972. Barry and Enright resumed their partnership full-time in 1976. Their production of game shows, notably the syndicated Tic-Tac-Dough (which Barry did not host) and Joker (which he did) in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in millions of dollars in revenue and, more importantly for both, forgiveness from the public for their involvement in the scandals.|$|E
25|$|At the {{break-out}} of World War II in Norway on 9 April 1940, all the company's buses {{were taken}} over by the armed forces. From 17 May, the buses were returned to the company, but quotas for petrol were introduced, and the company was forced to install wood gasifiers on its fleet. Both Steinkjer and Namsos were bombed in 1940, but in both towns the company's facilities survived, except the garage in Steinkjer. The buses were at the time spread around the county, and only a single bus was destroyed. After the war ended in 1945, the company had 21 operational buses. The company needed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>license</b> to purchase buses, and in the following five years, 17 buses were bought for about NOK1 million. They were mostly Volvos and Scania-Vabis, including one from the municipal bus company in Høylandet. In 1946, Fylkesbilene bought Kvam Billag and the routes from Steinkjer to Øvre Kvam. At the same time, the route to Follafoss was extended to the county border. From 1 January 1948, Fylkesbilene bought the private bus operators in Ytre Namdal, and started routes from Vikna, Nærøy, Leka and Bindal via Ottersøy to Namsos. The company in Høylandet was bought to allow direct connection from Ytre Namdal via Høylandet to Grong. The same year, the company introduced a direct service between Verdalsøra and Levanger, that previously had only been served by the railway.|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, Nokia Corporation sued Apple for Apple's {{infringement}} of Nokia's patents {{relating to}} wireless technology; Apple countersued Nokia in December 2009. The two companies engaged in nearly two-years of litigation and both parties amended their claims multiple {{times and in}} multiple courts before finally settling in June 2011. For an undisclosed amount of cash and future ongoing iPhone royalties to be paid by Apple, Nokia agreed to settle, with Apple's royalty payments retroactively back-payable to the iPhone's introduction in 2007, but with no broad cross-licensing agreement made between the companies. Apple only agreed to cross-license some patents to Nokia. [...] "Apple {{said in a statement}} today that Nokia will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>license</b> to some technology, “but not the majority of the innovations that make the iPhone unique”. Apple gets a license to some of Nokia’s patents, including ones that were deemed essential to industry standards on mobile phones.|$|E

500|$|In 1986, Congress {{passed the}} Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA), which relaxed certain {{controls}} in the Gun Control Act and permitted licensed firearm dealers to conduct business at gun shows. Specifically, FOPA made it legal for FFL holders to make private sales, provided the firearm {{was transferred to}} the licensee's personal collection at least one year prior to the sale. Hence, when a personal firearm is sold by an FFL holder, no background check or Form 4473 is required by federal law. According to the ATF, FFL holders are required to keep a record of such sales in a bound book. The United States Department of Justice (USDOJ) said the stated purpose of FOPA was to ensure the GCA did not [...] "place any undue or unnecessary federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens, but it opened many loopholes through which illegal gun traffickers can slip." [...] The scope of those who [...] "engage in the business" [...] of dealing in firearms (and are therefore required to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>license)</b> was narrowed to include only those who devote [...] "time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms." [...] FOPA excluded those who buy and sell firearms to [...] "enhance a personal collection" [...] or for a [...] "hobby," [...] or who [...] "sell all or part of a personal collection." [...] According to the USDOJ, this new definition made {{it difficult for them to}} identify offenders who could claim they were operating as [...] "hobbyists" [...] trading firearms from their personal collection. Efforts to reverse a key feature of FOPA by requiring criminal background checks and purchase records on private sales at gun shows were unsuccessful.|$|E

[...] This was under Queensland’s Polynesian Labourers Act. [...] That Act required a ship to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>license</b> to undertake that work. [...] The license required the vessel to uphold certain minimum conditions as {{to the state and}} fitness of the vessel to carry labourers.
