50|$|Renewable {{natural gas}} is defined as gas {{obtained}} from biomass which is upgraded to a quality similar to natural gas.

Cost benefit studies indicate that large scale 50% biogenic carbon content sustainable SNG can be injected into the high pressure <b>gas</b> transmission <b>grid</b> {{at a cost of}} around 65p/therm. At this cost, it is possible to re-process fossil natural gas, used as an energy input into the gasification process, into 5 to 10 times greater quantity of sustainable SNG. Large scale sustainable SNG, combined with continuing natural gas production from UK continental shelf and unconventional gas, will potentially enable the cost of UK peak electricity to be de-coupled from international oil denominated 'take or pay' gas supply contracts.|$|R
