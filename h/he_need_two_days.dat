5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Korea Times, Kang-min stated that when he started drawing cartoons, he overworked himself as {{there was a large}} amount of labor to do. During this period, he spent <b>two</b> <b>days</b> per week writing up scripts, and the other five days to draw the cartoon itself. As of 2015, <b>he</b> only <b>needs</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> to draw the comic itself, as he no longer has to use up his time with routine processes. For example, <b>he</b> no longer <b>needs</b> to draw backgrounds, as he adapted 3D-rendered backgrounds. Kang-min stated that his life motto is to [...] "not to skip a meal and not to pass a night without sleep," [...] and that he is currently [...] "fully benefiting from my digitalized environment." ...|$|R

25|$|According to the ICTY, Croat/HVO forces {{attacked}} {{the villages of}} Doljani and Sovići, about 50 kilometers north of Mostar {{in the morning on}} 17 April 1993. The attack {{was part of a larger}} Croatian Defence Forces offensive aimed at taking Jablanica, the main Bosnian Muslim dominated town in the area. The HVO commanders had calculated that they <b>needed</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> to take Jablanica. Sovići's geopolitical location was of strategic significance for the HVO as it was en route to Jablanica. For the Bosnian Army, it was a gateway to the plateau of Risovac, which could create conditions for further progression towards the Adriatic coast.|$|R
5000|$|On January 8, 2016, the [...] "3 Percenters of Idaho" [...] group {{announced}} it was sending some of its members {{in support of the}} occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, allegedly in order to [...] "secure the perimeter" [...] and to prevent a [...] "Waco-style situation." [...] They left several hours later after being told their assistance was not <b>needed.</b> <b>Two</b> <b>days</b> previously, Vanderboegh had described the occupiers as [...] "a collection of fruits and nuts."

To get the former, Philip befriends former engineer John Skeevers (Željko Ivanek), who is dying of cancer and believes he was poisoned by his former employers. He learns that the material is a paint containing tiny iron balls and is possibly poisonous.|$|R
5|$|Benchley {{returned}} to the cinema in 1937, cast in the revue Broadway Melody of 1938, and in his largest role to that point, the critically panned Live, Love and Learn. A short that Benchley completed for MGM, A Night at the Movies, was Benchley's greatest success since How to Sleep, and won him a contract for more short films that would be produced in New York. These films were produced more quickly than his previous efforts (while How to Sleep <b>needed</b> <b>two</b> <b>days,</b> the later short How to Vote needed less than twelve hours), and took their toll on Benchley. He still completed two shoots in one day (one of which was The Courtship of the Newt), but rested for a while following the 1937 schedule.|$|R
50|$|Cobblepot and Butch Gilzean {{arrive at}} the hospital, {{intending}} to kill Falcone. Cobblepot reveals planning the mob war since before making his deal with Falcone. Gordon stops them and handcuffs Cobblepot and Butch to a pipe and frees Falcone. Falcone will <b>need</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> in a hideout {{to find a way}} to stop the war and Gordon agrees to help him. Cobblepot, realizing Maroni's men are coming and will kill him for his betrayal, pleads with Gordon to free him, citing the favor Gordon owns him. Commissioner Loeb arrives with Maroni's hitmen and orders them to kill Gordon and Falcone. A shootout between Gordon and the hitmen ensues with Gordon killing the hitmen. With help from Bullock, Gordon, Falcone, Cobblepot and Gilzean escape in an ambulance.|$|R
50|$|He {{set a new}} {{personal}} best of 2.31 on 17 June 2012, jumping in his native Ukraine at Mykolaiv. Bondarenko was a finalist at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London on 7 August 2012, clearing 2.29 and finishing in 7th place. Only 2 men jumped higher, as Bondarenko and five other jumpers ended their competition at 2.29, with the places determined by the countback: there was a 3-way tie for the third place bronze medal (based on clearing 2.29 on their first try), with Bondarenko relegated to seventh because <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>two</b> attempts to clear that height.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{it turns}} out that Evchen is pregnant, a fact she hides in front of her family and {{environment}} laboriously. When the five-month deadline draws near, von Gröningseck lets his comrade Lieutenant von Hasenpoth in on the secret. <b>He</b> <b>needs</b> <b>two</b> more months to accept an inheritance but still plans to marry the butcher's daughter, knowing that she does not befit his social status and he would have to quit the military service. During the conversation we learn that von Hasenpoth had laid out the plan for Evchen's rape, and had also given von Gröningseck the sleeping powder to silence the mother.|$|R
50|$|Terence Stamp says Ken Loach was {{inspired}} to write the film after meeting Carol White during Cathy Come Home:But he really didn’t write it; we didn’t really have a script. That {{was one of the}} things that was interesting about it. It was just wholly improvised. He had the idea, he had the overall trajectory in his mind, but we didn’t have a script. And, consequently, it had to be Take One because each of us had cameras on us. So before a take, he’d say something to Carol, and then he would say something to me, and we only discovered once the camera was rolling that he’d given us completely different directions. That’s why <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>two</b> cameras, because <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> the confusion and the spontaneity.|$|R
5|$|Like {{some other}} British {{football}} {{stars of the}} late 20th century, Baxter drank to excess, {{and at one point}} was said to be consuming three bottles of Bacardi a day. Scotland teammate Dave Mackay unsuccessfully advised him to train harder and live more sensibly. Baxter often got falling-down drunk the night before a match, but this did not seem to hamper his play, and team managers took little notice of his drinking. After retiring from football Baxter became a pub licensee, an unsuitable career for a problem drinker. At the age of 55 <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>two</b> liver transplants in four days, and promised to quit drinking.|$|R
50|$|Migueli {{was born}} in Ceuta. After playing with Cádiz CF from 1970 to 1973, {{competing}} in Segunda División, he transferred to La Liga giants FC Barcelona, where he became an undisputed starter after just one league appearance in his first year, going on to amass 391 games in the competition (549 overall, club's all-time best until 5 January 2011, when Xavi surpassed him in a Copa del Rey match against Athletic Bilbao); whilst he was performing his compulsory military service in Cádiz he made his official debut for the latter, and upon his return, not aware that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>two</b> special permits to leave the headquarters, he was jailed for one month.|$|R
5000|$|Yang {{said that}} he wanted to do two volumes because he was not sure which side in the {{conflict}} were [...] "good" [...] or [...] "bad" [...] and he noticed connections between contemporary terrorists and the Boxers. Yang said [...] "So in a lot of ways, I was trying to write {{the story of a young}} man who was essentially a terrorist, and I wanted him to be sympathetic, but I also didn't want the book to feel like I was condoning terrorism. So it was kind of a fine line." [...] He explained that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>two</b> different characters so the reader can [...] "see everything through". Yang outlined both books together and made the volumes separate.|$|R

50|$|If the thrower uses a spin technique, {{the knife}} will rotate during flight. This {{means that the}} thrower, {{assuming}} they are throwing the same way every time, must either choose a specific distance {{for each type of}} throw or, more practically, make slight adjustments to the placement of the knife in the hand or to the throwing movement. Another adjustment that can be made is the way the knife is held. If it is held at the blade when it is thrown, this makes it spin half, whereas if it is held by the handle, this makes a full spin. So if the thrower estimates <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> one and a half spins for the point to hit the target, he would hold the knife from the blade when it is thrown. If <b>he</b> feels <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>two</b> full spins for it to hit the target point-first, then it would be held by the handle.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the weekend}} of December 19 and 20, Strong World topped the Japanese box office {{for a second time}} in a row and, with $22,500,000 earned in its first eight days of showing, set a new company record for Toei, beating Aibo, the record holder from 2008, which <b>needed</b> <b>two</b> more <b>days</b> to reach the same amount and {{eventually}} finished with a total gross revenue of $50,000,000, a sum Toei expects Strong World to exceed by $7,000,000.|$|R
5|$|Although {{he gained}} a {{reputation}} as a womaniser when he moved to Glasgow, he married in 1965 and had two sons. The marriage broke up in 1981, and in 1983 he formed another relationship that lasted the rest of his life. After retiring from football he became manager of a pub, and his continued heavy drinking damaged his liver so badly that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>two</b> transplants at the age of 55, after which he swore off alcohol. Baxter was also addicted to gambling, and is estimated to have lost between £250,000 and £500,000. After he died of pancreatic cancer in 2001, his funeral was held in Glasgow Cathedral and his ashes were buried at Rangers' Ibrox Stadium. In 2003, a statue was erected in his honour at his hometown, Hill of Beath.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{character}} makes his appearance in Carroll's 1871 Through the Looking-Glass, {{the sequel to}} Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, he is again {{in trouble with the}} law. This time, he is not necessarily guilty; the White Queen explains that subjects are often punished before they commit a crime, rather than after, and sometimes they do not even commit it at all. The Hatter, and the March Hare, is also mentioned as being one of the White King's messengers, since the King explains that <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>two</b> messengers, [...] "one to come, and one to go". Sir John Tenniel's illustration also depicts him as sipping from a teacup as he did in the original novel, adding weight to Carroll's hint that the two characters are very much the same.|$|R
50|$|Worley's sophomore {{season ended}} early {{due to a}} torn {{anterior}} cruciate ligament. The injury was so severe that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> almost <b>two</b> years of rehab, forcing him to sit {{out all of the}} 1987 season. He also became academically ineligible during that time, and worked hard at a junior college (while rehabbing his knee) to restore his grade point average, and his NCAA eligibility.|$|R
50|$|Wessig {{not only}} out-dueled Wszoła {{for the gold}} during the finals on 1 August, the two {{shattered}} the 1976 mark several times, with clearances at 2.27, 2.29, and 2.31. Wessig began the competition at 2.15, and was flawless until 2.29, when <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>two</b> attempts. That {{proved to be the}} decisive height: of the 7 men who cleared (the, then new Olympic Record of) 2.27, only 4 managed to scale 2.29. Those four, the Polish champion versus the entire East German team of Wessig, 18-year-old sensation Jörg Freimuth, and 22-year-old Henry Lauterbach, would now battle for the medals. With the other three men having all cleared 2.29 on their first attempts, Wessig's first miss at that height dropped him to fourth place, out of the medals. But, he leaped back into first place, all alone, with his first attempt clearance of 2.31.|$|R

The larger HVO offensive on Jablanica had already started on 15 April 1993. The artillery destroyed the upper part of Sovici. The Bosnian Army was fighting back, but at about five p.m. the Bosnian Army commander in Sovici, surrendered. Approximately 70 to 75 soldiers surrendered. In total, at least 400 Bosnian Muslim civilians were detained. The HVO advance towards Jablanica was halted after a cease-fire agreement had been negotiated.|$|R

When he raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back.

At a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. <b>He</b> <b>needed</b> <b>two</b> soldiers to keep his hands up and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.|$|R
50|$|According to Catholic News Service (CNS) {{the miracle}} needed for his canonization was {{the healing of}} an adult male - William Glisson (who was 21 {{at the time of}} his {{accident}} and is now married) - from the United States of America who had fallen over a hole and hit his head while skating backward without a helmet rollerblading down the Baltimore Pike in Springfield. <b>He</b> <b>needed</b> <b>two</b> separate skull surgeries and was in a coma for a fortnight with a grave prognosis. A doctor - who was both a friend and worked at a rehabilitation center that the Opera Don Guanella ran - gave Glisson's mother two relics of the late priest. The Opera's website stated that Glisson was released from the hospital less than a month after the accident and returned to work just seven months later in what was seen as a rapid healing for someone in his condition.|$|R

His father {{turned out to be a}} Russian double agent, who is then killed by his mother. Joining S.H.I.E.L.D. after high school, Jesse is sent back to the moon to renovate the base where he and his crew were attacked by alien spider creatures. Jesse makes it out alive, but the spider's spit starts poisoning his blood and turning it into black goo. He is saved by the head of S.I.L.K., Cindy Moon, who uses her spider formula to fix his blood and grant him spider powers. She deceives Jesse into thinking <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>two</b> doses of the formula a day to survive, but it {{is discovered}} by Gwen that he is already cured and the doses are just maintaining his superhuman powers.|$|R
