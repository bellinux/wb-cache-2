50|$|From {{the turn}} of the 21st century, Hjorth’s work took on a more majestic {{dimension}} in terms of scale. Having spent much of the 1990s sculpting with recycled and obsolescent materials like <b>foundry</b> <b>moulds</b> for sand casting, Hjorth brought her passions—art, anthropology (material cultures) and architecture—together by building houses she called ‘living sculptures’. Deploying entirely recycled materials, these living sculptures were often mistaken by experts as heritage. Her last ‘living sculpture’, completed in 2011 in Semaphore, was dedicated to the living memory of her son, chess champion and mathematician, the late Professor Greg Hjorth. The house won a local government Heritage Award in Urban Design and Character for a New Development.|$|E

For example, the American matrices are shallower by 0.025 mm (0.010 inch), and consequently the interior of American <b>foundry</b> <b>moulds</b> need to be higher to produce characters with a type height of 23.3 mm (0.918 inch). This {{was one of many}} measures taken by the two Monotype companies to divide the world market between themselves. For example, the Americans served the Americas and the Canadian markets. The British company, The Monotype Corporation Ltd. in Salfords, had many customers in India, Africa, and Asia. For these countries many non-Latin typefaces were created for printing in Hebrew, Javanese, Sanskrit, Sinhala, Thai, and other languages.|$|E

Three-dimensional printing enables making of <b>foundry</b> <b>moulds</b> for elements of complex shapes. The mould {{presented in the}} paper was printed {{with the use of}} Z 510 Spectrum unit in the Car Technology Sp. z o. o. (Ltd. Co.) in Kraków. The basic material for printing <b>foundry</b> <b>moulds</b> is the ZCast 501 powder. This powder is a mixture of traditional molding sand, gypsum and supplementary ingredients. The mould is made in ZCast technology, and it enables casting of zinc, magnesium and aluminum alloys at max. pouring temperature of 1100 °C. The paper describes research on the possibility to utilize a standard ZP 14 powder for building a rotor blade casting moulds. The research has showed that the ZP 14 powder may serve for printing <b>foundry</b> <b>moulds,</b> which should then be subjected to thermo-chemical treatment.

Using biodegradable materials as partial content of new binders, or additives to moulding sands may not only decrease the toxicity and increase reclamation ability of tested moulding sands, but also accelerate the biodegradation rate of used binders, and the new biodegradable additive (PCL) did not decrease the strength and thermal properties. In addition, using polycaprolactone (PCL) as a biodegradable material may improve the flexibility of moulding sands with polymeric binder and reduce toxicity...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the process of}} thermal evaporation of a foundry pattern. At several research-development centres, studies {{have been carried out}} to examine the physico-chemical phenomena that take place in <b>foundry</b> <b>mould</b> filled with polystyrene pattern when it is poured with molten metal. In the technique of evaporative patterns, the process of mould filling with molten metal (the said mould holding inside a polystyrene pattern) is interrelated with the process of thermal decomposition of this pattern. The transformation of an evaporative pattern (e. g. made from foamed polystyrene) from the solid into liquid and then gaseous state occurs {{as a result of the}} thermal effect that the liquid metal exerts onto this pattern. Consequently, at the liquid metal-pattern-mould phase boundary some physico-chemical phenomena take place, which until now have not been fully explained. When the pattern is evaporating, some solid and gaseous products are evolved, e. g. CO, CO 2, H 2, N 2, and hydrocarbons, e. g. styrene, toluene, ethane, methane, benzene [16, 23]. The process of polystyrene pattern evaporation in <b>foundry</b> <b>mould</b> under the effect of molten metal is of a very complex nature and depends on many different factors, still not fully investigated. The kinetics of pattern evaporation is also affected by the technological properties of <b>foundry</b> <b>mould,</b> e. g. permeability, thermophysical properties, parameters of the gating system, temperature of pouring, properties of pattern material, and the size of pattern-liquid metal contact surface...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Metal reoxidation {{causes a}} number of iron {{castings}} defects, particularly when pouring them in green-sand moulds. One of them is pinholes the occurrence of which is explained by several hypotheses. One of possible causes is reoxidation processes in the <b>foundry</b> <b>mould</b> cavity. During its flowing in the gating system and in the mould cavity the liquid metal gets into contact with oxygen from air and water vapour. Secondary oxidation of elements takes place in sequence of their affinity to oxygen. Design/methodology/approach: Therefore the authors were aimed at cast irons. Besides indirect methods the reoxidation was researched mainly by direct measurement of oxygen activity during filling of a mould up to solidus temperature. Findings: The use of oxygen activity measurement for direct study of changes caused by reoxidation processes is limited {{and that it is}} more suitable for study of the influence of different factors on cast iron crystallization and graphite morphology. Practical implications: Obtained results have confirmed that oxygen activity measurement can serve to the casting quality control. But it is little sensitive for explanation of processes running in a cavity during metal casting. Originality/value: Continuous monitoring of oxygen activity changes in a <b>foundry</b> <b>mould</b> is an original solution since other authors have done their measurements only in a furnace with disposable sensors...|$|R

On the grounds of measurement results, theoretical value of microwave heating power, dissipated in unit volume of the selected multilayer foundry system, was determined.

Since drying time of water based coatings is heavily dependent on the amount of water present in the coating layer, a stable coating process is prerequisite for a stable drying process. In this study, we analyse the effect of different variables on the coating layer properties. We start by considering four critical variables identified in a previous study such as sand compaction, coating density, dipping time and gravity and then we add centre points to the original experimental plans to identify possible non-linear effects and variation in process stability. Finally, we investigate the relation between coating penetration (a variable that is relatively simple to measure in production) and other coating layer thickness properties (relevant for the drying process design). Correlations are found and equations are provided. In particular it is found that water thickness can be directly correlated to penetration with a simple linear equation and without the need to account for other variables...|$|E

In particular, <b>foundry</b> <b>moulds</b> used {{for the production of}} cast components undergo a process of drying needed to avoid quality problems in the final parts.
