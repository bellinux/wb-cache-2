5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted.

This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E
5|$|While the {{electromagnetic}} field {{together with the}} gravitational field are the only classical fields providing accurate descriptions of nature, other types of classical fields are important too. In the approach to quantum field theory (QFT) referred to as second quantization, the starting point is one or more classical fields, where e.g. the wave functions solving the Dirac equation are considered as classical fields prior to (second) quantization. While second quantization and the Lagrangian formalism associated with {{it is not a}} fundamental aspect of QFT, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> so far all quantum field theories can be approached this way, including the standard model. In these cases, there are classical versions of the field equations following from the Euler–Lagrange equations derived from the Lagrangian using the principle of least action. These field equations must be relativistically invariant, and their solutions (which will qualify as relativistic wave functions according to the definition below) must transform under some representation of the Lorentz group.|$|E

Here, after a general introduction and historical overview, we emphasize the role of counterfactual reasoning within the quantitative frameworks of probability theory, decision theory, and game theory. 1. Counterfactuals Counterfactuals are a species of conditionals. They are propositions or sentences, expressed by or equivalent to subjunctive conditionals of the form 'if it <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> A, then it would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> B', or 'if it had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> A, then it would have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> B'; A <b>is</b> called <b>the</b> antecedent, and B the consequent. Counterfactual reasoning typically involves the entertaining of hypothetical states of affairs: <b>the</b> antecedent <b>is</b> believed or presumed to be false, or contrary-to-the-fact, but its truth is imagined or supposed. Counterfactual reasoning is thus a form of modal reasoning, kindred to reasoning about necessity or possibility, and in contrast to reasoning about the way things actually <b>are.</b> <b>The</b> philosophical study of conditionals goes back {{at least as far as}} the Stoics o...|$|R

25|$|The {{simplest}} example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> {{the family}} of vector spaces is constant, i.e., there is a fixed vector space V such that V(x)=V for all x in X: in this case there is a copy of V for each x in X and these copies fit together to form the vector bundle X×V over X. Such vector bundles {{are said to be}} trivial. A more complicated (and prototypical) class of examples are the tangent bundles of smooth (or differentiable) manifolds: to every point of such a manifold we attach the tangent space to the manifold at that point. Tangent bundles are not, in general, trivial bundles: for example, the tangent bundle of the sphere is non-trivial by the hairy ball theorem. In general, a manifold is said to be parallelizable if and only if its tangent bundle is trivial.|$|E

[...] The amount can be less than one percent in animals consuming less digestible plants, and it can be as high as forty percent in zooplankton consuming phytoplankton.

[...] For example, it might mean [...] " [...] [...] [...] is a dog." [...] But it makes no sense to think we can quantify over something like this. (Such a position is quite consistent with Frege's own arguments on the concept-object distinction). So to use a predicate as a variable is to have it occupy the place of a name which only individual variables should occupy. This reasoning has been rejected by Boolos.|$|E

Georges Coedès said: “Fu-nan occupied a key position with regard to the maritime trade routes, and was inevitably a port of call both for the navigators who went through the Straits of Malacca and for those – probably more numerous – who made the transit over one of the isthmuses of the Malay Peninsula.
