5|$|The {{silver birch}} is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree that owes its common {{name to the}} white peeling bark on the trunk. The twigs are slender and often pendulous and the leaves are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow in autumn before they fall. The flowers are catkins and the light, winged seed get widely scattered by the wind. The silver birch is a hardy tree, a pioneer species, {{and one of the}} first trees to appear on bare or fire-swept land. Many species of birds and animals are found in birch woodland, the tree supports a wide range of insects and the light shade it casts allows shrubby and other plants to grow beneath its canopy. It is planted decoratively in parks and gardens and is used for forest products such as <b>joinery</b> <b>timber,</b> firewood, tanning, racecourse jumps and brooms. Various parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine and the bark contains triterpenes which have been shown to have medicinal properties.|$|E
40|$|The East House reconfigures an {{existing}} 1190 s brick house {{to create a}} modern beachside residence with a very strong relationship to the coastal environment {{in which it is}} situated at Australia 2 Ì† 7 s most easterly point. Primary motivations of the project included employing passive-solar design principles to achieve year-round comfort and energy performance, as well as establishing a home of rich experiential quality. interlocking spatial ribbons realized via internal <b>joinery,</b> <b>timber</b> screening, and a thermal mass wall are deployed to create a series of overlapping, extensive spatial zones...|$|E
50|$|Internally {{elements}} of finely detailed original <b>joinery</b> survive. <b>Timber</b> posts, beams and brick walls are unpainted.|$|R
50|$|An {{ornamental}} tree. Also planted for shade. Previously {{used for}} timber {{in the construction}} of coaches. Also cabinet making, flooring, tool handles, lining, ammunition boxes, artificial limbs and <b>joinery.</b> The <b>timber</b> has steam bending qualities. The weight is between 575 and 900 kilograms per cubic metre.|$|R

Full-height partition walls have been erected in the former post office public space. Floors are lined with recent carpet. Door furniture has generally been replaced though some china and brass door handles remain.|$|R
40|$|Applications of a CNC timber {{processor}} at the University of British Columbia {{in research}} on <b>timber</b> <b>joinery</b> and teaching and manufacturing of timber structures are presented. The feasibility of traditional <b>timber</b> <b>joinery</b> was governed by practical considerations such as carpenters skills and available tools. Modern CNC wood-processing machinery has changed these constraints and almost any desired geometry is possible; therefore, traditional joinery becomes feasible and affordable again. High-tech manufacturing machinery like automated CNC timber processors can be readily adapted to produce traditional <b>timber</b> <b>joinery</b> and thereby create value added timber building components. Furthermore, the use of advanced CAD/CAM systems in combination with CNC timber processors allows an integrated, streamlined and paperless design approach assuring high quality. The integration of knowledge {{in the areas of}} wood mechanics, architectural design, CAD programmes, and CAM technology is leading to new developments, increased use of value added components, and finally change in timber construction...|$|R

50|$|The weaving sheds {{were simple}} working {{industrial}} {{buildings and the}} external materials generally used in their construction are robust and there was {{little in the way}} of ornamentation. External walls were generally in coursed rubble stone or brick. The few openings or windows were in simple detailed <b>timber</b> <b>joinery.</b> Internal materials comprised stone flag floors, exposed cast iron structure, <b>timber</b> <b>joinery</b> and boarded partitions and lime plaster on lath soffits to the south facing roof slopes. The sheds were often built into the hillside so the wall would benefit from contact with damp earth that would maintain the moisture levels in the shed required by cotton weaving.|$|R
