25|$|The National Council of Arab Americans and the ANSWER Coalition, {{two groups}} {{sponsoring}} a planned march and rally, <b>have</b> <b>sued</b> {{the city in}} federal court for the denial of the Great Lawn permits. In addition to claiming that a large gathering would have damaged the newly renovated Great Lawn, the city also claimed it could not provide adequate police protection, and that the protesters failed to provide a rain date for the gathering. The edition of July 31, 2006 of The New York Times reported that court documents appeared to indicate the Parks Department turned down the permits in order to shield Republican visitors from the protests. The documents include several emails and legal memoranda from city officials.|$|E

500|$|On two {{occasions}} Japanese citizens <b>have</b> <b>sued</b> their government for damages from the bombings, {{arguing that the}} government is culpable for having waged a [...] "reckless war" [...] that provoked the bombings and for requiring civilians to remain in the targeted areas. In December 2009 the Tokyo District Court dismissed one of the suits, stating that {{it was not possible to}} identify individuals who deserve compensation as almost all Japanese suffered as a result of the war. The court also ruled that any compensation should be allocated through the legislative, rather than judicial, process. In December 2011, the Osaka District Court handed down a similar ruling, adding that the government did not violate its constitution in its treatment of bombing victims. This judgement stated that there had not been [...] "unreasonable disparity" [...] in how civilians, soldiers, and atomic bomb survivors were treated, and that the government had showed [...] "no gross deviation from its discretionary right in not legislating for redress measures".|$|E

2500|$|Fluoridation {{has been}} the subject of many court cases wherein activists <b>have</b> <b>sued</b> municipalities, asserting that their rights to consent to medical {{treatment}} and due process are infringed by mandatory water fluoridation. Individuals <b>have</b> <b>sued</b> municipalities for a number of illnesses that they believe were caused by fluoridation of the city's water supply. In most of these cases, the courts have held in favor of cities, finding no or only a tenuous connection between health problems and widespread water fluoridation.

As a result, Oaks concludes that while under contemporaneous law it would have been legally permissible for city officials to destroy, or [...] "abate," [...] the actual printed newspapers, the destruction of the printing press itself was probably outside of the council's legal authority, and its owners could <b>have</b> <b>sued</b> for damages.|$|E
2500|$|The Valukas Report {{issued in}} 2010 charged that Lehman Brothers {{engaged in a}} {{practice}} known as repo 105 and that EY, Lehman's auditor, was aware of it.

New York prosecutors announced in 2010 that they <b>have</b> <b>sued</b> the firm. David Goldfarb, a Lehman CFO who concocted the repo 105 balance sheet window dressing technique was a former senior partner of EY. EY said that its last audit of Lehman Brothers was {{for the fiscal year}} ending 30 November 2007 and that Lehman’s financial statements were fairly presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

2500|$|... 1852, Scott v. Emerson. The legal scholar Edlie Wong {{has noted}} that the case was shaped by Harriet and Dred Scott's desire to achieve freedom and to protect their two young daughters Eliza and Lizzie, who were of an age to be sold and at great risk in slave markets {{by the time the}} case was settled. [...] By the 1850s, {{southern}} juries became less willing to follow precedent and grant freedom to slaves based on their having resided for a time in free states. In 1852 the Missouri state supreme court ruled that Scott's residence in a free state did not entitle him to freedom after he returned to Missouri. Its ruling that he should <b>have</b> <b>sued</b> for freedom while in a free state, was a de facto end in Missouri to the precedent of [...] "once free, always free." ...|$|E

A number of groups of U.S. citizens— especially farmers and inhabitants of cities downwind of the Nevada Test Site and U.S. military workers at various tests— <b>have</b> <b>sued</b> for compensation and recognition of their exposure, many successfully. The passage of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 allowed for a systematic filing of compensation claims in relation to testing as well as those employed at nuclear weapons facilities.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to lawsuits against Google directly, various proxy wars have been waged against Android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of Android devices, with {{the effect of}} discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an Android device to market. Both Apple and Microsoft <b>have</b> <b>sued</b> several manufacturers for patent infringement, with Apple's ongoing legal action against Samsung being a particularly high-profile case. In January 2012, Microsoft said they had signed patent license agreements with eleven Android device manufacturers, whose products account for [...] "70 percent of all Android smartphones" [...] sold in the US and 55% of the worldwide revenue for Android devices. These include Samsung and HTC. Samsung's patent settlement with Microsoft included an agreement to allocate more resources to developing and marketing phones running Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system. Microsoft has also tied its own Android software to patent licenses, requiring the bundling of Microsoft Office Mobile and Skype applications on Android devices to subsidize the licensing fees, {{while at the same}} time helping to promote its software lines.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{fishing is}} now {{predominantly}} based in Canadian communities, {{with a much}} smaller fishery—largely restricted to yellow perch—in Ohio. One account suggested that Canadian fishermen are [...] "still at it and making money" [...] and they [...] "know how to fish" [...] by [...] "using the old nets." [...] The Ontario fishery {{is one of the}} most intensively managed in the world. However, there are reports that some Canadian commercial fishermen are dissatisfied with fishing quotas, and <b>have</b> <b>sued</b> their government about this matter, and there have been complaints that the legislative body writing the quotas is [...] "dominated by the U.S." [...] and that sport fishing interests are favored at the expense of commercial fishing interests. Cuts of 30 to 45 percent for certain fish were made in 2007. The Lake Erie fishery was one of the first fisheries in the world managed on individual transferable quotas and features mandatory daily catch reporting and intensive auditing of the catch reporting system. Still, the commercial fishery is the target of critics who would like to see the lake managed for the exclusive benefit of sport fishing and the various industries serving the sport fishery. In November 2010, Ontario's oldest and largest fish processor known as Great Lakes Fish Corporation was shut down after operating for a hundred years; 130 workers were laid off and numerous spinoff jobs disappeared, such as jobs at local restaurants and net repair shops. According to one report, the Canadian town of Port Dover is the home of the lake's largest fishing fleet, and the town features miniature golf, dairy bars, French-fry stands, and restaurants serving perch.|$|E
