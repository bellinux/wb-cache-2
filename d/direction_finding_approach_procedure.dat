40|$|This paper {{consider}} {{the problem of}} relaxing the spatial coverage re-quirement on the mechanical rotation in the <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> (DF) <b>approach</b> based on the received power measurements from single antenna pointing to different directions. Under incomplete spatial coverage, we show that the least square (LS) solution used to trans-form the problem into its spectral form is no longer accurate due to its ill-conditioned system matrix. To overcome this, we propose an approach based on spatial remodeling of the spatial power measure-ments such that its spatial periodicity can be adjusted according to the spatial coverage. The approach also incorporates the Tikhonov regularization in calculating the LS solution based on the new sys-tem matrix. Upon arriving at the new spectral form, the Cadzow-annihilating filter method can then be used to estimate the direction-of-arrival. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to show {{the efficacy of the}} proposed method.

40|$|In many {{applications}} of public safety, security, and emergency scenarios electromagnetic emitters such as cell phones {{have to be}} located. However, in urban environments an effective and reliable localization in a noncooperative case is a challenging task due to the propagation properties of the electromagnetic waves. In particular scenarios, buildings, vegetation and other obstacles (partly metallic ones such a lamp posts or signs) lead to shadowing, diffraction, and reflection of the signal. As a consequence the emitted wave is often measured as a superposition of the signal taking multiple paths. Therefore conventional <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> (DF) <b>approaches</b> are likely to fail the localization task in these multi-path. The research project “Emitter Localization in Multi-Path Environments” (EiLT) [1] has the aim to develop {{the next generation of}} DF systems for surveillance and spectrum control in urban scenarios taking advantage of ray-tracing techniques, high resolution channel parameter estimation, wideband polarimetric DF antennas and data fusion algorithms...|$|R

Early detection and adequate management of adnexal lesions are very important for saving lives and preserving fertility. In this study, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of 106 Turkish adolescent women who underwent surgery for adnexal masses. Methods: The study included 106 patients aged ≤ 20 years that underwent surgery for adnexal masses at our hospital between January 2008 and December 2013.

40|$|A radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> (DF) {{system is}} an antenna array and a {{receiver}} {{arranged in a}} combination to determine the azimuth angle of a distant emitter. Basically, all DF systems derive the emitter location from an initial determination of the angle-of-arrival (AOA). Radio <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> techniques have classically been based on multiple-antenna systems employing multiple receivers. Classic techniques such as MUSIC [1][2] and ESPRIT use simultaneous phase information from each antenna to estimate the angle-of-arrival of the signal of interest. In many scenarios (e. g., hand-held systems), however, multiple receivers are impractical. Thus, single channel techniques are of interest, particularly in mobile scenarios. Although the amount of existing research for single channel DF is considerably less than for multi-channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding,</b> single channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> techniques have been previously investigated. Since many of the single channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> techniques are older analog techniques and have been analyzed in previous work, we will investigate a new single channel <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> technique that takes specific advantage of digital capabilities.

Starting in the 1950s, these beacons were generally replaced by the VOR system, in which the bearing to the navigational aid is measured from the signal itself; therefore no specialized antenna with moving parts is required. Due to relatively low purchase, maintenance and calibration cost, NDB's are still used to mark locations of smaller aerodromes and important helicopter landing sites.|$|R

A new architecture for a laser warning system is here presented and the specific trade-off and performance analysis are discussed for an equipment capable of location the radiation within a 360 deg azimuthal field-of-inspection, with an angular resolution of 5 deg. Additional signal processing was also implemented in order to obtain data that will lead to the classification of the laser source. the model adopted for this system results from application of the monopulse processing, currently used in microwave and RF <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> systems.

Following is the study of phenomena involved in the laser propagation in the atmosphere, giving special attention to the influence of the turbulence regime in the detection process.
