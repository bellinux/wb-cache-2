50|$|The {{inner circle}} is the stimulus, {{from which the}} tristimulus values should be {{measured}} in CIE XYZ using the 2° standard observer. The intermediate circle is the proximal field, extending out another 2°. The outer circle is the background, reaching out to 10°, from which the relative luminance (Yb) need be measured. If the proximal field is {{the same color as}} the background, the background is considered to be adjacent to the stimulus. Beyond the circles which comprise the display <b>field</b> (<b>display</b> area, viewing area) is the surround field (or peripheral area), which can be considered to be the entire room. The totality of the proximal field, background, and surround is called the adapting field (the field of view that supports adaptation—extends to the limit of vision).|$|E
5000|$|Research {{conducted}} on presence with HDTV and other higher resolution formats that use a wide <b>field</b> <b>display,</b> {{has revealed that}} sometimes the feeling of presence can be too real, producing physiological effect that some viewers may find undesirable. Subjects have reported experiencing an increase in symptoms that are common to motion sickness when viewing strong visual stimuli on large screens. [...] A study conducted using virtual reality simulation {{as part of the}} experiment, found that subjects with lower visual acuity experienced significantly more of the symptoms associated with motion sickness. Furthermore, the study also found that the symptoms of motion sickness increased when subjects observed the visual stimuli without the aid of their glass or contact lenses. [...] Consequently, optimum viewing distance recommendations based solely on human visual system and technological limitations may not always produce the best viewing experience. Viewers with lower visual acuity, who prefer to watch HDTV without their corrective lenses may want to sit closer to see critical details and run the risk of undesirable side effects.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the design and {{evaluation}} of direct 3 D gesture interaction with a full horizontal parallax light <b>field</b> <b>display.</b> A light <b>field</b> <b>display</b> defines a visual scene using directional light beams emitted from multiple light sources {{as if they are}} emitted from scene points. Each scene point is rendered individually resulting in more realistic and accurate 3 D visualization compared to other 3 D displaying technologies. We propose an interaction setup combining the visualization of objects within the Field Of View (FOV) of a light <b>field</b> <b>display</b> and their selection through freehand gesture tracked by the Leap Motion Controller. The accuracy and usefulness of the proposed interaction setup was also evaluated in a user study with test subjects. The results of the study revealed high user preference for free hand interaction with light <b>field</b> <b>display</b> as well as relatively low cognitive demand of this technique. Further, our results also revealed some limitations and adjustments of the proposed setup to be addressed in future work...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{key issues}} in {{conventional}} stereoscopic displays is the well-known vergence-accommodation conflict problem {{due to the lack}} of the ability to render correct focus cues for 3 D scenes. Recently several light <b>field</b> <b>display</b> methods have been explored to reconstruct a true 3 D scene by sampling either the projections of the 3 D scene at different depths or the directions of the light rays apparently emitted by the 3 D scene and viewed from different eye positions. These methods are potentially capable of rendering correct or nearly correct focus cues and addressing the vergence-accommodation conflict problem. In this paper, we describe a generalized framework to model the image formation process of the existing light-field display methods and present a systematic method to simulate and characterize the retinal image and the accommodation response rendered by a light <b>field</b> <b>display.</b> We further employ this framework to investigate the trade-offs and guidelines for an optimal 3 D light <b>field</b> <b>display</b> design. Our method is based on quantitatively evaluating the modulation transfer functions of the perceived retinal image of a light <b>field</b> <b>display</b> by accounting for the ocular factors of the human visual system.

40|$|Abstract: Approach {{to achieve}} self-calibration three {{dimensional}} (3 D) light <b>field</b> <b>display</b> is investigated in this paper. The proposed 3 D light <b>field</b> <b>display</b> is constructed up on spliced multi-LCDs, lens and diaphragm arrays, and directional diffuser. The light field imaging principle, hardware configuration, diffuser characteristic and image reconstruction simulation are described and analyzed, respectively. Besides the light field imaging, a self-calibration method is {{proposed to improve}} the imaging performance. An image sensor is deployed to capture calibration patterns projected onto and then reflected by the Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) film, which is attached to and shaped the diffuser. These calibration components are assembled with the display unit and can be switched between display mode and calibration mode. In calibration mode, the imperfect imaging relations of optical components are captured and calibrated automatically. We demonstrate our design by implementing the prototype of proposed 3 D light <b>field</b> <b>display</b> using modified off-the-shelf products. The proposed approach successfully meets the requirement of real application on scalable configuration, fast-calibration, large viewing angular range and smooth motion parallax...|$|E

Such displays consist of a stacked set of liquid crystal panels with a single pair of crossed linear polarizers.

40|$|Abstract—Ultimately, {{a display}} device should {{be capable of}} {{reproducing}} the visual effects observed in reality. In this paper, we introduce an autostereoscopic display that uses a scalable array of digital light projectors and a projection screen augmented with microlenses to simulate a light field for a given three-dimensional scene. Physical objects emit or reflect light in all directions to create a light field that can be approximated by the light <b>field</b> <b>display.</b> The display can simultaneously provide many viewers from different viewpoints a stereoscopic effect without head tracking or special viewing glasses. This work focuses on two important technical problems related to the light field display: calibration and rendering. We present a solution to automatically calibrate the light <b>field</b> <b>display</b> using a camera and introduce two efficient algorithms to render the special multiview images by exploiting their spatial coherence. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with a four-projector prototype that can display dynamic imagery with full parallax.
