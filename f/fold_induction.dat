40|$|M. Sc. in {{the current}} study the effect of the {{addition}} of methyl Jasmonate (MeJA), chitosan, a cell wall elicitor prepared from Phytophthora nicotlanae to tobacco cells and the subsequent defense responses elicited in these cells were Investigated. The defense responses investigated can be divided into three categories according to the time scale whereby resistance responses in plant cells are induced: early events which included the analysis of lipid peroxidation, the induction of lipoxygenase (L 0) 0 enzyme activity as well as the changes in phosphoprotein profiles; intermediate to later responses which included investigations of peroxidase (POD) activity, lignin content, phytoalexin content and phenolic content and also late responses which included studies of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR) and 13 - 1, 3 -giucanase activity. An approach also followed in this study was the addition of MeJA to tobacco cells for 24 h followed by the addition of either the cell wall elicitor or chitosan as a secondary elicitors, to investigate possible preconditioning or sensitisation by MeJA. Results obtained in this study revealed the time and concentration dependent accumulation of phytoalexins (secondary metabolites) when MeJA was added to tobacco cells and an optimal concentration of MeJA to use in further studies was determined as 1 mM. MeJA was the most effective inducer of lipid peroxidation (22 <b>fold</b> <b>induction),</b> a response observable after 2 h of exposure to MeJA. Conditioning with MeJA, followed by both chitosan (19 <b>fold</b> <b>induction)</b> and elicitor (25 <b>fold</b> <b>induction)</b> led to an earlier accumulation as well as significant increases in the levels of malondialdehyde, the product of lipid peroxidation. LOX enzyme activity was significantly increased by the addition of MeJA (6 <b>fold</b> <b>Induction),</b> chitosan (4 <b>fold</b> <b>induction)</b> and elicitor (3. 8 <b>fold</b> <b>induction).</b> Conditioning with. MeJA, followed by both chitosan (3. 3 <b>fold</b> <b>induction)</b> and elicitor (3. 9 <b>fold</b> <b>Induction)</b> also led to noteworthy increases in enzyme activity. Analysis of the phosphoprotein profiles do not reveal the accumulation of phosphorylated proteins when MeJA was added to cells and very little accumulation of such proteins when chitosan was added. Phosphorylated proteins could be observed in cells treated with elicitor and In the cases where conditioning with MeJA, followed by secondary elicitation with either chitosan or elicitor, was studied, the differential induction of phosphorylated cellular proteins could also be observed. No significant induction of POD activity could be observed under any of the conditions, except for a possible slight increase in POD activity starting at 16 - 24 h after the elicitor had been added and a more definite increase after 24 h which was sustained up to 48 h after the addition of MeJA. PAGE of peroxidase, followed by activity staining revealed the presence of a slow migrating anionic peroxidase as well as a fast migrating peroxidase. Conditioning with MeJA, followed by secondary elicitation with both chitosan and elicitor revealed enhanced POD activity as well increased induction of a fast migrating anionic peroxidase on PAGE gels. MeJA was a more effective inducer of elevated levels of lignin content than the elicitor or chitosan and the addition of MeJA to tobacco cells led to a 2. 2 fold increase in the lignin content, a response observed after 24 h and sustained up to 48 h. Chitosan as secondary elicitor did not lead to any increase in lignin content, but the cell wall elicitor as secondary agent significantly increased the lignin content after 40 - 48 h. Analysis of phenolic content did not show any significant increases In the total soluble phenolics when the agents were used on their own and only the phenolic content of the MeJA-conditioned cells, followed by the addition of chitosan showed a slight increase. In this case, the HPLC analysis of the phenolics also revealed a shift In the profiles for phenolics. SDS-PAGE of PR proteins revealed the induction of constitutive as well as new proteins when MeJA and elicitor, but not chitosan were used as elicitation agents. However, In the MeJA-pretreated cells addition of both chitosan and elicitor led to increased accumulation of PR proteins with molecular masses ranging from 6 - 70 kDa. Results from the i 3 - 1, 3 -glucanase activity assay indicate a strong induction (4 - 5 fold) when MeJA and elicitor (4 fold), but not when chitosan was added to cells. Conditioning effects were revealed when both chitosan (3 <b>fold</b> <b>induction)</b> and elicitor (2. 5 <b>fold</b> <b>induction)</b> were used as secondary elicitors. The increases in intensities of bands with molecular masses ranging from 31 - 35 kDa observed on SOS-PAGE gels where chitosan and elicitor were added as secondary agents corresponded in a time dependent manner with the increased levels obtained in thep- 1, 3 -glucanase activity assay...|$|E

However, the progress for cyanobacteria is far behind with a specific lack of non-native inducible promoters. RESULTS: We report the development of engineered TetR-regulated promoters with a wide dynamic range of transcriptional regulation. An optimal 239 (± 16) <b>fold</b> <b>induction</b> in darkness (white-light-activated heterotrophic growth, 24 [*]h) and an optimal 290 (± 93) <b>fold</b> <b>induction</b> in red light (photoautotrophic growth, 48 [*]h) were observed with the L 03 promoter in cells of the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain ATCC 27184 (i. e. glucose-tolerant Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803).

The cytotoxicity experiment yielded a LD 50 value of 23. 4 + 9. 7 µg PCP/mL upon 48 hrs of exposure, indicating that PCP is acutely toxic. A dose-response relationship was recorded with respect to gene <b>induction.</b> For example, <b>fold</b> <b>inductions</b> of CYP 1 A 1 were 1. 0 + 0. 0, 1. 0 + 0. 0, 1. 3 + 0. 5, 6. 3 + 4. 3, and 22. 5 + 3. 5 for 0, 6. 2, 12. 5, 25, and 50 µg PCP/mL, respectively.

Exposure to mercury has been associated with a significant number of adverse health effects including: cardiovascular disease, anemia, developmental abnormalities, neurobehavioral disorders, kidney and liver damage, and cancer in some cases. In several studies, the toxicity of mercury has been attributed to its high affinity to protein-containing sulfhydryl groups. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms by which mercury exerts its toxicity, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis. This research was therefore designed to assess the cellular and molecular responses of human liver carcinoma cells following exposure to mercury. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT-assay for cell viability, while the gene profile assay was performed to measure the transcriptional activation of stress genes in thirteen different recombinant cell lines generated from HepG 2 cells. Cytotoxicity experiment yielded a LD 50 value of 3. 5 ± 0. 6 µg/mL upon 48 hours of exposure, indicating that mercury is highly toxic.

Recent data have documented a decrease in SERCA 2 levels in human heart failure. In order to further study the importance of SERCA 2 levels in cardiac cellular physiology we constructed a recombinant replication deficient adenovirus encoding SERCA 2 driven by an SV 40 enhanced TK promoter (14 CTK). After documenting the presence of the SERCA 2 gene by southern analysis of viral DNA. neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were infected with either the SERCA 2 encoding adenovirus or an adenovirus encoding beta-galactosidase. Cells were harvested for RNA preparation at 48 hours and for protein at 72 hours post infection. Northern blot analysis using a full length probe specific for rat SERCA 2 revealed a several <b>fold</b> <b>induction</b> of SERCA 2 mRNA levels compared to cells infected with the beta-galactosidase encoding virus.

The <b>fold</b> <b>induction</b> of the mRNA was accounted for by a similar fold activation of transcription of the gene by glucocorticoids in regenerating but not in quiescent liver; in the latter, activation of transcription was marginal in spite of glucocorticoid-induced hypersensitivity to cleavage by DNase I at the glucocorticoid-dependent enhancer of the gene. The possibility that in quiescent liver glucocorticoids act at a transcriptional step beyond initiation, increasing the rate of elongation or overcoming a blockage in elongation, was excluded. However, a similar <b>fold</b> <b>induction</b> was determined for total and nuclear tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA {{in the presence of}} glucocorticoids, suggesting that in quiescent liver glucocorticoids promote efficient maturation of the tyrosine aminotransferase primary transcript.

Induction of phosphorylated Chk 2 was evaluated using several different parameters, including <b>fold</b> <b>induction,</b> Kolmogorov-Smirnov score, and percentage of positively stained cells. These measurements were highly correlated and provided an accurate method for compound ranking/binning, structure-activity relationship studies, and lead identification. Screening for Chk 2 activators was undertaken with a target-focused library and a diversified library from ArQule chemical space. Several compounds exhibited submicromolar EC 50 values for phosphorylated Chk 2 induction. These compounds were further analyzed for Chk 2 -dependent cytotoxicity, as assessed through a high-content cell death assay in combination with siRNA silencing of Chk 2 expression. Several compounds were identified and showed specific inhibition or lethality in a target-dependent manner.

40|$|Activation of AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) {{inhibits}} hepatic fatty acid synthesis by suppressing sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) - 1 c, a master regulator of hepatic lipogenic gene expression. Using a model cell line rat hepatoma McA-RH 7777 (CRL- 1601) that mimics {{the behavior of}} the intact liver by producing high levels of SREPB- 1 c mRNA and protein, we previously showed that AMPK suppresses hepatic Srebp- 1 c transcription by inhibiting endogenous liver X receptor (LXR) ligand production and SREBP- 1 c processing. However, whether AMPK directly inhibits ligand-induced LXR activity remained undetermined. In this study we used a series of mutant Srebp- 1 c promoter linked to a luciferase reporter to determine the inhibitory mechanism in rat hepatoma McA-RH 7777 cells. AMPK activation by either AICAR or metformin decreases Srebp- 1 c promoter activity by about 75 %. Normally, the synthetic LXR ligand T 0901317 compound increases the wild-type Srebp- 1 c promoter activity by about 3 -fold, which is similar to that observed in the presence of AICAR or metformin. When endogenous LXR ligand production was blocked by the potent HMG CoA reductase inhibitor compactin, T 0901317 -induced Srebp- 1 c promoter activity was decreased by AICAR or metformin treatment. In the mutant Srebp- 1 c promoter in which two LXR elements are intact but the sterol regulatory element (SRE) is disrupted, the <b>fold</b> <b>inductions</b> of the promoter activity by T 0901317 without AMPK activators are significantly higher than those with AMPK activators. Furthermore, AMPK activation attenuates induction of endogenous SREBP- 1 c mRNA by T 0901317. These results indicate that AMPK directly inhibits ligand-induced LXR activity in addition to blocking production of endogenous LXR ligands. </p...|$|R

The efficiency of recovery is determined with synthetic RNAs as internal hybridization standards. The method is particularly applicable to the kidney since this organ shows a strong preferential uptake of the label. Rates of synthesis, expressed as a fraction of total RNA synthesis, were measured for the androgen-inducible mRNAs coding for beta-glucuronidase (GUS), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the protein coded by the RP- 2 gene, and the so-called kidney androgen-regulated protein (KAP). Control mRNAs coded for beta-actin, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and major urinary protein. Testosterone markedly increased the synthesis of the androgen-inducible mRNAs, but not the control mRNAs. Induction was not seen in mutant mice lacking functional androgen receptor protein. For GUS, ODC, and RP- 2 mRNAs, the <b>fold</b> <b>induction</b> of synthesis was less than the <b>fold</b> <b>induction</b> of concentration, suggesting that mRNA stabilization also plays {{a part in the}} response to androgen.

Here, we used bioassays based on human leukemic monocyte lymphoma U 937 and human liver hepatocellular carcinoma HepG 2 cell lines to detect the ligand-induced activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARd). Exposure of U 937 cells to the PPARd agonist GW 501516 resulted in a marked increase in mRNA expression of the PPARd target gene Angptl 4 which was quantified by qRTPCR analysis. Exposure ofHepG 2 cells transiently transfected with a PPARd expression plasmid and a PPAR-response element-driven luciferase reporter plasmid to PPARd agonists GW 501516, GW 610742 and L- 165041 resulted in clear dose–response curves. Although the qRT-PCR resulted in higher <b>fold</b> <b>inductions,</b> the luciferase assay with transfected HepG 2 cells is cheaper and quicker and about ten times more sensitive to GW 501516 compared to analysis of Angptl 4 mRNA expression in U 937 cells by qRT-PCR.

A total of 60 earthworms were DNA typed for the cytochrome oxidase I gene to identify A. caliginosa specimens. The genetically typed earthworms were then used to construct a breeding population of A. caliginosa. Citrate coated AgNPs were synthesised and characterised for soil exposure experiments. Earthworms were exposed to 0. 3 mgkg⁻¹ AgNP, 30 mgkg⁻¹ AgNP, 3 mgkg⁻¹ AgNO₃ and 0 mgkg⁻¹ control in 600 g of organic soil. RNA samples and coelomocyte samples were removed from earthworms at 3 time points, 2, 7 and 14 d. Gene expression of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and metallothionein (MT), and also coelomocyte viability and differential coelomocyte cell counts were studied. CAT gene expressions were significant across treatments notably at the 14 d time point.

Here we systematically investigated which parameters affected the <b>fold</b> <b>induction</b> values of luminescence obtained in the bioassay and developed a modified protocol. Our experiments showed that growth and luminescence of V. harveyi BB 170 are strongly influenced by trace elements.

40|$|The {{transition}} from fins to limbs {{was an important}} terrestrial adaptation, but how this crucial evolutionary shift arose developmentally is unknown. Current models focus on the distinct roles of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the signalling molecules that it secretes during limb and fin outgrowth. In contrast to the limb AER, the AER of the fin rapidly transitions into the apical fold {{and in the process}} shuts off AER-derived signals that stimulate proliferation of the precursors of the appendicular skeleton. The differing fates of the AER during fish and tetrapod development have led to the speculation that fin-fold formation was one of the evolutionary hurdles to the AER-dependent expansion of the fin mesenchyme required to generate the increased appendicular structure evident within limbs. Consequently, a heterochronic shift in the AER-to-apical-fold transition has been postulated to be crucial for limb evolution. The ability to test this model has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the mechanisms controlling apical <b>fold</b> <b>induction.</b> Here we show that invasion by cells of a newly identified somite-derived lineage into the AER in zebrafish regulates apical <b>fold</b> <b>induction.</b> Ablation of these cells inhibits apical fold formation, prolongs AER activity and increases the amount of fin bud mesenchyme, suggesting that these cells could provide the timing mechanism proposed in Thorogood's clock model of the fin-to-limb transition.

While the latter has been reported to be induced during both compatible and incompatible interactions between Kavya rice and GM (Rawat et al. 2012), former gene was never examined for its role in this context. Significantly, analysis of another SSH cDNA library developed from Aganni rice with Gm 8 gene, highlighted a list of 27 genes that were distinctly upregulated after GM infestation as compared to uninfested plants but the list did not contain any of the above seven genes (Divya et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|The {{sequence}} {{specificity of}} the recombination activating gene (RAG) complex during V(D) J recombination {{has been well}} studied. RAGs can also act as structure-specific nuclease; however, {{little is known about}} the mechanism of its action. Here, we show that in addition to DNA structure, sequence dictates the pattern and efficiency of RAG cleavage on altered DNA structures. Cytosine nucleotides are preferentially nicked by RAGs when present at single-stranded regions of heteroduplex DNA. Although unpaired thymine nucleotides are also nicked, the efficiency is many <b>fold</b> weaker. <b>Induction</b> of single- or double-strand breaks by RAGs depends on the position of cytosines and whether it is present on one or both of the strands. Interestingly, RAGs are unable to induce breaks when adenine or guanine nucleotides are present at single-strand regions. The nucleotide present immediately next to the bubble sequence could also affect RAG cleavage. Hence, we propose “C(d) C(S) C(S) ” (d, double-stranded; s, single-stranded) as a consensus sequence for RAG-induced breaks at single-/double-strand DNA transitions. Such a consensus sequence motif is useful for explaining RAG cleavage on other types of DNA structures described in the literature. Therefore, the mechanism of RAG cleavage described here could explain facets of chromosomal rearrangements specific to lymphoid tissues leading to genomic instability...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R) of {{neuronal}} {{structures and}} organs {{is associated with}} increased morbidity and mortality due to neuronal cell death. We hypothesized that inhalation of carbon monoxide (CO) after I/R injury (‘postconditioning’) would protect retinal ganglion cells (RGC). Methods: Retinal I/R injury was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8) by increasing ocular pressure (120 mmHg, 1 h). Rats inhaled room air or CO (250 ppm) for 1 h immediately following ischemia or with 1. 5 and 3 h latency. Retinal tissue was harvested to analyze Bcl- 2, Bax, Caspase- 3, HO- 1 expression and phosphorylation of the nuclear transcription factor (NF) -kB, p 38 and ERK- 1 / 2 MAPK. NF-kB activation was determined and inhibition of ERK- 1 / 2 was performed using PD 98059 (2 mg/ kg). Densities of fluorogold prelabeled RGC were analyzed 7 days after injury. Microglia, macrophage and Müller cell activation and proliferation were evaluated by Iba- 1, GFAP and Ki- 67 staining. Results: Inhalation of CO after I/R inhibited Bax and Caspase- 3 expression (Bax: 1. 960. 3 vs. 1. 460. 2, p = 0. 028; caspase- 3 : 2. 060. 2 vs. 1. 560. 1, p = 0. 007; mean 6 S.

CO postconditioning suppressed retinal p 38 phosphorylation (p = 0. 023 at 24 h) and induced the phosphorylation of ERK- 1 / 2 (p, 0. 001 at 24 h). CO postconditioning inhibited the expression of HO- 1. The activation of NF-kB, microglia and Müller cells was potently inhibited by CO as well as immigratio...|$|E
40|$|The {{promoter}} {{from the}} metallothionein gene {{may be a}} useful conditional promoter {{for the construction of}} chimeric genes to be expressed in Drosophila cells in culture. To explore this possibility the responses of the endogenous metallothionein gene and an in vitro constructed chimeric gene containing the metallothionein promoter were examined. Copper and cadmium, when added to the growth medium of Drosophila Schneider's line 2 cells, can produce a 30 - 100 <b>fold</b> <b>induction</b> of metallothionein mRNA levels. The level of induction depends on the amount of copper or cadmium added to the medium and these mRNA levels remain high for at least four days. Copper is less toxic than cadmium and does not induce a typical heat-shock response in the cells. Finally, a chimeric gene containing the metallothionein promoter shows a similar induction when transformed into the cells...|$|E
40|$|Increased plasma {{plasminogen}} activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) {{activity is}} a common finding in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), particularly in young post-infarction patients with hypertriglyceridaemia, and is associated with recurrence of cardiovascular events. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to determine plasma PAI- 1 activity. A striking feature of PAI- 1 is its positive association with the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycéride concentration. In the present study, we {{support the notion that}} a common 4 G/ 5 G polymorphic region in the PAI- 1 promoter is involved in an allele-specific response to triglycérides. The slope of the regression line was steeper among individuals who were homozygous for the 4 G allele as compared to individuals who were homozygous for the 5 G allele. Transfection and DMA binding studies showed that the two proteins that previously been shown to bind to the 4 G and 5 G sequences (Eriksson et al. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sei. USA 92, 1851 - 1855), are not directly involved in an activation of the PAI- 1 promoter mediated by VLDL. However, by transfection assay, VLDL was shown to induce transcription of the PAI- 1 promoter in HUVEC:s. Maximum induction was obtained at 0. 075 mg VLDL/ml culture medium. A promoter construct containing the 4 G allele showed a slightly higher promoter activity in response to VLDL (3. 8 <b>fold</b> <b>induction)</b> than did the promoter containing the 5 G allele (2. 3 <b>fold</b> <b>induction).</b> To localize the VLDL-response element, transfection studies with promoter deletions together with mobility shift assay and footprinting studies were performed. VLDL-induction of PAI- 1 in endothelial cells was found to be caused by transcriptional activation mediated by a response element in the PAI- 1 promoter located downstream and adjacent to the 4 G/ 5 G polymorphic site. Competitive binding of the factors binding to the polymorphic 4 G/ 5 G site and the VLDL induced factor could explain the allele specific response...|$|E

40|$|A cDNA {{encoding}} maize enolase (2 -phospho-D-glycerate hydrolase) {{was isolated}} by functional genetic complementation using an enolase deficient mutant of Escherichia coli. This cDNA, present on pZM 245 contained an {{open reading frame}} encoding a protein of 446 amino acids {{with a high degree}} of similarity to enolase sequences from other organisms. The specific activity of enolase was found to increase to twice its initial levels after 48 hours of anaerobiosis. Northern blot analysis showed a five <b>fold</b> anaerobic <b>induction</b> of enolase mRNA, while the mRNAs of genes not encoding glycolytic enzymes were reduced to undetectable levels. Southern-blot analysis of maize genomic DNA indicated that there is one copy of the cloned enolase gene per haploid genome of maize. Enolase was purified from maize (Zea mays L. inbred B 73) seeds. Purification steps included: ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, Mono Q and Phenyl Superose chromatography. The purified fraction resolved into 55 and 56 kilodalton proteins by SDS-PAGE. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the fusion protein of pZM 245 specifically bound to both purified proteins in all stages of purification. Polyclonal antibodies have also been generated against purified enolase. These antibodies recognize a 56 kilodalton protein in cell extracts of E. coli DF 261 (pZM 245) but not in the cell extracts of E. coli DF 261 (enolase deficient mutant of E. coli). These observations suggest that the 55 kilodalton protein is either a modification of the 56 kilodalton polypeptide, or an enolase isozyme. The plastid fraction of maize lacked both enolase protein and activity. Protein levels of enolase remained unchanged under anaerobic stress. In-vivo labeling of the proteins in maize roots revealed that enolase is not translated efficiently under anaerobic stress. ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that interleukin (IL) - 8 can serve as a biomarker for discrimination of skin sensitizers from nonsensitizers. We established a stable THP- 1 –derived IL- 8 reporter cell line, THP-G 8, which harbors SLO and SLR luciferase genes under the control of IL- 8 and glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase promoters, respectively. After 6 h treatment with chemicals, normalized SLO luciferase activity (nSLO-LA) was calculated by dividing SLO-LA by SLR-LA, and the <b>fold</b> <b>induction</b> of nSLO-LA (FInSLO-LA) was calculated by dividing nSLO-LA of chemically treated cells by that of nontreated cells. The nSLO-LA of THP-G 8 cells increased in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and several sensitizers. The FInSLO-LA in THP-G 8 cells induced by LPS or sensitizers positively correlated with their induction of IL- 8 messenger RNA in THP- 1 cells.

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) is {{inflammatory}} and caused by genetic/environmental factors. Interleukin (IL) 6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in CAD. Selenoprotein S (SelS) {{has recently been}} implicated in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Several IL 6 and SelS polymorphisms are associated with increased CAD risk. The aim of this project {{was to investigate the}} role of polymorphisms of IL 6 (- 6331 T/C,- 597 G/A,- 572 G/C), IL- 6 R (rs 8192284 A/C, Asp 358 Ala) and SelS (- 1500 A/C,+ 3705 G/A,+ 5227 C/T, and + 9000 C/G) on the expression of their mRNA/proteins. This will help us understand the role of these SNPs in risk of CAD/ Myocardial infarction (MI). Flow cytometry was used to assess the surface expression of the macrophage differentiation-specific markers CD 14 and CD 11 c, and IL- 6 R by peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) - derived macrophages. Messenger RNA levels were determined by quantitative PCR (QPCR) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IL- 1 β-stimulated THP- 1 cells and in PBMC-derived macrophages from healthy donors. SelS protein expression was analysed by Western blotting. Cell culture supernatants were assayed for cytokine production by flow cytometry (Cytokine Bead Array). Gene expression (mRNA and protein) was compared to IL 6 and SelS genotype and haplotype. CD 11 c-hi, CD 14 -lo expression on 8 -day cultured PBMCs confirmed their differentiation state as macrophage. The effect of LPS or IL- 1 β at 8 hours on SelS mRNA expression of SelS combined data did not show a significant increase but SelS mRNA was upregulated in LPS-induced +CATG SelS haplotype in PBMC-derived macrophages. +CATG SelS Haplotype did not increase the SelS protein concentration in either LPS or IL- 1 β stimulated PBMC-derived macrophages at 8 hours time point. SelS- 1500 CC genotype was associated with high SelS <b>fold</b> <b>induction</b> in PBMC-derived macrophages treated by LPS. IL 6 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in LPS-stimulated THP- 1. IL- 1 β- and LPS-induced +TGG, +TAG and +CGG haplotypes in PBMC-derived macrophages. IL 6 protein production was also significantly increased in the LPS-induced +TAG and +CGG haplotypes. IL 6 - 597 A allele increased the IL 6 mRNA <b>fold</b> <b>induction.</b> Interestingly, PBMCs from people with the IL 6 TAG haplotype (or – 597 A allele) have higher IL 6 and in contrast, lower SelS at baseline and IL- 1 β. CD 126 (IL- 6 R) expression was very low on PBMC-derived macrophages, suggesting that classical IL 6 signalling may not occur in these PBMCs. In conclusion, SelS mRNA was up-regulated in LPS-induced +CATG SelS haplotype in PBMC-derived macrophages. +CATG SelS Haplotype did not increase the SelS protein concentration in either LPS or IL- 1 β stimulated PBMC-derived macrophages at 8 hours time point. SelS- 1500 CC genotype was associated with high SelS <b>fold</b> <b>induction</b> in PBMC-derived macrophages treated by LPS. The individuals with +TAG IL 6 haplotype (or IL 6 - 597 A allele) show greater induction with pro-inflammatory stimuli.

40|$|Using ionspray tandem mass {{spectrometry}} the glutathione conjugate SMG {{was identified as}} a biliary metabolite of DMF in rats (0. 003 % of a dose of 5 OOmg/kg DMF i. p.). Formation of this metabolite was increased five <b>fold</b> after <b>induction</b> of CYP 2 E 1 by acetone, and was inhibited to 20 % of control values following pretreatment with disulfrram. Generation of SMG from DMF in vivo was shown to exhibit a large kinetic deuterium isotope effect (KWKD= 10. 1 ± 1. 3), which most likely represents the product of 2 discrete isotope effects on N-demethylation and formyl oxidation reactions. The industrial solvent N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and the investigational anti-tumour agent N-methylformamide (NMF) cause liver damage in rodents and humans. The hepatotoxicity of N-alkylformamides is linked to their metabolism to N-alkylcarbamic acid thioesters. The enzymatic details of this pathway were investigated. Hepatocytes isolated from BALB/c mice which had been pretreated with acetone, an inducer of the cytochrome P- 450 isozyme CYP 2 E 1, were incubated with NMF (10 mM). NMF caused extensive toxicity (> 90 %) as determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, compared to cells from untreated animals. Incubation of liver cells with NMF for 6 hrs caused 60 ± 17 % LDH release whilst in the presence of DMSO (10 mM), an alternative substrate for CYP 2 E 1, LDH release was reduced to 20 ± 10 %. The metabolism of NMF to S-(N-methylcarbamoyl) glutathione (SMG) was measured in incubates with liver microsomes from mice, rats or humans. Metabolism of NMF was elevated in microsomes isolated from rats and mice pretreated with acetone, by 339 % and 183 % respectively. Pretreatment of animals with 4 -methylpyrazole induced the metabolism of NMF to 280 % by rat microsomes, but was without effect on NMF metabolism by mouse microsomes. The CYP 2 E 1 inhibitors or alternative substrates diethyl dithiocarbamate (DEDTC), p-nitrophenol (PNP) and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) strongly inhibited the metabolism of NMF in suspensions of rat liver microsomes, at concentrations which did not effect aminopyrine N-demethylation. The rate of metabolism of NMF to SMG in human microsomes correlated (r> 0. 8) with the rate of metabolism of chlorzoxazone, a CYP 2 E 1 probe. A polyclonal antibody against rat CYP 2 E 1 (10 mg/nmol P- 450) inhibited NMF metabolism in microsomes from rats and humans by 75 % and 80 %, respectively. The amount of immunoblottable enzyme in human microsomes, determined using an anti-rat CYP 2 E 1 antibody, correlated with the rate of NMF metabolism (r> 0. 8). Purified rat CYP 2 E 1 catalysed the generation of SMG from NMF. Formation of the DMF metabolite N-hydroxymethyl-N-methylformamide (HMMF) in incubations with rat liver microsomes was elevated by 200 % following pretreatment of animals with acetone. Co-incubation with DEDTC (100 μM) inhibited HMMF generation from DMF by 88 %. Co-incubation of DMF (10 mM) with NMF (1 mM) inhibited the formation of SMG by 95 %. A polyclonal antibody against rat CYP 2 E 1 (10 mg/nmol P- 450) inhibited generation of HMMF in incubates with rat and human liver microsomes by 68. 4 % and 67. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|Introduction and objective: Cytokines may be {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of Peyronie’s disease (PD). In this case, biological drugs, acting on specific cytokines, could be adopted in the pharmacological treatment of the disease.  Materials and methods: Twenty PD patients and 8 patients affected by congenital recurvatum penis (control group) who underwent corporoplasty were enrolled in the study. Histological examination and measurement by Real Time PCR of the expression of the encoding genes for IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 13, TGF-β, TNF-α and IFN-γ were performed on the removed tunica albuginea (TA). For the normalization of data GAPDH (glucerldehyde- 3 fosfatehydrogenase) and GUSB (β-glucuronidase), housekeeping genes were used. The analysis of the data was performed using the comparative method 2 ̆ 028 of ΔCt. The results were reported with the <b>Fold</b> of <b>induction</b> (FOI) method.  Results: The histological exams of TA showed only fibrous tissue without cavernous tissue. The analysis of gene expression of IL- 6, IL- 10, IFN-γ and TGF-β 1 showed in all samples very low levels. The levels were lower in PD patients although the differences were not statistically significant. An exception was represented by TGF-β that showed a higher level in PD patients, although not statistically significant. The expression of IL- 4, IL- 13 and TNF-α was undetectable.  Conclusions: The expressions of cytokines in TA of PD patients compared to those of the controls do not show any significant difference. A bias of our study is that the groups were not age-matched. This is a bias already present in similar experiences and due to the different pathogenesis of the diseases. Cytokines promoting inflammation resulted undetectable and do not seem to {{be involved}} in PD pathogenesis. The higher level of TGF-β, a pro-fibrotic cytokine, detected in PD could explain the presence of fibrotic tissue. Presently, there is no data suggesting a possible role of biological drugs in PD...|$|R

Temperature and induction regime were recognized as very important factors affecting the growth of the bacteria Esche-richia coli, as well as recombinant protein yield and protein folding. Decreasing the growth temperature resulted in hig-her final biomass production and slower bacterial metabolism; therefore the percentage of correctly folded target protein inside the cell was higher.
