5|$|<b>Diamond</b> is the allotrope {{of carbon}} {{in which the}} carbon atoms are {{arranged}} in the specific type of cubic lattice called <b>diamond</b> cubic. <b>Diamond</b> is an optically isotropic crystal that is transparent to opaque. <b>Diamond</b> is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Yet, due to important structural weaknesses, diamond's toughness is only fair to good. The precise tensile strength of <b>diamond</b> is unknown, however strength up to 60GPa has been observed, {{and it could be}} as high as 90–225GPa depending on the crystal orientation. The anisotropy of <b>diamond</b> hardness is carefully considered during <b>diamond</b> cutting. <b>Diamond</b> has a high refractive index (2.417) and moderate dispersion (0.044) properties which give cut diamonds their brilliance. Scientists classify diamonds into four main types according to the nature of crystallographic defects present. Trace impurities substitutionally replacing carbon atoms in a diamond's crystal structure, and in some cases structural defects, are responsible for the wide range of colors seen in <b>diamond.</b> Most diamonds are electrical insulators but extremely efficient thermal conductors. Unlike many other minerals, the specific gravity of <b>diamond</b> crystals (3.52) has rather small variation from <b>diamond</b> to <b>diamond.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early <b>diamond</b> {{identification}} tests {{included a}} scratch test {{relying on the}} superior hardness of <b>diamond.</b> This test is destructive, as a <b>diamond</b> can scratch another <b>diamond,</b> and is rarely used nowadays. Instead, <b>diamond</b> identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity. Electronic thermal probes are widely used in the gemological centers to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a <b>diamond,</b> it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Further {{down the}} supply chain, members of The World Federation of <b>Diamond</b> Bourses (WFDB) {{act as a}} medium for {{wholesale}} <b>diamond</b> exchange, trading both polished and rough diamonds. The WFDB consists of independent <b>diamond</b> bourses in major cutting centers such as Tel Aviv, Antwerp, Johannesburg and other cities across the USA, Europe and Asia. In 2000, the WFDB and The International <b>Diamond</b> Manufacturers Association established the World <b>Diamond</b> Council to prevent the trading of diamonds used to fund war and inhumane acts. WFDB's additional activities include sponsoring the World <b>Diamond</b> Congress every two years, {{as well as the}} establishment of the International <b>Diamond</b> Council (IDC) to oversee <b>diamond</b> grading.|$|E

50|$|Red <b>diamonds</b> {{are famous}} for their {{generally}} small carat sizes. The majority of red <b>diamonds</b> on the market are less than 1 carat in weight. Only 5 red <b>diamonds</b> are known {{to exist in the}} world that are greater than 5 carats in weight, and the largest is only 5.11 carats. Only a handful of red <b>diamonds</b> are discovered on an annual basis throughout the world, and most of them do not exceed 1 carat. Red <b>diamonds</b> are priced per carat as all <b>diamonds</b> are, and their per carat price is 300-400% higher than the per carat prices of the next most expensive <b>diamonds,</b> pink <b>diamonds</b> and blue <b>diamonds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pink <b>diamonds</b> {{have been}} found in Brazil, Russia, Siberia, South Africa, Tanzania and Canada. [...] Pink <b>diamonds</b> were first {{discovered}} in India, in the Kollur mine in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh (which at the time was part of the Golconda kingdom), one of two of the earliest known <b>diamonds</b> are thought to have originated. Concurrently, and throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, pink <b>diamonds</b> were being discovered in the Minas Gerais region of Brazil. [...] Pink <b>diamonds</b> are still occasionally found in the Golconda mine and in Brazil but to date, 80% of the world’s pink <b>diamonds</b> now originate from the Argyle mine in Kimberley, Western Australia. Out of the mine’s 20 million carat annual output, only 0.1% are classified as pink <b>diamonds.</b> After the <b>diamonds</b> are polished, the total carats of pink <b>diamonds</b> becomes smaller still. This makes pink <b>diamonds</b> not only rare but also difficult to obtain, as all interested buyers of pink <b>diamonds</b> around the world are consequently fixed on Argyle pink <b>diamonds.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{technological}} important impurities in semiconductors, including <b>diamond.</b> Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural <b>diamond</b> and in synthetic <b>diamond</b> films. Those films are produced by various chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen (typical hydrogen/carbon ratio >100), under strong bombardment of growing <b>diamond</b> by the plasma ions. As a result, CVD <b>diamond</b> is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In polycrystalline films, much of the hydrogen may be located at the boundaries between <b>diamond</b> 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions. Within the <b>diamond</b> lattice itself, hydrogen-vacancy and hydrogen-nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been identified in negative charge states by electron paramagnetic resonance. In addition, numerous hydrogen-related IR absorption peaks are documented.|$|E
5|$|Imperfections in {{the crystal}} lattice of <b>diamond</b> are common. Such crystallographic defects in <b>diamond</b> {{may be the}} result of lattice {{irregularities}} or extrinsic substitutional or interstitial impurities, introduced during or after the <b>diamond</b> growth. The defects affect the material properties of <b>diamond</b> and determine to which type a <b>diamond</b> is assigned; the most dramatic effects are on the <b>diamond</b> color and electrical conductivity, as explained by the electronic band structure.|$|E
5|$|In early 1964, {{gemologist}} G. Robert (Bob) Crowningshield {{evaluated the}} Nassak <b>Diamond</b> at the Gemological Institute of America gem laboratory {{to produce a}} <b>Diamond</b> Grading Report. In that same year, the Nassak <b>Diamond</b> {{was placed in the}} hands of J. & S.S. DeYoung, a then 100-year-old estate jewellery house located in New York. The Gemological Institute of America <b>Diamond</b> Grading Report that came with the <b>diamond</b> indicated that it was Internally Flawless.|$|E
5|$|<b>Diamonds</b> exhibit fluorescence, that is, they emit {{light of}} various colors and intensities under long-wave {{ultraviolet}} light (365nm): Cape series stones (type Ia) usually fluoresce blue, and these stones may also phosphoresce yellow, a unique property among gemstones. Other possible long-wave fluorescence colors are green (usually in brown stones), yellow, mauve, or red (in type IIb <b>diamonds).</b> In natural <b>diamonds,</b> there is typically {{little if any}} response to short-wave ultraviolet, but {{the reverse is true}} of synthetic <b>diamonds.</b> Some natural type IIb <b>diamonds</b> phosphoresce blue after exposure to short-wave ultraviolet. In natural <b>diamonds,</b> fluorescence under X-rays is generally bluish-white, yellowish or greenish. Some <b>diamonds,</b> particularly Canadian <b>diamonds,</b> show no fluorescence.|$|R
50|$|The Shelby Gem Factory's {{simulated}} <b>diamonds</b> have a Dcolor rating, {{the highest}} rating for <b>diamonds</b> (as {{determined by the}} Gemological Institute of America). Kelley claims their man-made simulated white <b>diamonds</b> are flawless, like expensive real <b>diamonds.</b> In addition to simulated <b>diamonds,</b> the Shelby Gem Factory also manufactures simulated citrine and topaz, along with other birthstone substitutes.|$|R
5000|$|Type IIa <b>diamonds</b> make up 1-2% of {{all natural}} <b>diamonds</b> (1.8% of gem <b>diamonds).</b> These <b>diamonds</b> are almost or entirely devoid of impurities, and {{consequently}} are usually colourless {{and have the}} highest thermal conductivity. They are very transparent in ultraviolet, down to 230 nm. Occasionally, while Type IIa <b>diamonds</b> are being extruded towards {{the surface of the}} Earth, the pressure and tension can cause structural anomalies arising through plastic deformation during the growth of the tetrahedral crystal structure, leading to imperfections. These imperfections can confer a yellow, brown, orange, pink, red, or purple colour to the gem. Type IIa <b>diamonds</b> can have their structural deformations [...] "repaired" [...] via a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) process, removing much or all of the <b>diamond's</b> color. Type IIa <b>diamonds</b> constitute a great percentage of Australian production. Many famous large <b>diamonds,</b> like the Cullinan, Koh-i-Noor, and Lesedi La Rona, are Type IIa. Synthetic <b>diamonds</b> grown using the CVD process typically also belong to this type.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, {{research}} {{started in}} the Soviet Union and the US on the growth of <b>diamond</b> by pyrolysis of hydrocarbon gases at the relatively low temperature of 800°C. This low-pressure process is known as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). William G. Eversole reportedly achieved vapor deposition of <b>diamond</b> over <b>diamond</b> substrate in 1953, {{but it was not}} reported until 1962. <b>Diamond</b> film deposition was independently reproduced by Angus and coworkers in 1968 and by Deryagin and Fedoseev in 1970. Whereas Eversole and Angus used large, expensive, single-crystal diamonds as substrates, Deryagin and Fedoseev succeeded in making <b>diamond</b> films on non-diamond materials (silicon and metals), which led to massive research on inexpensive <b>diamond</b> coatings in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Most {{industrial}} applications of synthetic <b>diamond</b> {{have long been}} associated with their hardness; this property makes <b>diamond</b> the ideal material for machine tools and cutting tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, <b>diamond</b> {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common {{industrial applications}} of this ability include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of <b>diamond</b> powder as an abrasive. These are by far the largest industrial applications of synthetic <b>diamond.</b> While natural <b>diamond</b> is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT <b>diamond</b> is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. <b>Diamond</b> is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on <b>diamond</b> tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic <b>diamond</b> has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic <b>diamond</b> into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic <b>diamond</b> with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic <b>diamond</b> for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD <b>diamond.</b> High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from <b>diamond</b> have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of <b>diamond</b> (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of <b>diamond,</b> those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E

25|$|Most of Argyle's gem-quality {{production}} is in brown <b>diamonds.</b> These <b>diamonds</b> are usually difficult to sell, although Rio Tinto has seen {{some success in}} a decade-long marketing campaign to promote brown <b>diamonds</b> as champagne and cognac toned. In contrast, the company has no problems selling <b>diamonds</b> in pink, purple, and red tones, which are very rare and in high demand, therefore commanding premium prices. The pink <b>diamonds</b> are processed and sold as polished <b>diamonds</b> by a specialised team based in Perth to customers worldwide.|$|R
5|$|The hardest natural <b>diamonds</b> mostly {{originate}} from the Copeton and Bingara fields {{located in the}} New England area in New South Wales, Australia. These <b>diamonds</b> are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other <b>diamonds.</b> Their hardness {{is associated with the}} crystal growth form, which is single-stage crystal growth. Most other <b>diamonds</b> show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect planes in the crystal lattice, all of which affect their hardness. It is possible to treat regular <b>diamonds</b> under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce <b>diamonds</b> that are harder than the <b>diamonds</b> used in hardness gauges.|$|R
5|$|The Nassak <b>Diamond</b> {{originated}} in the 15th century in India. Although {{the date of the}} original cutting is unknown, the original cutting was performed in India and had sacrificed everything to size while giving the <b>diamond</b> a form and appearance {{similar to that of the}} Koh-i-Noor <b>diamond.</b> From at least 1500 to 1817, the Nassak <b>Diamond</b> adorned the Shivalinga in the Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple, near Nashik (Nassak), India on the upper Godavari River. As priests worshiped Shiva, the <b>diamond</b> eventually acquired its name from its long-term proximity to Nashik.|$|E
5|$|The Nassak <b>Diamond</b> quickly resurfaced in the {{possession}} of Baji Rao II the last independent Indian Peshwa Prince, who handed over the <b>diamond</b> to an English colonel named J. Briggs. In turn, Briggs delivered the <b>diamond</b> to Francis Rawdon-Hastings, the 1st Marquess of Hastings who had conducted the military operations against the Peshwa. Rawdon-Hastings delivered the <b>diamond</b> to the East India Company as part of the spoils of the Maratha war. The East India Company then sent the Nassak <b>Diamond</b> to England, to be sold on the London <b>diamond</b> market in 1818.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{impurity}} in <b>diamond</b> is nitrogen, which can comprise up to 1% of a <b>diamond</b> by mass. Previously, all lattice defects in <b>diamond</b> {{were thought to}} be the result of structural anomalies; later research revealed nitrogen to be present in most diamonds and in many different configurations. Most nitrogen enters the <b>diamond</b> lattice as a single atom (i.e. nitrogen-containing molecules dissociate before incorporation), however, molecular nitrogen incorporates into <b>diamond</b> as well.|$|E
40|$|During {{their growth}} <b>diamonds</b> may trap micron-scale {{inclusions}} of the fluids {{from which they}} grew, and these “time capsules” provide insights into the metasomatic processes that have modified the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. LAM-ICPMS analysis of trace elements in > 500 fibrous and monocrystalline <b>diamonds</b> worldwide {{has been used to}} understand the nature of these fluids. Analyses of fibrous <b>diamonds</b> define two general types of pattern, a “fibrous-high” (FH) one with high contents of LREE, Ba and K, and a “fibrous-low” (FL) pattern characterized by depletion in LREE/MREE, Ba and K, negative anomalies in Sr and Y, and subchondritic Zr/Hf and Nb/Ta. Both types may be found in fibrous <b>diamonds</b> from single deposits, and in three Yakutian pipes some <b>diamonds</b> show abrupt transitions from inclusion-rich cores with FH patterns to clearer rims with FL patterns. Most monocrystalline <b>diamonds</b> show FL-type patterns, but some have patterns that resemble those of FH fibrous <b>diamonds.</b> Peridotitic and eclogitic monocrystalline <b>diamonds</b> may show either patterns with relatively flat REE, or patterns with more strongly depleted LREE. Kimberlites that contain peridotitic <b>diamonds</b> with “high” patterns also contain eclogitic <b>diamonds</b> with “high” patterns. Strong similarities in the patterns of these two groups of <b>diamonds</b> may suggest high fluid/rock ratios. Many <b>diamonds</b> of the “superdeep” paragenesis have trace-element patterns similar to those of other monocrystalline <b>diamonds.</b> This may be evidence that the trace-element compositions of deep-seated fluids are generally similar to those that form <b>diamonds</b> in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. The element fractionations observed between the FH and FL patterns are consistent with the immiscible separation of a silicic fluid from a carbonatite–silicate fluid, leaving a residual carbonatitic fluid strongly enriched in LREE, Ba and alkalies. This model would suggest that most monocrystalline <b>diamonds</b> crystallized from the more silicic fraction. Comparison with studies of single fluid inclusions in fibrous <b>diamonds</b> suggests that the FH patterns reflect trapped inclusions of high-Mg and low-Mg carbonatitic high-density fluids. In terms of the rock-forming elements, the fluids that precipitated the rims of some fibrous <b>diamonds</b> (FL pattern) and most monocrystalline <b>diamonds</b> are broadly similar to some hydro-silicic high-density fluids found in fibrous <b>diamonds.</b> However, there are still significant differences between the trace-element patterns of most monocrystalline <b>diamonds</b> and known high-density fluids, and further research is required to understand the formation and growth of these <b>diamonds.</b> 25 page(s...|$|R
