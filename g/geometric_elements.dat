5|$|Increasingly tough {{economic}} times in the early 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new construction and concentrate on attracting customers to existing theaters. Only one more cinema, the 2,168-seat Alameda Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California would ever be built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, the eclectic Alameda's exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides {{on either side of}} Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism. In the interest of economy, the Alameda's floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and <b>geometric</b> <b>elements</b> were borrowed from the Paramount.|$|E

40|$|Road Safety Audits {{strongly}} {{depend on}} the operative conditions roads are exposed to, {{in terms of both}} influence of local environmental parameters (light, visibility, troubling elements, etc.) and vehicle dynamics related to driver behaviour. This is particularly important in the case of circular curves, where the influence of the “human” factor becomes highly determinant in the road safety assessment: both the choice of trajectory and transit speed along the <b>geometric</b> <b>element</b> unavoidably rebound on vehicle behaviour and, with this, on the tyre-road friction characteristics. These aspects are reflected in Road Safety Audit procedures, mainly through the integration of the “human” factor in road safety assessment. The border-line conditions to be used in safety audits must reflect the real road geometry covered by drivers (free geometry or free trajectories), the transit speed accepted by drivers (in terms of S 85) and the real dynamic conditions undercurrent between tyres and road pavement. Road Safety Audits conducted considering the “human” factor will show a different safety degree between the operative conditions and the theoretical ones forecast for the <b>geometric</b> <b>element,</b> especially in terms of required skid resistance. The adoption of higher transit speeds than the theoretical ones, united with the choice of trajectories not coinciding with the road axis, unavoidably involves higher friction properties than those foreseen by designers. In particular, comparing required friction and offered friction in both cases (operative and theoretical), a different safety coefficient can be found for the considered <b>geometric</b> <b>element.</b> This paper discusses the importance of the interaction among the three factors “driver-vehicle-road” in Road Safety Audits in the case of circular curves...|$|R
