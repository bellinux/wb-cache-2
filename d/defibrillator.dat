5|$|Use of an {{automated}} external <b>defibrillator</b> on {{a patient in}} a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra should be removed by the first responder before the AED is applied. In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a <b>defibrillator</b> on a patient who is using an underwire bra, and concluded that while it is possible, {{it is not likely}} unless the metal underwire is exposed and paddles of the <b>defibrillator</b> are very close to it.|$|E
5|$|First {{responder}} – A {{person who}} arrives {{first at the}} scene of an incident, and whose job is to provide early critical care such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or using an automated external <b>defibrillator</b> (AED). First responders may be dispatched by the ambulance service, may be passers-by, or may be dispatched to the scene from other agencies, such as the police or fire departments.|$|E
5|$|When Bågenholm {{was pulled}} out of the water, her pupils were dilated, her blood was not circulating, and she was not breathing. Falkenberg and Næsheim, both doctors, began giving her {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR). The rescue helicopter soon arrived and Bågenholm was brought to the Tromsø University Hospital in an hour. The helicopter emergency team continued to give her CPR during the flight, and she was ventilated with oxygen. She was also treated with a <b>defibrillator,</b> but to no effect.|$|E

2500|$|John M. Crewdson of the Chicago Tribune wrote a 1996 article proposing the {{installment}} of <b>defibrillators</b> on American airliners. Crewdson argued {{that based on}} his research and analysis, [...] "Medical kits and <b>defibrillators</b> would be economically justified if they saved just 3 lives each year." [...] Soon after the article's publication, airlines began installing <b>defibrillators</b> on planes, and the devices began {{to show up in}} airports and other public spaces. Ten years after installing <b>defibrillators,</b> American Airlines reported that 80 lives had been saved by the machines.|$|R

5|$|Bond rapidly rebuilds his {{position}} {{before the next}} break. Le Chiffre's girlfriend, Valenka, spikes Bond's martini with poison. Bond vomits and retreats to his Aston Martin to inject himself with an antidote. MI6 instructs him to use the <b>defibrillator,</b> but a wire is disconnected; Vesper saves Bond by reconnecting the wire. Bond returns to the game just as Leiter loses his last hand to Le Chiffre. The tournament culminates in a $115-million hand in which the remaining players, including Bond and Le Chiffre, go all in. Le Chiffre trumps the other players, but Bond wins with a straight flush.|$|E
5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an {{allergic}} reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a <b>defibrillator.</b>|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} Isabella, Clear {{and the other}} realize {{that all of them}} are still alive due to the Flight 180 {{survivors}} having gotten off the plane. While driving to the hospital, they are involved in a car accident that leaves Eugene needing medical help and eventually leads to the deaths of Kat and Rory. Following their deaths, Clear, Kimberly and Thomas go to the hospital to save Isabella. While they do succeed in finding her in time and ensuring her infant survives, Kimberly has another premonition that reveals to her Isabella was never meant to die in the pileup, meaning they're still in danger. Understanding the situation, Clear tries to find Eugene's room. Finding him contained by an oxygenated room, she opens the door, subsequently loosening the plug of Eugene's <b>defibrillator,</b> creating a spark that incinerates Eugene's room, burning her and Eugene.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to providing and installing these <b>defibrillators</b> completely free of charge, Dipsalut takes full responsibility for managing the devices. This includes providing information, controlling, monitoring and maintaining the network of <b>defibrillators.</b> The maintenance includes annual inspections, interior and exterior cleaning of the storage case, responding to incidents, replacing used or broken <b>defibrillators</b> and changing the batteries and electrodes when necessary, always within a maximum period of 24 hours.|$|R
40|$|The modern {{generation}} of transthoracic <b>defibrillators</b> now employ impedance compensated biphasic waveforms. These new devices {{are superior to}} those with monophasic waveforms and practice is currently switching to biphasic <b>defibrillators</b> {{for the treatment of}} both ventricular and atrial fibrillation. However, there is no universal guideline for the use of biphasic <b>defibrillators</b> in direct current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. This article reviews the use of biphasic defibrillation waveforms for transthoracic cardioversion of atrial fibrillation...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of devices}} that deliver shock therapy for atrial {{fibrillation}} is still debated. Following technical improvements in catheter-based atrial defibrillation, implantable devices have become available {{either in the}} form of stand-alone atrial <b>defibrillators</b> or {{in the form of}} dual <b>defibrillators.</b> Although preliminary results do not support their use as a single, unique treatment for atrial fibrillation patients, in combination with drugs, pacing or other treatments such as ablation, atrial <b>defibrillators</b> should help appropriately selected groups of patients...|$|R
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or <b>defibrillator</b> may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
5|$|The inquest {{was opened}} and adjourned in April 2009. The City of London coroner, Paul Matthews, {{expressed}} concern about whether he had appropriate expertise, and Peter Thornton QC, who specializes in protest law, took over. The inquest opened on 28 March 2011 before a jury. The court heard from Kevin Channer, a cardiologist at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, who analysed electrocardiogram (ECG) data from the <b>defibrillator</b> paramedics had used on Tomlinson. He said the readings were inconsistent with an arrhythmic heart attack, but consistent with death from internal bleeding. Pathologist Nat Carey concurred regarding the cause of death. Graeme Alexander, a hepatologist, said that in his opinion Tomlinson had died of internal bleeding {{as a result of}} trauma to the liver after the fall. He told the court that Tomlinson had been suffering from serious liver disease, which would have made him susceptible to collapse from internal bleeding.|$|E
5|$|While {{opening up}} the attic door, Kyle is seized by an {{attacker}} and killed. They {{find out that the}} killer is Billy Lenz's sister Agnes, who has also set up the corpses of the sorority sisters around a Christmas tree. After Leigh falls through the floor of the attic, Kelli is attacked by both Agnes and Billy. While fighting, the Christmas tree catches fire while she and Agnes fall down into one of the holes in the wall. Managing to escape with Leigh's help, they set the house on fire and reach the hospital. At the hospital, Agnes, who had survived the fire, kills Leigh but Kelli manages to kill her using a <b>defibrillator.</b> When Billy chases her to the stairs, Kelli manages to knock him over, impaling him on the finial of a Christmas tree and finally killing him. She is last seen staring at Billy's corpse.|$|E

50|$|Trained health {{professionals}} have more limited use for AEDs than manual external <b>defibrillators.</b> Recent {{studies show that}} AEDs does not improve outcome in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests. AEDs have set voltages and does not allow the operator to vary voltage according need. AEDs may also delay delivery of effective CPR. For diagnosis of rhythm, AEDs often require the stopping of chest compressions and rescue breathing. For these reasons, certain bodies, such as the European Resuscitation Council, recommend using manual external <b>defibrillators</b> over AEDs if manual external <b>defibrillators</b> are readily available.|$|R
5|$|NYU has 470,000 living alumni as of 2015. At least 37 Nobel Prize {{winners are}} {{affiliated}} with NYU. NYU {{is associated with}} a great number of important inventions and discoveries. For example, cardiac <b>defibrillator</b> and artificial cardiac pacemaker (Barouh Berkovits), closed-chest cardiac <b>defibrillator</b> (William B.

Driven mad, the boss places the baby in a deep freeze room next to Max's corpse so the baby can be with his son, {{prompting}} Thongs and Octopus {{to fight for the}} baby. The two end up trapped in the room with two minions, but are saved when Inspector Mok arrives with the Landlord, who swiftly cracks the lock to the room. Thongs and Octopus run to the garage with the comatose baby, where Thongs attempts to revive him with a makeshift <b>defibrillator</b> powered by a car battery from a Pagani Zonda. Despite his efforts, the baby does not come to and is driven off in an ambulance, where his heart is found to be beating weakly. Imprisoned for kidnapping, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord volunteer for a mock capital punishment demonstration during an open day, using the opportunity to apologise to their loved ones. After the demonstration, Inspector Mok informs the three that their sentences have been further reduced by the Department of Justice. Thongs, Octopus, and the Landlord then see the baby alive and well with his parents. As a token of appreciation for saving the baby's life, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord are offered jobs by the Lee family as a bodyguard, chauffeur and head of security respectively.|$|E
