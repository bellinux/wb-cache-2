A <b>draft</b> <b>control</b> mechanism is often present in modern three-point hitch systems. The draft of the implement, the amount of force it is taking to pull the implement, is sensed on the lower arms and the hydraulic system automatically raises the arms slightly when the draft increases and lowers the arms when the draft decreases.|$|E

5000|$|Official {{production}} of the 8N tractor began in July 1947. Equipped with a 4-speed transmission, this model was destined to become the top-selling individual tractor of all time in North America. The most noticeable differences between the 8N and its predecessors was {{the inclusion of a}} 4-speed transmission instead of a 3-speed in the 9N and 2N, and an increase in both PTO and drawbar horsepower. The other big change on the 8N was the addition of a 'Position-control' setting for the hydraulics. This change was made partially to improve flexibility in varying soil conditions, and partially to evade Harry Ferguson's patent on the hydraulic system. The original automatic <b>draft</b> <b>control</b> on the Ferguson system would allow the depth of the implement to vary based on soil conditions, which did not work well for some implements. The new Position Control setting bypassed the <b>draft</b> <b>control</b> and allowed the implement to remain at a consistent position relative to the position of the Touch Control lever. A continued drawback to this series of tractor, was the lack of a [...] "live" [...] PTO. Without a live PTO certain implements such as brush cutters which store inertial energy could send that back into the transmission. This would cause the tractor to surge forward if the clutch were disengaged. This was addressed {{with the advent of the}} PTO overrunning coupler.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, a {{differential}} lock, an {{hour meter}} and a padded seat were all added. During the same year, a second model (MK2) was released, featuring {{a more advanced}} hydraulic system. This allowed position control, based on the top link <b>draft</b> <b>control,</b> as well as mixing control. The Mk2 also saw some cost-cutting measures, such as the Bosch fuel injection being replaced by a lower performance Simms unit, as well as Lucas electrics replacing the Bosch. The 310D engine {{was replaced by a}} cheaper 310A unit. The most prominent exterior differences between the MK1 and MK2 are a spraying device, and a lifting device connected to the hand lever.|$|E
5000|$|The first tractor of {{the series}} was the 9N, the first tractor to have both three-point hitch and a rear power {{take-off}} (PTO). The 9N was first demonstrated in Dearborn, Michigan on June 29, 1939. Its model name reflected a model-naming system using the last digit of the year of introduction and a letter for product type, with [...] "N" [...] for tractors (hence 9N). Like the Farmall, {{it was designed to}} be a general-purpose row-crop tractor for use on smaller farms. An extremely simple tractor, the 9N was fitted with the Ferguson system three-point hitch, a three-speed transmission, and featured footpegs instead of running boards. The 9N's relatively tall and wide-spaced front wheel design resulted in somewhat sluggish steering and reduced maneuverability compared to competing machines such as John Deere's Models A and B, and the Farmall [...] "Letter series". The 9N had variable front track, a valuable feature for row-crop cultivation, via front half-axles that could be slid in and out and pinned in place. It also had variable rear track via the reversible offset of the rear wheel design (flipping the rear wheels around 180°, moving the formerly inboard side to the outboard side, widened the rear track). Uniquely, the exhaust was routed underneath the tractor, much like an automobile. All 9N tractors were painted dark grey. This tractor has a rear PTO, which could be used to drive three-point or towed implements. The Ferguson hitch was designed to solve some of the problems found in the earlier Fordson tractors, such as flipping over if the plow hit an obstruction. The upper link also would adjust the hydraulic lift to use the drag of the plow to improve traction. This was known as <b>draft</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Harry Ferguson {{patented}} the three-point linkage {{for agricultural}} tractors in Britain in 1926. He {{had long been}} a champion {{of the importance of}} rigid attachment of the plough to the tractor. The idea did not originate with him, but he led its popularization over many years of development, explaining, and selling. During the decade of 1916 to 1926 he developed his ideas through various iterations, duplex and triplex, mechanical and hydraulic, to arrive at the patented form. During the next decade, he continued explaining and selling his hitches and implements and even produced his own model of tractor (contract-manufactured by David Brown Ltd.). The particular geometry of the linkage that attached the plough to the tractor enabled forces generated by the plough to be applied to the rear wheels of the tractor. This redirected the plough's resistance into downward force on the drive wheels, which enabled Ferguson's tractor to be much lighter and more manoeuvrable than earlier models of farm tractor with equivalent tractive force and traction. As a result his tractor could operate on soft ground and caused less compacting damage to the soil in comparison with other tractors of the time, and it could produce given amounts of work with less time and fuel. The hydraulically operated and controlled three-point hitch used the draft of the mounted tool to moderate the depth of the tool and therefore the load on the tractor (automatic depth control or <b>draft</b> <b>control).</b> In addition, the three-point hitch would prevent the tractor from flipping backwards on the drive wheels if the implement being dragged were to hit a rock or other immovable obstruction. Ferguson and his colleagues developed several innovations to this device (e.g., the hydraulic lift and depth control) which made the system workable, effective, and desirable. In 1938, after almost two decades of trying to sell Henry Ford on using Ferguson's system on tractors mass-produced by Ford, Ferguson finally convinced Ford. The American mass-market debut was via the Ford-Ferguson 9N in 1939.|$|E

40|$|International {{literature}} suggests that corporate influence is evident when governments attempt to regulate products implicated in non-communicable disease, such as tobacco, asbestos, pollution, and foods, such as trans-fat, salt and sugar. These lifestyle diseases are aptly referred to as 'industrial epidemic', since industries profit from the public's continued consumption of such products. Of these 'industrial epidemics', alcohol is {{a major contributor to}} the health burden in South Africa. In the year 2000, 7. 1 % of all deaths and 7 % of total disability-adjusted life years have been ascribed to alcohol-related harm in the country. The tangible and intangible costs of alcohol-related harm amount to 10 - 12 % of South Africa's 2009 Gross Domestic Product. Literature suggests that limiting alcohol use could prevent the incidence of violence, injury, risky sexual behaviours, several forms of cancer, and neuropsychiatric and physical diseases. The World Health Organisation (WHO) released two documents, The Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol (2010 b) and The Global Status Report on Non-communicable Diseases (2010 a), detailing the negative effects of alcohol consumption for societies. Both documents recommend that decreasing alcohol consumption through banning of alcohol advertising would have significant public health benefits, although an integrated strategy is necessary to mitigate alcohol abuse including taxation, increasing prices, limiting places of sales and increasing education on the topic. In response, the South African government proposed a draft regulation aimed at restricting alcohol advertising as an evidence-based upstream intervention. The <b>draft</b> <b>Control</b> of Marketing of Alcoholic Beverages Bill {{is in the process of}} undergoing impact assessments to determine the impact this regulation may have on South African society. Literature suggests that industry employs various political strategies to avoid such regulation. However, little is known about the strategies the alcohol industry potentially uses to influence policy development in South Africa. There is a lack of knowledge on the current strategies used by the alcohol industry to influence policy; the <b>draft</b> <b>Control</b> of Marketing of Alcoholic Beverage Bill is a case in point. This study sought to explore the complex policy formulation process in South Africa, using the <b>draft</b> <b>Control</b> of Marketing of Alcoholic Beverages Bill as a tracer case and focused on the alcohol industry, as a central actor, to understand how it - together with other actors - may influence this process. A qualitative case study approach was used, which included stakeholder mapping, 10 in-depth interviews and review of approximately 240 documents. This study makes use of two conceptual frameworks. The first framework, Berlan et al. (2014) is used to understand policy formulation as a process with multiple facets. The second framework, Roberts et al. (2004), provides four typologies of political strategies that health reformers/advocates/lobbyists employ to influence the policy process. A thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Key themes identified were: (1) Competing and shared values - different stakeholders promote conflicting ideals for policymaking; (2) Inter-department jostling - different government departments seek to protect their own interests, hindering policy development; (3) Stakeholder consultation in democratic policymaking – policy formulation requires consultation even with those opposed to regulation; (4) Battle for evidence – industry sought to assemble evidence to use as 'ammunition' in opposition to the ban. It was concluded that networks of actors with financial interest use diverse strategies to influence policy formulation processes to contest proposed regulation. Using the policy formulation process of the <b>draft</b> <b>Control</b> of Marketing of Alcoholic Beverages Bill as a tracer case, this research is a critical enquiry into how the for-profit industry affects public health interests in South Africa; such a critical enquiry could also be applied to other non-communicable diseases. Research suggests that industries have more difficulty in pushing their agenda when policymakers are well informed, are aware of the evidence-based practice and are not motivated by economic arguments alone. There is also a lack of research that focuses on health policy analysis in low and middle-income countries, and there is a lack of research focusing on the policy formulation process in particular. Therefore, this research aims to fill a gap in addressing a lack of research on health policy analysis in the context of a middleincome country. The implications of the study are that measures to insulate policy development are needed to prevent industry influence potentially undermining public health goals, such as: government to moderate certain consultations with industry; industry to declare conflict of interest; guidelines for bureaucrats and policymakers to advise on whose evidence to consider; and guidelines for bureaucrats and policymakers to assess quality of evidence...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the slip}} {{indicator}} {{was designed and}} constructed {{for the purpose of}} monitoring the slippage of the tractor powered wheel during the operation of plowing and of applying the output signal to control the draft force acting on the plow. In the previous work conducted by one of the authors, two AC generators were attached to front and rear wheels of the tractor to detect their rotational speed, and the slippage was calculated from the output voltage signal proportional to the rotational speed of the wheels. In the use of this type of slip sensor, some difficulty was found in adjusting and resetting the voltage corresponding to the zero slippage, depending on the running gear prior to the operation. A different type of slip sensor was therefore designed and constructed to remedy this disadvantage. The photo-electric type pulse generator was used to detect the rotational speed of both front and rear wheels through the mechanical amplification by use of gears to obtain the required numbers of pulses per unit rotation of the wheel. The number of pulses generated from the wheels was converted to the frequency and then to the voltage. This output voltage was compared to the set voltage which corresponds to the set slippage. In turn this is properly determined from the relationship between the slippage and the pulling froce expressing the different shape due to the soil condition and running device. The difference between the output voltage and set voltage was amlified. Then the relay connected to the hydraulic directional valve to control lifting and lowering the implement mounted on the three point linkage moved on off, depending on the voltage difference. The slippage calculated from the difference indicated through the monitoring device mounted on the platform located in front of operator's seat. This monitoring device worked quite satisfactorily to help the operator in knowing how much draft force was acting on the implement through the indicated value of the slippage. The field test was done to validate the accurate response and action of the implement under slip <b>draft</b> <b>control</b> in two kinds of fields, sandy and paddy, after harvesting of rice. Through the satisfactory result of the field experiments, it was observed that this type of slip <b>draft</b> <b>control</b> system described here would be possible to apply to a commercial tractor without much modification and improvements.
