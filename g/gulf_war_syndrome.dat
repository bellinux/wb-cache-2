5|$|The major {{application}} of uranium {{in the military}} sector is in high-density penetrators. This ammunition consists of depleted uranium (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements, such as titanium or molybdenum. At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates. The use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after {{the use of such}} munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil (see <b>Gulf</b> <b>War</b> <b>Syndrome).</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{wars that}} ended the twentieth century and {{launched}} the twenty-first brought a mysterious, unexpected side effect. Some postwar pathologies, such as soldiers' malformed offspring and the illnesses of peacekeepers deployed to former battlefields, raise crucial questions. Other than {{coming up with a}} name for the collection of symptoms experienced by veterans of the first two <b>Gulf</b> <b>Wars</b> and the war in the Balkans, doctors have little understanding of <b>Gulf</b> <b>War</b> <b>syndrome's</b> causes. The solution to these medical mysteries may be found in a new word: nanopathology. Dust at the nanoscale can elude physiological barriers and easily enter the bloodstream, where it is very likely to reach all internal organs and tissues. Nano-war is a real risk that is already with us, even if governments seem to be unaware of it. The obvious (but overly simplistic) solution is to stop making war. The second best solution is to stop pretending nanodust either doesn't exist or is harmless...|$|R

His disappointments included failure to obtain Russian ratification of the START II treaty; slowness in securing increases in the budget for weapon systems modernization; and the faulty perceptions of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>War</b> illness <b>syndrome</b> held {{by some of the}} media and much of the public.
