5|$|<b>Items</b> {{from the}} hoard {{have been on}} display almost {{continuously}} since the treasure was received at the British Museum. Some <b>items</b> were displayed at the Museum as early as September 1993 in response to public interest. Much of the hoard was exhibited at Ipswich Museum in 1994–1995. From 1997, the most important <b>items</b> went on permanent display at the British Museum {{in a new and}} enlarged Roman Britain gallery (Room 49), alongside the roughly contemporary Thetford Hoard, and adjacent to the Mildenhall Treasure, which contains large silver vessels of types that are absent from the Hoxne Hoard. Some <b>items</b> from the Hoxne Hoard were included in Treasure: Finding Our Past, a touring exhibition that was shown in five cities in England and Wales in 2003. A perspex reconstruction of the chest and inner boxes in which it was deposited was created for this tour, showing the arrangement of the different types of <b>items</b> with sample <b>items</b> inside. It is now part of the permanent display in London, along with other <b>items</b> laid out more traditionally.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between <b>item</b> level response time and (1) <b>item</b> discrimination, (2) <b>item</b> difficulty, (3) word count, (4) <b>item</b> type, and (5) whether a figure is included in an <b>item.</b> Data are from the Graduate Management Admission Test, which is currently offered only as a computerized adaptive test. Analyses revealed significant differences in response time between the five <b>item</b> types: problem solving, data sufficiency, sentence correction, critical reasoning, and reading comprehension. For this reason, the planned pairwise and complex analyses were run within each <b>item</b> type. Pairwise curvilinear regression analyses explored {{the relationship between}} response time and <b>item</b> discrimination, <b>item</b> difficulty, and word count. <b>Item</b> difficulty significantly contributed {{to the prediction of}} response time for each <b>item</b> type; two of the relationships were significantly quadratic. <b>Item</b> discrimination significantly contributed to the prediction of response time for only two of the <b>item</b> types; one revealed a quadratic relationship and the other a cubic relationship. Word count had significant linear relationship with response time for all the <b>item</b> types except reading comprehension, for which there was no significant relationship. Multiple regression analyses using word count, <b>item</b> difficulty, and <b>item</b> discrimination predicted between 35. 4 % and 71. 4 % of the variability in <b>item</b> response time across <b>item</b> types. The results suggest that response time research should consider the type of <b>item</b> that is being administered and continue to explore curvilinear relationships between response time and its predictor variables. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to find a {{relationship}} formula between <b>item</b> exposure parameters and <b>item</b> parameters in computerized adaptive tests (CATs) by using genetic programming (GP), which is a biologically inspired artificial intelligence technique. Based on the relationship formula, <b>item</b> exposure parameters for new parallel <b>item</b> pools can be predicted without conducting any tedious iterative simulations. Randomized <b>item</b> selection (e. g., McBride & Martin, 1983) and conditioned <b>item</b> selection (e. g., Sympson and Hetter, 1985) are main approaches used to avoid <b>item</b> overexposure in CATs. Although the conditioned <b>item</b> selection performs better than the randomized <b>item</b> selection on controlling <b>item</b> exposure, finding stabilized <b>item</b> exposure parameters through iterative simulation for the conditioned <b>item</b> selection is very time consuming. Furthermore, the tedious iterative simulations need to be re-conducted whenever there are changes in CAT settings or the examinee population of interest. Since <b>item</b> pools are changed much more often than the other CAT setting when CATs are administered in practice, it would be very useful if the relationship between <b>item</b> exposur...|$|R

Each spell is learned from a different wise man in one of the eight towns within Hyrule. Link often has to complete side-quests, such as retrieving lost <b>items,</b> before they will teach him their spells. Some spells and <b>items</b> are necessary for advancing beyond certain points in the game. Also, the Life spell becomes the main means of recovering health during action scenes, since healing Fairies are only found in rare fixed spots, and only appear randomly as overworld encounters.|$|E
