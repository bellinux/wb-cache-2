50|$|There {{are several}} types of first aid (and <b>first</b> <b>aider)</b> which require {{specific}} additional training. These are usually undertaken to fulfill {{the demands of the}} work or activity undertaken.|$|E
50|$|St John {{provides}} volunteer <b>First</b> <b>Aiders,</b> <b>First</b> Responders, Advanced Responders and Health Care Professionals {{to provide}} medical services at small community events from school fates and sports days, corporate events and large public {{events such as}} ANZAC day services and New Year's Eve celebrations.|$|R
50|$|Choking can {{be treated}} {{with a number of}} {{different}} procedures, with both basic techniques available for <b>first</b> <b>aiders</b> and more advanced techniques available for health professionals.|$|R
5000|$|Medical {{emergency}} where <b>first</b> <b>aiders</b> {{are called}} to attend an unconscious person and after checking their airways and general condition, put them into a recover position whilst awaiting the paramedic.|$|R
50|$|The airway {{can also}} become blocked through a foreign object {{becoming}} {{lodged in the}} pharynx or larynx, commonly called choking. The <b>first</b> <b>aider</b> will be taught {{to deal with this}} through a combination of ‘back slaps’ and ‘abdominal thrusts’.|$|E

5000|$|Youth MHFA, {{a two-day}} course which qualifies a {{participant}} {{to become a}} Youth Mental Health <b>First</b> <b>Aider.</b> This course is designed {{for those who are}} working, living or interacting with young people. It was first launched in England in 2010 and revised and re-launched in October 2013.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to providing volunteer <b>first</b> <b>aiders</b> for events, where necessary St John Ambulance can provide paramedics, doctors, nurses and cycle responders, as well as mobile treatment centres, ambulances and other medical provision.|$|R
50|$|The MSA circuit licence {{requires}} {{a minimum of}} two doctors and two rescue units for a race meeting. Most meetings are operated with three rescue units plus a medical car, along with ambulances and <b>first</b> <b>aiders.</b>|$|R
50|$|SJAM runs {{first aid}} courses for {{external}} individuals and organisations {{in return for}} a modest fee. SJAM has assisted many commercial establishments in training their employees as <b>first</b> <b>aiders</b> based on the popular First Aid at Work syllabus.|$|R
5000|$|A cycle {{responder}} is a medically trained responder, such as {{a paramedic}} or <b>first</b> <b>aider</b> that uses a bicycle {{to respond to a}} medical emergency. They are used by professional ambulance services to respond to emergency calls and also by private and voluntary providers of medical cover at events.|$|E

5000|$|<b>First</b> <b>aider,</b> {{a person}} who is {{specifically}} trained to give initial care or treatment to a casualty on scene before more advanced personnel arrives. Organizations such as St. John Ambulance, St. Andrew's Ambulance Association and the British Red Cross have many trained volunteer first aiders who are often incorrectly referred to as paramedics.|$|E

50|$|The Voluntary Service Detachments were offshoots of the Australian Red Cross Society's South Australian and Western Australian {{divisions}} formed {{shortly before}} the outbreak of World War II.

50|$|If {{the patient}} was breathing, a <b>first</b> <b>aider</b> would {{normally}} then place them in the recovery position, with the patient leant over on their side, which also {{has the effect of}} clearing the tongue from the pharynx. It also avoids a common cause of death in unconscious patients, which is choking on regurgitated stomach contents.|$|E
50|$|Typically, an AED kit {{will contain}} {{a face shield}} for {{providing}} a barrier between patient and <b>first</b> <b>aider</b> during rescue breathing; a pair of nitrile rubber gloves; a pair of trauma shears for cutting through a patient's clothing to expose the chest; a small towel for wiping away any moisture on the chest, and a razor for shaving those with very hairy chests.|$|E
50|$|Patients who {{are unable}} to breathe on their own will require {{positive}} pressure to move oxygen into their lungs for gaseous exchange to take place. Systems for delivering this vary in complexity (and cost), starting with a basic pocket mask adjunct which can be used by a basically trained <b>first</b> <b>aider</b> to manually deliver artificial respiration with supplemental oxygen delivered through a port in the mask.|$|E
5000|$|Before taking part, {{entrants}} must sign a [...] "death warrant", which {{acknowledges the}} many risks and dangers, {{and which the}} organizers claim absolves them of any legal liability {{in the case of}} injury.

40|$|Objectives: To {{establish}} {{the extent of}} first aid qualifications and knowledge amongst coaches and officials working in five non-elite youth sports in England. Materials & Methods: Questionnaires were administered to 1065 youth sports clubs across England. Data on <b>first</b> <b>aider's</b> qualifications and knowledge was requested in addition to information on medical record keeping and first aid equipment. Results: 80 % of respondents held an up to date first aid certificate, however only 57 % and 41 % respectively answered the "collapsed player" and "choking player" scenario correctly. A lack of confidence amongst <b>first</b> <b>aiders</b> to manage commonly occurring incidents such as shoulder dislocations, epileptic attacks and diabetic attacks was also highlighted. Conclusion: First aid training providers should look at their courses and consider simplifying the content and altering the teaching methods {{in order to improve}} their student's skill levels and retention...|$|R
