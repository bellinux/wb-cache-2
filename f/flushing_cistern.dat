50|$|Flushing troughs are {{commonly}} used {{in places such as}} schools, colleges, public toilets, factories and public buildings where quick refill of the <b>flushing</b> <b>cistern</b> is required. Siphonic action is started {{in the same way as}} an ordinary <b>flushing</b> <b>cistern.</b> As the water is siphoned, the water level falls only inside a timing box designed to permit the required flush. When the timing box has been emptied of water, air enters through an air pipe to break the siphonic action. The timing box refills with water through a hole in its side. The cistern is then ready to flush.|$|E

5000|$|Von Franz was passionately {{interested}} {{in nature and}} gardening. In order to meet her love for nature, she acquired {{a piece of land}} at the borders of a large forest above Bollingen. There, in 1958, she built a quadrate tower following the example of C. G. Jung. The tower {{was meant to be a}} hermitage, having neither electricity nor a <b>flushing</b> <b>cistern.</b> She used to take her wood for heating and cooking from the surrounding woods. Besides the house, there was a bog pond, abundant with toads and frogs, which she loved. This tower enabled her [...] "to escape modern civilization and all its unrest from time to time and to find a refuge in nature", as her sister reported. At that place, she felt [...] "in tune with the spirit of nature" [...] and she wrote a good deal of her books that she had planned early on in her life, and which she had realised one after the other, throughout the decades.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{the first}} day of term. Jane says she has lined up an {{interview}} for a job as a social worker. Patterson thinks this is ironic as they have lots of children of their own that need looking after. When he gets to work, he expresses having high hopes for his first lecture but it doesn't go as planned. On entering Room 351, he is greeted by the sound of a <b>flushing</b> <b>cistern</b> - it transpires he is in the wrong building. Arriving late, he soon concludes his students are neither intelligent nor academically inclined. At a meeting of the department, Misty rails against falling standards and, in particular, fornication by faculty which, he insists, must cease utterly. The Pattersons are invited to the Vice-Chancellor's reception where Melissa makes a bee-line for Andrew. He is about to take up her offer of showing her [...] "some fascinating Greek statuary in the garden" [...] when he is inconveniently interrupted by Jane. Cuthbertson wanders over and suggests showing Jane the same statuary. The night ends in disaster after the Vice-Chancellor asks Patterson not to smoke and he hurriedly puts his lit cigarette in his jacket pocket. The suit catches fire and he has to jump in the lake to extinguish the flames.|$|E

50|$|Backflow {{is a term}} in {{plumbing}} for {{an unwanted}} flow {{of water in the}} reverse direction. It can be a serious health risk for the contamination of potable water supplies with foul water. In the most obvious case, a toilet <b>flush</b> <b>cistern</b> and its water supply must be isolated from the toilet bowl. For this reason, building codes mandate a series of measures and backflow prevention devices to prevent backflow.|$|R
50|$|The Peterborough studio {{opened in}} a single office in Broadway Court, rented from Peterborough Development Corporation, the body {{responsible}} for the city's expansion as a New Town. The broadcasting equipment was two Studer tape recorders, a four-channel mixer and two microphones, which were placed on a table surrounded by mobile sound baffles. Ian Cameron, the first broadcaster from there the day Radio Cambridgeshire opened, realised {{at the last moment}} that the wall behind the temporary studio abutted the office block's lavatories and asked the staff in Cambridge to listen while he <b>flushed</b> the <b>cistern.</b> Nothing could be heard and the broadcast went ahead without fear of others in the office block inadvertently disturbing it.|$|R
50|$|Some toilets {{also use}} the siphon {{principle}} to obtain the actual <b>flush</b> from the <b>cistern.</b> The <b>flush</b> is triggered by a lever or handle that operates a simple diaphragm-like piston pump that lifts enough water to {{the crest of the}} siphon to start the flow of water which then completely empties the contents of the cistern into the toilet bowl. The advantage of this system was that no water would leak from the <b>cistern</b> excepting when <b>flushed.</b> These were mandatory in the UK until 2011.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{example is}} from 1936. It was manufactured by Alisa and {{was intended to}} serve schools or places where toilets would be of high use. The cistern was made of cast iron and could serve 2, 3 or 4 toilets. To <b>flush</b> the <b>cistern,</b> the chain that connects to the siphon is over {{the front of the}} cistern although water may sometimes slightly splash over the top. This was later adapted to hang over the back. A concealed variant was also available located in a 'duct' behind the wall to prevent vandalism. Maintenance could be carried out without entering the public space. A third version passes the chain through the cistern. The chain extended through a pipe higher than the water level and overflow level and thus no water would be splashed over the side while in use. Most flushing troughs had a longer life span than a standard single cistern. The main disadvantage is that maintenance requires all WCs served by the Trough to be unavailable.|$|R
40|$|Internationally, {{rain water}} tank systems have {{experienced}} a renaissance in urban areas in recent times as they {{are perceived to be}} a low cost source substitution option for many end uses or micro-components (e. g. toilet, clothes washer, irrigation, etc.) of water demand. While there are many studies that have been conducted investigating rainwater tank performance, none have explored their water-energy nexus at a micro-component level. Through a high resolution (i. e. 5 s, 0. 014 L/pulse, 1 W/pulse) smart metering study, this research was able to reveal the energy intensity of three rainwater tank end uses in 19 residential homes located in Gold Coast City, Queensland, Australia. Half <b>flush</b> toilet <b>cistern</b> events were found to have the highest variability of energy intensity values between homes (1. 05 to 3. 32 Wh/L) and also the highest energy intensity at 1. 88 Wh/L. Full flush toilet events had a tighter range (1. 02 to 2. 30 Wh/L) and slightly lower energy intensity than half flush events at 1. 61 Wh/L. Clothes washer energy intensity values were quite variable (0. 90 to 2. 73 Wh/L) but on average were lower than toilet flushing at 1. 28 Wh/L. Lastly, irrigation events had the tightest range (0. 83 to 1. 66 Wh/L) and lowest average energy intensity of 1. 12 Wh/L. The study has significant implications for building code specifications for internally plumbed rain tanks systems, particularly fit-for-purpose pump selection.

The building has 9 floors and basement. There is a pantry, water metering unit and heating {{station in the}} basement. The aim of thesis – to investigate the most effective method of collecting rainwater, {{to find out how}} much rainwater can be collected from the roof and from the vertical facades, in accordance with existing normative documents design investigated systems. The building has designed recycling rainwater recovery system. This system collects rainwater from the roof and from the vertical facade. Collected water is used for toilet flushing. This system covering up to 95 % of water used for <b>flushing</b> toilet <b>cisterns.</b> During the years from the roof of the building with an area of 460 m 2 can be collected about 300 m 2 of water. Either during the years from the building's facade, with an area of 1346 m 2 can be collected up to 424 m 2 of rain water. These systems can save 1295 € annually. The building has designed cold, rain and hot water supply systems. Cold water inlet provides multi water meter. Horizontal cold and hot water pipes are laid in the floor structure. Household waste water discharged wastewater stands and marriages in urban sewage networks. Rain water from the roof and facade, is leaking into the collection tank.

40|$|Australia, as an arid {{continent}} with Western consumption habits, {{is particularly}} susceptible to potable water scarcity. The {{extended periods of}} drought experienced {{by the majority of}} the nation from 2000 - 2009 led to the introduction of legislation mandating that all new residential dwellings achieve potable savings targets. Internally plumbed rainwater tanks are the most widely used means of satisfying these requirements. The least transparent variable affecting the viability of these decentralised supply systems is the pump energy and its associated costs. However little research has investigated what these costs are for specific end-use events (e. g. <b>cistern</b> <b>flush).</b> This paper reveals the pump energy intensity for a variety of end-uses under common system configurations. The experimental design consisted of three high resolution water meters and an electricity meter installed in each home collecting data at 5 -second intervals before transmitting wirelessly to servers over cellular networks. Once combined with relevant socio-demographic data, water and energy usage was disaggregated into individual end-use events, even when events were occurring simultaneously or when supply was split between sources. Findings determined that for the mandated rain tank enduses, cistern half-flushes are the most energy intense, followed by cistern full-flushes and clothes washer events, while irrigation events are significantly more efficient. Minimisation of pump energy, whilst maintaining potable savings, acts to lower electricity costs and GHG emissions. This information has broader implications in the evaluation and optimisation of internally plumbed rainwater tanks amid the spectrum of alternate urban water supply systems.

40|$|The {{performance}} assessment as {{to water}} consumption in WC cisterns {{has contributed to}} the development of flushing system technologies, which allow smaller flushing volumes. The purpose of this work is to assess the performance of the the low water consumption requirement of WC <b>cisterns</b> with dual <b>flushing</b> system (6 / 3 L), when compared to 6 L <b>flushing</b> volume WC <b>cisterns</b> in multifamily buildings. The research methodology consisted of a case study in a multifamily residential building with submetering system, by monitoring the total water consumption and the two flushing systems using water meters installed in WC cisterns. By means of a mathematical model, a comparison of the design flowrate in the main branch was carried out considering the two types of WC cisterns. The results indicated that the water consumption in the 6 L WC cistern was 20 % in relation to the total domestic consumption, whereas the water consumption observed in the dual-flush WC cistern (6 / 3 L) was 16 %. The dual flushing system (6 / 3 L) presented about 18 % consumption reduction impact as compared to the 6 L system. The design flowrate values in the main branch, obtained by the mathematical model, were 0. 35 L/s for systems with 6 L WC cistern and 0. 34 L/s with dual-flush WC cistern (6 / 3 L), that is, a reduction of similar to 3 %. Practical application: The knowledge of the performance in field of dual-flush WC cistern contributes to industry to improve this system and to users to aid their choice of technologies aimed at water conservation, and so assisting to the development of sustainable buildings...|$|R
