40|$|The {{frequencies}} {{of the solar}} acoustic oscillations vary over the activity cycle. The variations in other activity proxies {{are found to be}} well correlated with the variations in the acoustic frequencies. However, each proxy has a slightly different time behaviour. Our goal is to characterize the differences between the time behaviour of the <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> and of two other activity proxies, namely, the area covered by sunspots and the 10. 7 cm flux. We define a new observable that is particularly sensitive to the short-term frequency variations. We then compare the observable when computed from model <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> and from observed <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> obtained with the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) for cycle 23. Our analysis shows that on the shortest time-scales the variations in the <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> seen in the GONG observations are strongly correlated with the variations in the area covered by sunspots. However, a significant loss of correlation is still found. We verify that the times when the <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> and the sunspot area do not vary in a similar way tend to coincide with the times of the maxima of the quasi-biennial variations seen in the solar seismic data. A similar analysis of the relation between the 10. 7 cm flux and the <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> reveals that the short-time variations in the <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> follow even more closely those of the 10. 7 cm flux than those of the sunspot area.

When the lower observer sends a light signal to the higher observer, the acceleration causes the light to be red-shifted, as may be calculated from special relativity; the second observer will measure a lower frequency for the light than the first. Conversely, light sent from the higher observer to the lower is blue-shifted, that is, shifted towards higher frequencies. Einstein argued that such frequency shifts must also be observed in a gravitational field.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{analysis of the}} problem of <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> in piezoelectric resonators due to various effects is performed and reported in this dissertation based on the theory for small fields superposed on finite biasing fields in an electroelastic body. ^ This research includes the study of nonlinear effect of large accelerations on resonators that are mounted on moving objects and are under finite biasing fields. A second-order perturbation procedure is developed to estimate the <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts.</b> The effect of biasing fields on degenerate resonant frequencies is studied by a perturbation procedure. It is found that the degenerate frequency may split into different frequencies due to biasing fields. Stress induced <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> in resonators made from langasite (La 3 Ga 5 SiO 14 or LGS), a new piezoelectric crystal promising for future resonator applications, are calculated and zero stress sensitivity orientations of the crystal are determined. The results have important applications in high accuracy resonator design. The <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> due to intrinsic film stresses in asymmetric electrodes deposited on resonators are calculated. The result shows that <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> are partially due to the mode center (nodal plane) shift in resonators with unequal thickness electrodes. The effects of a small curvature of the middle surface of a thickness-shear mode crystal resonator on its vibration frequencies, modes, and acceleration sensitivity are studied. The results have important applications in design of plano-convex resonators. Third-order nonlinear elastic constants are essential in calculating the <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> of resonators. The PMN-PT electrostrictive ceramics, a new materials used for electromechanical transducers with the composition of (1 −x) [Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3]-(x) [PbTiO 3], are examined experimentally by studying the propagation of small amplitude ultrasonic waves in specimens under biasing stresses and their third-order elastic constants are determined. ^ In addition, a set of two-dimensional nonlinear equations for electroelastic plates in large amplitude thickness-shear vibrations are developed and are employed in the calculation of frequency-electric current amplitude behavior near nonlinear resonance of piezoelectric resonators. General expressions for the second-order <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> and degenerate <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> in an electroelastic body are obtained and the explicit forms of effective material constants at different orders are given. ^ The research results provide valuable information on minimizing the <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts</b> in crystal resonators due to environmental effects such as acceleration, temperature, stress or other biasing fields. They can also be used on various types of sensor and transducer designs, in which case it is desirable to maximize the <b>frequency</b> <b>shifts.</b> ...|$|R
