40|$|International {{bodies have}} started {{to address the problem}} of {{cross-border}} insolvency of corporate groups rather recently. UNCITRAL has adopted a set of recommendations and the EU Commission may address the matter in the near future, in the process of revising the European Insolvency Regulation. It is, therefore, timely to evaluate major proposals for the Regulation’s amendment regarding groups, suggested by <b>INSOL</b> <b>Europe.</b> The paper critically evaluates the proposals regarding coordination of group cases and the concept of substantive consolidation. This evaluation takes account of both the variety of possible group structures and the goals the insolvency regime would aim to achieve...|$|E
40|$|The {{harmonization}} of the European legislations on insolvency, {{in reference}} to the problems related to the substantive law of insolvency, represents a new stage, required by the European legislative process. The outline and analysis of the current problems of European, cross-border insolvency, of its causes and effects at the European Union level and, in particular, of the solutions proposed for the elimination of such problems, represents the concern of this paper. The <b>INSOL</b> <b>EUROPE</b> Report - Academic Forum "The harmonization of the laws on the insolvency at the European Union level" represents a first and important scientific step in this matter, and, therefore, this European document represents the starting point for analysing the utility and the means of harmonizing the European laws on insolvency, as a solution to the present difficulties generated by the cross-border insolvency at the EU level, from the view of the Romanian law and based on the Romanian experts opinions...|$|E
40|$|Following up on <b>Insol</b> <b>Europe’s</b> Note ‘Harmonisation of Insolvency Law at EU level’ (2010), {{this article}} {{provides}} a proposition for a European rule on transaction avoidance in insolvencies. The question explored here is whether, and to what extent, it is possible anddesirable to identify rules on transaction avoidance solely onthe basis of objective criteria. Based on a comparison of English, German and Dutch law a largely objective rule is formulated for three basic categories of detrimental legal acts. The first category concerns legal acts compromising {{the integrity of the}} estate of the debtor. The second category is formed by preferences. The third category consists of shareholder loans and shareholder guarantees...|$|R
40|$|Insolvency law {{has finally}} become {{a field of}} law for which {{harmonisation}} at a European level is considered both important and feasible. In deciding upon the content of such harmonised rules, there {{will need to be}} a common understanding about the goals of insolvency law and, therefore, a European debate on bankruptcy theory. Bankruptcy theory, and most notably the influential creditors' bargain theory, has long viewed insolvency law as a set of rules for overcoming common pool problems. Bankruptcy theory thus far has almost completely overlooked anticommons problems. Anticommons present themselves in a situation in which there are several owners or entitled parties, and each of the parties has it within its power to block the use by others. Should anticommons behaviour in insolvency procedures go unchecked, creditors as a whole will be harmed. Insolvency is a collective process, and this process may not be sabotaged by a single party. Four typical insolvency issues, each identified by <b>INSOL</b> <b>Europe</b> as a candidate for harmonisation at a European level, are discussed, analysing them in terms of common pool problems and anticommons: preferences, reorganisation/composition plans, claim validation and insolvency of a group of companies...|$|E
