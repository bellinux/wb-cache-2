2500|$|Despite Martin's {{reputation}} as a drinker – perpetuated via his vanity license plate [...] "DRUNKY" [...] – he masked his self-discipline. He was often the first to call <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>night,</b> and when not on tour or on a film location, liked {{to go home to}} see his wife and children. [...] He borrowed the lovable-drunk shtick from Joe E. Lewis, but his convincing portrayals of heavy boozers in Some Came Running and Howard Hawks's Rio Bravo led to unsubstantiated claims of alcoholism. Martin starred in and co-produced four Matt Helm superspy comedy adventures during this time, {{as well as a number}} of Westerns. By the early 1970s, The Dean Martin Show was still earning solid ratings, and although he was no longer a Top 40 hitmaker, his record albums continued to sell. He found a way to make his passion for golf profitable by offering a signature line golf balls and the Dean Martin Tucson Open was an event on golf's PGA Tour from 1972–75. At his death, Martin was reportedly the single largest minority shareholder of RCA stock.|$|E

60|$|His {{development}} (or retrogression) was rapid. His muscles became hard as iron, and he grew callous to all ordinary pain. He achieved {{an internal}} {{as well as}} external economy. He could eat anything, no matter how loathsome or indigestible; and, once eaten, the juices of his stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment; and his blood carried it to the farthest reaches of his body, building it into the toughest and stoutest of tissues. Sight and scent became remarkably keen, while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril. He learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between his toes; {{and when he was}} thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole, he would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs. His most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> in advance. No matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by tree or bank, the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward, sheltered and snug.|$|E
