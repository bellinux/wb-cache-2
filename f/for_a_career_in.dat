Though he was a short, thin, and sickly young man, Matsui opted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>in</b> the Army, because in Japan at that time military schools charged the lowest tuition fees.|$|E

5|$|Originally a Danish prince, George {{was born}} in Copenhagen, and seemed destined <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>in</b> the Royal Danish Navy. He was only 17 {{years old when he}} was elected king by the Greek National Assembly, which had deposed the unpopular former king Otto. His {{nomination}} was both suggested and supported by the Great Powers: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Second French Empire and the Russian Empire. He married the Russian grand duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia, and became the first monarch of a new Greek dynasty. Two of his sisters, Alexandra and Dagmar, married into the British and Russian royal families. King Edward VII and Tsar Alexander III were his brothers-in-law and King George V and Tsar Nicholas II were his nephews.|$|E
5|$|Sir Hugh Seymour Walpole, CBE (13 March 18841 June 1941) was an English novelist. He {{was the son}} of an Anglican clergyman, {{intended}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>in</b> {{the church}} but drawn instead to writing. Among those who encouraged him were the authors Henry James and Arnold Bennett. His skill at scene-setting and vivid plots, as well as his high profile as a lecturer, brought him a large readership in the United Kingdom and North America. He was a best-selling author in the 1920s and 1930s but has been largely neglected since his death.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 {{season and}} Super Bowl win {{marked the end}} of an era for the Giants. Shortly after the win, {{defensive}} coordinator Bill Belichick left to become head coach of the Cleveland Browns, and Parcells decided in the spring of 1991 to leave the Giants <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>in</b> broadcasting. There was also an ownership change in what had been one of the most stable front offices in professional sports. In February 1991, after being diagnosed with Cancer, Tim Mara sold his 50% interest in the team to Bob Tisch for a reported $80 million. The sale was actually worked out before the Super Bowl but not announced until afterwards, so as to avoid distracting the team. It marked the first time since their inception in 1925 that the Giants had not been wholly owned and controlled by the Mara family.|$|E

5|$|Henry of Huntingdon {{records that}} noblemen sent their {{children}} to be educated at Bloet's household, {{whether or not they}} were destined <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>in</b> the church. King Henry's illegitimate son Robert of Gloucester was educated in Bloet's care. Another illegitimate son of Henry's, Richard of Lincoln, was also in Bloet's household for an education. Gilbert of Sempringham, who founded the Gilbertine Order, was also educated in Bloet's household, entering it before Bloet's death and continuing there under Bloet's successor Alexander of Lincoln. Besides educating laymen, Bloet educated his own household clergy, including sending some of them to study under Ivo, Bishop of Chartres. He was known for his ostentatious manner of living, and served personally in war when needed. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury claimed that he hated monks. Henry of Huntingdon, however, remembered him as handsome, cheerful and affable. Earlier in his episcopate, Bloet had aided Christina of Markyate's family in their attempts to get the religious hermit to marry, at one point giving a judicial judgement that she must marry, which she refused to do. It was only after Bloet's death that Christina was able to be consecrated as a recluse at St Albans Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Treloar {{was born}} in Melbourne on 10December 1894. His father was a sales {{representative}} for Carlton & United Breweries {{and his mother was}} a strict Methodist. Treloar was educated at Albert Park State School and became a trained Sunday school teacher. He was not able to attend university, but sought self-education in Melbourne's museums and libraries. Treloar also participated in his school's cadet unit, and believed that the military offered a means to follow his ambition <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>in</b> a field other than small business. He was also a capable footballer, cricket player, and athlete and was invited to train with the South Melbourne Football Club. He took his father's advice to wait until he was 21 before playing senior games, however, and instead took a job with the Department of Defence after he left school in 1911. In this position he worked as a clerk for Brudenell White, who was later a leading Australian staff officer of World War I and the commander of the Australian Army during the early months of World War II.|$|E
