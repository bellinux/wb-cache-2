40|$|The {{impacts of}} sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) anomalies and anthropogenic greenhouse gases on {{the likelihood of}} extreme drought occurring in the central US in the year 2012 was investigated using large-ensemble simulations from a global atmospheric climate model. Two sets of experiments were conducted. In the first, the simulated hydroclimate of 2012 was compared to a baseline period (1986 – 2014) to investigate the impact of SSTs. In the second, the hydroclimate in a world with 2012 -level anthropogenic forcing was compared to 5 “counterfactual” versions of a 2012 -world under pre-industrial forcing. SST anomalies in 2012 increased the simulated likelihood of an extreme summer precipitation deficit (e. g. the deficit with a 2 % exceedance probability) {{by a factor of}} 5. The likelihood of an extreme summer soil moisture deficit increased by a similar amount, due in great part to a large spring soil moisture <b>deficit</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>over</b> into summer. An anthropogenic impact on precipitation was detectable in the simulations, doubling the likelihood of what would have been a rainfall deficit with a 2 % exceedance probability under pre-industrial-level forcings. Despite this reduction in rainfall, summer soil moisture during extreme drought was essentially unaffected by anthropogenic forcing because of 1) evapotranspiration declining roughly one-to-one with a decrease in precipitation due to severe water supply constraint and despite higher evaporative demand and 2) a decrease in stomatal conductance, and therefore a decrease in potential transpiration, with higher atmospheric CO 2 concentrations...|$|R

The brief three-year ("Thousand Days") period of NDP governance brought several lasting changes to the province, most notably the creation of the Agricultural Land Reserve, intended to protect farmland from redevelopment, and the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing single-payer basic automobile insurance.|$|R

40|$|Task {{demands that}} {{influence}} scanning behaviour in one task can cause that behaviour to persist {{to a second}} unrelated task (<b>carry</b> <b>over).</b> This can also affect performance on a second task (e. g., hazard perception ratings), and {{has been attributed to}} a process of attentional bias that is modulated by top-down influences (Thompson & Crundall, 2011). In a series of experiments we explored how these top-down influences impact upon <b>carry</b> <b>over.</b> In all experiments, participants searched letters that were presented horizontally, vertically, or in a random array. They were then presented with a driving scene and rated the hazardousness of the scene. <b>Carry</b> <b>over</b> of eye-movements from the letter search to the scene was observed in all experiments. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that this <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect influenced hazard perception accuracy. The magnitude of <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> was correlated with task switching abilities, attentional conflicting, and attentional orienting (Experiment 1), and was affected by predictability of the primary task (Experiment 2). Furthermore, direct current stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal areas affected the magnitude of the effect (Experiment 3). These results indicate that <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> is modulated by the specific ability to orient attention and disengage from this orientation. Over orienting leads to increased <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> and insufficient task switching is detrimental to task performance. As a result the current experiments provide evidence that the <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect is strongly influenced by attentional processes, namely orienting, inhibition, and task switching...|$|R
