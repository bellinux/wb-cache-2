25|$|During {{the three}} days that the battle of Arcole raged, cannon fire could be heard in Mantua. Observers in the {{fortress}} <b>even</b> <b>noticed</b> {{that some of the}} French camps seemed to be empty, yet Wurmser unaccountably failed to act. On 23 November, Wurmser assaulted the siege lines, capturing 200 Frenchmen and demolishing some earthworks. The Austrians suffered almost 800 casualties. When he learned that Davidovich was in full retreat, Wurmser withdrew into the city.|$|E
25|$|When the Continuation War {{started in}} June 1941, the {{state-owned}} icebreakers were again called to arms. On 13 September 1941, icebreakers Tarmo and Jääkarhu participated in Operation Nordwind together with Finnish and German naval ships. The joint Finnish-German distraction manoeuvre {{was a complete}} failure. Not only did it fail to achieve its goal – it is uncertain if the Soviet forces <b>even</b> <b>noticed</b> the fleet – but when the ships turned back, paravanes dragged a Soviet naval mine against the hull of Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen, the flagship of the Finnish Navy, which sank in seven minutes following the explosion, claiming 271 lives.|$|E

25|$|The trial caught {{worldwide}} {{attention as}} Antikainen and the Bulgarian communist Georgi Dimitrov, arrested in Berlin for alleged {{complicity in the}} Reichstag fire, were supported by an international solidarity campaign. The International Red Aid was also involved acquiring legal aid and bringing independent foreign experts to follow the trial. One of the observers was Diana Hubback, {{the daughter of the}} British feminist Eva Marian Hubback. Antikainen was <b>even</b> <b>noticed</b> by the Finnish American volunteers of the Spanish Civil War, a machine gun company of the Abraham Lincoln brigade was named after him. Due to the Antikainen case, the Finnish right-wing was eager to bring back the capital punishment, but this was strongly rejected by the liberals who collected a petition of more than 120,000 names against the intention. Finally, Antikainen was sentenced for 8 years of a preparation of a high treason. In May 1937, the Supreme Court sentenced him a life in prison of the murder of Antti Marjoniemi, although there was only circumstantial evidence. In 1974, the Finnish-born KGB officer Toivo Vähä published his memoirs claiming that he had killed Marjoniemi with a knife by an order from Antikainen. This information, however, cannot be verified from other sources.|$|E

Hitler's rise to prominence came as a surprise to Hess and many of his colleagues from the regiment.

Hess regarded Hitler as [...] "an absolute cypher" [...] and spoke of his surprise that Hitler had been one of his comrades: [...] "What, Hitler? He was in our unit?

2500|$|Some asteroids such as Pallas (...) and Vesta (...) , {{as well as}} dwarf planet Ceres, can {{sometimes}} be seen with binoculars (Vesta even with the naked eye), but these were not recognized as planetary, and perhaps not <b>even</b> <b>noticed,</b> until the early 19th century.

Although asteroids have been known to both astronomers and astrologers for more than 200 years, they are often ignored by astrologers.

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable moment of the debate was a [...] "rare error" [...] from Romney when {{discussing}} Massachusetts health care reform with Rick Perry.

Romney's offer was derided as being [...] "out of touch" [...] and [...] "elitist".
