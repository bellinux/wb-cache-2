5|$|Ezri Dax (Nicole de Boer), the station's counselor, has {{concerns}} with Nog {{living in a}} fictional world and speaks to Fontaine, who explains that he <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to rectify the situation. Fontaine convinces Nog that the bar is in trouble and he needs some help with the accounts; the Ferengi uses his business knowledge to help the hologram. Fontaine befriends Nog {{and after a while}} tries to convince him to return to the outside world following prompting by Ezri. Nog refuses to leave, resulting in Fontaine shutting down his program and refusing to let it restart. Fontaine appears to Nog in an otherwise empty holosuite, and Nog confesses that his injury has made him fear death and the ongoing war with the Dominion. Fontaine counsels Nog, who feels strong enough to leave the holosuite and return to duty. Shortly after he resumes his role back on the station, Nog returns to Fontaine to inform him that he has convinced Quark to leave the program running continuously to allow Vic to have a life of his own.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{factors associated with}} the likelihood of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> that includes <b>a</b> special needs trust among families that have disabled minor children. Descriptive analyses indicate that the top two reasons families provide for not <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> are the inability to save and no perceived need. Among families that do indicate <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan,</b> most do not include a special needs trust. Multivariate analyses reveal that professional involvement (financial, legal, and mental health professionals) is a key factor to increasing the likelihood of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> with <b>a</b> special needs trust. Families that <b>have</b> met with <b>a</b> financial advisor are 23 times more likely, and families who are encouraged to create <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> by <b>a</b> mental health professional are almost three times more likely, to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> that includes <b>a</b> special needs trust. Results from {{this study suggest that}} financial therapists are uniquely positioned to educate and ensure that appropriate plans are in place to provide for the future of children with special needs...|$|R

He teaches Liam about {{antiques}} but considers returning to Upton Park as he hasn't seen anywhere {{to move his}} business to. When Carol discovers that Eddie has allowed Liam to skip school, they argue and Carol tells him {{to stay away from}} her and Liam. Eddie discovers that someone is squatting in a local lock-up and decides to take over the premises. Eddie asks Liam to watch his stock, which he leaves in the gardens. Eddie's son, Anthony (Matt Lapinskas), poses {{as a member of the}} council to force the squatter out. Eddie returns to find his stock on fire and cannot extinguish the flames. He confronts Michael, thinking he started the fire, but Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) told Liam that she was responsible in revenge for comments Anthony and Tyler made about her grandfather Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick). Eddie finds out it was Lola and confronts her. Eddie and Michael seemingly make amends but Eddie is unaware that Michael <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b> He later gets a letter that intrigues Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) and she becomes fascinated by Eddie. When she tells him she knows his secret, that he wears silk underwear, Eddie assumes she read the letter and shouts at her. Eddie moves into a house on Albert Square and tells Michael that he likes Carol. They are set up by Eddie's sons to spend time alone and are caught under a blanket by Tyler and Anthony.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the family}} can call it a day, they arrive home and find Amber and Ginger waiting in their driveway. Amber shows Marge and the kids video footage of a drunk Homer marrying Amber in Vegas, while Ginger is next door with the widowed Ned Flanders. Homer tries to get his {{marriage}} to Amber annulled by the court, but Judge Constance Harm refuses, stating that Homer married Amber in Nevada and the marriage still stands, since Homer never officially divorced Amber. Marge is so angry that she banishes Homer, who takes up residence in Bart's treehouse with Amber. Homer still loves Marge and refuses to sleep with Amber, so he tries to sleep in Santa's Little Helper's kennel, but ends up getting its doorway stuck to his head and spends {{the rest of the}} night trying to get it off. The next day, Marge finds Homer asleep amid the broken remains of the doghouse, and she tells Homer that she is still angry at Homer over what he did, but she <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to get Amber out of their house.|$|E
500|$|In {{his search}} for the Black Hand, Talion allies himself with Hirgon, a ranger deserter who leads a {{community}} of Gondorian outcasts choosing to settle in Mordor, and Ratbag the Coward (Phil LaMarr), an Orc who offers to bring Talion closer to the Black Hand {{in exchange for his}} assistance in climbing Mordor's military hierarchy. Talion helps Ratbag ascend the ranks to the level of warchief by killing each of his immediate superiors, finally becoming Warchief himself. Talion then goes after the other Warchiefs in Udun, weakening Sauron's forces in that area. Soon enough, Hirgon <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to draw out the Black Captains. Using acquired grog and blasting powder, Talion helps the Outcasts destroy a statue dedicated to Sauron. Instead of the Black Hand answering the [...] "message", the Hammer of Sauron is sent, punishing Ratbag for not answering his duties to kill the ranger. Talion and The Hammer then face off, with packs of Uruk joining the fight, but after a savage battle, Talion manages to kill The Hammer.|$|E
500|$|Protected {{under the}} United States Federal Endangered Species Act, the bog turtle is {{considered}} threatened in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania as of November 4, 1997. Due to a [...] "similarity of appearance" [...] {{to the northern}} population, the bog turtle is also threatened in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia (considered to be the southern population). In addition to the federal listing of threatened, states in the southern range list the bog turtle as either endangered or threatened. Changes to the bog turtle's habitat {{have resulted in the}} disappearance of 80percent of the colonies that existed 30years ago. Because of the turtle's rarity, it is also in danger of illegal collection, often for the worldwide pet trade. Despite regulations prohibiting their collection, barter, or export, bog turtles are commonly taken by poachers. Road traffic has also led to declines. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> for the recovery of the northern population. The bog turtle was listed as critically endangered in the 2011 IUCN Red List.|$|E

Ben Rawson-Jones from Digital Spy describes Ben as a [...] "supposed villain", pondering [...] "Could he really have been the good guy all along" [...] following the fourth-season episode [...] "The Shape of Things to Come". Actor Michael Emerson suspects where Ben's loyalties lie will always be ambiguous, making this a [...] "wonderful role". He is rarely shown losing control of his emotions, but when he does, it is done in a big and childish way. Emerson explains [...] "He's cold because any trace of warmth makes him vulnerable to his enemies". Ben is also known for {{his commitment to the}} island and doing whatever is necessary to protect it. He has no qualms with Locke attempting to kill Naomi (Marsha Thomason) and even Jack after the survivors begin to call the freighter. He undertakes the risky and unpredictable step of moving the Island to prevent the freighter crew, and thus Charles Widmore, from finding it. He always <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> and is described by Kevin Thompson from The Palm Beach Post as a [...] "know-it-all", which another reviewer thinks is because [...] " [...] talks quietly, in a menacingly measured drawl... with lots of pauses and emphases".|$|E
500|$|Harrison did {{not create}} an overall plan {{for his work on}} the site; a series of plans for {{different}} buildings were prepared and building works continued until 1792. [...] The new buildings had to be placed between the existing medieval castle buildings, including the keep, towers and the gatehouse. [...] Harrison decided to design them with Gothic motifs, such as battlements and windows with pointed heads. [...] Construction started in 1788, and the first building to be completed was the Keeper's House, standing {{to the right of the}} gatehouse. [...] The next substantial building to be completed was the Female Felon's Prison on the other side of the gatehouse. [...] He designed an arcade on the south side of the keep to give some shelter to the debtors as they walked round their courtyard. [...] He later added two storeys to provide more accommodation for debtors, and completed the Male Felon's Prison to the north of the keep. [...] By 1794 these buildings and other improvements had cost £10,853 (...) , more than had been expected. [...] By 1795 Harrison had moved from Lancaster to Chester, from where he continued to supervise the work on both sites. [...] At Lancaster this work included rebuilding the Crown Court and the Shire Hall. [...] At that time the Crown Court was held in the medieval hall of the castle, and civil cases were held in the Shire Hall in the keep. [...] The new buildings form a symmetrical group to the west of the keep, and were completed in 1798, although the internal decoration and furnishings were not finished until some years later by Joseph Gandy. [...] The Crown Court is a simple rectangular room, measuring about [...] by [...] high and wide. [...] The Shire Hall <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> of half a polygon about [...] in diameter. [...] Six Gothic columns support a panelled vault covering the main part of the courtroom. [...] Around the perimeter is an arcade, and the judge's bench has an elaborate canopy in Coade stone. [...] The precise cost of these buildings is unknown, but in 1807 an estimate of more than £40,000 (...) was given.|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} {{the percentage of}} full-time wheelchair users with spinal cord injuries who felt they could evacuate from various locations, and the percentage who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> for evacuation. Study results will help clinicians and emergency officials understand needs related to evacuation preparedness. Design Convenience sample su rvey. Setting Six Spinal Cord Injury Model System centers, {{part of the national}} database funded through the Department of Education, National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research. Participants People (N= 487) with spinal cord injuries who use a wheelchair more than 40 hours a week. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures The percentage of wheelchair users who felt {{they would be able to}} safely evacuate, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> for safe evacuation, or reported a need for assistive technology and human assistance to evacuate from various locations in the event of an emergency. Results The highest percentage of participants felt they would be able to safely evacuate and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> for work evacuation. The lowest percentage of participants reported they could evacuate from their city/town in the event of <b>an</b> emergency and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to evacuate their city/town in the event of a natural disaster. A large difference exists between the percentage of participants who felt they could evacuate and those who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> for evacuation. Conclusions A large discrepancy exists between the perception that one can evacuate and actually <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b> The perception that one can evacuate without <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> or the use of assistive technology is an area of concern that must be further addressed by educators. Education must emphasize the need to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> defined evacuation <b>plan</b> and effective utilization of assistive technology. © 2011 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine...|$|R
