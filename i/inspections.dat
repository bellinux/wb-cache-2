40|$|In {{the past}} several decades, {{significant}} amount of resources have been spent by many manufactures for product quality improvement. Quality improvement efforts involve mitigating the impact of manufacturing variation through robust design, statistical process control (SPC), and <b>inspection.</b> This research focuses on manufacturing system design issues related to <b>inspection.</b> The problem of determining the optimal <b>inspection</b> strategy for a given multi-stage manufacturing system i. e. <b>inspection</b> strategy {{that will result in}} the lowest total processing cost is modeled as a joint optimization of <b>inspection</b> location and type. Three <b>inspection</b> options considered in this work are no <b>inspection,</b> full <b>inspection</b> and sampling <b>inspection.</b> This thesis presents a generic mathematical model and employs dynamic programming to identify the optimal <b>inspection</b> plan with minimum total processing cost. Numerical examples are presented to describe the solution procedure. The conclusions are supported by a factorial experiment.

There wasn't a significant amount of deterioration noted in these early <b>inspections,</b> and when the wheels were jacked off the rails, as they had been 50 years earlier, the axles were found to be freely operable.
