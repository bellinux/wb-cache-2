5|$|Database <b>forensics</b> is {{a branch}} of digital <b>forensics</b> {{relating}} to the forensic study of databases and their metadata. Investigations use database contents, log files and in-RAM data to build a timeline or recover relevant information.|$|E
5|$|The {{technical}} aspect {{of an investigation}} is divided into several sub-branches, relating {{to the type of}} digital devices involved; computer <b>forensics,</b> network <b>forensics,</b> forensic data analysis and mobile device <b>forensics.</b> The typical forensic process encompasses the seizure, forensic imaging (acquisition) and analysis of digital media and the production of a report into collected evidence.|$|E
5|$|Digital <b>{{forensic}}s</b> (sometimes {{known as}} digital forensic science) is {{a branch of}} forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. The term digital <b>forensics</b> was originally used as a synonym for computer <b>forensics</b> but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, {{and it was not}} until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.|$|E

5|$|Digital <b>forensics</b> {{investigations}} {{have a variety}} of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil (as part of the electronic discovery process) courts. <b>Forensics</b> may also feature in the private sector; such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigation (a specialist probe into {{the nature and extent of}} an unauthorized network intrusion).|$|E
5|$|In civil {{litigation}} {{or corporate}} matters digital <b>forensics</b> forms {{part of the}} electronic discovery (or eDiscovery) process. Forensic procedures {{are similar to those}} used in criminal investigations, often with different legal requirements and limitations. Outside of the courts digital <b>forensics</b> can form a part of internal corporate investigations.|$|E
5|$|Mobile device <b>forensics</b> is a sub-branch {{of digital}} <b>forensics</b> {{relating}} to recovery of digital evidence or {{data from a}} mobile device. It differs from Computer <b>forensics</b> in that a mobile device will have an inbuilt communication system (e.g. GSM) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms. Investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communications (SMS/Email) rather than in-depth recovery of deleted data. SMS data from a mobile device investigation helped to exonerate Patrick Lumumba {{in the murder of}} Meredith Kercher.|$|E
40|$|Criminology is {{a science}} dealing with the {{protection}} of citizens and state from infringement. Criminology uses mostly biological or genetic methods for crime detection. <b>Forensic</b> traces which are collected by <b>forensic</b> experts on the scene are the key items of those methods. <b>Forensic</b> genetics {{is among the most}} important <b>forensic</b> subdisciplines. <b>Forensic</b> genetics uses DNA analysis for identification.

5|$|Network <b>forensics</b> is {{concerned}} with the monitoring and analysis of computer network traffic, both local and WAN/internet, for the purposes of information gathering, evidence collection, or intrusion detection. Traffic is usually intercepted at the packet level, and either stored for later analysis or filtered in real-time. Unlike other areas of digital <b>forensics</b> network data is often volatile and rarely logged, making the discipline often reactionary.|$|E
5|$|Digital <b>forensics</b> {{investigation}} is {{not restricted to}} retrieve data merely from the computer, as laws are breached by the criminals and small digital devices (e.g. tablets, smartphones, flash drives) are now extensively used. Some of these devices have volatile memory while some have non-volatile memory. Sufficient methodologies are available to retrieve data from volatile memory, however, there is lack of detailed methodology or a framework for data retrieval from non-volatile memory sources.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the field of <b>forensic</b> science has {{experienced}} a remarkable development, immense mass media focus, and a substantially enhanced public profile. Consequently, <b>forensic</b> science education has been characterized by a rapid expansion in both the number of <b>forensic</b> science courses {{and the number of}} students enrolling in such courses. Despite the concerns such rapid expansion has created, very little remains published on <b>forensic</b> science education and on the curricular and pedagogical approaches adopted in <b>forensic</b> science courses. This article aims to generate a deep understanding about the current status of <b>forensic</b> science education in academia and the curricular and pedagogical frameworks adopted in <b>forensic</b> science courses. In order to fulfill this aim, a document analysis of 190 <b>forensic</b> science courses offered worldwide was conducted. Document analysis generated understandings of and insights into the way higher education institutes organize <b>forensic</b> science education, transmit <b>forensic</b> science knowledge, and liaise with the <b>forensic</b> science industry. This article examines current <b>forensic</b> science courses from a three-lens view of knowledge, practice, and identity. The article finds that the rapid expansion in <b>forensic</b> science education has attracted both “authentic” and “inauthentic” investments. “Authentic” <b>forensic</b> science courses are courses that truly emphasize <b>forensic</b> science knowledge, connect to <b>forensic</b> science practice, and reflect <b>forensic</b> science identity. On the other hand, “inauthentic” courses were identified when such courses failed to represent <b>forensic</b> science knowledge, practice, and identity. The article concludes that the current state of <b>forensic</b> science education sets off an alarm for the <b>forensic</b> science community about the future of <b>forensic</b> science and its education...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MCom (<b>Forensic</b> accountancy)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. <b>Forensic</b> {{accountants}} are occasionally {{called upon}} to assist in criminal law proceedings. The role of the <b>forensic</b> accountant in such proceedings is usually determined during the engagement of the <b>forensic</b> investigation {{to assist in the}} matter under investigation. During such investigations, various investigation techniques may be utilised by the <b>forensic</b> accountant in order to convey the facts and findings of the <b>forensic</b> investigation in a written report, drafted by the <b>forensic</b> accountant. When criminal prosecutions are instituted and the <b>forensic</b> accountant is {{called upon to}} act as an expert witness, such evidence is mostly based on the findings of the written report. Thus, in giving evidence, the <b>forensic</b> accountant must ensure that the testimony and evidence will be admissible in court and that the <b>forensic</b> accountant is found to be a credible witness. Although there are various legal standards that the <b>forensic</b> accountant must adhere to, the ICFP, which is the South African regulatory body for commercial <b>forensic</b> practitioners, {{is still in its infancy}} and has as yet not set any standards with which <b>forensic</b> accountants must comply with when assisting in criminal investigations or drafting written reports. The objective of this study is to highlight the role of the <b>forensic</b> accountant in criminal law proceedings. This objective is reached by clarification of the following: •	the difference between a <b>forensic</b> accountant and an auditor; •	the techniques available to the <b>forensic</b> accountant when conducting a <b>forensic</b> investigation; •	the standards with which a <b>forensic</b> accountant‘s report should comply; and •	the <b>forensic</b> accountant‘s role in testimony. The study illustrates the difference between a <b>forensic</b> accountant and an auditor and suggests a definition for a <b>forensic</b> accountant. The study furthermore explores various techniques that the <b>forensic</b> accountant may utilise during the investigation. The study also analyses the legal standards with which a <b>forensic</b> accountant must comply in order to ensure the admissibility of the written report and its findings. In order to achieve this, international regulatory standards applicable to <b>forensic</b> accountants are analysed and discussed. Finally, the role of the <b>forensic</b> accountant in court proceedings is examined. The illustrations in this study will be helpful in determining standards that could be implemented in South Africa to guide <b>forensic</b> accountants in their role in criminal law proceedings.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{insights}} and {{results are presented}} of a long term and ongoing improvement effort within the Netherlands <b>Forensic</b> Institute (NFI) to establish a valuable innovation programme. From the overall perspective of the role and use of <b>forensic</b> science {{in the criminal justice}} system, the concepts of <b>Forensic</b> Information Value Added (FIVA) and <b>Forensic</b> Information Value Efficiency (FIVE) are introduced. From these concepts the key factors determining the added value of <b>forensic</b> investigations are discussed; Evidential Value, Relevance, Quality, Speed and Cost. By unravelling the added value of <b>forensic</b> science and combining this with the future needs and scientific and technological developments, six <b>forensic</b> grand challenges are introduced: i) Molecular Photo-fitting; ii) chemical imaging, profiling and age estimation of finger marks; iii) Advancing <b>Forensic</b> Medicine; iv) Objective <b>Forensic</b> Evaluation; v) the Digital <b>Forensic</b> Service Centre and vi) Real time In-Situ Chemical Identification. Finally, models for <b>forensic</b> innovation are presented that could lead to major international breakthroughs on all these six themes within a five year time span. This could cause a step change in the added value of <b>forensic</b> science and would make <b>forensic</b> investigative methods even more valuable than they already are today...|$|R
