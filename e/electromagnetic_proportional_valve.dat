40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model of a}} servoactuator and of a four-port <b>proportional</b> direction control <b>valve</b> has been developed. Mechanical and hydraulic elements have been simulated in the LMS Amesim environment. The complete model has been validated {{on the basis of}} the experimental time histories of the actuator velocity and of the flow-rate controlled by the <b>proportional</b> <b>valve.</b> The validation data have been acquired on a fluid power system used to test electro-hydraulic servovalves according to ISO 10770 - 1 standard. The measurement of the instantaneous flow-rate through the valve has been performed with an innovative high-dynamics flowmeter, recently developed for high-pressure liquid flows. Furthermore, the model predicted static characteristic of the <b>proportional</b> <b>valve</b> has been compared with a corresponding experimentally derived curve and an analysis of the cause-and-effect relationships has been carried out for the valve static performance. Measured data on valve leakages have also been presented in order to complete the steadystate characterization of the tested valve. The developed model of the hydraulic system has been then applied to realize the Bode diagram of the <b>proportional</b> <b>valve,</b> which is expressed in terms of instantaneous flow-rate as a function of the sinusoidal driving command, as well as the Bode diagram of the subsystem made up of the <b>proportional</b> <b>valve</b> and of the linear actuator.

40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, a {{passenger}} car suspension must has high performance criteria with light weight, low cost, and low energy consumption. Pilot controlled <b>proportional</b> <b>valve</b> is designed and analyzed to get small pressure change rate after blow-off, {{and to get}} a fast response of the damper, a reverse damping mechanism is adapted. The reverse continuous variable damper is designed as a HS-SH damper which offers good body control with reduced transferred input force from the tire, compared with any other type of suspension system. The damper structure is designed, so that rebound and compression damping forces can be tuned independently, of which the variable valve is placed externally. The rate of pressure change with respect to the flow rate after blow-off becomes smooth when the fixed orifice size increases, which means that the blow-off slope is controllable using the fixed orifice size. Damping forces are measured with the change of the solenoid current at the different piston velocities to confirm the maximum hysteresis of 20 N, linearity, and variance of damping force. The damping force variance is wide and continuous, and is controlled by the spool opening, of which scheme is usually adapted in <b>proportional</b> <b>valves.</b> The reverse continuous variable damper developed in this study is expected to be utilized in the semi-active suspension systems in passenger cars after its performance and simplicity of the design is confirmed through a real car test.

The pump is currently equipped with a double negative feedback control loop with an inner control loop to control the position of <b>proportional</b> <b>valve</b> using PID controller. Consequently, the <b>proportional</b> <b>valve</b> distributes the control pressure across {{the two sides of}} a control piston that is mechanically attached to the pump swash plate in order to change the pump flow rate.

40|$|The {{replacement}} of on-off solenoids with solenoids which can adjust the spool {{position of a}} directional valve proportionally to their input voltage was {{the groundwork for the}} development of <b>proportional</b> <b>valve</b> technology. Due to their robustness and well-priced properties, <b>proportional</b> <b>valves</b> are a good alternative to conventional servo-solenoid valves. Indeed, servosolenoid valves are highly precise but that makes them highly expensive as well. Additionally, they place great demands on maintenance and industrial surroundings. Hence <b>proportional</b> <b>valves</b> are widely-used in automation engineering. A common application is the positioning of actuators. Thus, a closed-loop circuit is necessary. In doing so, the <b>proportional</b> <b>valve’s</b> input voltage is the manipulated value which enables a certain area for the oil to pass through the valve. Therefore, the flow rate to the actuator can be changed to control the actuator position with high precision. In this thesis the main components of a hydraulic positioning unit shall be modelled and simulated using the software Matlab/Simulink. That includes the actuator, the pressure relief valve, connecting pipes and of course the <b>proportional</b> directional control <b>valve.</b> With this model the positioning unit can be tested under different conditions to make predictions on how the system is going to react. Due {{to the fact that it}} was not possible to collect measured data from the several components, measured data from the datasheets have been used to verify the models. For the actuator was no datasheet available. Consequently, only a general model could be created. The dynamic behavior of the pressure relief valve could be obtained by using the dimensions given in the datasheet. However, the datasheet does not provide any curves related to dynamic behavior. Therefore, only the static behavior was verifiable. The simulation of the <b>proportional</b> directional control <b>valve</b> was divided into a static and a dynamic part. Based on flow, pressure and leakage curves given by the manufacturer, pseudo-section functions have been created. These functions characterize the relationship between normalized spool position and flow rate. For simulating the dynamic behavior, a nonlinear Simulink model was created. The model was fitted to nonlinear frequency response data points by using a Nelder-Mead simplex optimization algorithm. Methodologies and models were subsequently tested with used data from the manufacturer. The good quality of the results seems to support the approach. Nevertheless, the Simulink model has to be adjusted more properly to the measurement curves. All important components of a hydraulic positioning unit have been modelled. It is recommended to make further improvements to adjust the Simulink model more properly to the given curves in the datasheet. Subsequently, all components can be connected together to implement the closed-loop circuit...|$|R
