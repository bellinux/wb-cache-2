50|$|The {{plains of}} Lombardy, formed by {{alluvial}} deposits, {{can be divided}} into the Alta - an upper, permeable ground zone in the north and a lower zone - the Bassa - dotted by the so-called line of fontanili, spring waters rising from <b>impermeable</b> <b>ground.</b> Inconsistent with the three distinctions above made is the small subregion of Oltrepò Pavese, formed by the Apennine foothills beyond the Po River.|$|E
50|$|Drainage density {{depends upon}} both climate and {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} drainage basin. Soil permeability (infiltration difficulty) and underlying rock type affect the runoff in a watershed; <b>impermeable</b> <b>ground</b> or exposed bedrock will {{lead to an increase}} in surface water runoff and therefore to more frequent streams. Rugged regions or those with high relief will also have a higher drainage density than other drainage basins if the other characteristics of the basin are the same.|$|E

The exact nature of the <b>impermeable</b> <b>ground</b> layer of the lake is still unknown. It is assumed, that fine-grained densely compressed ash, basalt rock or small permafrost layer may play a role. No permafrost layer has been established so far for the lake area itself, but it was found at another location in peak area. Established however is 7.5 m thick sediment layer {{at the bottom of}} the lake.|$|E

50|$|The {{river is}} a 'perch' stream, flowing over {{a bed of}} {{impermeable}} material {{on top of a}} porous substrate. This state is only quasi-stable, since in periods of low rainfall the water table drops below the level of the <b>impermeable</b> layer. If <b>ground</b> works are then carried out which damage this layer, the river can sink into the porous substrate and disappear.|$|R
50|$|LPS {{comprises}} a loose {{sleeve of}} polyethylene that completely wraps the pipe, including the bells of any joints. The sleeving inhibits corrosion {{by a number}} of mechanisms. It physically separates the pipe from soil particles, preventing direct galvanic corrosion. By providing an <b>impermeable</b> barrier to <b>ground</b> water, the sleeve also inhibits the diffusion of oxygen to the ductile iron surface and limits the availability of electrolytes that would accelerate corrosion. It provides a homogeneous environment along the pipe surface so that corrosion occurs evenly over the pipe. The sleeve also restricts the availability of nutrients which could support sulfate-reducing bacteria, inhibiting microbially induced corrosion. LPS is not designed to be completely water-tight but rather to greatly restrict the movement of water to and from the pipe surface. Water present beneath the sleeve and in contact with the pipe surface is rapidly deoxygenated and depleted of nutrients and forms a stable environment in which limited further corrosion occurs. An improperly installed sleeve that continues to allow the free flow of ground water is not effective in inhibiting corrosion.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the lake}} to exist {{there must be a}} {{hydrostatic}} seal along the entire perimeter, if the floating level is higher than the threshold. A hydrostatic seal is created when the ice is so much higher around the lake that the equipotential surface dips down into <b>impermeable</b> <b>ground.</b> Water from underneath this ice rim is then pressed back into the lake by the hydrostatic seal. [...] In Lake Vostok the ice rim has been estimated to a mere 7 m, while the floating level is about 3 km above the lake ceiling.|$|E
40|$|Soil {{erosion and}} {{sedimentation}} caused by vegetation removal, soil disturbances, changes to natural drainage patterns, or increases in <b>impermeable</b> <b>ground</b> cover {{are two of}} the primary problems associated with storm water runoff. One of the most effective ways to prevent erosion and sedimentation is to stabilize disturbed land through the addition of vegetation. This practice is referred to as “vegetative covering. ” Vegetative covers can be used to preserve existing vegetation and/or revegetate disturbed soils. They can provide both dust control and a reduction in erosion potential by increasing infiltration, trapping sediment, stabilizing the soil, and dissipating the energy of hard rain...|$|E
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityHigh precipitation and evaporation rates in tropical climates result in highly dynamic moisture fluxes in the vadose zone. This shallow soil region provides a critical link between the land surface above and the groundwater aquifer below. Yet vadose zone hydrology in tropical regions has not been studied as thoroughly as in temperate, arid, or semi-arid regions. The lack of hydrologic investigations presents particular challenges in urban areas where subsurface aquifers are vulnerable to contamination from chemicals introduced {{at or near the}} ground surface. An improved understanding of the hydrologic processes in the vadose zone of sandy, humid, tropical environments can inform strategies to protect the water quality of such urban aquifers. This dissertation studies the moisture fluxes in the vadose zone at the Changi East Reclamation Area, a constructed fill site in Singapore. This site is under consideration for both urban development and use as a freshwater storage aquifer or a flow-through treatment facility. The findings presented here are relevant both for urban water resources management at this site and at locations with similar environments. An understanding of fundamental hydrological processes specific to an area is needed prior to conducting groundwater vulnerability assessments on the scale needed for city-planning. In particular, vadose zone processes {{play a critical role in}} groundwater protection, but there is insufficient evidence from field or modeling studies to describe the relevant processes in detail for such tropical sandy environments. Field studies of these processes are challenging due to the difficult nature of vadose zone measurements in general and the limited accessibility at sites like the Changi East Reclamation Area. Mathematical studies of this environment are equally challenging. Most relevant analytic methods are devoted to steady-state results or involve simplified solutions that are not appropriate for describing these field conditions. In addition, numerical modeling of the vadose zone is computationally demanding, especially in this environment where precipitation rates change rapidly and high evaporative demand results in low nearsurface soil moisture content between rain events. Despite these challenges, this study combines field observations at the Changi East Reclamation Area with one- and twodimensional numerical modeling experiments to explore vadose zone moisture fluxes and their implications for urban groundwater quality. This study provides insights into hydrologic processes in the vadose zone of a sandy soil in a tropical climate, a historically understudied environment. The knowledge gained is then synthesized to provide insight into groundwater vulnerability assessments and stormwater management practices useful for urban water resources planners. Some key outcomes from this study include: Field observations showing that precipitation quantity and antecedent soil moisture are strongly correlated to wetting front depth, while maximum precipitation intensity plays a lesser role; A data analysis method to correct tensiometer measurement errors introduced by daily temperature fluctuations at the ground surface; and A comparative metric to evaluate the impact of different stormwater management scenarios on vadose zone travel times. Additionally, the modeling results provide the following general observations about vadose zone moisture fluxes in tropical sandy soils: When the water table is shallow (less than 2 m), upward fluxes from the water table are important to the overall water budget, so both recharge and net recharge (recharge minus upflux) quantities are relevant. When the water table is deeper than 2 m, recharge and net recharge are directly proportional to the saturated hydraulic conductivity and nearly independent of water table depth. One-dimensional modeling is appropriate in this environment when the vadose zone soil is homogeneous. This is independent of spatially-variable infiltration patterns due to <b>impermeable</b> <b>ground</b> covering from urban development because lateral fluxes do not significantly impact recharge and net recharge estimates. Post-development net recharge drops proportionally with the introduction of impermeable surfaces when stormwater runoff is routed offsite. However, net recharge increases dramatically when runoff is infiltrated locally, exceeding the pre-development recharge. These observations have implications for the water quality of the shallow groundwater aquifers found in this environment. Since these aquifers are extremely vulnerable to contamination introduced at the ground surface, the quality of runoff water should be ensured prior to infiltration when aquifer protection is part of the stormwater management plan. The results of this study are useful for developing urban water resources management strategies, particularly in sandy tropical environments...|$|E
40|$|During {{significant}} precipitation events {{water that}} does not directly run off infiltrates the soil. If the soils are thin or overlie an impermeable layer, the water will percolate to the impermeable layer and build-up forming a perched water table. If the build-up of infiltrating water generates sufficient pore fluid pressure, the shear strength of the material will be reduced, resulting in slope failure. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the conditions resulting in periodic slope instability on gently sloped terrain. It was hypothesized that that a perched water table, generated by excessive or intense precipitation events, affects the slope stability in the area and results in intermittent movement of the landslide. Data-gathering activities included monitoring precipitation, measuring the height and extent of the perched water table using a piezometer array, interpreting the location and morphology of <b>impermeable</b> boundaries with <b>ground</b> penetrating radar and assessing relative slide movements. Field measurements suggest that there was a correlation between the amount of rainfall received and the change in height of the rise of water above the impermeable surface; a slope-stability analysis was performed to quantify probable conditions resulting in stability. Conditions that lead to slope instability on gentle slopes in this study were identified as precipitation falling on soils with high antecedent moisture conditions, causing the formation of a perched water table. According to the factor of safety analysis, the height of the perched water table need for movement is met seasonally. Because of the gentle slopes, movement occurred slowly. CSU, Chic...|$|R
