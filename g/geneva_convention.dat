5|$|In his dissent he {{asserted}} that the courts had no jurisdiction for this case for the reasons described in Scalia's dissent above; that Hamdan is an illegal combatant and therefore not protected by the Geneva convention; that the <b>Geneva</b> <b>convention</b> does not prohibit the special court council proposed; and that the President already had authority {{to set up the}} special court council proposed.|$|E

5|$|At its peak, {{the camp}} held 8,000American {{soldiers}} (along {{with a small}} number of soldiers and civilians from other nations including the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Netherlands), making it the largest POW camp in the Philippines. This number dropped significantly as able-bodied soldiers were shipped to other areas in the Philippines, Japan, Japanese-occupied Taiwan, and Manchukuo to work in slave labor camps. As Japan had not yet ratified the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention,</b> the POWs were transported out of the camp and forced to work in factories to build Japanese weaponry, unload ships, and repair airfields.|$|E
5|$|In late 1953, the United States Senate Committee on Government Operations, led by Joseph McCarthy, {{conducted}} {{an investigation of}} up to 1,800 reported incidents of war crimes allegedly committed throughout the Korean War. The Chaplain–Medic massacre {{was one of the}} first to be investigated, and it was here that the incident got its name. Buttrey, the lone survivor of the executions, was called to testify before the committee, and the U.S. Government concluded that the North Korean army violated the terms of the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention,</b> and condemned its actions.|$|E
5|$|Most French {{prisoners of}} war were not held in camps {{for most of the}} war, but instead, over 93 percent of French {{prisoners of war}} lived and worked on Kommandos of work details. Under the terms of the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention</b> NCOs were, like officers, {{exempted}} from work during captivity, but Germans often forced them to work. Workers were fed but virtually their entire wages were paid directly to the German army and prisoners were only allowed to retain 70 pfennigs per day.|$|E

5|$|Some navies operate ocean-going {{hospital}} {{ships to}} lend medical assistance in high casualty situations like wars or natural disasters. These hospital ships fulfill {{the criteria of}} an ambulance (transporting the sick or injured), although the capabilities of a hospital ship are more on par with a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. In line with the laws of war, these ships can display a prominent Red Cross or Red Crescent to confer protection under the appropriate <b>Geneva</b> <b>convention.</b> However, this designation has not always protected hospital ships from enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|The Behar {{survivors}} were maltreated {{by members}} of Tones crew. Japanese sailors forced the survivors to hand over all their personal belongings of any value, and then used ropes to tie the survivors in painful positions which caused them to have difficultly breathing. The merchant ship's chief officer was beaten after he complained that treating civilians {{in such a way}} violated the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention.</b> However, the female survivors later had their ropes removed. When the survivors were taken below decks to be imprisoned they were badly beaten by Japanese sailors.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these first-person accounts, she also incorporates court reports and testimony in her research. Szalavitz highlights controversial practices used by these tough love teen industry programs which the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention</b> banned as being too extreme for prisoners of war. She states {{that there is no}} evidence that any of the programs are effective. Portions of the book are addressed to parents and provide resources and advice on how to select better choices instead of programs in the tough love teen industry, and the book includes an appendix aimed at educating parents on how to find help for their teenagers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions</b> {{guarantee}} combatants {{the right}} not {{to be put on}} trial for fighting in a war - unless they commit a war crime (a grave breach) or other crime (e.g., captured behind enemy lines out of proper uniforms or insignia while carrying out espionage or sabotage operations). Most held under the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions</b> are not accused of a crime and therefore it would be a war crime under the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions</b> to give them a trial. This protection against getting a trial is fully consistent with human rights law because human rights law prohibits putting people on trial when there is no crime to try them for. The <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions</b> however guarantee that anyone charged with a war crime or other crime must get a fair trial.|$|R

5|$|In his roles at the ICTY and ICTR he had {{to design}} prosecutorial {{strategies}} for both those ground-breaking tribunals, from scratch. In doing so, he sought to be scrupulously even-handed – a goal he was more easily able to achieve at ICTY than at ICTR. He built his strategy at both courts {{to a large degree}} on that pursued by the prosecutors at the Nuremberg Tribunal of 1945–46. He served as the chief prosecutor of the two tribunals until September 1996. Among his most notable legal achievements as chief prosecutor was securing the recognition of rape as a war crime under the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} well {{organized}} for defense, {{and in the}} Battle for Brest Middleton's units went about capturing it methodically. The defense {{of the city was}} under German Generalleutnant Hermann Ramcke with whom Middleton carried on a dialog during the siege. Ramcke sent Middleton a map showing where several hundred American prisoners were being held in the city, but also slyly placed on the map a number of red crosses where the Allies knew some good bombing targets were located, such as ammunition depots. Middleton wrote back to Ramcke telling him to remove some of the bogus red crosses, or some terms of the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention</b> might have to be ignored. Middleton also reminded Ramcke of the Allies' superior artillery and air power.|$|E
