40|$|PT. Charoen Pokphand Indonesia Semarang {{is one of}} {{the largest}} poultry feed {{companies}} in Indonesia. To store the finished products that are ready to be distributed, it needs a finished goods warehouse. To minimize the wastes that occur in the process of warehousing the finished goods, the implementation of lean warehouse is required. The core process of finished goods warehouse is the process of putting bag that has been through the process of pallets packing, and then transporting the pallets contained bags of feed at finished goods warehouses and the process of unloading food from the finished goods warehouse to the distribution truck. With the implementation of the lean warehouse, we can know whether the activities are value added or not, to be identified later which type of waste happened. Opinions of stakeholders regarding the waste that must be eliminated first need to be determined by questionnaires. Based on the results of the questionnaires, three top wastes are selected to be identified the cause by using fishbone diagram. They can be repaired by using the implementation of 5 S, namely Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu, and Shitsuke. Defect waste can be minimized by selecting pallet, putting sack correctly, forklift line clearance, applying working procedures, and creating cleaning schedule. Next, overprocessing waste is minimized by removing unnecessary items, putting based on the date of manufacture, and manufacture of <b>feed</b> <b>plan.</b> Inventory waste is minimized by removing junks, putting feed based on the expired date, and cleaning the barn</p...|$|E

Growth performance obtained with two <b>feeding</b> <b>plans</b> previously tested in silico was compared with results from an in vivo experiment on a batch of pigs of the same crossbreed. Pigs were housed in pens of six pigs of the same sex each (n = 168). They were offered feed ad libitum (AL) or were restricted (RA) with an increase in feed allowance of 27 g/d to a maximum allowance of 2. 40 and 2. 70 kg/d, for gilts and barrows, respectively. A two-phase feeding strategy was applied, with 0, 9 and 0. 7 g of digestible lysine per MJ of net energy (NE) in diets provided before or after 65 kg BW (9. 75 MJ NE/kg), respectively. Growth was similar to that obtained by simulation. In vivo, BW 1 was more homogenous with the restricted <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> than with the ad libitum <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> (P = 0. 02), in association with a more homogenous feed intake per pen.

40|$|Lifetime {{performance}} variability is {{a powerful}} tool for evaluating herd management. Although efficiency is a key aspect of performance, it has not been integrated into existing studies on the variability of lifetime performance. The goal of the present article is to analyse the effects of various herd management options on the variability of lifetime performance by integrating criteria relative to feed efficiency. A herd model developed for dairy goat systems was used in three virtual experiments to test the effects of the diet energy level, the segmentation of the <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> and the mean production potential of the herd on the variability of lifetime performance. Principal component analysis showed that the variability of lifetime performance was structured around the first axis related to longevity and production and the second related to the variables used in feed efficiency calculation. The intra-management variability was expressed on the first axis (longevity and production), whereas the inter-management variability was expressed on the second axis (feed efficiency) and was mainly influenced by the combination of the diet energy level and the mean production potential. Similar feed efficiencies were attained with different management options. Still, such combinations relied on different biological bases and, {{at the level of the}} individual, contrasting results were observed in the relationship between the obtained pattern of performance (in response to diet energy) and the reference pattern of performance (defined by the production potential). Indeed, our results showed that over-feeding interacted with the <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> segmentation: a high level of <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> segmentation generated a low proportion of individuals at equilibrium with their production potential, whereas a single ration generated a larger proportion. At the herd level, the diet energy level and the herd production potential had marked effects on production and efficiency due to dilution of fixed production costs (i. e. maintenance requirements). Management options led to similar production and feed efficiencies at the herd level while giving large contrasts in the proportions of individuals at equilibrium with their production potential. These results suggested that analysing individual variability on the basis of criteria related to production processes could improve the assessment of herd management. The herd model opens promising perspectives in studying whether individual variability represents an advantage for herd performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} harvest date for leys {{is one of}} the most {{important}} factors affecting the size and quality of the harvest. An early harvest gives a high nutritive value while a late harvest gives larger quantity. Today’s aim to produce high nutritive leys gives early harvest dates both in primary growth and regrowth in northern part of Sweden. The consequence is a growth in the autumn, a "third harvest". The aim of this master thesis was to study the effects of different harvesting systems and their effect on size, feed quality, wintering and economy for conditions in the northern part of Sweden. How different amount of litter in the spring affects the silage quality has also been studied. On the research station Röbäcksdalen in Umeå, a field trial was started in an existing first year ley in 2006. The ley consisted of red clover, timothy and meadow fescue and was studied under three years (2006 - 2008). During the three years of the trial the ley was harvested according to three systems. One system with two harvests with high nutritive quality, one with three harvests and one with two harvests where the harvesting dates was somewhat later than in the first system. The quality of the silage, microbial and hygienic, was studied in a fermentation study where green forage from the two first systems was used. The quality of the forage in the different systems was compared from <b>feeding</b> <b>plans</b> calculated in the optimisation software NorFor. Also, an economic evaluation was done. The highest yielding system over the three years was the three-harvest system. However, a marked decline in the third year indicates that the system has a problem with persistence. The fermentation study showed that the hygienic status of silage with large amount of litter didn’t differ from the silage without the large litter amount. The calculations of the <b>feeding</b> <b>plans</b> showed that the harvest system with early primary growth harvest gave less expensive feeding rations with less amount of concentrate.

40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of standing pasture biomass in livestock production systems {{is a major}} factor for improving <b>feed</b> <b>planning.</b> Several tools are available to achieve this, including the GrassMaster II capacitance meter. This tool relies on an electrical signal, which is modified by the surrounding pasture. There is limited knowledge on how this capacitance meter performs in Mediterranean pastures. Therefore, we evaluated the GrassMaster II under Mediterranean conditions to determine (i) the effect of pasture moisture content (PMC) on the meter’s ability to estimate pasture green matter (GM) and dry matter (DM) yields, and (ii) the spatial variability and temporal stability of corrected meter readings (CMR) and DM in a bio-diverse pasture. Field tests were carried out with typical pastures of the southern region of Portugal (grasses, legumes, mixture and volunteer annual species) and at different phenological stages (and different PMC). There were significant positive linear relations between CMR and GM (r 2 = 0. 60, P 80 % (r 2 = 0. 57, P < 0. 01, RMSE = 2856. 7 kg ha– 1, CVRMSE= 17. 1 % to GM; and r 2 = 0. 51, P < 0. 01,RMSE = 353. 7 kg ha– 1, CVRMSE = 14. 3 % to DM). Therefore, under the conditions of this current study there exists an optimum PMC (%) for estimating both GM and DM with the GrassMaster II. Repeated-measurements taken at the same location on different dates and conditions in a bio-diverse pasture showed similar and stable patterns between CMR and DM (r 2 = 0. 67, P < 0. 01, RMSE = 136. 1 kg ha– 1, CVRMSE = 6. 5 %).

40|$|This study {{consists}} of a literature study and a survey in Tamil Nadu, India. The aim {{of the study was}} to get an understanding of horse feeding in tropical climates and what kind of feeding related problems that could occur because of the fodder. Information and data were collected from eight different stables and from Tamil Nadu University of Agriculture in the region of Tamil Nadu in March-April 2009. The horses in Tamil Nadu were given rice straw, unknown grass, Cynodon dactylon, lucerne, maize, Pennisetum glaucum x Pennisetum purpureum hybrid and Chloris gayana as roughage. As concentrates, the horses were given wheat bran, oats, barley, soybean meal, maize, carrots, coconut cake, peanut cake, horse gram and chick pea. Tropical grasses contain high amounts of lignin and oxalate, and low amounts of energy, protein and calcium. The high amount of oxalate and low amount of Ca in tropical grasses can lead to Ca deficiency and “big head disease”. Of 126 horses in the survey, 64 horses were measured to calculate their weight, fat scored and tested for dehydration. During the fat scoring, 37 of the 64 horses were judged as normal to good, 21 horses as very poor to poor and only 6 horses as fat to very fat. Only 3 horses showed signs of dehydration. The estimated energy and protein content in the <b>feeding</b> <b>plans</b> at the different stables were compared to the horses theoretically calculated energy and protein requirements.

The R rabbits were fed from 80 % (first days on trial) to 100 % (end of 3 rd wk) of ad libitum intake, whereafter R rabbits had free access to feed. The 3 <b>feeding</b> <b>plans</b> were: MM plan, M diet with moderate digestible energy (DE) content, 10. 6 MJ/kg, throughout the trial; HH plan, H diet with high DE content, 11. 1 MJ/kg, throughout the trial; MH plan, M diet for the first 3 wk and H diet for the last 2 wk. Feed restriction did not affect nutrient digestibility, growth rate on the whole trial and slaughter results, but improved feed conversion (2. 96 vs. 2. 89 in L and R rabbits, respectively; P< 0. 01) and reduced N excretion (2. 16 vs. 2. 07 g excreted N/d, in L and R rabbits; P< 0. 05).

40|$|This review {{describes}} the principal causes of poor welfare in beef cattle and veal calves raised in intensive husbandry systems in Italy. Nowadays {{there are no}} specific regulations in force for beef cattle welfare. However, a document produced in 2001 by the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare of the European Commission on Health and Consumer Protection identified the main causes of inadequate welfare levels in the different cattle rearing systems in Europe. In Italy and in the Po Valley in particular, the beef cattle farms are mainly finishing units characterised by animals kept at high density in multiple pens and fed high starch diets. Under these rearing conditions the limited space allowance {{is one of the}} most important issues impairing animal welfare. Other risk factors for poor welfare related to the housing structures are type of floor, space at the manger, number of water dispensers and lack of specific moving and handling facilities. Microclimatic conditions can be critical especially during the summer season when cattle can experience heat stress. The <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> adopted in the Italian beef farms may be another factor negatively affecting the welfare of these animals due to the low content of long fibre roughage which increases the risk of metabolic acidosis. In the veal calf rearing systems there has been a mandatory introduction of the new system of production according to the European Council Directives 91 / 629 /EEC and 97 / 2 /EC. Farms had to adopt group housing and to provide calves with an increasing amount of fibrous feed in addition to the all-liquid diet. Despite this specific legislation, several risk factors for calves' welfare can still be identified. Some of them are related to the housing system (type of floor, air quality, feed and water supply equipment and lack of loading facilities) and some others to the <b>feeding</b> <b>plan</b> (type and amount of roughage, quality of milk replacers).

We developed a model, called PigOptim that optimizes the <b>feed</b> sequence <b>plan</b> of a population of growing pigs. PigOptim calculates the environmental impacts of pig production by Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). It optimizes the number of feeding phases, the average live weight {{at the beginning of each}} phase, the lysine supply (from 70 % to 130 % of the average requirement of the population) and the formula of each feed with a multi-objective function which integrates gross margin (GM) of the unit and its impact on Climate Change (CC). PigOptim includes response laws of growth performance issued from simulations performed with InraPorc® software for a population. For an optimization of GM only, the best results of GM and CC were obtained for a lysine supply between 90 % and 100 % of the average requirement of the population, whereas animal performance was maximized at 110 % of the average requirement. Indeed, reducing feed costs between 110 % and 90 % of the average lysine requirement compensates for the reduction in growth performance. This result highlights the interest of models accounting for animal variability when investigating economic and environmental issues. The simultaneous optimization of GM and CC led to a reduction of GM and CC, but some other environmental impacts increased. These first results suggest that PigOptim gives consistent estimations of animal performance, GM and environmental impacts. To our knowledge, PigOptim is the first model optimizing <b>feed</b> sequence <b>plan</b> on criteria calculated by LCA. In the future, PigOptim will have to include various environmental impacts in the objective function and will need an improved optimization process for further integration into a decision support system...|$|R

To evaluate the antimicrobial residual concentrations in poultry edible tissues due to contaminated feed, sulfadimethoxine and doxycycline were administered for ten days to chickens by poultry feed incurred at the contamination level frequently recovered during national <b>feed</b> monitoring <b>plans</b> (1 - 5 mg/kg). Sulfadimethoxine and doxycycline residual concentrations detected in muscle...|$|R
40|$|Key {{principles}} underpinning feeding {{guidelines for}} preterm infants include support for developmental care, breastfeeding, milk expression, and creating <b>feeding</b> <b>plans.</b> Early trophic <b>feeding</b> with colostrum and transitional milk improves immune protection and promotes gut maturation. Studies of preterm infants demonstrate that feeding mother 2 ̆ 7 s milk (MM) decreases {{the incidence of}} infection and necrotizing enterocolitis and improves neurodevelopmental outcome but may decrease ponderal and linear growth. Standard practice in neonatal units is to promote mother 2 ̆ 7 s own milk as the feed of choice for all infants. However, it is not feasible or prudent {{to do so for}} all preterm infants. Mothers of preterm infants have lower rates of successful breastfeeding compared with those of term infants. MM can contain harmful bacterial or viral pathogens. Although preterm human milk (HM) contains higher concentrations of protein, sodium, zinc, and calcium than mature HM, it falls short of supplying adequate quantities of nutrients required by preterm infants. Therefore, HM supplemented with nutrients is recommended for all infants born before 32 weeks gestation and for certain infants born at 32 - 36 weeks of gestation. HM is the preferred feed, but preterm formula is an appropriate option when there is an inadequate supply of MM...|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} the simulant preparation procedure for producing multi-component simulants for leaching and filtration studies, including development and comparison activities {{in accordance with}} the test plan() prepared and approved in response to the Test Specification 24590 -WTP-TSP-RT- 06 - 006, Rev 0 (Smith 2006). A fundamental premise is that this approach would allow blending of the different components to simulate a wide variety of feeds to be treated in the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). For example, a given <b>feed</b> from the <b>planned</b> <b>feed</b> vector could be selected, and the appropriate components would then be blended to achieve a representation of that particular feed. Using the blending of component simulants allows the representation of a much broader spectrum of potential feeds to the Pretreatment Engineering Platform (PEP) ...|$|R
