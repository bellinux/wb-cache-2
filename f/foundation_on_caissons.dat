40|$|Many {{major river}} bridges were {{constructed}} in highgly active seismic areas of India much before the seismic code development. Bridges are lifelines infrastructure {{and as a}} result, {{it is necessary to}} requalify/reasses these structures {{in the light of the}} new and improved understanding of seismic resistant design philosophies. The aim of the paper is to develop a simplified methodology to carry out scenario based seismic requalification of major river bridges supported <b>on</b> <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> (aslo known as Well Foundation). An example problem of Saraighat Bridge located in high Himalayan seismic zone is considered to demonstrate the application of the methodology. Field investigation and advanced laboratory tests on soil samples from the bridge site were carried out. The test results reveal that the soil is susceptible to liquefaction and as a result, soil structure interaction analyses are carried out. It is shown that good performance of these type of bridges depend on the displacement response of the pier head so as not to cause unseating of the decks. It is concluded, owing to the large stiffness of the <b>foundations,</b> bridges supported <b>on</b> <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> may not adversely affected by liquefaction induced effects...|$|R

40|$|Suction {{caissons}} are a type {{of offshore}} foundation that allow for fast and noise-free installation and decommissioning of offshore structures. They {{have been used for}} 20 years in {{the oil and gas industry}} and are also becoming more common in the offshore wind sector as a promising way to cost reduction. SPT is a leading contractor for the installation of both single anchor piles and <b>foundations</b> <b>on</b> multiple <b>caissons.</b> The suction caissons are installed by applying a differential pressure between the inner and outer sides of the caissons, which pushes the caissons into the soil. When a platform is founded <b>on</b> multiple suction <b>caissons,</b> the way the wind and wave loads are transferred through the structure and various caissons into the soil will depend on the stiffness of both the platform and the caissons. The design of the substructure and suction caissons should thus be combined to include the effects of soil-structure interaction. This is currently done by modelling the suction caisson foundations as a set of linear-elastic springs attached to the substructure. These springs are however not able to capture the non-linear behaviour that is often characteristic for soils. A method has been developed to model the suction caisson foundations using non-linear springs. The characteristics of the springs are determined using FEM calculations with a nonlinear soil model in the geotechnical software PLAXIS. The springs are then implemented in a structural model of the substructure and the multiple foundations in the structural software SACS. The resulting loads on and displacements of the suction caisson foundations for a test load case have been compared to results from a complete FE model and a model that uses linear-elastic springs. The comparison has shown that the developed model gives results that match well with the results from the full FE model. The linear-elastic model on the other hand gives results that deviate significantly for high loads. When the stresses in the soil increase the soil will behave softer, leading to an increase of the displacements of the suction caissons for high loads. The substructure will help decrease large differences between the displacements of the suction caissons, resulting in a more even load distribution over the foundations and thus smaller design loads for the suction caissons. This allows for smaller suction caissons and savings of material and costs. The model with nonlinear springs is able to predict this behaviour of the soil and the substructure accurately and can be used to make a more efficient design of suction caisson foundations. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} numerical flume {{is developed}} to study cnoidal wave interaction with multiple arranged perforated quasi-ellipse caissons. The continuity equation and the Navier-Stokes equations {{are used as}} the governing equation, and the VOF method is adopted to capture the free surface elevation. The equations are discretized on staggered cells and then solved using a finite difference method. The generation and propagation of cnoidal waves in the numerical flume are tested first. And {{the ability of the}} present model to simulate interactions between waves and structures is verified by known experimental results. Then cnoidal waves with varying incident wave height and period are generated and interact with multiple quasi-ellipse caissons with and without perforation. It is found that the perforation plays an effective role in reducing wave runup/rundown and wave forces <b>on</b> the <b>caissons.</b> The wave forces <b>on</b> <b>caissons</b> reduce with the decreasing incident wave period. The influence of the transverse distance of multiple <b>caissons</b> <b>on</b> wave forces is also investigated. A closer transverse distance between caissons can produce larger wave forces. But when relative adjacent distance L/D (L is the transverse distance and D is the width of the quasi-ellipse caisson) is larger than 3, the effect of adjacent distance is limited...|$|R
