Some of the problems using this thermal process of coating and curing includes: Speed of printing limited by length and speed of pin chain conveyors, high energy costs for gas ovens, and also the can coatings becoming non-functional, when they are overheated in the oven due to slow speed or stoppages. Also, the use of lubricants on the pin chains is kept to a minimum to prevent it from getting into the can. Because of this, pin chains [...] "wear excessively and break frequently".

40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of the apical zone of lactating rat mammary {{epithelial cells}} was studied {{with emphasis on}} vesicle coat structures. Typical 40 - 60 nm ID "coated vesicles" were abundant, frequently associated with the internal filamentous plasma membrane coat or in direct continuity with secretory vesicles (SV) or plasma membrane proper. Bristle coats partially or totally covered membranes of secretory vesicles identified by their casein micelle content. This coat survived SV isolation. Exocytotic fusion of SV membranes and release of the casein micelles was observed. Frequently, regularly arranged bristle coat structures were identified in those regions of the plasma membrane that were involved in exocytotic processes. Both coated and uncoated surfaces of the casein-containing vesicles, as well as typical "coated vesicles", were frequently associated with microtubules and/or microfilaments. We suggest that coat materials of vesicles are related or identical to components of the <b>internal</b> <b>coat</b> of the surface membrane and that new plasma membrane and associated <b>internal</b> <b>coat</b> is produced concomitantly by fusion and integration of bristle coat moieties. Postexocytotic association of secreted casein micelles with the cell surface, mediated by finely filamentous extensions, provided a marker for the integrated vesicle membrane. An arrangement of SV with the inner surface of the plasma membrane is described which is characterized by regularly spaced, heabily stained membrane to membrane cross-bridges (pre-exocytotic attachment plaques).

The comparison between the produced films and commercial samples indicated that the desirable characteristics depend on the nanometric structure of the films and that this structure is sensitive to the heat treatments...|$|E

This <b>internal</b> <b>coat</b> structure remains attached to the membrane during isolation and extraction with low- and high-salt buffers, is insoluble in nondenaturing detergents, and is enriched in an acidic glycoprotein (butyrophilin) with an apparent Mr of 67, 000. Guinea pig antibodies against this protein, which show cross-reaction with the corresponding protein in some (goat) but not other (human, rat) species, {{have been used for}} localization of butyrophilin on frozen sections of various tissues from cow by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Significant reaction is found only in milk-secreting epithelial cells and not in other cell types of mammary gland and various epithelial tissues. In milk-secreting cells, the staining is restricted to the apical cell surface, including budding milk lipid globules, and to the periphery of the milk lipid globules contained in the alveolar lumina. These findings indicate that butyrophilin, which is constitutively secreted by surface budding in coordination with milk lipid production, is located at the apical surface and is not detected at basolateral surfaces, in endoplasmic reticulum, and in the Golgi apparatus.
