25|$|Team New Zealand led {{all the way}} to win race eleven by 15 {{seconds to}} move to match point {{in the race for the}} Cup. During the pre-start, Barker maneuvered in front of Spithill and then delayed both boats {{crossing}} the start line till well after the gun had gone. Oracle performed well on the upwind beat, but Team New Zealand covered well, and the boats rounded opposite marks 17 seconds apart. At the <b>final</b> <b>mark</b> Barker kept Aotearoa between Oracle and the mark, and the rounding was well below the usual speed. Team New Zealand were able to accelerate away leaving Oracle almost dead in the water on the sprint to the finish line, taking the score to 1–8.|$|E
25|$|Having {{left his}} {{equipment}} behind during the hasty retreat, the protagonist, now obviously hallucinating, uses the almost superhuman reflexes afforded {{to him by}} the <b>final</b> <b>Mark</b> to evade death at the hands of both the bandits and the Hisomu stalkers, and travels back to Japan with Ora, who recommends he kill Azai for the dishonor of failing to maintain the traditional Hisomu way. The protagonist uses his almost preternatural abilities to infiltrate past Hisomu-jo's new sophisticated defenses, and confronts Azai in his garden. When Ora arrives and commands the protagonist to slay Azai, Azai claims to be unable to see Ora, and, suggesting that she is a symptom of the protagonist's creeping madness, insists that he satisfy his honor and kill himself before he slips too far beyond reason. Suddenly uncertain, the protagonist is reassured by Ora that Azai is lying to deceive him, and she urges him to murder Azai and purge the dishonorable Hisomu clan who followed him. Upon retrieving the ritual sword, the protagonist experiences a brief psychotic fugue state, in which he symbolically relives the events of his life subsequent to taking on the Mark. He finds himself in a courtyard opposite both Ora and Azai, who kneels and places his own sheathed sword on the ground, awaiting the protagonist's choice.|$|E

30|$|In {{the case}} of {{academic}} outcomes, {{an increase in the}} number of students who pass or an increase of marks would indicate that the actions implemented gave the expected results. First, Pearson’s Chi Square tests (Siegel, 1988) were applied to check significant differences in the percentage of students who did or did not pass in the different years. Second, the <b>final</b> <b>marks</b> neither follow normal distributions for the years of implementation (before or after the experiment) nor present homogeneity of variances. Therefore, instead of an ANOVA, a Kruskal-Wallis test (Siegel, 1988) was performed to check whether the distribution of the <b>final</b> <b>marks</b> in the three years was significantly different (dependent variable: the <b>final</b> <b>marks</b> obtained [best mark of each call for all the students, those who passed or not]; independent variable: year of implementation).|$|R

500|$|... "Digging Your Scene" [...] {{is one of}} The Blow Monkey's most commercially {{successful}} singles. In the United Kingdom, {{the recording}} peaked at number 12, becoming the group's second-highest peaking single, behind [...] "It Doesn't Have to Be This Way", which peaked at number five in January 1987. On the United States' Billboard Hot 100, it entered at number 89 for the week ending 3 May 1986, becoming the issue's fifth-highest entry. The song continued increasing its position on the chart before reaching its peak position of number 14 on 2 August of the same year. The following week, the single decreased its position to number 21. [...] "Digging Your Scene" [...] consistently escalated down the Hot 100 until 6 September 1986 when its position was at number 99, the <b>final</b> <b>mark</b> before departing. It also peaked at number 16 on the Hot 100 Airplay, a component chart for the Billboard Hot 100. The United States remix reached the number seven mark on the Dance Club Songs chart, which was formerly called the Hot Dance/Disco chart. On its 13th week on Canada's official charts, compiled by RPM, [...] "Digging Your Scene" [...] peaked at number 19, also the group's highest entry in that respective country.

2500|$|The <b>final</b> <b>Mark</b> 2 {{carriage}} was departmental 999550, in 1977. [...] it {{is still}} in service with Network Rail as a Track Recording Coach. The later versions (2D onwards) look somewhat similar to the later Mark 3 design. The Mark 3 is longer (75 feet as opposed to 64 feet 6inches), has a large skirting between the bogies to conceal the ancillary equipment, and has a ridged roof {{as opposed to the}} smooth roof of the Mark 2. The development of the High Speed Train overlapped with that of the final production run, and the Mark 2F [...] "previewed" [...] many features incorporated into the Mark 3, such as new seating, plastic interior panelling, and floor-sensor-operated automatic gangway doors.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 90s, {{there was an}} {{appearance}} of gymnasts whose exercise flexibility {{is used as a}} main element (the Russian Yana Batyrchina or Alina Kabáyeba for example), {{which was one of the}} motivations for a major change in the Code of 2001, which doubled the number of required elements of difficulty (although later would be slightly recessed) and reduced the value of the artistic part. The <b>final</b> <b>mark</b> then became an exercise obtained by adding notes difficulty, artistic and execution, each with a maximum value of 10 points, so the final score would be a maximum of 30 points (except the Olympic cycle 2005 [...] 2008, where the final note would be a maximum of 20 points to join the average grade of difficulty and the artistic execution) [...]8.

2500|$|In May 1956, the Mark C was {{discontinued}} and the Mark D introduced. The changes {{between the}} last Mark Cs and the Mark D are, like those between the <b>final</b> <b>Mark</b> As and the Mark B, almost entirely {{hidden from view}} and the cars are externally identical. Beneath the Mark D bonnet however, Villiers had substantially upgraded the [...] engine, which now became the Mark 9E. The main changes were a 4-plate clutch, a heavier final drive chain with simplified adjustment and a higher top-gear ratio. The 9E was said to produce a 12½ per cent increase in power over the 8E, providing a claimed [...] at 4,000rpm. This increased the cruising speed to around , with {{a top speed of}} [...] Electrics were upgraded from 6 volt to 12 volt, allowing more powerful headlights with separate side-lights within the headlamp units. All Deluxe models include the SIBA Dynastart. Other changes which had been gradually introduced onto Mark Cs over the years, were carried over to the Mark D. This included items such as strengthened rear suspension, chrome side flashes on the front wings of Deluxe models and larger rear lights with integrated rear reflectors. As well as the slight weight increase, Sharp's also noted that ground clearance on the Mark D was now only [...] compared to the Mark C's [...]|$|E
6000|$|WE had now reached Switzerland, so {{long the}} <b>final</b> <b>mark</b> and aim of our exertions. We had looked, I know not wherefore, with hope and {{pleasing}} expectation on her congregation of hills and snowy crags, and opened our bosoms with renewed spirits to the icy Biz, which even at Midsummer {{used to come}} from the northern glacier laden with cold. Yet how could we nourish expectation of relief? Like our native England, and the vast extent of fertile France, this mountain-embowered land was desolate of its inhabitants. Nor bleak mountain-top, nor snow-nourished rivulet; not the ice-laden Biz, nor thunder, the tamer of contagion, had preserved them-- why therefore should we claim exemption? ...|$|E
6000|$|...

This is a case of ordinary Double Rule of Three. We multiply A's 3 marks together, and do the same for B. Note that, if A gets a single [...] "0," [...] his <b>final</b> <b>mark</b> is [...] "0," [...] even if he gets full marks for 2 papers while B gets only one mark for each paper. This of course would be very unfair on A, though a correct solution under the given conditions.|$|E

6000|$|But {{this larger}} and more adventurous Christian {{universe}} has one <b>final</b> <b>mark</b> difficult to express; yet as a conclusion of the whole matter I will attempt to express it. All the real argument about religion turns {{on the question of}} whether a man who was born upside down can tell when he comes right way up. The primary paradox of Christianity is that the ordinary condition of man is not his sane or sensible condition; that the normal itself is an abnormality. That is the inmost philosophy of the Fall. In Sir Oliver Lodge's interesting new Catechism, the first two questions were: [...] "What are you?" [...] and [...] "What, then, is the meaning of the Fall of Man?" [...] I remember amusing myself by writing my own answers to the questions; but I soon found that they were very broken and agnostic answers. To the question, [...] "What are you?" [...] I could only answer, [...] "God knows." [...] And to the question, [...] "What is meant by the Fall?" [...] I could answer with complete sincerity, [...] "That whatever I am, I am not myself." [...] This is the prime paradox of our religion; something that we have never in any full sense known, is not only better than ourselves, but even more natural to us than ourselves. And there is really no test of this except the merely experimental one with which these pages began, the test of the padded cell and the open door. It is only since I have known orthodoxy that I have known mental emancipation. But, in conclusion, it has one special application to the ultimate idea of joy.|$|E
6000|$|The great {{principle}} {{of the division of}} labour has been brought to bear on selection. In certain districts (20/12. Wilson in 'Transact. Highland Agricult. Soc.' quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1844 page 29.) [...] "the breeding of bulls is confined to a very limited number of persons, who by devoting their whole attention to this department, are able from year to year to furnish a class of bulls which are steadily improving the general breed of the district." [...] The rearing and letting of choice rams has long been, as is well known, a chief source of profit to several eminent breeders. In parts of Germany this principle is carried with merino sheep to an extreme point. (20/13. Simmonds quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1855 page 637. And for the second quotation see 'Youatt on Sheep' page 171.) So [...] "important is the proper selection of breeding animals considered, that the best flock-masters do not trust to their own judgment or to that of their shepherds, but employ persons called 'sheep-classifiers' who make it their special business to attend to this part of the management of several flocks, and thus to preserve, or if possible to improve, the best qualities of both parents in the lambs." [...] In Saxony, [...] "when the lambs are weaned, each in his turn is placed upon a table that his wool and form may be minutely observed. The finest are selected for breeding and receive a first mark. When they are one year old, and prior to shearing them, another close examination of those previously marked takes place: those in which no defect can be found receive a second mark, and the rest are condemned. A few months afterwards a third and last scrutiny is made; the prime rams and ewes receive a third and <b>final</b> <b>mark,</b> but the slightest blemish is sufficient to cause the rejection of the animal." [...] These sheep are bred and valued almost exclusively for the fineness of their wool; and the result corresponds with the labour bestowed on their selection. Instruments have been invented to measure accurately the thickness of the fibres; and [...] "an Austrian fleece has been produced of which twelve hairs equalled in thickness one from a Leicester sheep." ...|$|E
