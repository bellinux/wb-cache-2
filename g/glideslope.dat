25|$|The pilot also misinformed ATC {{that he is}} {{executing}} ILS approach, {{while in}} fact he was not. The ILS was likely operational, but the ILS frequency was not set because the pilots assumed it was not operational. When the ILS indicator is not in use, its needle is in the middle, same as when the aircraft is exactly following the <b>glideslope.</b> Therefore, the report suggests that the pilot may have believed that {{he is on the}} <b>glideslope,</b> even though he was significantly below it.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes pilots may {{intentionally}} {{operate the}} rudder and ailerons {{in opposite directions}} in a maneuver called a slip. This may be done to overcome crosswinds and keep the fuselage {{in line with the}} runway, or to more rapidly lose altitude by increasing drag, or both. The pilots of Air Canada Flight 143 used a similar technique to land the plane as it was too high above the <b>glideslope.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the final}} approach, the plane descended along the ILS <b>glideslope</b> until at about 700ft, the crew {{visually}} acquired the runway. They disengaged the autopilot but left the autothrottle on. During the flare, {{the rate of}} descent was not arrested, the plane landed with the right wing slightly lower. The right landing gear touched down first, the right engine impacted the runway and the right wing was detached from the fuselage. Since the left wing was still attached, the lift from that wing rolled the fuselage onto its right side, and the plane came to rest inverted in the grass strip next to the runway. The spilled fuel caught fire.|$|E

With the rotorcraft’s potential of flying at much steeper <b>glideslopes</b> than “normally ” done, and their greater performance capabilities due to their lower speeds (e. g. smaller turn radii), it is possible to design IFR procedures with turns or curves on the final approach segment, with <b>glideslopes</b> that are in the range of 6 º to 10 º. The flying quality issues and pilot acceptability of such procedures have not yet been investigated. Description of work In the course of the EU-funde...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{analytical and}} simulation {{results of an}} investigation into proposed operational concepts for closely spaced parallel runways, including the Simplified Aircraft-based Paired Approach (SAPA) with alerting and an escape maneuver, MITRE?s echelon spacing and no escape maneuver, and a hybrid concept aimed at lowering the visibility minima. We found that the SAPA procedure can be used at 950 ft separations or higher with next-generation avionics and that 1150 ft separations or higher is feasible with current-rule compliant ADS-B OUT. An additional 50 ft reduction in runway separation for the SAPA procedure is possible if different <b>glideslopes</b> are used. For the echelon concept we determined that current generation aircraft cannot conduct paired approaches on parallel paths using echelon spacing on runways less than 1400 ft apart and next-generation aircraft {{will not be able}} to conduct paired approach on runways less than 1050 ft apart. The hybrid concept added alerting and an escape maneuver starting 1 NM from the threshold when flying the echelon concept. This combination was found to be effective, but the probability of a collision can be seriously impacted if the turn component of the escape maneuver has to be disengaged near the ground (e. g. 300 ft or below) due to airport buildings and surrounding terrain. We also found that stabilizing the approach path in the straight-in segment was only possible if the merge point was at least 1. 5 to 2 NM from the threshold unless the total system error can be sufficiently constrained on the offset path and final turn...|$|R

2500|$|Nevertheless, Captain Nowroz's {{decision}} to approach Gatwick {{with a view}} to landing there presented [...] "no undue risk" [...] and did not cause the accident. Instead, the cause was found to be a series of changes to speed, power and flap angle settings which were not in accordance with the airline's operating procedures and which took place in the last [...] of the approach. At 0128, the aircraft picked up the ILS localiser beam, and the flaps were lowered in three stages as the aircraft's speed reduced. Soon afterwards, as it approached the ILS <b>glideslope</b> beam, its height and speed were reduced further and the undercarriage was extended. Then the Captain saw a light which he mistook for one {{at the far end of}} the runway—it was actually on a hill beyond the airport—and the [...] "stabiliser out of trim" [...] warning light came on. This had been faulty earlier in the flight, and the Captain disengaged the autopilot and the automatic <b>glideslope</b> tracker. At 0133, the flap angle was increased; the aircraft then began to fall below the approach slope and was travelling faster than the crew thought. Only when it reached a height of [...] was an attempt made to gain height, but this happened too late.|$|E
2500|$|The NTSB {{investigated}} {{the accident and}} was able to retrieve both the CVR and FDR. The investigators concluded that, based on the retrieved flight data and simulations, the flight crew very likely operated the flight director improperly, inadvertently switching it into a [...] "go around" [...] mode during the final approach, instead of the appropriate approach mode. This caused confusion and additional pressure, and contributed to the unstablized approach and deviation from the glide path. According to the CVR, no altitude callouts were made by the crew during the final approach, as the aircraft descended below the <b>glideslope</b> and decision height, until it struck the seawall and crashed.|$|E
2500|$|G-AJDL left Northolt at 7:27, about 25 minutes late. Two {{hours later}} it was on {{approach}} to Nutts Corner.

This impact caused the aircraft to break up. There was a slight fire after the accident.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controller}} requested Flight 821 {{to check}} the altitude: [...] "According to my data, you are climbing. Confirm current altitude 900 meters." [...] The aircraft should have been {{at an altitude of}} 600 m at that time to descend further 300 m. The pilot replied [...] "Roger, we are descending" [...] and initiated a climb to about 1200 m, at which point he could no longer catch the <b>glideslope.</b> The controller instructed the pilot to turn right and go around.

The controller asked whether everything was all right with the crew; the pilots confirmed that it was.|$|E
2500|$|The flight {{experienced}} some turbulence but was uneventful until shortly after 1:00a.m. on August 6, as the jet {{was preparing to}} land.

Continuing to descend, the aircraft reached its minimum descent altitude (MDA) of [...] – the lowest altitude to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure where no electronic <b>glideslope</b> is provided (the airport was not equipped with an instrument landing system) – but both pilots said that they still had no visual reference to the runway or its approach lighting system because of the thick fog. One pilot discerned some lights in the distance but was not sure what exactly they belonged to.|$|E
2500|$|GP Express Airlines Flight 861 was {{to operate}} from Atlanta to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, with an {{intermediate}} stop in Anniston. The flight was operated as a Department of Transportation Essential Air Service (EAS) flight. In Atlanta, four passengers and six bags were loaded on the fifteen-passenger aircraft for the flight. During the flight, intercom problems created difficulty in {{communication between the}} crew. Additionally, the crew encountered problems with a battery and autofeather system. As the flight approached Anniston, confusion developed in the cockpit regarding the aircraft’s position and correct course to Anniston. While a visual approach was considered, visual conditions necessitated an instrument landing system approach to Runway 5 at Anniston. The crew experienced difficulty establishing the <b>glideslope</b> to Runway 5 and discussed minimum decision heights and missed approach procedures immediately before the aircraft impacted a heavily wooded ridge approximately 7.5 {{miles north of the}} Anniston airport in conditions of fog and low-lying clouds. The aircraft was destroyed by impact and post-accident fire.|$|E
2500|$|The aircraft, {{flying at}} , had been {{vectored}} by Boston's approach control to intercept the final approach course to the ILS runway 4R approach at a 45 degree angle, about [...] outside the outer marker. As {{it was later}} revealed, the controller was busy handling a potential collision conflict between two other aircraft, and therefore neglected to clear Flight 723 for the approach. The flight crew had to ask the controller for approach clearance, which was immediately given, {{but by that time}} [...] more than a minute after the intercept vector had been issued [...] they were high and fast and almost over the outer marker. The flight crew subsequently failed to stabilize the aircraft's descent rate and airspeed, descended below the <b>glideslope</b> and drifted away from the localizer course, hitting a seawall about [...] {{to the right of the}} extended runway centerline, about [...] short of the runway's displaced threshold. The aircraft was destroyed, killing 87 of its 89 occupants. One of the two survivors died after two hours, and the other, Leopold Chouinard, died of burn injuries on December 11, 1973; Chouinard is not listed as a Delta 723 fatality due to language in the Code of Federal Regulations that defines a fatality as taking place within 30 days of the accident.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was {{cleared to land}} by controllers at Tashkent at around 1900 hours local time.

[...] As the plane approached the threshold of the runway, it was still 30 to 40 meters above ground level, when it should have been less than half that height and in landing configuration. [...] When the pilots became aware that they were running out of runway, they increased engine power, {{but it was too late}} for the aircraft to climb and go around. The right wing of the aircraft struck either a radio beacon or a stanchion of approach lights, which tore off the wing, and then hit a concrete wall, losing the left wing. Flight 1154 then flipped over and exploded. Rescue services reached the crash site but found no survivors. Among the dead were senior United Nations official Richard Conroyan Australian/British dual citizen and a Canadian aid worker, country manager for the Christian relief organization, World Concern, Richard Penner.|$|E

On some aircraft is only the <b>glideslope</b> indicated on two main instruments, and the oldest version of ILS-instruments was an instrument of its own used instead. This usedtwo dangeling bars, fixed in the middle of the top (localizer indicator) and in the middle of the left side (<b>glideslope</b> indicator), and if the aircraft was located on the intended glidepath, the dangeling bars formed a cross. This is, in theory, however, more difficult to learn—but even for pilots experienced with using such indicators, it added another instrument they needed to focus on.
