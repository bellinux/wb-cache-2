5|$|Crawford {{originally}} created Frog Fractions {{to entertain}} his friends, {{and to see}} their reactions when they first played it. Later on, he felt that with the indie genre taking off, Frog Fractions was taken more seriously among gamers.

Instead, Crawford explained that Frog Fractions had an <b>educational</b> theme because of the name's alliteration, and because he considered <b>educational</b> games {{a part of his}} youth.|$|E
