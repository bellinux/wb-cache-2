40|$|The murine albino-deletion complex {{developed}} {{as part of}} the Oak Ridge specific-locus test covers 6 - 11 cM of chromosome 7. This complex {{has proven to be a}} valuable resource for localizing traits to a small target region suitable for positional cloning. In this study, we mapped the endpoints of deletions in this complex using all of the available Mit simple-sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) markers. Concurrently, this mapping has determined the map order of nearly all of the SSLP markers, most of which were previously unresolved. The SSLP-based <b>deletion</b> <b>map</b> was confirmed and genetic distances were determined using the European Collaborative Interspecific Backcross panel of nearly a thousand mice. The average SSLP marker resolution is 0. 3 - 0. 4 cM, comparable to the cloning capacity of yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs). The SSLP markers were then used to construct a genetically anchored YAC framework map that further confirms the <b>deletion</b> <b>map.</b> We find that the largest deleted region distal to Tyr is about two to three times larger than the largest proximal deleted region, and the original C 3 H/ 101 regions flanking the deletions (moved to an St 2 A c(ch) /c(ch) background) are smaller than anticipated, which we suggest may result from increased recombination rates immediately flanking the deleted regions...|$|E
40|$|Non-flagellate H 2 mutants were {{isolated}} from a phase- 2 stable strain, SJW 806 HI-gt- H 2 -enPn vh 2 -, a derivative of Salmonella typhimurium. By transductional crosses a <b>deletion</b> <b>map</b> and a recombination {{map of the}} H 2 gene were made. There are three regions especially rich in nonflagellate mutational sites. By {{the use of the}} <b>deletion</b> <b>map,</b> mutational sites of 21 flagellar shape mutants were also determined. Most of them were located at two regions which coincide with two of the three regions rich in non-flagellate mutational sites. A gene, vh 2, is closely linked to the promoter side of the H 2 gene. Three-factor transductional crosses showed that the oh 2 gene was on the left of the H 2 gene in the present map. The H 2 gene forms part of an operon with the distal gene rhl which specifies the HI repressor. Thus, a polarity effect of the H 2 mutations on the expression of the rhl gene was examined by observing whether a wild-type HI allele introduced into the H 2 mutants was expressed or not. Many of the H 2 mutations were polar, and most of the strongly polar mutations were located in the left (promoter-proximal) half of the HZgene, while most of the mutations in the right half of the gene were weakly polar or non-polar...|$|E

The two clusters were located in the left arm of vegetative φ 80 (the tail specifying cluster being distal).

40|$|A plasmid {{of about}} 140 megadaltons has been {{associated}} with the invasiveness of Shigella flexneri. Upon subculturing in liquid media of fully virulent isolates of Shigella flexneri 2 a YSH 6000, which contains only a 230 -kilobase-pair (kbp) plasmid in addition to 3. 3 - and 4. 2 -kbp cryptic plasmids characteristic to all S. flexneri strains, loss of invasiveness, loss of Congo red binding activity (Pcr), and complete loss of, or a deletion, or even a single-site IS insertion in the plasmid occurred simultaneously. This was ascribed to the fact that, once a noninvasive Pcr- cell has emerged, it overgrows the wild type as a consequence of its selective advantage in artificial media. A <b>deletion</b> <b>map</b> of the 230 -kbp plasmid was made by analyzing SalI digests of 39 deletion derivatives plus 1 formed by insertion of an IS 1 -like element in independently isolated, noninvasive Pcr- mutants. Of 39 deletion derivatives, 16 belonged to a single type, and 6 belonged to another, suggesting deletion hot spots. The <b>deletion</b> <b>map</b> was confirmed and extended by analyzing 359 SalI-generated partial digests of the wild-type plasmid cloned into pBR 322. Three copies of IS 1 -like elements were found on three different SalI fragments by Southern hybridization. Segments required for the Pcr+ phenotype seemed to occur at several different locations in the plasmid. Each of 28 representative Pcr- mutants were negative by the Sereny test.

40|$|Kallmann {{syndrome}} is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia. Six families {{in which the}} disorder followed an X-linked inheritance were investigated by linkage analysis. Diagnostic criteria were uniformly applied and included tests for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia. Close linkage was found by using the hypervariable repeated sequence CRI-S 232 (DXS 278) previously mapped to Xp 22. 3. At a maximum lod score of 6. 5, the recombination fraction was calculated as. 03. Of 30 fully informative meioses, one recombination between the disease locus and the loci recognized by probe CRI-S 232 was observed. When an independent approach is used, these results confirm the X-linked Kallmann syndrome assignment previously made by <b>deletion</b> <b>mapping,</b> and allow definitive localization of the syndrome assignment previously made by <b>deletion</b> <b>mapping,</b> and allow definitive localization of the syndrome to the Xp 22. 3 region.
