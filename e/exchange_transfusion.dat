2500|$|The first {{treatment}} for Rh disease was an <b>exchange</b> <b>transfusion,</b> which {{was invented by}} Alexander S. Wiener. [...] That procedure was further refined by Harry Wallerstein, a transfusionist. [...] Although the most effective method of treating the problem at the time, it was only partially ameliorative in cases where damage to the neonate had already been done. [...] Children with severe motor damage and/or retardation could result. [...] However, {{it is estimated that}} in the two decades it was used approximately 200,000 lives were saved, and the great majority were not brain damaged.|$|E
2500|$|Management {{is similar}} to vaso-occlusive crisis, with the {{addition}} of antibiotics (usually a quinolone or macrolide, since cell wall-deficient [...] bacteria are thought to contribute to the syndrome), oxygen supplementation for hypoxia, and close observation. Should the pulmonary infiltrate worsen or the oxygen requirements increase, simple blood transfusion or <b>exchange</b> <b>transfusion</b> is indicated. The latter involves the exchange of {{a significant portion of the}} person's red cell mass for normal red cells, which decreases the percent of haemoglobin S in the patient's blood. The patient with suspected acute chest syndrome should be admitted to the hospital with worsening A-a gradient an indication for ICU admission.|$|E
2500|$|IVIG {{has been}} used to {{successfully}} treat many cases of HDN. It {{has been used}} not only on anti-D, but on anti-E as well. IVIG can be used to reduce the need for <b>exchange</b> <b>transfusion</b> and to shorten the length of phototherapy. The AAP recommends [...] "In isoimmune hemolytic disease, administration of intravenousγ-globulin (0.5-1 g/kg over 2 hours) is recommended if the TSB is rising despite intensive phototherapy or the TSB level is within 2 to 3 mg/dL (34-51 μmol/L) of the exchange level [...] If necessary, this dose can be repeated in 12 hours (evidence quality B: benefits exceed harms).

40|$|Of 40 {{patients}} with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, 17 {{were treated with}} plasma exchange, 15 with <b>exchange</b> <b>transfusions,</b> and 6 with both types of therapy. One patient died before being treated and another patient was seen but not treated. Plasma exchange was performed daily for a mean of seven exchanges per patient. The replacement fluid during plasma exchange was fresh frozen plasma in all cases. The complete response rates {{for each type of}} treatment were as follows: 88 % for plasma exchange (15 patients), 47 % for <b>exchange</b> <b>transfusions</b> (7 patients), and 67 % for <b>exchange</b> <b>transfusions</b> and plasma <b>exchange</b> (4 patients). Clinical and laboratory factors were examined for any statistically significant association with therapy response. Treatment with plasma exchange was statistically the initial factor most strongly associated with prognosis. Paresis, paresthesias, seizures, mental status change, and coma showed no association with response to treatment. Some of the laboratory factors that did not show significant association with treatment response were the initial creatinine, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase, and total bilirubin. This study supports the hypothesis that plasma exchange has significantly improved the prognosis of {{patients with}} thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. These patients should be treated aggressively regardless of the severity of their symptoms...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground and objectivesTo {{determine}} the effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) on the course of late hyporegenerative anemia and the requirement for <b>exchange</b> <b>transfusions,</b> phototherapy and top-up red blood cell transfusions due to rhesus hemolytic disease of the newborn (Rh-HDN). Patients and methodsThis is retrospective cohort study of newborns with Rh-HDN who were treated with or without IVIg. Relevant maternal and neonatal data were obtained and analyzed. All infants were followed up as outpatients for a period of 2 – 3 months, and during the follow ups, complete blood counts (RBCs) were performed every two weeks to diagnose late hyporegenerative anemia. ResultsSixty-six infants with Rh-HDN were enrolled in this study (42 in the IVIg group and 24 in the no-IVIg group). We observed {{no significant differences between the}} two groups in terms of maternal age, number of previous children affected with Rh-HDN, intrauterine transfusions, gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), Apgar scores at the 1 st or 5 th minutes, <b>exchange</b> <b>transfusions,</b> or days on phototherapy. The serum bilirubin immediately after birth and the maximum serum bilirubin during the hospital course were significantly higher in the IVIG group (P = 0. 0035 and P = 0. 0225, respectively). Although there were no statistically significant differences, there was a trend toward the late anemia in the IVIg group being diagnosed and resolved earlier than in the no-IVIg group. Additionally, a greater proportion of the IVIg group required three or more top-up transfusions compared to the no-IVIg group, but this difference was not statistically significant. ConclusionIVIg might have had an effect on the early development of late anemia and might have shortened the duration of late anemia relative to the infants who did not receive IVIg. The <b>exchange</b> <b>transfusions</b> and the days on phototherapy were not affected by IVIg...|$|R
40|$|Background. Hemolytic {{disease of}} the fetus and newborn (HDFN) {{develops}} because of the passage of maternal erythrocyte alloantibodies through the placenta. These antibodies cause a reduction of the erythrocyte life span in the fetus and newborn. This severe form of the disease is most commonly caused by anti-D antibodies. Besides those, the hemolytic disease can also be caused by anti-K, anti-c, anti-E, anti-A, anti-B and some other antibodies. Methods and material. A case of a pregnant {{woman who has been}} pregnant four times is presented. During the first pregnancy, she developed anti-D erythrocyte antibodies, and after the third pregnancy also additional anti-C antibodies. During the first pregnancy, hemolytic disease of fetus led to the intrauterine death of the fetus. The second child died one day after birth. The third and fourth fetuses required several intrauterine <b>exchange</b> <b>transfusions</b> due to high titers and great hemolytic activity of anti-D antibodies. In both newborns, <b>exchange</b> <b>transfusions</b> had to be performed after birth, and both received additional transfusions of concentrated erythrocytes because of anemia. Conclusions. HDFN is a severe disorder that can be successfully prevented with appropriate legalized measures. </p...|$|R
