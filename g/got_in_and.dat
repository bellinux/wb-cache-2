500|$|While {{taking a}} bath, {{he noticed that}} the level of the water in the tub rose as he <b>got</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> {{realized}} that this effect could be used to determine the volume of the crown. For practical purposes water is incompressible, so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying [...] "Eureka!" [...] ( [...] , heúrēka!", meaning [...] "I have found !"). The test was conducted successfully, proving that silver had indeed been mixed in.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] was filmed from April 7 to April 9, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Hype Williams. It officially premiered on Vevo on April 30, 2010. On working with Williams {{and the new}} looks she developed in the video, Aguilera stated, [...] "...someone with {{that much of a}} catalog under his belt and success as a video maker, he's like a legend. So again entering into the collaborating factor, I didn't know what to expect ... and he's probably thinking the same about me. And when we walked away from working with each other, it was just a love connection. I wanted to maintain and keep consistent with the look of the album packaging and book, and I really wanted to keep all that in line, and so he really paid attention, and I think it's really iconic and classic. We totally made magic together on a creative level, it was absolutely amazing. He really <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> listened to where my music was at".|$|E
2500|$|The 1991 edition {{restored}} many expurgated sections, primarily {{dealing with}} the changes that befall human civilization {{over the course of}} William Mandella's life. This version's cover [...] "has a futuristic soldier who looks like Robin Williams in a funny hat," [...] as Haldeman notes, [...] "But alas, not all of the changes <b>got</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> the book has some internal contradictions because of things left over from the [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's sexual overtones {{led to its}} {{enthusiastic}} {{acceptance in}} American gay clubs shortly after its release. Bono commented on this phenomenon, saying, [...] "First of all we started out and made Boy, which is a sexual LP, and we changed the cover in America to stop any concern there might be about paedophilia and the like, because it was our first album. But import copies <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>and,</b> as you know, in America a lot of music is broken in gay clubs {{and so we had}} a gay audience, {{a lot of people who}} were convinced the music was specifically for them. So there was a misconception if you like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the best}} {{endorsement}} made of Cosgrave, {{came from his}} old rival Éamon de Valera, with whom he was reconciled before his death. De Valera, once in 1932 and later close to his own death, made two major comments. To an interviewer, when asked what was his biggest mistake, he said without a pause, [...] "not accepting the Treaty". To his own son, Vivion, weeks after taking power in 1932 and reading the files on the actions of Cosgrave's governments in relation to its work in the Commonwealth, he said of Cosgrave and Cosgrave's ministers [...] "when we <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> saw the files[...] [...] they did a magnificent job, Viv. They did a magnificent job." ...|$|E
2500|$|Poirot's {{explanation}} {{solves the}} case to the satisfaction of Carla and, most importantly, her fiancé. But, as Elsa forces him to admit, it cannot be proven. Poirot states that, although his chances of getting a conviction are slim, he does not intend to simply leave her to her rich, privileged life. Privately, however, she confides the full measure of her defeat. Caroline, having earned redemption, went uncomplainingly to prison, where she died soon after. Elsa has always felt that the husband and wife escaped together, and her own life has been empty since. The last paragraph of the novel underlines this defeat: [...] "The chauffeur held open the door of the car. Lady Dittisham <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> the chauffeur wrapped the fur rug around her knees." ...|$|E
