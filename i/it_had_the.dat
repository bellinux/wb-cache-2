5|$|Brettingham {{moved on}} to other projects. In the 1760s, he was {{approached}} by his most illustrious patron, the Duke of York (brother of King George III), to design one of the greatest mansions in Pall Mall, namely York House. The rectangular mansion that Brettingham designed was built in the Palladian style on two principal floors, with the state rooms as at Norfolk House, arranged in a circuit around the central staircase hall. The house was a mere pastiche of Norfolk House, but for Brettingham <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> kudos of a royal occupant.|$|E

5|$|Cinematographer V. Manikandan {{abandoned}} the project halfway through, {{until he was}} replaced with Ravi Varman. The technical departments were headed by V. T. Vijayan (editing), Sabu Cyril (production design), and Peter Hein (stunt choreography), and the soundtrack was composed by Harris Jayaraj, who was in his first collaboration with the director. The film was touted as the director's magnum opus and was budgeted at 263.8 million, making {{it at the time}} of its release the most expensive South Indian film ever made. Notably, it was the first South Indian film to obtain institutional finance, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> highest insurance coverage available for films at that time.|$|E

5|$|Development began {{shortly after}} the release of Christmas Nights in November 1996. Producer Yuji Naka wanted to create a game which {{involved}} saving people rather than killing them. Sonic Team chose to connect the game with firefighting as they thought it was an effective way of having players identify with heroism. Burning Rangers received mostly positive reviews. Critics unanimously commended the game's soundtrack and audio, with the voice navigation system receiving particular praise. The response to the graphics was mixed, with some critics asserting that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> best visuals on the Saturn, although it was noted for its poor collision detection and occasional glitching. The game was among the final five Saturn titles released in America.|$|E

5|$|Footprints {{belonging}} to the ichnogenus Brachychirotherium are often associated with aetosaurs. Brachychirotherium has been found from Rio Grande do Sul in Paleorrota, Brazil as well as Italy, Germany, and the eastern United States. They are also common in the southwestern United States, having been found from Canyonlands National Park and Dinosaur National Monument. Many of these tracks have a narrow gauge (meaning left and right prints are placed closely together) and nearly overstep each other. A 2011 functional analysis of the skeleton of Typothorax coccinarum indicated that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> range of movement necessary to produce the tracks.|$|E

On returning to England, Cockcroft arranged through Lord Melchett for Laurence to receive a $5,000 grant to continue his research.

5|$|In 1873, {{following}} the abdication of Amadeus, Duke of Aosta, as King (1870–1873) and with Spain's change from Kingdom to Republic, the Spanish government issued a new colonial flag for Puerto Rico.

5|$|In 1938, Walter Baade {{became the}} first {{astronomer}} to identify a nebula as a supernova remnant when he suggested that the Crab Nebula was the remains of SN 1054.

During the same year, Baade first proposed {{the use of the}} Type Ia supernova as a secondary distance indicator. Later, the work of Allan Sandage and Gustav Tammann helped refine the process so that Type Ia supernovae became a type of standard candle for measuring large distances across the cosmos.|$|E
