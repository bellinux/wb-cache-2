Indeed, erect-limbs may be omnipresent in pterosaurs.|$|E

5|$|<b>Footprints</b> {{from the}} Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when Currie and colleagues {{described}} several {{examples from the}} Nemegt locality. Most of these <b>footprints</b> belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while two have been left by a large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which showed a matching hind foot morphology. The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym, making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another, similar titanosaur. The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, Charles Mortram Sternberg {{reported}} {{the presence of}} the <b>footprints</b> of a large, four-footed dinosaur from Lower Cretaceous rocks in British Columbia, Canada. He described a new ichnogenus and species for these tracks, Tetrapodosaurus borealis, and attributed them to ceratopsians. However, in 1984 paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter re-examined the British Columbian Tetrapodosaurus prints and argued that they were made by ankylosaurs rather than ceratopsians. Specifically, Carpenter concluded that these were probably the <b>footprints</b> of Sauropelta. Five years later, large numbers of Tetrapodosaurus tracks were discovered at the Smoky River Coal Mine near Grande Cache, Alberta.

5|$|The Glen Rose Formation {{of central}} Texas {{preserves}} many dinosaur <b>footprints,</b> including large, three-toed theropod prints. The {{most famous of}} these trackways was discovered along the Paluxy River in Dinosaur Valley State Park, a section of which is now on exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, although several other sites around the state have been described in the literature. It is impossible to say what animal made the prints, since no fossil bones {{have been associated with}} the trackways. However, scientists have long considered it likely that the <b>footprints</b> belong to Acrocanthosaurus. A 2001 study compared the Glen Rose <b>footprints</b> to the feet of various large theropods but could not confidently assign them to any particular genus. However, the study noted that the tracks were within the ranges of size and shape expected for Acrocanthosaurus. Because the Glen Rose Formation is close to the Antlers and Twin Mountains Formations in both geographical location and geological age, and the only large theropod known from those formations is Acrocanthosaurus, the study concluded that Acrocanthosaurus was most likely to have made the tracks.|$|E

The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the <b>footprints</b> in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the <b>footprints</b> were made and the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{heritage}} {{sites have}} been gaining popularity as tourism destinations. The arrival {{of large numbers}} of tourists, however, has created serious challenges to these vulnerable ecosystems. In particular, water resources are facing tremendous pressure. Thus, an assessment of tourism water <b>footprint</b> is suggested before promoting sustainable tourism. This paper uses the bottom-up approach to construct a framework on the tourism water <b>footprint</b> of agricultural heritage sites. The tourism water <b>footprint</b> consists of four components, namely accommodation water <b>footprint,</b> diet water <b>footprint,</b> transportation water <b>footprint</b> and sewage dilution water <b>footprint.</b> Yuanyang County, a representative of the Honghe Hani rice terraces, was selected as the study area. Field surveys including questionnaires, interviews and participant observation approaches were undertaken to study the tourism water <b>footprint</b> and water capacity of the heritage site. Based on the results, measures to improve the tourism water capacity have been put forward, which should provide references for making policies that aim to maintain a sustainable water system and promote tourism development without hampering the sustainability of the heritage system. The sewage dilution water <b>footprint</b> and the diet water <b>footprint</b> were top contributors to the tourism water <b>footprint</b> of the subject area, taking up 38. 33 % and 36. 15 % of the tourism water <b>footprint,</b> respectively, followed by the transportation water <b>footprint</b> (21. 47 %). The accommodation water <b>footprint</b> had the smallest proportion (4. 05 %). The tourism water capacity of the heritage site was 14, 500 tourists per day. The water pressure index was 97 %, indicating that the water <b>footprint</b> was still within the water capacity, but there is a danger that the water <b>footprint</b> may soon exceed the water capacity. As a consequence, we suggest that macro and micro approaches, including appropriate technologies, awareness enhancement and diversified tourism product development throughout the whole year that can alleviate the water pressure at critical times, could be taken to optimize the water management of the heritage sites...|$|R
