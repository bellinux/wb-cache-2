When producing the film, she chose young director Garin Nugroho, whom she perceived to be highly talented; she also took the leading role. During production, she made a mistake that required the reshooting of all footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans of exposed film to send to the developing lab at once; the lab then notified her that a technical <b>fault</b> <b>with</b> the camera had rendered all of it unusable and that the problem could have been detected earlier had she sent each can as it was filmed.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} a comparative, field-based hydrogeological characterization of exhumed, inactive fault zones in low-porosity Triassic dolostones and limestones of the Hochschwab massif, a carbonate unit of high economic importance supplying 60 % of {{the drinking water}} of Austria’s capital, Vienna. Cataclastic rocks and sheared, strongly cemented breccias form low-permeability ( 3 % and permeabilities > 1, 000 mD form high-permeability domains. With respect to fault-zone architecture and rock content, which is demonstrated to be different for dolostone and limestone, four types of faults are presented. <b>Faults</b> <b>with</b> single-stranded minor <b>fault</b> cores, <b>faults</b> <b>with</b> single-stranded permeable <b>fault</b> cores, and <b>faults</b> <b>with</b> multiple-stranded <b>fault</b> cores are seen as conduits. <b>Faults</b> <b>with</b> single-stranded impermeable <b>fault</b> cores are seen as conduit-barrier systems. Karstic carbonate dissolution occurs along fault cores in limestones and, to a lesser degree, dolostones and creates superposed high-permeability conduits. On a regional scale, faults of a particular deformation event have {{to be viewed as}} forming a network of flow conduits directing recharge more or less rapidly towards the water table and the springs. Sections of impermeable fault cores only very locally have the potential to create barriers...|$|R

5|$|Stephen {{also found}} <b>fault</b> <b>with</b> Symeon for revering his spiritual father, Symeon the Studite. At that time, formal {{recognition}} of saints was seldom practiced and not obligatory, so revered monks were informally recognized and honored by monasteries {{and by their}} disciples. Every year the younger Symeon arranged a celebration honoring his teacher, which included an icon of Symeon the Studite and a service to him. Stephen rebuked Symeon for honoring his teacher as a saint, because in his opinion the Studite was not worth of any honor. The conflict between the two lasted for six years.|$|E
5|$|Stephen found <b>fault</b> <b>with</b> Symeon {{especially}} for his charismatic approach, and {{his support of}} individual direct experience of God's grace. Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, {{without the need for}} formal ordination—as practiced by his own teacher, Symeon the Studite. Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, while Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience. Symeon's teachings, especially those regarding the direct experience of God's grace, brought accusations of heresy from Stephen. Symeon responded to Stephen's charges by declaring that the real heresy was to teach {{that it is impossible to}} have direct experience of God (Disc. 29.4).|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{displacement}} along the Imperial Fault {{was very similar}} to that observed for {{the northern part of the}} rupture during the 1940 El Centro earthquake, although on this occasion the rupture did not extend across the border into Mexico. This had been explained as the behavior of individual slip patches along the Imperial <b>Fault</b> <b>with</b> two patches rupturing in 1940 and only the northern one in 1979. The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source strong motion recordings. This analysis showed that the rupture speed had at times exceeded the shear wave velocity, making this the first earthquake for which supershear rupture was inferred.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} spring of 313, as Licinius {{advanced}} against Maximinus, the latter resorted to savagery in his dealings with his own citizens, and his Christians in particular. In May 313, Maximinus issued one more edict of toleration, hoping to persuade Licinius to stop advancing, and win more public support. For the first time, Maximinus issued a law which offered comprehensive toleration {{and the means to}} effectively secure it. As in his earlier letter, Maximinus is apologetic but one-sided. Maximinus absolves himself for all the failings of his policy, locating <b>fault</b> <b>with</b> local judges and enforcers instead. He frames the new universal toleration as a means of removing all ambiguity and extortion. Maximinus then declares full freedom of religious practice, encourages Christians to rebuild their churches, and pledges to restore Christian property lost in the persecution. The edict changed little: Licinius defeated Maximinus at the Battle of Adrianople on April 30, 313; the now-powerless Maximinus committed suicide at Tarsus in the summer of 313. On June 13, Licinius published the Edict of Milan in Nicomedia.|$|E
5|$|Segrè's group set up its {{equipment}} in a disused Forest Service {{cabin in the}} Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos in August 1943. His group's task was to measure and catalog the radioactivity of various fission products. An important line of research was determining the degree of isotope enrichment achieved with various samples of enriched uranium. Initially, the tests using mass spectrometry, used by Columbia University, and neutron assay, used by Berkeley, gave different results. Segrè studied Berkeley's results and could find no error, while Kenneth Bainbridge likewise found no <b>fault</b> <b>with</b> New York's. However, analysis of another sample showed close agreement. Higher rates of spontaneous fission were observed at Los Alamos, which Segrè's group concluded were due to cosmic rays, which were more prevalent at Los Alamos due to its high altitude.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors {{and that there was}} no <b>fault</b> <b>with</b> the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown to the left and needed to adjust course to the right. Because he was in a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes to happen, and his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him.|$|E

40|$|We have {{employed}} numerical approaches to study earthquake nucleation on geometrically complex faults governed by either slip-dependent friction or rate- and state- dependent friction. The interactions of fault friction, complex fault geometry and remote slow stressing from plate tectonics are investigated. In particular, {{we focus on}} characterizing three important physical aspects of an earthquake: the occurrence time, hypocenter location and earthquake source dimensions. Using a slip dependent friction law, we have investigated earthquake nucleation on both thrust and normal dip-slip <b>faults</b> <b>with</b> changes in dip (bends) at depth. Our results show that earthquakes tend to nucleate at shallower depth on thrust faults as compared to those on normal <b>faults</b> <b>with</b> the same geometry. Nucleation time increases significantly as the fault plane are bent more severe for both thrust and normal faults. Using the rate- and state-dependent friction, we studied nucleation on two parallel planar <b>faults</b> <b>with</b> step-over features. We focus on investigating how nucleation {{is affected by the}} offset between the two faults. We found that for <b>faults</b> <b>with</b> compressional step-overs, earthquakes tend to nucleate the end of the overlapping zone when the offset is small, but generally nucleate further away from the overlapping end as the offset becomes larger. For <b>faults</b> <b>with</b> extensional step-overs, nucleation always occurs near the overlapping end for all the offsets considered. Our studies provide better understanding of the effects of fault geometry on earthquake nucleation and form a basis for the study of nucleation on large scale geometrically complex fault systems such as fault systems in Southern California. Our results may also provide realistic earthquake source conditions for rupture dynamics studies which at present largely employ ad hoc source conditions...|$|R
