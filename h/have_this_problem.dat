The combined Kaldor–Hicks criterion does not <b>have</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> but it can be non-transitive (though A may be an improvement over B, and B over C, A is not thereby an improvement over C).|$|E
25|$|Although speed bumps are {{effective}} in keeping vehicle speeds down, their use is sometimes controversial—as they can increase traffic noise, may damage vehicles if traversed at too great a speed, and slow emergency vehicles. Poorly-designed speed bumps that stand too tall or with too-sharp an angle (often found in private car parks) can be disruptive for drivers, and {{may be difficult to}} navigate for vehicles with low ground clearance, even at very low speeds. Many sports cars <b>have</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> with such speed bumps. Speed bumps can also pose serious hazards to motorcyclists and bicyclists if they are not clearly visible, though in some cases a small cut across the bump allows those vehicles to traverse without impediment. Speed bumps cost $50–200 and may need replacement over time due to wear.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that a disadvantage of sexual reproduction is that a sexually reproducing organism will {{only be able to}} pass on 50% of its genes to each offspring. This is a consequence of the fact that gametes from sexually reproducing species are haploid. This, however, conflates sex and reproduction which are two separate events. The [...] "two-fold cost of sex" [...] may more accurately be described as the cost of anisogamy. Not all sexual organisms are anisogamous. There are numerous species which are sexual and do not <b>have</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> because they do not produce males or females. Yeast, for example, are isogamous sexual organisms which have two mating types which fuse and recombine their haploid genomes.

2500|$|Long {{before the}} horse collar harness, {{there was the}} less {{efficient}} throat-girth harness. This, it was claimed, {{could be found in}} many ancient civilizations, according to early 20th century French cavalry officer Lefebvre des Noëttes. This type of collar was supposedly used in ancient Chaldea (3rd millennium BC), both Sumeria and Assyria (1400–800 BC), ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom (1570–1070 BC), Shang Dynasty China (1600–1050 BC), Minoan Crete (2700–1450 BC), Classical Greece (550–323 BC), and ancient Rome (510 BC–476 AD). With this [...] "ancient harness," [...] ploughs and carts were pulled using harnesses that had flat straps across the neck and chest of the animal, with the load attached {{at the top of the}} collar, above the neck, in a manner similar to a yoke. These straps pressed against the horse's sterno-cephalicus muscle and trachea which restricted its breathing and reducing the pulling power of the horse. Thus, the harder a horse pulled, the more strongly it choked off its own breathing. [...] Because of these supposed physical constraints, oxen were used in preference to horses for heavy work, as they do not <b>have</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> due to anatomical differences and could be yoked to their loads.|$|E
2500|$|Some low-quality {{keyboards}} also suffer {{problems with}} rollover (that is, when multiple keys pressed {{at the same}} time, or when keys are pressed so fast that multiple keys are down within the same milliseconds). Early [...] "solid-state" [...] keyswitch keyboards did not <b>have</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> because the keyswitches are electrically isolated from each other, and early [...] "direct-contact" [...] keyswitch keyboards avoided this problem by having isolation diodes for every keyswitch. These early keyboards had [...] "n-key" [...] rollover, which means any number of keys can be depressed and the keyboard will still recognize the next key depressed. But when three keys are pressed (electrically closed) {{at the same time}} in a [...] "direct contact" [...] keyswitch matrix that doesn't have isolation diodes, the keyboard electronics can see a fourth [...] "phantom" [...] key which is the intersection of the X and Y lines of the three keys. Some types of keyboard circuitry will register a maximum number of keys at one time. [...] "Three-key" [...] rollover, also called [...] "phantom key blocking" [...] or [...] "phantom key lockout", will only register three keys and ignore all others until one of the three keys is lifted. This is undesirable, especially for fast typing (hitting new keys before the fingers can release previous keys), and games (designed for multiple key presses).|$|E
