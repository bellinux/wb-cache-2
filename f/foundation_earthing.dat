25|$|The 50,000-year {{estimate}} {{is at odds}} with the chronology given in Asimov's later novels, in particular <b>Foundation</b> and <b>Earth</b> and The Caves of Steel. The latter novel indicates that the robot R. Daneel Olivaw was constructed some three thousand years after the founding of New York City. <b>Foundation</b> and <b>Earth,</b> in its concluding scene, establishes that Daneel survives into the Interregnum period, after the First Galactic Empire collapses. He gives his age as (roughly) twenty thousand years. The Galactic Era dating system, to which most of Asimov's Foundation Series adheres, places <b>Foundation</b> and <b>Earth</b> approximately twelve thousand years after the events of Pebble in the Sky. Adding up all the differences, Joseph Schwartz's time displacement ultimately transported him only some eleven millennia into the future.|$|R

Six different concrete dosages have been designed, and two extensive mechanical and physical characterization programs have been conducted.

The second program was developed in a laboratory under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Although compressive strengths greater than 25 N/mm 2 have been reached (which allows the material to be classified as structural), the design in this initial phase is oriented to applications with limited mechanical requirements (e. g., <b>foundations,</b> <b>earth</b> retaining walls and pavements, in which design forces are moderate).
