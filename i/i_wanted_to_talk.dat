I got to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What {{happened}} to me yesterday? What happened to me today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E

As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E
500|$|... "Grown Woman" [...] is {{an urban}} R song written by Ne-Yo, Magnus Beite, Bernt Stray, and Norwegian {{production}} team StarGate (who also produced the song). Jeremy Helligar of True/Slant commented {{the song was}} [...] "still {{to the left of}} what normally passes for modern R" [...] Originally revealed as [...] "Grown Ass Woman" [...] and later changed to [...] "Grown Woman," [...] the lyrics and theme of the song are based on a woman who [...] "asserts her maturity and clues her suitors in on what won’t fly when it comes to relationships." [...] The song is one of three records which Ne-Yo co-wrote for Rowland after the singer specifically approached him to pen records for her album. Its concept was devised in a brief conversation between the pair. Rowland said, [...] "'Ne-Yo asked me what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about,' and I replied 'I'm in a different space. Change is very comfortable for me, and I'm happy where I am'.

500|$|After Beyoncé {{finished}} her {{concert at the}} Trent FM Arena in Nottingham, England on November 20, 2009, she announced to the crowd that a new album would be released the next year. I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained {{that the idea of}} filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely, stating [...] "there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and I {{looked out the window and}} there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... I guess I was a bit lonely and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side. The album's track listing was confirmed on November 12, 2010. Both Jay-Z and Kanye West make guest appearances on the DVD. In November 2010, there was a sweepstakes to win tickets to an exclusive screening of the DVD.|$|E
500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and I have a good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} is not {{essentially}} experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality. James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film. In one famous scene, Allen's character, in line {{to see a movie}} with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off camera to personally correct the man's errors. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, [...] "mental subtitles" [...] convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts. An animated scene—with artwork based on the comic strip Inside Woody Allen—depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from Snow White. Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the [...] "fourth wall" [...] is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable [...] "wish-fulfillment." [...] Allen chose to have Alvy break the fourth wall, he explained, [...] "because I felt many {{of the people in the}} audience had the same feelings and the same problems. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to them directly and confront them." ...|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{parallel}} lives has been explored before in {{films such as}} Run Lola Run (1998) and Sliding Doors (1998) which influenced Van Dormael's writing. Unlike any of those, Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the butterfly effect, pigeon superstition, and the space-time continuum. Van Dormael stated, [...] "My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there we follow two possible futures. I started one version {{based on the fact}} that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out, followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer. I had to find something else. And that's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, I wanted to find a different way of telling a story. I wanted the gaze of the child on his future to meet the gaze of the old man he has become on his past. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us is more and more complex, the information is more and more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. What interests me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false." ...|$|E

[...] "What set my site apart is that prior to PerezHilton.com, most blogs were mainly online journals and diaries, but that never interested me. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about celebrities because they're far more entertaining." [...] On March 11, 2005, within {{the first six months}} of Hilton's blogging career, PageSixSixSix.com was named [...] "Hollywood's Most-Hated Website" [...] by The Insider, catalyzing an initial surge in its popularity which temporarily crippled its server. Hilton claimed that on July 30, 2007, a seemingly [...] "ordinary day", Perezhilton.com had over 8.82 million page views in a 24-hour period. Other sources dispute the reliability of Hilton's traffic claims.|$|E
2500|$|In fall 2000, Norwood {{finally began}} conceiving ideas {{for a third}} studio album with the Atlantic label. While Rodney Jerkins, the main {{producer}} of her previous album, and his Darkchild crew, including Fred Jerkins III and LaShawn Daniels, {{had been working on}} several new songs for the singer's upcoming project in hopes of recreating the winning chemistry of Never Say Never, [...] Norwood {{wanted to make sure that}} she was gaining more creative control over the project and thus, arranged meetings with all her writers and musicians to discuss the lyricals topics and sounds she wanted for the album. [...] "I was involved from A-Z," [...] she said. [...] "Every song on the album was inspired by my life [...] <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about how I feel on so many levels. I wanted to be in touch with all of my emotions and share them.

2500|$|From the Inside Out {{combines}} the genres of pop, rock, hip hop, soul and R. Lead single [...] "Unbroken" [...] {{has been described}} as a [...] "chest-beating and uplifting" [...] single, while the second single, [...] "Choose You" [...] has been appreciated for its [...] "soaring pop and grand stomp". According to Cameron Adams from The Daily Telegraph, [...] "Inside Out" [...] "borrows Usher's electro thunderclaps and robo-R". [...] "All I Need" [...] makes use of Auto-Tune and has been compared to will.i.am. According to Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald, [...] "Homesick" [...] is [...] "lush, pure pop" [...] and [...] "One Thing" [...] is influenced by R and hip hop. [...] "The One", featuring Pixie Lott, has been called [...] "a dramatic ballad", and [...] "Love Graffiti" [...] has been compared to The Beatles. Most of the songs' lyrics explore the theme of love. Walker stated, [...] "I wanted to make an album of songs, with real lyrics about how we all feel sometimes. There's a lot of manufactured songs with nasty lyrics, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about real love, real situations that people could really connect to." [...] He named [...] "Love Graffiti" [...] as his favourite track for that reason, valuing the positive way it portrays love.|$|E
2500|$|American R singer-songwriter Ne-Yo {{was also}} {{involved}} in the album and wrote three songs which were produced by StarGate. When describing the process of working with him, Rowland said, [...] "Ne-Yo asked me what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about, and I replied 'I'm in a different space. Change is very comfortable for me, and I'm happy where I am'." [...] The first of these records, [...] "Shake Them Haters Off", was originally {{intended to be a}} single in the US. It is an [...] "up-tempo" [...] and fun record with lyrics such as [...] "Its like a job I that I never get a break from/because haters never take a vacation." [...] Another collaboration titled [...] "Grown Ass Woman" [...] (later changed to [...] "Grown Woman") was described by Rowland as her favorite song on the album. Ne-Yo conceptualized the song in a three-minute conversation with Rowland, where she told him she wanted a record where she could claim [...] "I'm grown!". According to Janine Simon from Honey Mag, on [...] "Grown [...] Woman" [...] Rowland digs [...] "through old pictures from the Destiny's Child days reflecting on how far she has come yet how 'Grown and silly' she still is." [...] It would later be released as one of the album's two US lead singles. The pair collaborated on a third song, [...] "Heaven and Earth", described by Simon as a ballad using imagery to demonstrate a [...] "sonic portrait, painted with flecks of sentiment; a picture of what the singer believes is what 'we deserve as a people'." [...] According to Rowland, one of these three records was also recorded as a duet featuring Ne-Yo's vocals. None of these songs made the album apart from [...] "Heaven and Earth", which features as song number eleven on the deluxe edition.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Iron Man" [...] was {{originally}} entitled [...] "Iron Bloke"; upon hearing the main guitar riff {{for the first}} time, Osbourne remarked that it sounded [...] "like a big iron bloke walking around". The title was later changed to [...] "Iron Man" [...] as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. [...] The riff to [...] "Iron Man" [...] is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that [...] "...Tony Iommi {{turned out to be}} one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away." [...] Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. He is rendered mute, unable verbally to warn people of his time of the impending destruction. His attempts to communicate are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and have his revenge on mankind, causing the destruction seen in his vision. [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands [...] "it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life." [...] In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne concurs: [...] "It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday... And suddenly, you know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet. [...] "You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world," [...] Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, [...] "and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about political stuff so that's what inspired me." ...|$|E
