40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of regular daily handling on weight gain and on the fear reaction towards a new environment and human beings in domestic kits (Tonic Immobility test: TI, Emergence test: ET). Two groups in the same environment and fed the same diet were analysed: handled group and control (17 litters, 9 kits/litter per group). No differences in weight gain were recorded. During ET at 33 days of age, <b>handled</b> <b>kits</b> took less time to enter the arena than control group kits. TI duration was shorter in <b>handled</b> <b>kits,</b> which required more inductions than the control group. It was found that minimal human contact imposed before nursing reduced the fear of humans in rabbit <b>kits.</b> Our <b>handling</b> method requires minimal contact and can be used to reduce fear and improve welfare in rabbits. Moreover, the short length of the handling procedure allows stockpersons to produce tamer rabbits, reducing stress levels. </p...|$|R

Chassis upgrades included tweaked suspension and Brembo brakes. Visually the Cup was recognizable from its 5-spoke split-rim Speedline wheels and badges on the doors. Only four paint colours were available: red, white, yellow and French blue. The sporty theme continued in the Cup's cabin with black leather, carbon fibre trim, aluminium pedals and a MOMO steering wheel.|$|R

6000|$|The tools! In {{his office}} Father had tools {{fascinating}} in their shininess and curious shapes, {{but they were}} sharp, they were something called sterized, and they distinctly were not for boys to touch. In fact {{it was a good}} dodge to volunteer [...] "I must not touch," [...] when you looked at the tools on the glass shelves in Father's office. But Uncle Miles, who was a person altogether superior to Father, let you <b>handle</b> all his <b>kit</b> except the saws. There was a hammer with a silver head; there was a metal thing like a big L; there was a magic instrument, very precious, made out of costly red wood and gold, with a tube which contained a drop--no, it wasn't a drop, it was a nothing, which lived in the water, but the nothing LOOKED like a drop, and it ran in a frightened way up and down the tube, no matter how cautiously you tilted the magic instrument. And there were nails, very different and clever--big valiant spikes, middle-sized ones which were not very interesting, and shingle-nails much jollier than the fussed-up fairies in the yellow book.|$|R
40|$|A commercially {{available}} 125 1 -digoxin radioim-munoassay kit {{had been used}} routinely for 2 years for determining serum digoxin levels. Suddenly, parameters recorded daily, {{as a means of}} quality control, were ob-served to change. Since no new techniques in <b>handling</b> the <b>kit</b> had been introduced and preparation of kit rea-gents was confirmed to be consistent with the manufac-turer's protocol, the assay itself became ·suspect. Using a representative time period prior to the observed change, comparisons of data were made:from complete daily records. Investigating several parameters in light of radioimmunoassay principles, a probable cause was determined. Materials and Methods The digoxin kit used required a 30 -min incubation of 125 1 -digoxin derivative with patient serum and antibody followed by a 5 -min adsorption of unbound digoxin onto dextran-coated charcoal (DCC), centrifugation at 4, 000 g for 10 min at 40 °C, decantation, and assessment of radioactivity in the antibody-bound fraction. Com-puterized data handling and standard curve-fitting tech-niques were employed. The quality control program, in-cluding records of percent total binding (%B/T), per-cent bound of the 0 ngfml standard (% 80), and high and low digoxin level reference serums assayed daily, aided in determining the validity of each run. Toxic ranges were considered to be above 2. 5 ngfml with a minimum detectable dose of 0. 4 ngfml. Observations In mid-November 1974, a drop in %B/T across the assay range was noted. A mean % 80 of 66 for the period immediately preceeding, October 20 to November 20, fell to an average 53 % from November 20 to December 20. An increase in dose estimates for the low and high control pools accompanied this change in binding ca-pacity (Table l). The increase itself appeared more pronounced for the high control and might even perhaps be considered negligible for the low control. Most significant, however, is the loss of acceptable interassay precision. The percent coefficient of variation (%CV) 17...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{acceptability}} {{and efficacy}} of a new kit with a new formulation of quinine alkaloids designed for the intra-rectal administration {{in the treatment of}} non-per os malaria was assessed in the peripheral health care system of Mopti, Mali. Methods A single-arm trial was conducted from August 2003 to January 2004. An initial dose of diluted quinine alkaloids (20 mg/kg Quinimax ®) was administered by the intra-rectal route to children with presumptive non per-os malaria at six peripheral heath care centres. The children were then referred to two referral hospitals where standard inpatient care including intravenous route were routinely provided. A malaria thick smear was done at inclusion and a second malaria thick smear after arrival at the referral facility, where a more complete clinical examination and laboratory testing was done to confirm diagnosis. Confirmed cases of severe malaria or others diseases were treated according to national treatment guidelines. Cases of non per-os malaria received a second dose of intra rectal quinine alkaloids. Primary outcome was acceptability of the intra rectal route by children and their parents as well as the ease to <b>handle</b> the <b>kit</b> by health care workers. Results The study included 134 children with a median age of 33 months and 53. 7 % were male. Most of the children (67 %) and 92 % of parents or guardians readily accepted the intra-rectal route; 84 % of health care workers found the kit easy to use. At the peripheral health care centres, 32 % of children had a coma score ≤ 3 and this was reduced to 10 % at the referral hospital, following one dose of intra-rectal quinine alkaloids (IRQA). The mean time to availability of oral route treatment was 1. 8 ± 1. 1 days. Overall, 73 % of cases were confirmed severe malaria and for those the case fatality rate was 7. 2 %. Conclusion IRQA was well accepted by children, their parents/guardians and by the health workers at peripheral health facilities in Mopti, Mali. There was also a quick recovery from deep coma and a reduced case fatality rate in severe malaria. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: For the {{diagnosis}} of seasonal influenza, clinicians rely on point-of-care testing (POCT) using commercially available kits developed against seasonal influenza viruses. However, POCT {{has not yet been}} established for {{the diagnosis}} of pandemic influenza A virus (H 1 N 1 pdm) infection due to the low sensitivity of the existing kits for H 1 N 1 pdm. Methodology/Principal Findings: An immunochromatography (IC) test kit was developed based on a monoclonal antibody against H 1 N 1 pdm, which does not cross-react with seasonal influenza A or B viruses. The efficacy of this kit (PDM-IC kit) for {{the diagnosis of}} H 1 N 1 pdm infection was compared with that of an existing kit for the detection of seasonal influenza viruses (SEA-IC kit). Nasal swabs (n = 542) were obtained from patients with flu-like syndrome at 13 clinics in Osaka, Japan during the winter of 2010 / 2011. Among the 542 samples, randomly selected 332 were further evaluated for viral presence by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The PDM-IC kit versus the SEA-IC kit showed higher sensitivity to and specificity for H 1 N 1 pdm, despite several inconsistencies between the two kits or between the kits and RT-PCR. Consequently, greater numbers of false-negative and false-positive cases were documented when the SEA-IC kit was employed. Significant correlation coefficients for sensitivity, specificity, and negative prediction values between the two kits were observed at individual clinics, indicating that the results could be affected by clinic-related techniques for sampling and <b>kit</b> <b>handling.</b> Importantly, many patients (especially influenza-negative cases) were prescribed anti-influenza drugs tha...|$|R
