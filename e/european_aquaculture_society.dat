40|$|Mechanical {{separation}} {{systems are}} a good option to create new fish products and open new market, however studies on the effect on quality of mechanical treatment on species of interest for <b>European</b> <b>aquaculture,</b> such as <b>European</b> sea bass, gilthead sea bream, and rainbow trout are scarce. Thus in this research, the effect on colour, nutritional quality, and lipid stability was considered immediately after separation process and after 90 days of frozen storage.

Increases in L* and secondary oxidation products were observed, together with a decrease of antioxidant capacity. Nutritional value instead was unaffected by treatment.

40|$|The European Project SustainAQ (Framework 6) aims to {{identify}} the limiting factors for the sustainable production of aquatic origin food in Eastern Europe. It focuses on the possible use of Recirculation Aquaculture Systems (RAS) as sustainable method {{for the production of}} aquatic animals as mentioned in the communication of the <b>European</b> Commission on <b>Aquaculture</b> in 2009. RASs already exist mainly in western countries and proved economically feasible. RASs allow controlling the production process including effluents, biosecurity and escapes.

Therefore, these countries are potential beneficiaries of improved sustainability through RAS use.

40|$|Although {{carp farming}} {{had a key}} role in the Blue Revolution at a global level, <b>European</b> carp <b>aquaculture</b> has stagnated over the past 25 years without {{achieving}} any productivity gains. The objective of this study was to identify the factors and mechanisms constraining production and productivity growth in pond-based carp farming in Hungary, as the country is a good representative of the EU pond-based farming sector. By using data from 44 carp farms, different specifications of the Cobb-Douglas production function were parameterized to investigate the determinants of yields and to assess the extent of economies of scale. Descriptive statistics show that large differences exist in productivity between individual farms, meaning that it is hard to implement technical standards and to ensure repeatability in extensive carp farming technology. Econometric analysis demonstrates that economies of scale do not prevail in pond-based farming in Hungary, so a concentration of farms would not stimulate a growth in carp farming. This may explain the stagnation of carp aquaculture, as the only <b>European</b> <b>aquaculture</b> segments which can grow are those that can exploit economies of scale. Further analysis demonstrates that labour is an important factor of production, and a decreasing workforce may constrain the intensification process of production. On the other hand, mechanisation did not prove to be a significant contributing factor to yields, indicating that large investment in equipment has a limited role in carp farming...|$|R

40|$|Objectives of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the combined market share of breeding companies in aquaculture production in Europe, to describe the main characteristics of breeding companies and their programs, and to provide per species estimates on cumulative genetic gain in growth performance. Surveys were conducted among breeding companies of five major species cultured in Europe: Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, European seabass, gilthead seabream, and turbot. The market share was estimated as the combined egg or juvenile production of breeding companies relative to the total egg or juvenile production in Europe for each species in 2012. Cumulative genetic gain was estimated from the number of selected generations in current breeding programs, combined with genetic trends, reported selection responses in literature, and phenotypic differences. The combined market share of breeding companies ranged from 43 - 56 % for seabass to 100 % for turbot. The total volume of fish production in Europe that originated from selective breeding was 1653 - 1706 thousand tonnes, corresponding to 80 - 83 % of the total aquaculture production. Over species, there were 37 breeding programs of which the majority performed family selection. Growth performance was universally selected upon. Cumulative genetic gain in growth performance varied from +. 65 % for turbot to +. 900 % for trout in terms of harvest weight, and from +. 25 % for turbot to +. 200 % for trout in terms of thermal growth coefficient. It is concluded that selective breeding has a major impact on <b>European</b> <b>aquaculture</b> and will contribute to future growth of the sector. Statement of relevance: This manuscript helps to understand the impact of selective breeding on <b>European</b> <b>aquaculture.</b> It shows that the adoption of selective breeding is much higher in Europe than globally. It demonstrates that selective breeding has led to major improvements. Forecasts of industry trends are made and the importance of selective breeding to future growth of aquaculture production is illustrated. </p...|$|R
