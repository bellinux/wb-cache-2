The solutions depend on 2 N − 2 parameters and give when all these parameters are equal to 0, the analogue of the famous Peregrine breather PN. It is fundamental to note that in this representation at order N, all these solutions can be seen as deformations with 2 N − 2 parameters of the famous Peregrine breather PN.
