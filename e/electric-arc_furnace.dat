40|$|<b>Electric-arc</b> <b>furnace</b> (EAF) slag, the {{by-product}} of steel fabricated at the EAF, is {{in most cases}} still sent to dumps, with serious environmental consequences. This work shows an innovative, economically convenient application for EAF slag: its use as reinforcing filler for polypropylene. Composites based on polypropylene containing 10 – 40 wt. % of EAF slag particles were prepared by melt compounding followed by injection molding. A physical–chemical analysis of the EAF slag was performed to determine microstructural features and main component phases. Leaching tests demonstrated that, although EAF slag can release small amounts of toxic elements, such as heavy metals, incorporating such material into the polymeric matrix immobilizes the heavy metals inside that matrix. The mechanical characterization of the polymer-based composites was performed. Incorporating EAF slag particles raises the Young’s modulus and the tensile strength at yield, whereas elongation at break and the impact strength of the polymer-based composite are significantly reduced only when large amounts of filler are added, i. e., 30 % or more...|$|E

This approach requires laboratory studies. The main objective of this work focuses on evaluating the durability of slag concrete under the conditions specified in the Spanish structural concrete code.

The {{processing}} and recycling experiments of dust from Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) in industrial conditions aimed at highlighting the minimizing possibility of this waste by transforming {{it into a}} by-product that can represent either a secondary raw material for steel making in EAF or to recover iron, zinc and lead (the Waltz process). <b>Electric-arc</b> <b>furnace</b> dust (EAFD) is a by-product of steel production and recycling.

This fine-grained material contains high amounts of zinc and iron as well as significant amounts of potentially toxic elements such as lead, cadmium and chromium. Therefore, the treatment and stabilization of this industrial residue is necessary. Concrete is a well-known suitable environment for stabilization/solidification of materials which have leachable elements in need of fixation. The effect of the EAFD content on the mechanical and chemical performance of Portland cement concrete is investigated in this paper. The effect of the EAFD content on the setting time of cement slurry was also analyzed. The axial compressive strength of the concrete samples increases with the EAFD addition {{in the range of}} 10 to 20 wt. (%) EAFD; also the tensile strength increases with the EAFD addition. An increase in EAFD content significantly increases the setting time of the concrete. The acetic acid leaching and water solubilization tests indicate low mobility of the potentially toxic elements from the EAFD concrete composite. The results of the immersion tests show that the addition of EAFD to the concrete seems to reduce chloride penetration, which may help prevent pitting corrosion in reinforced concrete...|$|E
40|$|<b>Electric-arc</b> <b>furnace</b> dust (EAFD) {{is one of}} {{the several}} process {{residues}} generated in mini mills during steel production. The presence of valuable zinc in EAF dust and the rising costs for waste disposal are the motivating factors for EAFD recycling or its incorporation into other materials. Features such as small particle size, high zinc content and the existence of the decomposition-resistant mineral franklinite have long influenced both positively and negatively EAF dust processing. More recently, the growing presence of deleterious chlorine, lead and chromium is affecting equally the traditional as well as the new recycling routes or waste incorporation processes in a decisive way. In this study, a critical overview on the fundamentals of pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical EAF dust recycling or incorporation processes is presented, {{as a starting point for}} the understanding of how the EAF dust processing routes are influenced by all cited factors.

In Italy, they generate some two million tons of waste materials per year; from an international point of view, only a minor part of these wastes is reused as marginal materials. In road construction the recycling of <b>electric-arc</b> <b>furnace</b> slag is very interesting because of the significant environmental considerations connected with this matter.

40|$|Research was {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effect of the reductive roasting conditions on the smelting characteristics of nickel laterite ores from three different areas of Greece-Evia, Viotia and Kastoria. The roasting experiments were performed in a rotary kiln at 800 degrees, 860 degrees and 900 degreesC for 10 - 90 min; the smelting experiments were carried out in an <b>electric-arc</b> <b>furnace</b> that allowed the melting temperature and energy consumption to be monitored. The melting temperature values of the ore and roast samples were also determined with a LECO AF 600 instrument by enploying the Seger cones technique. The Evia samples, in which the SiO 2 /Fe-tot ratio was higher than in the ores from Viotia and Kastoria, exhibited the highest melting temperatures. The lowest values were observed for the Kastoria samples owing to the presence of serpentine, which had a positive effect on their fusibility. Reductive roasting of the Evia and Viotia ore samples was beneficial for the subsequent smelting stage, but roasting of the Kastoria samples resulted in an increase in the melting temperature, possibly on account of the production of refractory oxides. Finally, in agreement with the generally accepted view that reductive roasting has a positive effect on the subsequent smelting operation, increases in the temperature and duration of roasting of a composite laterite ore sample resulted in lower energy consumption during the reductive smelting, which was attributed to fayalite formation...|$|E

40|$|An {{energy saving}} {{opportunity}} exists in mining and smelting {{industries such as}} the Ferrochrome industry, {{in the form of}} waste heat extraction and recovery. The mining and smelting of metals requires the use of high-power, AC or DC <b>electric-arc</b> <b>furnaces</b> that melt raw feed material in order to separate and produce useful metals from the feed. The smelting of raw materials into metals inside arc furnaces produces large quantities of hot gas as by-products, according to specific process-controlled chemical reactions. These hot gases combined with small feed dust particles thrown up from the feed process must be extracted from the smelting process and therefore from the furnaces themselves. The furnaces operate at internal temperatures around 1 500 oC and therefore the extracted hot material, referred to as the smelting process off-gas, is extracted at extremely high temperatures and thermal energy levels. The implementation of a bottoming cycle cogeneration system allows for the extraction and recovery of thermal energy from the furnace off-gases which can then be used to generate additional useful electrical energy via the heat exchanger and electrical energy generation components of the proposed cogeneration system. This additional energy improves the energy savings of the smelting process and the entire plant since thermal energy that was previously dissipated into the atmosphere and wasted is now used to generate additional and useful electricity. This additional electricity can either be used to power the furnace loads associated with the smelting of the raw materials into metals, thereby supplementing the utility grid electrical supply to the plant, or it can be fed back to or wheeled through the utility grid to be supplied to third party customers and consumers. This however creates a power dispatch and optimal power flow problem. The power dispatch and optimal power flow problem is solved and controlled through the implementation of an Economic Power Dispatch (EPD) model. The model considers the operating conditions of the furnaces in order to determine how much additional electrical energy can be generated from the available thermal energy, recovered from the smelting process via the proposed cogeneration system. The model then utilises information regarding all costs associated with the consumption and generation of electrical energy {{as a result of the}} smelting and heat recovery cogeneration system operation. With these considerations the model then determines the optimal manner in which to dispatch the cogeneration generated electrical energy between the furnace loads and the utility grid so as to achieve the maximum possible overall system associated energy savings. The model is implemented as a half-hourly cogeneration-generated optimal power dispatch schedule. The consideration of a bottoming cycle cogeneration system for heat recovery and additional electrical energy generation, and the development and implementation of an Economic Power Dispatch (EPD) model for the control of the dispatch of cogeneration generated power between the furnace loads and the utility grid, allow for considerable system associated energy savings. These savings are obtained due to the reduced net electrical energy required from the utility grid, and the financial incentives and rebates obtained due to the feed of electrical energy back to and through the utility grid to third party consumers.
