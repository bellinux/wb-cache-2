25|$|The forming {{machines}} {{hold and}} move the parts that form the container. The machine consist of basic 19 mechanisms in operation to form a bottle and generally powered by compressed air (high pressure - 3.2 bar and low pressure - 2.8 bar), the mechanisms are electronically timed to coordinate all movements of the mechanisms. The most widely used forming machine arrangement is the <b>individual</b> <b>section</b> <b>machine</b> (or IS machine). This machine has a bank of 5–20 identical sections, each of which contains one complete set of mechanisms to make containers. The sections are in a row, and the gobs feed into each section via a moving chute, called the gob distributor. Sections make either one, two, three or four containers simultaneously. (Referred to as single, double, triple and quad gob). In the case of multiple gobs, the shears cut the gobs simultaneously, and they fall into the blank moulds in parallel.|$|E
40|$|Two papers {{presented}} at the Shelter Island workshop are very briefly summarized here, in view of recent publications elsewhere The WARP code, developed for Heavy-Ion beam-driven inertial confinement Fusion (HIF) accelerator studies, combines features of a particle-in-cell plasma simulation and an accelerator tracking program. Its methods and architecture {{have been developed for}} efficiency both in detailed simulation of <b>individual</b> <b>machine</b> <b>sections</b> and in long-time beam tracking. The transverse ``slice`` model in the code has been applied to the study of transverse resonance effects associated with quadrupole strength errors. These simulations confirm that rapid passage through a resonance can reduce the associated mismatch and emittance growth References to published details and to other sources of information are supplied...|$|R
