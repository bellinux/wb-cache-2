40|$|Furoxans (1, 2, 5 -oxadiazole- 2 -oxides) {{are widely}} used in organic {{chemistry}} as intermediate compounds for the synthesis of various heterocycles. Despite {{the fact that some}} furoxans have been found to possess remarkable biological activities, up to now no systematic study on their mode of action has been reported. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the molecular mode of the vasodilator action of furoxans. Furoxans, but not the corresponding <b>furazans,</b> concentration-dependently increased coronary flow in an isolated working rat heart preparation. This effect was blunted upon coinfusion with methylene blue. All tested furoxans were demonstrated to increase potently the activity of soluble guanylate cyclase. Enzyme stimulation was found to be mediated by the generation of nitric oxide (NO) following chemical reaction of the furoxans with sulfhydryl groups of low molecular weight thiols and proteins. Furoxans are thus prodrugs which increase the level of cyclic GMP via formation of NO and may therefore be classified as nitrovasodilators. Along with the generation of NO, nitrite and nitrate ions and S-nitrosothiols were formed. The rates of formation of these metabolites, however, did not appear to be related to enzyme stimulation. A tentative reaction scheme that fits the obtained experimental data is proposed.

It has two classes: 1, 2, 3 -triazoles and 1, 2, 4 -triazoles. 1, 2, 3 -triazoles are important compounds, which are applicable in the textile industry as optical brighteners and as polymer additives, and in medicine as drug substances. 1, 2, 3 -triazoles have been prepared by a number of distinct routes. 1, 2, 4 -triazoles are alkylated in basic media with alkyl halides to give predominantly 1 -alkyl derivatives. Benzotriazoles exist as 1 H- or 2 H- structures. When unsubstituted at nitrogen the 1 H-aromatic isomers are preferred. Four ring systems of oxadiazoles are namely 1, 2, 3 -, 1, 2, 4 -, 1, 2, 5 - and 1, 3, 4 -oxidiazoles. 1, 2, 5 -oxadiazoles are known <b>furazans</b> and their benzo derivatives are known as 2, 1, 3 -benzoxadiazoles.

The formation reaction has been examined in three successive courses. In the first course, chloroxime <b>furazan</b> is formed from amidoxime <b>furazan</b> via electrophilic substitution and diazotization followed by N- 2 elimination. In the second course, chloroxime <b>furazan</b> undergoes a dehydrochlorination process to give the nitrile oxide species.

The theoretical calculation indicates that a catalyzed water molecule accelerates the hydrogen transfer and dehydrochlorination in the first and second reaction courses. The computational results also suggest that the dimerization is stepwise process in which intermediates and transition states (TSs) show strong diradical character. The dimerization occurs with a large exothermicity, and its rate-determining step corresponds to C-C bond formation. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

We investigated the NO-release patterns and antiplatelet effects of novel furoxan derivatives of aspirin (B 8 and B 7) {{in comparison to}} existing antiplatelet agents. Cyclooxygenase (COX) activity was investigated in purified enzyme using an electron paramagnetic resonance-based technique. Concentration–response curves for antiplatelet agents±the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, ODQ (50 [*]μM) were generated in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and washed platelets (WP) activated with collagen using turbidometric aggregometry. NO was detected using an isolated NO electrode. The furoxan derivatives of aspirin (B 8, B 7) and their NO-free <b>furazan</b> equivalents (B 16, B 15; all 100 [*]μM) significantly inhibited COX activity (P< 0. 01; n= 6) in vitro and caused aspirin-independent, cGMP-dependent inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation in WP. B 8 was more potent than B 7 (PRP IC 50 = 0. 62 ± 0. 1 [*]μM for B 8; 400 ± 89 [*]μM for B 7; P< 0. 0001. WP IC 50 s= 0. 6 ± 0. 1 and 62 ± 10 [*]μM, respectively). The NO-free <b>furazan</b> counterparts were less potent antiplatelet agents (WP IC 50 s= 54 ± 3 [*]μM and 62 ± 10 [*]μM, respectively; P< 0. 0001, B 8 vs B 16). Of the hybrids investigated, only B 8 retained antiplatelet activity in PRP. NO release from furoxan–aspirin hybrids was undetectable in buffer alone, but was accelerated {{in the presence of}} either plasma or plasma components, albumin (4 %), glutathione (GSH; 3 [*]μM) and ascorbate (50 [*]μM), the effects of which were additive for B 7 but not B 8. NO generation from furoxans was greatly enhanced by platelet extract, an effect that could largely be explained by the synergistic effect of intracellular concentrations of GSH (3 [*]mM) and ascorbate (1 [*]mM). We conclude that the decomposition of furoxan–aspirin hybrids to generate biologically active NO is catalysed by endogenous agents which may instil a potential for primarily intracellular delivery of NO. The blunting of the aspirin effects of furoxan hybrids is likely to be due to loss of the acetyl moiety in plasma; the observed antiplatelet effects are thereby primarily mediated via NO release.

The pharmacological {{activity of}} the furoxan derivative condensed with pyridazine di-N-oxide 4, 7 -dimethyl- 1, 2, 5 -oxadiazolo[3, 4 -d]pyridazine 1, 5, 6 -trioxide (FPTO) and the corresponding <b>furazan</b> (FPDO) was studied. FPTO reacted with thiols generating nitrite (NO), S-nitrosoglutathione and hydroxylamine (nitroxyl) and converted oxyHb to metHb. FPDO did not generate detectable amounts of NO-like species but reacted with thiols and oxyHb. FPTO and FPDO haem-dependently stimulated the activity of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and this stimulation was inhibited by 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ) and by 0. 1 [*]mM dithiothreitol. FPTO relaxed noradrenaline-precontracted aortic rings and its concentration-response curve was biphasic (pIC 50 = 9. 03 ± 0. 13 and 5. 85 ± 0. 06). FPDO was significantly less potent vasodilator (pIC 50 = 5. 19 ± 0. 14). The vasorelaxant activity of FPTO and FPDO was inhibited by ODQ. oxyHb significantly inhibited only FPTO-dependent relaxation. FPTO and FPDO were equipotent inhibitors of ADP-induced platelet aggregation (IC 50 = 0. 63 ± 0. 15 and 0. 49 ± 0. 05 [*]μM, respectively). The antiplatelet activity of FPTO (but not FPDO) was partially suppressed by oxyHb. The antiaggregatory effects of FPTO and FPDO were only partially blocked by sGC inhibitors. FPTO and FPDO (10 – 20 [*]μM) significantly increased cyclic GMP levels in aortic rings and platelets and this increase was blocked by ODQ. Thus, FPTO can generate NO and, like FPDO, reacts with thiols and haem. The vasorelaxant activity of FPTO and FPDO is sGC-dependent and a predominant role is played by NO at FPTO concentrations below 1 [*]μM. On the contrary, inhibition of platelet aggregation is only partially related to sGC activation...|$|E
40|$|The syntheses and {{characterization}} of various tetrazine and <b>furazan</b> compounds offer {{a different approach}} to explosives development. Traditional explosives - such as TNT or RDX - rely on the oxidation of the carbon and hydrogen atoms by the oxygen carrying nitro group to produce the explosive energy. High-nitrogen compounds rely instead on large positive heats of formation for that energy. Some of these high-nitrogen compounds {{have been shown to be}} less sensitive to initiation (e. g. by impact) when compared to traditional nitro-containing explosives of similar performances. Using the precursor, 3, 6 -bis-(3, 5 -dimethylpyrazol- 1 -yl) -s-tetrazine (BDT), several useful energetic compounds based on the s-tetrazine system have been synthesized and studied. The compound, 3, 3 {prime}-azobis(6 -amino-s-tetrazine) or DAAT, detonates as a half inch rate stick despite having no oxygen in the molecule. Using perfluoroacetic acid, DAAT can be oxidized to give mixtures of N-oxide isomers (DAAT 03. 5) with an average oxygen content of about 3. 5. This energetic mixture burns at extremely high rates and with low dependency on pressure. Another tetrazine compound of interest is 3, 6 -diguanidino-s-tetrazine(DGT) and its dinitrate and diperchlorate salts. DGT is easily synthesized by reacting BDT with guanidine in methanol. Using Caro's acid, DGT can be further oxidized to give 3, 6 -diguanidino-s-tetrazine- 1, 4 -di-N-oxide (DGT-DO). Like DGT, the di-N-oxide can react with nitric acid or perchloric acid to give the dinitrate and the diperchlorate salts. The compounds, 4, 4 {prime}-diamino- 3, 3 {prime}-azoxyfurazan (DAAF) and 4, 4 {prime}-diamino- 3, 3 {prime}-azofurazan (DAAzF), may have important future roles in insensitive explosive applications.

40|$|Abstract Background The cytoprotective {{nature of}} nitric oxide (NO) led to {{development}} of NO-aspirins {{in the hope}} of overcoming the gastric side-effects of aspirin. However, the NO moiety gives these hybrids potential for actions further to their aspirin-mediated anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory effects. Having previously shown that novel NO-aspirin hybrids containing a furoxan NO-releasing group have potent anti-platelet effects, here we investigate their anti-inflammatory properties. Here we examine their effects upon TNFα release from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages and investigate a potential mechanism of action through effects on LPS-stimulated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation. Methods Peripheral venous blood was drawn from the antecubital fossa of human volunteers. Mononuclear cells were isolated and cultured. The resultant differentiated macrophages were treated with pharmacologically relevant concentrations of either a furoxan-aspirin (B 8, B 7; 10 μM), their respective <b>furazan</b> NO-free counterparts (B 16, B 15; 10 μM), aspirin (10 μM), existing nitroaspirin (NCX 4016; 10 μM), an NO donor (DEA/NO; 10 μM) or dexamethasone (1 μM), in the presence and absence of LPS (10 ng/ml; 4 h). Parallel experiments were conducted on undifferentiated fresh monocytes. Supernatants were assessed by specific ELISA for TNFα release and by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay for cell necrosis. To assess NF-κB activation, the effects of the compounds on the loss of cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-κB, IκBα (assessed by western blotting) and nuclear localisation (assessed by immunofluorescence) of the p 65 subunit of NF-κB were determined. Results B 8 significantly reduced TNFα release from LPS-treated macrophages to 36 ± 10 % of the LPS control. B 8 and B 16 significantly inhibited monocyte TNFα release to 28 ± 5, and 49 ± 9 % of control, respectively. The B 8 effect was equivalent in magnitude to that of dexamethasone, but was not shared by 10 μM DEA/NO, B 7, the furazans, aspirin or NCX 4016. LDH assessment revealed none of the treatments caused significant cell lysis. LPS stimulated loss of cytoplasmic IκBα and nuclear translocation of the p 65 NF-κB subunit was inhibited by the active NO-furoxans. Conclusion Here we show that furoxan-aspirin, B 8, significantly reduces TNFα release from both monocytes and macrophages and suggest that inhibition of NF-κB activation is a likely mechanism for the effect. This anti-inflammatory action highlights a further therapeutic potential of drugs of this class. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach to}} developing energetic molecules is to chemically place {{one or more}} nitro groups onto a carbon skeleton, {{which is why the}} term ''nitration'' is synonymous to explosives preparation. The nitro group carries the oxygen that reacts with the skeletal carbon and hydrogen fuels, which in turn produces the heat and gaseous reaction products necessary for driving an explosive shock. These nitro-containing energetic molecules typically have heats of formation near zero and therefore most of the released energy is derived from the combustion process. Our investigation of the tetrazine, <b>furazan</b> and tetrazole ring systems has offered a different approach to explosives development, where a significant amount of the chemical potential energy is derived from their large positive heats of formation. Because these compounds often contain a large percentage of nitrogen atoms, they are usually regarded as high-nitrogen fuels or explosives. A general artifact of these high-nitrogen compounds is that they are less sensitive to initiation (e. g. by impact) when compared to traditional nitro-containing explosives of similar performances. Using the precursor, 3, 6 -bis-(3, 5 -dimethylpyrazol- 1 -yl) -s-tetrazine, several useful energetic compounds based on the s-tetrazine system have been synthesized and studied. Some of the first compounds are 3, 6 -diamino-s-tetrazine- 1, 4 -dioxide (LAX- 112) and 3, 6 -dihydrazino-s-tetrazine (DHT). LAX- 112 was once extensively studied as an insensitive explosive by Los Alamos; DHT {{is an example of a}} high-nitrogen explosive that relies entirely on its heat of formation for sustaining a detonation. Recent synthesis efforts have yielded an azo-s-tetrazine, 3, 3 '-azobis(6 -amino-s-tetrazine) or DAAT, which has a very high positive heat of formation. The compounds, 4, 4 '-diamino- 3, 3 '-azoxyfurazan (DAAF) and 4, 4 '-diamino- 3, 3 '-azofurazan (DAAzF), may have important future roles in insensitive explosive applications. Neither DAAF nor DAAzF can be initiated by laboratory impact drop tests, yet both have in some aspects better explosive performances than 1, 3, 5 -triamino- 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene TATB [...] the standard of insensitive high explosives. The thermal stability of DAAzF is equal to that of hexanitrostilbene (HNS), yet it too is a better explosive performer. The recently discovered tetrazol derivative, 3, 6 -bis-(1 H- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrazol- 5 -ylamino) -s-tetrazine (BTATz) was measured to have exceptional positive heats of formation and to be insensitive to explosive initiation.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade the {{synthesis}} and spectroscopic characteristics of nitro compounds have aroused much interest. New synthetic methods have been developed, and the excellence of the nitro group as a chromophore in spectroscopy has been demonstrated. Previous work in this Department 1 has been concerned with the synthesis and spectroscopic properties of secondary nitrosteroids and related compounds. In the present work, this investigation was extended to nitro compounds in the bornane series, and to α-nitroketosteroids and related compounds. Many oximes and ketones were handled as starting materials, and other ketosteroids were available from microbiological studies. These provided a sufficiently wide coverage of the positions on the steroid nucleus to enable studies {{to be made of}} the solvent shifts of angular methyl groups in the n. m. r. spectra of the ketones, and of the low field signals and chemical shifts of the angular methyl groups in the n. m. r, spectra of the oximes. Accordingly, the present investigation is divided into four sections. In the first Section, general methods for the preparation of secondary nitro compounds are reviewed, and the preparation, and elucidation of the structures of the 2 - and 3 -nitrobornanes (l, 2) are described. 3 -Nitrocamphor (3) was prepared and its behaviour as a non-enolic nitro-ketone studied. Preparation of the 3 -nitrobornanes involved the conversion of camphor (4) into bornan- 3 -one (5). Both the methods available for this conversion, the classical route 2 via the sodium amalgam reduction of the ketol (6), prepared from bornan- 2, 3 -dione (7), and the reported sequence 3 involving Huang-Minlon reduction of 3 -hydroxyirainocamphor hydrazone (8), were studied. The former route was found to be satisfactory and bornan- 3 -one (5) was prepared from camphor in an overall yield of 10 %. The latter route was not satisfactory: attempts to prepare 3 -hydroxyiminocamphor hydrazone (8) failed, and reduction of the reaction product from treatment of the isomeric mixture of syn - and anti - 3 -hydroxyiminocamphor (9) with hydrazine hydrate, under a variety of conditions, did not yield either of the reported products, 3 3 -hydroxyiminobornane (10) and bornano-[2, 3, v]-triazole (11). 2 -Nitrobornane (l) was prepared both by N-bromosuccinimide, and nitric acid treatment of camphor oxime (12), with reduction of the bromo-nitro-, and gem-dinitro-intermediates. 3 -Nitrobornane (2) was prepared by the N -bromosuccinimide route. 2 -Nitrobornane (l) was shown to be a single compound, and 3 -nitro-bornane (2) to be a 50 : 50 epimeric mixture. The literature on the n. m. r. spectra of the bicyclo-[2, 2,l]-heptane system was summarised, and the structures of these compounds were deduced by n. m. r. examination to be 2 - endo -nitrobornane (13), and 3 - exo -, and 3 - endo -nitrobornane (l 4, 15). A study of these spectra, those of their respective intermediates and, in some cases, of their deuterated analogues, confirmed previously reported features and revealed some unexpected differences between 2 - and 3 - substituted bornanes. 3 -Nitrocamphor (3) was prepared from camphor by the classical route, 4 reactions involving less vigorous conditions, and base catalysed nitration with ethyl nitrate having failed. The mutarotation 5 of this compound was studied by n. m. r. spectroscopy and polarimetry. The configuration of the nitro group in the only isolable nitrocamphor was shown to be endo -, and Bell's postulate 6 that mutarotation involved the interconversion of stereoisomers was confirmed. In Section II methods for preparing α-nitroketones and related compounds are described. Base catalysed nitration of 5 αcholestan- 3 -one, 5 α-cholestan- 6 -one and 5 α-cholestan- 7 -one was carried out. The conditions for this reaction, originally used for the nitration of monocyclic 7 and steroid 8 ketones, and modified by Bull, 1 were studied in detail. The experimental conditions finally evolved afforded 2 -nitro- 5 α-cholestan- 3 -one (16) in reproducible yields of 52 %. The proportion of byproduct, 2, 4 -seco- 2, 4 -dinitro- 5 α-cholestane (17) formed from the bis-condensation product (18), was substantially reduced by working at - 30 °. The nitroketone (16) was shown, spectroscopically, to be almost totally enolic, and was smoothly brominated to give 2 α-bromo- 2 β-nitro- 5 α-cholestan- 3 -one (19), which could be decomposed to give the parent nitroketone (16) in 75 % yield. The nitroketone formed an oxime (20) which was used to prepare the furoxan (21). 5 α-Cholestan- 7 -one was nitrated under the same conditions as the 3 -ketone and afforded a mixture of nitroketones (44 %). Crystallisation of the mixture gave 6 α-nitro- 5 α-cholestan- 7 -one (22), and equilibration of the mixture by treatment with NaHCO 3, and acidification yielded 6 β-nitro- 5 α-cholestan- 7 -one (23). The structures of these compounds were determined by n. m. r. spectroscopy, and were confirmed by the instability of the 6 β-nitroketone (23) due to interaction with C- 19. Both nitroketones, on treatment with a trace of NaHCO 3, without acidification in the working up, afforded the 6 A 7 alpha;-nitroketone (22), and a second compound which was not investigated further. Nitration of 5 α-cholestan- 6 -one occurred only in low yield (< 5 %), the major product being unchanged ketone. This is attributed to hindrance of approach to C- 7 by the C- 15 methylene group. A second route to steroid nitroketones was investigated, but not carried to its conclusion. This route led, instead, to a study of compounds containing vicinal nitrogen substituents. 5 α-Cholestan- 3 -one was hydroxy-iminated 9 under basic conditions: with one mol. of amyl nitrite, 2 -hydroxy-imino- 5 α-cholestan- 3 -one (24) was obtained in 34 % yield. With 2 mols. of nitrite, the 2, 4 -disubstituted ketone (25) was obtained (22 %). Under acid catalysed conditions, 10 the hydroxyiminoketone (24) was obtained in 70 % yield, and was converted to the 2, 3 -dioxime (26) in 99 % yield. This dioxime was also prepared by oxygenating 5 α-cholestan- 3 -one under Barton's conditions, 11 and oximating the resulting dionediosphenol mixture (27). This dioxime was dehydrated to the <b>furazan</b> (28), and oxidised with sodium hypochlorite to the furoxan (29). The properties of these compounds were in agreement with analogous compounds previously reported. 10 The furoxan (29) was shown to have the structure (29) by comparison with the furoxan (21) prepared from the 2 -nitro- 3 -oxime (20). The dioxime was oxidised under conditions (buffered peracid) where steroid monoximes give good yields of secondary nitre-compounds, 1 but the only identifiable product (18 %) was a furoxan whose properties were {{similar to those of the}} product prepared above. A small amount of material (6 %) was isolated which exhibited strong nitro absorption in its i. r. spectrum (l 540, 1580 cm. - 1). During the preparation of the starting materials used in this section, it was found that the hydroboration of cholest- 5 -ene in the preparation of the 6 -ketone, was not as stereospecific as had been reported. 12 The mixture of 5 α- and 5 β- 6 -ketones produced was subjected to an alkaline epimerisation without any change in composition. In view of the fact that the ketone would be used under equilibrating conditions, the material prepared, containing approximately 15 % of 5 β-cholestan- 6 -one, was used without further purification. The signals of the angular methyl groups in twenty-six mono-, di- and tri-oxo-steroids, free from other substituents were examined in carbon tetrachloride, deuterochloroform, benzene and pyridine (Section III). Benzene was found, as expected, 13 to give rise to the largest shifts, and the Δ 3 1 values (Γ C 6 H 6 - Γ C C l 4) of the methyl groups varied characteristically with the position of the ketonic groups. With the 6 -ketones, the Δ 3 1 value appeared to be greater for the C- 18 than for the C- 19 protons: unexpectedly, changes in stereochemistry at C- 5 had little effect on the shifts in the 6 - and 17 -ketones. The methyl resonances of deuterochloroform solutions of di- and tri-oxo- 5 α-androstanes showed remarkably good agreement with the figures predicted from Zürcher's survey, 14 and the observed Δ 3 1 values were close to those calculated from the shifts of the corresponding monoketones. In Section IV, a study of the n. m. r. spectra of eight monocyclic mono- and dioximes, eight bicyclic monoterpene oximes and steroid monoximes at the 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 17 positions is described. The features of the spectra of the monocyclic oximes were found to be in agreement with those previously reported. 15 In the spectra of the isomeric mixture of syn - and anti - 3 - hydroxyimino camphor (9) and of pure anti - 3 -hydroxyimino camphor (30), a clear indication of the deshielding effect of the hydroxyl group of the oxime function on the C- 4 proton was observed. The low field signals in the spectra of the steroid oximes were shown to be equatorial in nature because of their appearance as doublets. Comparison of the shifts of the C- 18 and C- 19 protons' signals in these compounds, relative to the parent hydrocarbons, with those of compounds with ketone groups in the same positions indicated that the general effect of the oxime function is similar to that of the carbonyl group, since the observed shifts were of the same magnitude and sign.
