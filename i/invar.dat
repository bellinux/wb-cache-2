40|$|We propose an {{explanation}} of anomalies observed {{in the behavior of}} deformation hardening of <b>Invars.</b> An extremely strong volume magnetostriction, typical of <b>Invars,</b> results in an enhancement of the exchange contribution to the energy of the dislocation system by about three orders of magnitude with respect to its value in conventional ferromagnetics.

25|$|Because of {{the very}} high power levels involved, large lamps are water-cooled. In those used in IMAX projectors, the {{electrode}} bodies are made from solid <b>Invar</b> and tipped with thoriated tungsten. An O-ring seals off the tube, so that the naked electrodes do not contact the water. In low power applications the electrodes are too cold for efficient electron emission and are not cooled; in high power applications an additional water cooling circuit for each electrode is necessary. To save costs, the water circuits are often not separated and the water needs to be deionized to make it electrically non-conductive, which, in turn, lets the quartz or some laser media dissolve into the water.|$|E

500|$|Another {{space-saving}} innovation was {{the dielectric}} resonator, {{which can be}} used in other filter formats as well as waveguide. [...] The first use of these in a filter was by S. B. Cohn in 1965, using titanium dioxide as the dielectric material. [...] Dielectric resonators used in the 1960s, however, had very poor temperature coefficients, typically 500 times worse than a mechanical resonator made of <b>invar,</b> which led to instability of filter parameters. [...] Dielectric materials of the time with better temperature coefficients had too low a dielectric constant to be useful for space saving. [...] This changed with the introduction of ceramic resonators with very low temperature coefficients in the 1970s. [...] The first of these was from Massé and Pucel using barium tetratitanateO9 (Young et al., page 655) at Raytheon in 1972.

2500|$|Around 1900 low thermal {{expansion}} materials were developed which, when used as pendulum rods, made elaborate temperature compensation unnecessary. These were only used in {{a few of the}} highest precision clocks before the pendulum became obsolete as a time standard. In 1896 Charles Édouard Guillaume invented the nickel steel alloy <b>Invar.</b> This has a CTE of around 0.5 µin/(in·°F), resulting in pendulum temperature errors over 71°F of only 1.3 seconds per day, and this residual error could be compensated to zero with a few centimeters of aluminium under the pendulum bob (this {{can be seen in the}} Riefler clock image above). <b>Invar</b> pendulums were first used in 1898 in the Riefler regulator clock [...] which achieved accuracy of 15 milliseconds per day. Suspension springs of Elinvar were used to eliminate temperature variation of the spring's restoring force on the pendulum. Later fused quartz was used which had even lower CTE. These materials are the choice for modern high accuracy pendulums.|$|E
2500|$|It {{might seem}} logical {{to make the}} heavy magnet serve as a mass, but that {{subjects}} the seismograph to errors when the Earth's magnetic field moves. [...] This is also why seismograph's moving parts are constructed from a material that interacts minimally with magnetic fields. [...] A seismograph is also sensitive to changes in temperature so many instruments are constructed from low expansion materials such as nonmagnetic <b>invar.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Around 1900 low-thermal-expansion {{materials}} {{began to}} be used for pendulum rods in the highest precision clocks and other instruments, first <b>invar,</b> a nickel steel alloy, and later fused quartz, which made temperature compensation trivial. [...] Precision pendulums were housed in low pressure tanks, which kept the air pressure constant to prevent changes in the period due to changes in buoyancy of the pendulum due to changing atmospheric pressure. [...] The accuracy of the best pendulum clocks topped out at around a second per year.|$|E
2500|$|The Q of pendulums {{ranges from}} several {{thousand}} in an ordinary clock {{to several hundred}} thousand for precision regulator pendulums swinging in vacuum. [...] A quality home pendulum clock might have a Q of 10,000 and an accuracy of 10 seconds per month. The most accurate commercially produced pendulum clock was the Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock, invented in 1921. [...] Its <b>Invar</b> master pendulum swinging in a vacuum tank had a Q of 110,000 and an error rate of around a second per year.|$|E
2500|$|All modern xenon short-arc lamps use a {{fused quartz}} {{envelope}} with thoriated tungsten electrodes. [...] Fused quartz {{is the only}} economically feasible material currently available that can withstand the high pressure (25 atmospheres for an IMAX bulb) and high temperature present in an operating lamp, while still being optically clear. [...] The thorium dopant in the electrodes greatly enhances their electron emission characteristics. [...] Because tungsten and quartz have different coefficients of thermal expansion, the tungsten electrodes are welded to strips of pure molybdenum metal or <b>Invar</b> alloy, which are then melted into the quartz to form the envelope seal.|$|E
2500|$|Miller {{worked on}} {{increasingly}} larger interferometers, culminating in {{one with a}} [...] (effective) arm length that he tried at various sites, including {{on top of a}} mountain at the Mount Wilson Observatory. To avoid the possibility of the aether wind being blocked by solid walls, his mountaintop observations used a special shed with thin walls, mainly of canvas. From noisy, irregular data, he consistently extracted a small positive signal that varied with each rotation of the device, with the sidereal day, and on a yearly basis. His measurements in the 1920s amounted to approximately [...] instead of the nearly [...] expected from the Earth's orbital motion alone. He remained convinced this was due to partial entrainment or aether dragging, though he did not attempt a detailed explanation. He ignored critiques demonstrating the inconsistency of his results and the refutation by the Hammar experiment. Miller's findings were considered important at the time, and were discussed by Michelson, Lorentz and others at a meeting reported in 1928. There was general agreement that more experimentation was needed to check Miller's results. Miller later built a non-magnetic device to eliminate magnetostriction, while Michelson built one of non-expanding <b>Invar</b> to eliminate any remaining thermal effects. Other experimenters from around the world increased accuracy, eliminated possible side effects, or both. So far, no one has been able to replicate Miller's results, and modern experimental accuracies have ruled them out. Roberts (2006) has pointed out that the primitive data reduction techniques used by Miller and other early experimenters, including Michelson and Morley, were capable of creating apparent periodic signals even when none existed in the actual data. After reanalyzing Miller's original data using modern techniques of quantitative error analysis, Roberts found Miller's apparent signals to be statistically insignificant.|$|E
