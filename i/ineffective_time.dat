The brewing process of the company under study had been taking longer than the standard time hence affecting productivity. The researchers focused on identifying areas for productivity improvement using work-study. The boiler, brewing and packaging sections of the production department were investigated. A descriptive research was conducted in which interviews; direct observations and work sampling were used to collect data. A sample size of 75 observations was determined using a statistical formula. Out of the 75 observations conducted at the boiler, brewing and packaging sections, the researchers concluded that; for the boiler section, 68 % of the time the workers were working while the remaining 32 % was attributed to <b>ineffective</b> <b>time.</b> For the brewing section, 60 % of the time the workers were working while 40 % was attributed to <b>ineffective</b> <b>time.</b> For the packaging section (machine 1), 80 % of the time, the workers were working while 20 % accounted for <b>ineffective</b> <b>time.</b> Lastly for the packaging section (machine 2) 83 % of the time, the workers were working while 17 % accounted for <b>ineffective</b> <b>time.</b> The findings separated employee’s and machine working time from idle time.

Dementia will pose {{a huge impact on}} society and thus it is essential to develop novel tools able to detect the earliest, most sensitive, discriminative and dynamic biomarkers for each of the disorders. To date, the most common assays used in large-scale protein biomarker analysis are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), such as the sandwich immunoassays, which are sensitive, practical and easily implemented. However, due to the novelty of many candidate biomarkers identified during proteomics screening, such assays or the antibodies that specifically recognize the desired marker are often not available.

40|$|The {{explosion}} in the volume of data about urban environments has opened up opportunities to inform both policy and administration and thereby help governments {{improve the lives of}} their citizens, increase the efficiency of public services, and reduce the environmental harms of development. However, cities are complex systems and exploring the data they generate is challenging. The interaction between the various components in a city creates complex dynamics where interesting facts occur at multiple scales, requiring users to inspect a large number of data slices over time and space. Manual exploration of these slices is <b>ineffective,</b> <b>time</b> consuming, and in many cases impractical. In this paper, we propose a technique that supports event-guided exploration of large, spatio-temporal urban data. We model the data as time-varying scalar functions and use computational topology to automatically identify events in different data slices. To handle a potentially large number of events, we develop an algorithm to group and index them, thus allowing users to interactively explore and query event patterns on the fly. A visual exploration interface helps guide users towards data slices that display interesting events and trends. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on two different data sets from New York City (NYC) : data about taxi trips and subway service. We also report on the feedback we received from analysts at different NYC agencies. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Currently applied {{nebulisation}} {{techniques for}} the administration of antibiotics to patients with infectious lung diseases are <b>ineffective,</b> <b>time</b> consuming and therefore, burdensome to the patient. Dry powder inhalers may be an interesting alternative {{as they can be}} effective, simple, cheap and thus, disposable. Methods: Our preferred strategy for high dose drug administration is to avoid the use of excipients, apply simple production techniques and adapt the design of the dry powder inhaler to the specific properties of the drug. For this study we produced excipient free tobramycin particles (sulphate and base) by micronization and spray drying. We also used two different dry powder inhalers, the Twincer™and the Novolizer ®, both making use of air classifier technology for dispersion. The Twincer™is a disposable inhaler specifically designed {{for the administration}} of high doses of colistimethate sodium. The Novolizer ® was used only to investigate whether a different classifier design can overcome problems with retention and dispersion of tobramycin, which has completely different physico-chemical properties compared to colistimethate sodium. Results: Spray dried tobramycin performs better in the Twincer™than micronised particles. Although the Twincer™classifiers effectively disperse spray dried tobramycin, a high inhaler retention is obtained because of adhesion onto the classifier walls. In contrast, the Novolizer ® classifier combines a high dispersion efficiency with minimal retention, but this device is not suitable for delivery of high drug doses. Conclusion: The results indicate that the Twincer™dry powder inhaler can be optimised for spray-dried tobramycin free base by re-designing the classifiers...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} {{government}} and industry effort to study the flying qualities of aircraft with rate-limited control surface actuators, two studies were previously flown to examine an algorithm developed to reduce the tendency for pilot-induced oscillation when rate limiting occurs. This algorithm, when working properly, greatly improved the performance of the aircraft in the first study. In the second study, however, the algorithm did not initially offer as much improvement. The differences between the two studies caused concern. The study detailed in this paper was performed to determine whether the performance of the algorithm was affected by the characteristics of the cockpit controllers. Time delay and flight control system noise were also briefly evaluated. An in-flight simulator, the Calspan Learjet 25, was programmed with a low roll actuator rate limit, and the algorithm was programmed into the flight control system. Side- and center-stick controllers, force and position command signals, a rate-limited feel system, a low-frequency feel system, and a feel system damper were evaluated. The flight program consisted of four flights and 38 evaluations of test configurations. Performance of the algorithm was determined to be unaffected by using side- or center-stick controllers or force or position command signals.

The low-frequency feel system and the feel system damper were <b>ineffective.</b> <b>Time</b> delay and noise were determined to degrade the performance of the algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) {{makes up}} around {{one-third of all}} cases of SE, {{affecting}} approximately 1, 000 to 4, 000 individuals per year in Belgium. Compared with convulsive SE, NCSE has received considerably less attention, is underdiagnosed and undertreated. However, if recognised, NCSE can however be treated successfully. A workshop was convened by neurologists from major Belgian centres to review the latest information on NCSE and to make recommendations on diagnosis and treatment. These recommendations are not only intended for neurologists, but also for primary care physicians and physicians in intensive care units. NCSE should be suspected whenever cases of fluctuating consciousness or abrupt cognitive or behavioural changes are noted. Confirmation of diagnosis by EEG should be obtained wherever possible. In view of the often subtle clinical signs, EEG is also vital for monitoring treatment outcome. Non-comatose patients should generally be treated in a neurology ward since referral to an ICU is unnecessary. First-line treatment should be an intravenous benzodiazepine. For many patients who fail to respond to benzodiazepines, intravenous valproate will successfully abrogate seizure activity. Intravenous phenytoin {{can be used in}} patients with focal NCSE in whom valproate is contraindicated or <b>ineffective.</b> <b>Time</b> and care should be spent in identifying an appropriate and effective antiepileptic drug regimen without recourse to anaesthesia.

Socket fitting is cost <b>ineffective,</b> <b>time</b> consuming, {{and a source of}} inconvenience for the amputee. Stumpskin slippage within the socket can cause discomfort, internal limb pain, and eventually skin ulcers as a result of excessive pressure and shear within the socket. This study presents a new method of assessment of three-dimensional (3 D) socketstump kinematics/slippage of strenuous activities using Biplane Dynamic Roentgen Stereogrammetric Analysis instrumentation. Ten below knee amputees participated in the study. A more holistic representation of the downward slippage trend of all proximal side skin markers with respect to the socket, and an even more characteristic and of higher magnitude downward-and anterioposterior slippage (maximum slippage: 151 mm for the fast-stop task and 19 mm for the step-down task) between the distal markers after impact, was possible for both tasks for all amputees. Displacement between skin-to-skin marker pairs reached maximum values of approximately 10 mm for the step-down trials and up to 24 mm for the fast stop trials. Maximum skin strain was dependent on the position of the skin markers. Distally positioned skin marker pairs demonstrated mainly anterioposterior displacement between each other (maximum relative strain: 13 to 14). Maximum relative strain for the proximal markers was 8 to 10. This highly accurate, in-vivo, patient-specific, unobtrusive dynamic information, presented using 3 D visualization tools that were up to now unavailable to the clinician-prosthetist, can significantly impact the iterative cycle of socket fitting and evaluation...|$|E

This study was designed as a qualitative study. Subjects of this study consisted of 5 school administrators and 5 teachers. Two different, but parallel, semi-structured interview schedules were used for data collection. Data was analyzed through the use of the content analysis method. As a result of this analysis, the problems associated with classroom management were grouped under the following themes; lack of motivation, rule and routines breaking, boring literature texts/materials, <b>ineffective</b> <b>time</b> management, classroom environment, language barrier and lack of classroom interaction. On the other side, participants relate these problems with the following reasons; nature and status of the subject in the curriculum, classroom environment, crowded classroom and boring literature texts/materials, lack of rules, teachers’ inefficiency in classroom management and students’ attitudes. Finally, the following solutions were suggested to overcome disciplines and classroom management problems; increasing teachers’ pedagogical and subject area knowledge, re-framing the nature of literature course/subject in the curriculum, using a reward system that facilitates motivation, establishing classroom rules, giving punishment, ignoring, investigating the reasons of the problem, encouraging students’ creativity to incorporate the texts into their daily lives to make it interesting, using the influence of the English Language Society to promote Literature to the students in the school and collecting feedback from students about the subject and adhering to their needs...|$|E

The brewing laboratory also co-ordinates taste sessions, and maintains and calibrates equipment for the plant. They also have internal verification (Reference control) systems and validation (standards) systems in place to ensure accuracy of measurements. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) scores according to the researcher are low owing to staff cuts and <b>ineffective</b> <b>time</b> management. The aim {{of this research is}} to improve SLA scores and to investigate if using SLA scores {{is the best way to}} measure service quality in the Quality Control department of SAB. The researcher aims to use SERVQUAL as a measuring tool to measure service quality in conjunction with SLA‟s. Because the laboratory is a service department, it is expected by brewing internal customers that the laboratory provides the plant with quality data and equipment support in the virtual laboratories in the plant. Furthermore it is expected that the service provided will always be of a high standard, and that SLA scores will be of a high standard as well. The major issue with service quality in the SAB laboratory is the low level of SLA scores. The focus areas of SLA‟s currently are:  Quality Assurance (QA) / Technical/ Production interaction.  Reference control.  Equipment support.  Routine analysis and ad hoc requests.  Trial support.  In process taste requirements.  Package product taste requirements (Routine, profile, trials and flavour stability). The low score of SLA‟S are mainly due to equipment support and reference control. The other factors also contribute to the low score; however the above mentioned two consistently return low scores. The results of service quality are not significantly improved through the use of SLA‟s calling for the requirement to improve service quality using the SERVQUAL instrument...|$|E
