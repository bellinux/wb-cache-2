5|$|After World WarI, the {{prohibition}} {{movement in the}} United States led to Montreal becoming a destination for Americans looking <b>for</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Unemployment remained high in the city, and was exacerbated by the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{combined}} {{data from}} SAMHSA's 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use & Health, {{the rate of}} past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% {{of those who did}} not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{interviewed by}} a New York Times {{reporter}} in February 2017 were skeptical that any measures would {{be successful in}} significantly impacting illegal alcohol sales, given that {{it was such a}} high percentage of the total market <b>for</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Still, Rospotrebnadzor announced at the end of January that the country had seen its first decline in monthly alcohol poisoning deaths in five years.|$|E

5|$|A {{favourite}} of {{the ruling}} Ngô family, Đính received rapid promotions ahead of officers who were regarded as more capable. He converted to Roman Catholicism to curry favour with Diệm, and headed the military wing of the Cần Lao party, a secret Catholic organisation that maintained the Ngôs' grip on power. At the age of 32, Đính became the youngest ever ARVN general and {{the commander of the}} II Corps, but he was regarded as a dangerous, egotistical and impetuous figure with a weakness <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> and partying.|$|E
5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> but not more than three pills per day.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than <b>for</b> <b>alcohol.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hazelwood's driver's license {{had been}} {{suspended}} or revoked three {{times by the}} state of New York <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> violations since 1984. At the time of the Exxon Valdez incident, his New York state driving privileges were suspended {{as a result of a}} driving under the influence arrest on September 13, 1988. He entered a rehabilitation program in 1985 at South Oaks Hospital in Amityville, New York. Following rehabilitation he received 90 days of leave to attend Alcoholics Anonymous, but it is not clear if he attended during that leave.|$|E
5|$|His horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack, and he {{invested}} {{large sums}} of money in the hobby. Murphy had a gambling habit that left his finances in a poor state. In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes.

5|$|In New Jersey, older Department of Defense and Department of Interior {{properties}} such as Fort Dix {{and parts}} of Sandy Hook are federal enclaves, but most other federal properties are not enclaves. Because New Jersey generally did not reserve any right to regulate federal enclaves, state liquor licensing rules and alcohol taxes cannot be enforced. There is no universal policy regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages on federal lands, but almost all military bases, and some national parks allow <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> concessions, both for on-premises or off-premises consumption.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Court's decision in Schmerber, many legal scholars feared the ruling {{would be used to}} limit civil liberties. Other scholars, including Nita A. Farahany, Benjamin Holley, and John G. New, have suggested courts may use the ruling in Schmerber to justify the use of mind reading devices against criminal suspects. Because the Court's ruling in Schmerber prohibited the use of warrantless blood tests in most circumstances, some commentators argue that the decision was responsible for the proliferation of breathalyzers to test <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> and urine analyses to test for controlled substances in criminal investigations.|$|E

5000|$|The “1,5 ” {{hydrogen}} shift cause {{transfer of}} one γ- hydrogen to a radical site on a saturated heteroatom. The same requirements for McLafferty rearrangement apply to hydrogen rearrangement to a saturated heteroatom. Such rearrangement initiates charge-site reaction, {{resulting in the}} formation of an odd electron ion and a small neutral molecule ( [...] water, or acid and so on). <b>For</b> <b>alcohols,</b> this heterolytic cleavage releases a water molecule. Since the charge-site reactions are dominant in the less bulky alcohols, this reaction is favored <b>for</b> <b>alcohols</b> as primary > secondary > tertiary.|$|R

These residences were closed {{at the end of the}} Spring 2010 semester, although several others of these original dormitories continue to be used as office space for departments such as the Office of Student Employment, the Air Force ROTC Detachment 155, and the Center <b>for</b> <b>Alcohol</b> and Other Drug Education PIER 21.|$|E
5|$|Naltrexone is a {{competitive}} antagonist for opioid receptors, effectively blocking {{the effects of}} endorphins and opioids. Naltrexone is used to decrease cravings <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> and encourage abstinence. Alcohol causes the body to release endorphins, which in turn release dopamine and activate the reward pathways; hence when naltrexone is in the body there is {{a reduction in the}} pleasurable effects from consuming alcohol. Evidence supports a reduced risk of relapse among alcohol dependent persons and a decrease in excessive drinking. Nalmefene also appears effective and works by a similar manner.|$|E
5|$|Olds' fondness <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{was well}} known. John Darrell Sherwood, {{in his book}} Fast Movers: Jet Pilots and the Vietnam Experience, posits that Olds' heavy {{drinking}} hurt his post-Vietnam career. On July 12, 2001, Olds was arrested for {{driving under the influence}} of alcohol and resisting arrest near his home in Steamboat Springs. Olds, briefly hospitalized during the incident for facial cuts, pleaded guilty in return for charges of weaving and felony vehicular eluding being dropped. Olds was placed on one year probation, and ordered to pay almost $900in fines and costs, attend an alcohol education course, and perform 72hours of community service.|$|E

5|$|Topiramate, a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or {{cut back on the}} amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> dependence. A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E
