5|$|Shepard {{graduated}} from the Pinkerton Academy in 1940. Because World War II was already raging in Europe, his father wanted him to join the Army. Shepard chose the Navy instead. He easily passed the entrance exam to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1940, but at sixteen {{was too young to}} enter that year. The Navy sent him to the Admiral Farragut Academy, a prep school for the Naval Academy, from which he graduated with the class of 1941. Tests administered at Farragut indicated an IQ of 145, but his <b>grades</b> <b>were</b> mediocre.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Dawkins did a post {{graduate}} {{year at the}} New Hampton School in New Hampton, New Hampshire where he averaged 12.3 points and 3.6 rebounds before receiving a late scholarship offer from Michigan. His <b>grades</b> <b>were</b> not sufficient to pursue a scholarship at Stanford and despite his relationship with Chris Collins, Northwestern {{was not interested in}} Dawkins given their commitments from wings Vic Law and Scottie Lindsey. While at New Hampton, he was being recruited by Steve Donahue of Boston College, but Donahue left Boston College in 2014 and recommended Dawkins to Beilein. Before Michigan stepped in, it appeared that he would have committed to Dayton, although he was also considering Utah State, Pepperdine as well as Montana, and Rhode Island was showing a strong interest. In fact, during the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, Dawkins attended the Sweet 16 round to watch his father's Stanford Cardinal play Dayton in the South Regional on March 27. Dawkins accepted a recruiting visit to Michigan in early April 2014 when he received his scholarship offer. He made his verbal commitment on April 28 and signed his National Letter of Intent on May 9.|$|E
5|$|The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher <b>grades</b> <b>were</b> {{based on}} four {{separate}} enactments. The first enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573 of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross (Eisernes Kreuz) and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. As the war progressed, {{some of the}} recipients distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Oak Leaves to Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, {{were based on the}} enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849 of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613 of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit goldenem Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten), based on the enactment Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11 of 29 December 1944, concluded the variants of the Knight's Cross.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the quality of English summative test taken by the {{students}} of MAN Boarding School Meulaboh I in terms of validity, reliability, difficulty index, discrimination index, {{and the effectiveness of}} distractors. Content analysis was employed in this study. Two techniques were carried out to collect the data, namely checklist and document analysis. The data from checklist were analyzed by using a statistical procedure in percentage form and the data from document analysis were analyzed by using Anates Software version 4. The results showed that English summative test in the context of content analysis of the first grade has sufficient validity, the second grade has poor validity, and the third grade has a very poor validity. However, in terms of construct validity the first grade and the third grade have poor construct validity, while the second grade has sufficient construct validity. Meanwhile, in terms of validity coefficient, the first grade and the third <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 60 % and the second <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 44 %. Secondly, English summative test of MAN Boarding School has a consistent degree of reliability. The reliability index of the first grade and the second <b>grade</b> test <b>is</b> 0. 70 and the third <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 0. 88. Thirdly, 60 % of the test in the first grade test, 48 % of which in the second grade, and 8 % of which in the third <b>grade</b> test <b>are</b> accepted. It means that the third grade has a very poor difficulty index. Fourthly, a good discrimination index of the test in the first <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 76 %, second <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 56 %, and the third <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 72 %. In other words, more than half of discrimination index is good. Finally, the quality of distractors of English summative test of the third <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> not as good as that of the first grade and second grade.
