40|$|Heavy metals {{are found}} as {{pollutant}} in many industrial waste waters. The toxicity of heavy metals {{has been known}} for many years and they belong to persistent toxic substances. Therefore, removal of these metals from industrial effluents represents an important challenge in order to avoid one of the major causes of water and soil pollution. The aim of this thesis was the efficient removal of two metal ions which are close to or more noble than hydrogen in the <b>electromotive</b> <b>series</b> (i. e. zinc and copper) from aqueous solutions that simulate industrial wastewater containing these two elements. The removal was done by employing an electrolytic reactor, provided with a 3 -dimensional packed-bed cathode of carbon particles, operated in a continuous recirculation mode of flow. Firstly, the removal of copper from monometallic solution was dealt with where the effects of initial concentration of the metal, flow rate, applied current intensity and initial pH (pHo) on removal...|$|E

40|$|Sterile plain broth {{contains}} an active oxidation-reduction system, {{the characteristics of}} which have been analyzed. 1. Intensity factor: Under vaseline seal, the lot of broth used in these experiments reaches a reduction potential corresponding to reduced indigo disulfonate (rH = 10). All the indicators with a more positive E 0 ' are reduced, the others are not affected. It seems probable that fresh broth, which has not undergone oxidation by molecular oxygen, would give a higher reduction potential. 2. Capacity factor: The maximum amounts of different indicators that can be reduced correspond to equimolecular concentrations. This seems to indicate either (a) that the broth does not contain several "independent" reducing systems (at least in appreciable amounts), or (b) that these hypothetical "independent" systems all have about the same reduction potential. 3. Time factor: The different indicators of oxidation-reduction potentials are reduced in the order of the <b>electromotive</b> <b>series.</b> 4. Nature of the system: The system seems to be reversible (this not excluding the possibility of irreversible autoxidations) and {{does not appear to be}} of the nature of a sugar. The relation of these phenomena to the cultivation of different species of bacteria will be reported later...|$|E
40|$|An <b>electromotive</b> force <b>series</b> for redox couples {{was defined}} as a {{function}} of oxygen fugacity in a borosilicate melt at 1150 C. The resulting order of relative reduction potentials can be used to estimate the amounts of redox species in glass during processing. The <b>electromotive</b> force <b>series</b> in this melt is comparable to those in other silicate glass-forming melts and in aqueous systems but differs in detail because of interaction of the solvents with individual redox couples...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (1) an <b>electromotive</b> force <b>series</b> for solid and molten chlorides was presented for tem-peratures ranging from 25 ~ to 1500 ~ This series {{was based on}} the Gibbs energy (free energy) of formation of the respective solid and molten chlorides and cor-responded to the reversible mfs of cells of the type metal I metall ic chloride] chlorine gas [1] It was also shown that it was unnecessary for practical purposes to divide the emfs into separate anodic and cathodic potentials, although one could assume that the potential of the chlorine electrode is zero (2) for each solid or molten chloride; the potential of each metal would then be, by convention, equal to the emf of the whole cell [1]. In this paper similar series are given for solid an...|$|R
40|$|The {{potentials}} of {{a series}} of meta l-meta l chloride systems in an equimolar mixture of molten potassium and sodium chlorides have been measured against a s i lver-s i lver chloride reference electrode. An <b>electromotive</b> force <b>series</b> of metals at different temperatures has been established for this part icular solvent. Experiments with a chlorine electrode have shown that the solutions of si lver chloride in the KC 1 -NaC 1 solvent are ideal, and hence, deviations from ideal i ty of the other chlorides in this solvent can be attr ibuted irect ly to the formation of complexes in the melts. Three types of behavior have been ob-served for the salts studied in this solvent: ideality, and positive and negative deviations from ideality. The theoretical aspects of complex formation in melts are discussed.
