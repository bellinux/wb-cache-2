In Iran, like many other developing countries, not enough attention is paid to this matter and available information regarding the generation and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>wastes</b> are low. The existing information about production and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> wastes in our hospitals is little and incomplete. In this study, a survey on hospital waste management system in Bushehr province hospitals was conducted. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 8 hospitals in Bushehr province were investigated during a period of 6 months using a questionnaire, interviews and direct observations. The questionnaire had 93 questions (open and closed) about general information on the hospitals and about various systems of managing hospital waste according to the World Health Organization suggested survey questionnaire for hospital waste management in developing countries. Results: In hospitals of bushehr province, waste generation rate was 2615 kg/day, including domestic waste (51. 7 %), infectious waste (20. 8 %), sharps (15. 2 %) and chemical and drugs wastes (12. 3 %). In almost all hospitals, segregation of infectious waste from domestic waste at the place of origin and putting them in special containers had been done but this segregation wasn’t complete and sometimes some hazardous waste were disposed of in domestic waste containers. All hospitals used a color coding system for waste containers, 75 % of hospitals had incinerators. In others, waste was carried out by municipal service daily. In all hospitals, all workers were trained about hospital waste management. In none of the surveyed hospitals, there was an obvious policy and plan for purchasing equipment and necessary facilities in order to dispose hospital waste correctly and also no clear budget was allocated for hospital waste management. In none of these hospitals regular reports on hospital waste management were prepared.

S 24 comprises 			two important components. Firstly, it confers on “everyone” the right to an environment that is not harmful 			to their health or well-being”. Secondly, it places a duty on the state to prevent pollution and other 			damage to the environment, and to promote conservation and sustainable development. Section 24 (b) 			has vertical application as it is the state (or its organs like municipalities) that has the capacity to 			take”legislative and other measures” to protect the environment. 			The removal and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> is therefore the duty of local authority. If local authority cannot 			perform its duties the provincial executive must intervene to ensure and to create a co-operative 			government. Municipal councils must not judge their own functions; checks and balances must be 			controlled by another institution. The public must therefore be pro-active in order to build an environment 			that is sustainable in accordance with section 24 of the Constitution...|$|E
40|$|Background: Infection causes {{neonatal}} mortality in both {{high and low}} income countries. While simple interventions to prevent neonatal infection are available, they are often poorly understood and implemented by clinicians. A basic understanding of healthcare providers' perceptions of infection control provides a platform for improving current practices. Our aim was to explore the views of healthcare providers in provincial hospitals in south and south central Vietnam to inform the design of programmes to improve neonatal {{infection prevention and control}}. Methods: All fifty-four participants who attended a workshop on infection prevention and control were asked to complete an anonymous, written questionnaire identifying their priorities for improving neonatal infection prevention and control in provincial hospitals in south and south central Vietnam. Results: Hand washing, exclusive breastfeeding and safe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> were nominated by most participants as priorities for preventing neonatal infections. Education through instructional posters and written guidelines, family contact, kangaroo-mother-care, limitation of invasive procedures and screening for maternal GBS infection were advocated by a smaller proportion of participants. Conclusions: The opinions of neonatal healthcare providers at the workshop accurately reflect some of the current international recommendations for infection prevention. However, other important recommendations were not commonly identified by participants and need to be reinforced. Our results will be used to design interventions to improve infection prevention in Vietnam, and may be relevant to other low-resource countries. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{developing}} countries, {{very few}} methods <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>disposal</b> and treatments are used {{which lead to}} adverse impacts to public health. In healthcare facilities, the issue of infectious waste generated has become the big concern today for hospital authority. To ensure the proper <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>medical</b> <b>wastes</b> has become the big challenge for the hospital waste management {{and they think that}} to outsource the waste disposal process is the best option. Hence, to ensure the proper hygiene environment and to minimize the cost of operations, the trends in outsourcing the waste disposal process is increasing. But, outsourcing process is not easy for the hospitals authorities as {{it is very difficult to}} select the best waste disposal firm, which takes care of all the government regulations and at the same time is cost effective. Since selection <b>of</b> healthcare waste <b>disposal</b> firms is based on the evaluation of various attributes of each alternative, therefore this problem is a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. Till now, so many methods like analytical hierarchy process (AHP); analytical network process (ANP); data envelopment analysis (DEA); fuzzy theory; mathematical programming, etc. have been used by various researchers to select the best alternate out of the available choices. The above-mentioned techniques either used the precise values of the attributes or in terms of membership functions. However, in case of uncertainty these techniques failed to implement. Hence, this paper reports the implementation of grey theory to choose the appropriate healthcare waste disposal firm with uncertain information. This paper proposed a MADM model based on grey theory to select the optimal waste disposal firm and finally, the proposed model has been applied to select the best healthcare waste disposal firm...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Environmental Health)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2007 This study {{examined}} the <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management practices <b>of</b> Tygerberg Hospital. The researcher made use of both primary and secondaiy data. Since this was a is study, the analysis is essentially descriptive. The {{results of this study}} revealed that both general and <b>medical</b> <b>wastes</b> are generated in the hospital. Tygerberg Hospital does not quantify <b>medical</b> <b>waste.</b> Segregation <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>wastes</b> into infectious <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> and non-infectious <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> is not conducted according to definite rules and standards. The hospital does not label infectious waste with Biohazard symbol. Separation <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> and municipal waste is however practiced to a satisfactory extent. Wheeled trolleys are used for on-site transportation of waste from the points of production (different wards) to the temporary storage area. Staff responsible for collecting <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> use almost complete personal protective equipment. The results of this study indicated that off-site transportation of the hospital waste is undertaken by a private waste management company. Waste is transported daily and small pickups are mainly used by the waste management company for transporting the waste to an off-site area for treatment and disposal. The final <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> is done by the private waste management company. The main treatment method used in the final <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> infectious waste is incineration. Non-infectious waste is disposed <b>of</b> using land <b>disposal</b> method. The hospital does not recycle <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> materials except white office paper and mixed office paper and the use of empty containers of antiseptics for the collection and temporary storage of sharps. The hospital does not provide training for staff members on the health and environmental effects of infectious waste. The waste management company's workers have also not received any formal training with regards to <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management. The study showed that Tygerberg Hospital does not have a policy and plan in place for managing <b>medical</b> <b>waste.</b> There is no definite policy or plan for purchasing the necessary equipment and for providing the facilities for the correct management <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> in the hospital. There are also no policies and guidelines regarding the recycling <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> products. There are a number of problems the hospital faces in terms <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management, including; lack of necessary rules, regulations and instructions on the different aspects <b>of</b> collection and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> waste, intermingling of hazardous wastes with domestic waste in the hospital sometimes, failure to quantify the waste generated in reliable records, lack of use of coloured bags by limiting the bags to only one colour for all waste, the absence of a dedicated waste manager, the supervisor in charge of general services has waste management as part of his job schedule, and there is no committee responsible for monitoring the management <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>waste.</b> From the results of this study, it is obvious that <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management is not practiced according to the World Health Organisation's (WHO's) recommended standards. There are some areas where <b>medical</b> <b>wastes</b> are not properly managed. It is imperative for significant investment in the proper management <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> {{in order to reduce the}} health risk it poses...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Antibiotics {{as a type}} of {{pharmaceutical}} compounds are widely used in modern medicine and veterinary industries. They enter the environment in different ways, including agricultural runoff, direct discharge of urban wastewater treatment or human <b>waste,</b> direct <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>medical,</b> veterinary industrial <b>waste</b> and to name but a few. Antibiotics have been able to influence the microbial population. Their continuous presence in the environment can lead to bacterial resistance and in recent years, the issue has caused serious concerns in the scientific community. Materials and Methods: Unfortunately, in spite of the extensive investigations, there is still a considerable lack of integrated and classified information to assess the environmental risks of antibiotics. Therefore, in the current study, the removal of these compounds from aqueous solutions was studied. This study was carried out on the basis of surveys accomplished in recent decades and also the ones published in databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Elsevier, Scopus, Springer, Magiran and SID using anti-bacterial agents, antibiotic, wastewater and removal methods as the keywords. Results: Advanced treatment processes such as ozonation, advanced oxidation, activated carbon, Nano filtration and reverse osmosis can remove higher levels of antibiotics. Conclusion: Generally, the biological and chemical processes alone are not effective for antibiotics' removal from aquatic environments while combination of advanced oxidation and biological treatment processes can effectively reduce the amount of antibiotic.  ...|$|R
