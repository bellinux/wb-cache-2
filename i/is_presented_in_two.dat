During the mid-1990s, Ray's film essays and {{an anthology of}} short stories were also published in English in the West. Our Films, Their Films is an anthology of film criticism by Ray. The book contains articles and personal journal excerpts. The book <b>is</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> sections: Ray first discusses Indian film, before turning his attention toward Hollywood, specific filmmakers (Charlie Chaplin and Akira Kurosawa), and movements such as Italian neorealism. His book Bishoy Chalachchitra was published in translation in 2006 as Speaking of Films. It contains a compact description of his philosophy of {{different aspects of the}} cinemas.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, Nardini et al. (2010) {{recently}} hypothesised {{that young}} children have optimized their sensory appreciation for speed over accuracy. When information <b>is</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> forms, children may derive an estimate from the fastest available source, subsequently ignoring the alternate, even if it contains redundant information. Nardini et al. (2010) provides evidence that children's (aged 6 years) response latencies are significantly lower when stimuli are presented in multi-cue over single-cue conditions. Conversely, adults showed no change between these conditions. Indeed, adults display mandatory fusion of signals, therefore they can only ever aim for maximum accuracy. Interestingly, however, the overall mean latencies for children were not faster than adults, which suggests that speed optimization merely enable them {{to keep up with}} the mature pace. Considering the haste of real-world events, this strategy may prove necessary to counteract the general slower processing of children and maintain effective vision-action coupling. Ultimately the developing sensory system may preferentially adapt for different goals – speed and detecting sensory conflicts – those typical of objective learning.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> halves; in the first half, Lloyd and the curator introduce the three guests, provide an explanation of who they are, and the five engage in a general discussion. In the second half, the curator declares the Museum open for donations, and each guest explains what they wish to [...] "donate" [...] to the museum (again, as the museum is fictional, nothing is actually exchanged). Questioning of all three guests ensures that everyone says something about each donation.|$|E
