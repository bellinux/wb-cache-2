5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E
500|$|Skelton's 70-year {{career as}} an {{entertainer}} began as a stage performer. [...] He retained a fondness for theaters, and referred to them as [...] "palaces"; he also likened them to his [...] "living room", where he would privately entertain guests. [...] At {{the end of a}} performance, he would look at the empty stage where there was now no laughter or applause and tell himself, [...] "Tomorrow I must start again. One <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> I was a big man. I was important out there. Now it's empty. It's all gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|This breed, {{formerly}} named Picard, {{was much}} appreciated in ancient hunting {{at the time}} of Henry IV of France and Louis XIII of France, and much sought after. Selincourt already made much of it, wondering and amazed to see these dogs pulling a hare which had passed by one <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> in dry weather. Le Couteulx de Canteleu, in Manuel de Vénerie Française (1890), (Manual of French Hunting - 1890), praises also the Artois hound. He reports that the artesian breed of his time was crossbred and difficult to find pure but, in spite of that, it still remained one of the best breeds for hare hunting.|$|E

2500|$|McIntyre {{asked whether}} {{he was to be}} shot. Kelly replied, [...] "No, why should I want to shoot you? Could I not have done it half an <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> if I had wanted?" [...] He added, [...] "At first I thought you were Constable Flood. If you had been, I would have roasted you in the fire." [...] Kelly asked if the police came out to shoot him. [...] "No", replied McIntyre, [...] "we came to {{apprehend}} you." [...] "What", asked Kelly, [...] "brings you out here at all? It is a shame to see fine big strapping fellows like you in a lazy loafing billet like policemen." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 19, Duty offered Wise some {{cigarettes}} {{in exchange for}} allowing himself to be tied up to make the guards think {{that he had been}} taken hostage, with the goal of having Duty transferred into administrative security. The prosecutor's report stated that after tying Wise's hands and feet behind his back, Duty strangled him to death with a shoelace. Duty then wrote a letter to Wise's mother Mary, in which he stated: [...] "Well {{by the time you get}} this letter you will already know that your son is dead. I know now because I just killed him an <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> Gee you'd think I'd be feeling some remorse but I'm not." [...] The letter was intercepted at the prison.|$|E
2500|$|During the interval, Spofforth made an {{announcement}} to his team-mates in the dressing-room: [...] "This thing can be done.!" [...] In spite of being reduced to fifteen for two early on, England {{made a good}} start in its pursuit of a victory target of 85. The score rose to 51 for two, with Grace and Ulyett hitting out strongly. Spofforth changed ends, and Neville Cardus wrote thus of this move: [...] "Now I was behind his arm; I could see his superb break-back. And he bowled mainly medium pace at this time. With each off-break I could see his right hand, {{at the end of}} the swing over, finish near the left side, 'cutting' under the ball. Sometimes his arm went straight over and continued straight down in the follow-through – and then the batsmen had to tackle fierce topspin. There was the sense of the inimical in his aspect now. He seemed taller than he was half an <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> the right arm more sinuous. There was no excitement in him he was ... cold-blooded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{where you}} make a mistake, my hearty. They most likely landed two or three <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> runnin' down the western shore, where they'd find {{sheltered}} water. Them men ain't fools if they are villains, an' by noon knowed the brig couldn't hold together much longer. The chances are she was bilged two <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> an' has gone to pieces by this time." ...|$|R

2500|$|In the end, Isac {{opted to}} throw his support behind the unionist movement. He {{attended}} the 9th Social Democratic Congress, and was elected a {{representative to the}} Alba Iulia assembly. There, on December 1, the Romanian socialist clubs, together with the Romanian National Party and the various other civic forces, demanded the union with Romania [...] (see Great Union Day). According to fellow socialist Tiron Albani, Isac first sparked disagreements within the unionist gathering, after endorsing proposals that the Romanian Kingdom become a republic in exchange for union. Isac's controversial address to his peers, as cited by Grapini, stresses: [...] "a quarter of an <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> you have approved of the resolution [...] Now you are revolted that a human idea is being expressed. Today, when three emperors have been ejected and their crowns hurled back at them! Would you be more consistent! [...] a king may well be good and wise, but he {{may also be a}} tyrant, and he'll still be king". In the end, the socialist delegation renounced its republican aims, placated by a resolution to ensure land reform and workers' rights throughout the resulting nation.|$|E
2500|$|When Mrs. Rodenhurst {{told me of}} {{the advent}} to Shrewsbury of Wainwright, I asked her {{if he was in}} his room, or where. 'No,' she said, 'he went out about an <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> I think you'll find him in the King's Arms.' I went to the King's Arms and made my very first {{appearance}} in the bar-parlour of a public-house. The room was empty save for one man, dressed in blue serge, with a shrewd lean face. I recognised him. I had seen him playing for Yorkshire at Old Trafford. I introduced myself. 'I'm the assistant pro.,' I explained. 'Art thou?' he replied, 'well, then 'ave a drink wi' me.' I told him I didn't drink — only ginger ale. 'Christ,' he said, 'tha'rt a reight bloody cricketer.' He was a tall man, who walked as though he didn't care a damn for anybody. There was something sinister about him. Every night he got drunk as a matter of course, quietly and masterfully. One day he backed a winner at a glorious price, and towards eleven o'clock that night he and the drill-sergeant of the school arrived arm-in-arm (supporting one another) in the sitting-room of our lodgings. Very gravely Ted introduced me to the drill-sergeant, whom of course I knew very well. The drill-sergeant as gravely introduced Ted to me, then taking my arm, he whispered rather noisily in my ear, 'I'm 'fraid 'e's a l'il drunk, so I've jus' bror him h-home.' Whereupon Ted dissolved into helpless laughter and said, 'My dear sersergeant, don't be 'diculous[...] [...] [...] Bror me home? Why, you ole fool, it's me that's bror you 'ome.' Then (aside), 'E's jus' a l'il drunk, so I've bror him home.' The sergeant hooted with glee. 'Bless m' soul,' he said, 'Ted; jus' lis'en t'me. If you'd bror me home, this would be my lodgin's, see? I would be 'ome, not you. See? But this is your lodgin's—so I mus' 'ave bror you 'ome. See?' ...|$|E

60|$|I had {{suspended}} my packing {{in order}} to sit on my bed and brood. I was utterly depressed. There are crises in a man's life when Reason fails to bring the slightest consolation. In vain I tried to tell myself that what had happened was, in essence, precisely what, twenty-four <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> I was so eager to bring about. It amounted to this, that now, at last, Audrey had definitely gone out of my life. From now on I could have no relations with her of any sort. Was not this exactly what, twenty-four <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> I had wished? Twenty-four <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> had I not said to myself that I would go away and never see her again? Undoubtedly. Nevertheless, I sat there and groaned in spirit.|$|R
