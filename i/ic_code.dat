The research campaign {{has been carried out}} following a theoretical-computational approach based on the finite element method (FEM) and adopting a qualified commercial FEM code. In particular, two different three-dimensional FEM models of the WCLL blanket module have been set-up to be used for normal operation and over-pressurization analysis, respectively. The former reproduces realistically the WCLL blanket module central poloidal–radial region, including one breeder cell in the toroidal direction and all the five cells in the radial one. The latter simulates the entire module segment box, without including the breeder and its cooling tubes. Two set of uncoupled steady state thermo-mechanical analyses have been carried out with reference to the investigated loading scenarios. In particular, under normal operation scenario (level A) the module has been supposed to undergo both 15. 5  MPa coolant pressure on its cooling channels walls and thermal deformations due to the flat-top plasma operational state thermal field, while under over-pressurization scenario (level D) it has been assumed to experience 15. 5  MPa coolant pressure on its segment box internal walls while operating at normal operation thermal level.

40|$|The {{scope of}} the Apps WG covers three areas of interest: Physics and Engineering Models (PEM), multi-physics Integrated Codes (IC), and Verification and Validation (V&V). Each places {{different}} demands on the exascale environment. The exascale challenge will be to provide environments that optimize all three. PEM serve as a test bed for both model development and 'best practices' for <b>IC</b> <b>code</b> development, {{as well as their}} use as standalone codes to improve scientific understanding. Rapidly achieving reasonable performance for a small team is the key to maintaining PEM innovation. Thus, the environment must provide the ability to develop portable code at a higher level of abstraction, which can then be tuned, as needed. PEM concentrate their computational footprint in one or a few kernels that must perform efficiently. Their comparative simplicity permits extreme optimization, so the environment must provide the ability to exercise significant control over the lower software and hardware levels. IC serve as the underlying software tools employed for most ASC problems of interest. Often coupling dozens of physics models into very large, very complex applications, ICs are usually the product of hundreds of staff-years of development, with lifetimes measured in decades. Thus, emphasis is placed on portability, maintainability and overall performance, with optimization done on the whole rather than on individual parts. The exascale environment must provide a high-level standardized programming model with effective tools and mechanisms for fault detection and remediation. Finally, V&V addresses the infrastructure and methods to facilitate the assessment of code and model suitability for applications, and uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for assessment and quantification of margins of uncertainty (QMU). V&V employs both PEM and IC, with somewhat differing goals, i. e., parameter studies and error assessments to determine both the quality of the calculation and to estimate expected deviations of simulations from experiments. The exascale environment must provide a performance envelope suitable both for capacity calculations (high through-put) and full system capability runs (high performance).

40|$|SmartMotor AS has an {{ambition}} {{of developing a}} new series of permanent magnet (PM) machines. The aim is to offer one range of machines for marine applications such as propulsion, anchor and winches, and a separate range for industrial applications. In this regard, {{there is a need to}} identify possibilities for improvement of the cooling system. A study of competitors&# 146; cooling solutions revealed that cooling methods of the International Cooling (<b>IC)</b> <b>code</b> IC 71 W, IC 81 W, IC 01 and IC 411 occurred most frequently in marine applications. The machine, of which the design of the new range will be based, is a newly build 1, 4 MW unit, commissioned by W&# 228;rtsil&# 228;. This machine was tested to verify the performance characteristics of both machine and cooling system, which consists of combined air- and water-cooling. A surrounding water jacket primarily cools the stator and housing, representing 88 % of the total losses. The remaining 12 % loss from rotor, magnets and support is air-cooled by external fans. Losses were estimated to be 44, 1 kW and tests verified these estimations by recording actual losses of 43, 3 kW. The potential of replacing the external fans with a shaft-driven centrifugal fan was mapped out for five machines, representing the range project. A model of each machine was developed using COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 3 b. These models were used to obtain a system resistance curve, which was compared to the performance of centrifugal fans in the market. A single shaft-driven fan proved to be an impossible solution. Long active parts of 900 - 1200 mm required higher static pressure than the shaft speeds of 100 - 600 rpm could supply. Calculations and simulations stated an average deviation from required to obtainable pressure of 800 % for the five machines. Two parallel shaft-driven fans proved to be a theoretical option for machines with speed of 400 - 600 rpm. Theoretical heat transfer to the cooling air was calculated for comparative purposes. This indicated overcooling of close to 200 % for the simplified design of the W&# 228;rtsil&# 228; machine and between 20 - 120 % overcooling for the estimated design of the range project. The magnets, which can handle temperatures of 80 &# 8451;, were registered with an average temperature of 43, 2 &# 8451; for a test with 75 % load at full speed.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a methodology that enables the generation of valid and reliable inferences on what and how intellectual capital (IC) information is communicated by sell-side analysts in their research reports. Design/methodology/approach: The method described in this paper involves content-analysing initiating coverage analyst reports using a four-dimensional <b>IC</b> <b>coding</b> framework and a detailed coding instrument, which is founded in the literature and indigenous to analyst reports. The paper explicates methodological decisions associated with content analysis: selecting the appropriate sampling unit; recording unit and measurement unit; developing the categorisation scheme and coding instrument; the need for test coding; the approach to data collection; and assessment of reliability and validity. Findings: The methodology described is applied to a sample of analyst reports to illustrate inferences that can be drawn on what and how IC information is communicated in analyst reports. Practical implications: Various practical issues arising in the application of content analysis method are discussed and a methodology for investigating IC communications by sell-side analysts is described in this paper. This knowledge can be useful to future researchers conducting content-analytic studies involving analyst reports in general, and IC communications in analyst reports in particular. Originality/value: This paper extends the methodology developed previously to examine IC information in analyst reports. Although inspired and heavily influenced by these works, the methodology presented in this paper differs from theirs on several fronts. The paper introduces an alternative methodological paradigm to the study of analyst reports by emphasising them as a communication medium through which sell-side analysts may pursue an agenda of their own.

We present simulations that are based on a version of the gadget 3 code where our sub-resolution model is coupled with an advanced implementation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics that ensures a more accurate fluid sampling and an improved description of gas mixing and hydrodynamical instabilities. We quantify the strong interplay between the adopted hydrodynamic scheme and the sub-resolution model describing SF and feedback. We consider four different galactic outflow models, including the one introduced by Dalla Vecchia Schaye (2012) and a scheme that is inspired by the Springel Hernquist (2003) model. We find that the sub-resolution prescriptions adopted to generate galactic outflows are the main shaping factor of the stellar disc component at low redshift. The key requirement that a feedback model must have to be successful in producing a disc-dominated galaxy is the ability to regulate the high-redshift SF (responsible for the formation of the bulge component), the cosmological infall of gas from the large-scale environment, and gas fall-back within the galactic radius at low redshift, in order to avoid a too high SF rate at z = 0...|$|R
