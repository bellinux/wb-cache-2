In this work we introduced the <b>E</b> <b>442</b> A mutation, which abrogates a salt-bridge between switch I and switch II, and the G 440 A mutation, which abolishes a main-chain hydrogen bond associated with the interaction of switch II with the γ phosphate of ATP, into myosin V. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer between mant-labeled nucleotides or IAEDANS-labeled actin and FlAsH-labeled myosin V to examine the conformation of the nucleotide- and actin-binding regions, respectively. We demonstrate that {{in the absence of}} actin, both the G 440 A and <b>E</b> <b>442</b> A mutants bind ATP with similar affinity and result in only minor alterations in the conformation of the nucleotide-binding pocket (NBP). In the presence of ADP and actin, both switch II mutants disrupt the formation of a closed NBP actomyosin. ADP state. The G 440 A mutant also prevents ATP-induced opening of the actin-binding cleft.

The defining feature of the AAA proteins is a structurally conserved AAA domain which assembles into an oligomer. By chemical cross linking and gel filtration chromatography, we show that spastin oligomerizes into a hexamer. Furthermore, to gain a comprehensive overview of the oligomeric structure of spastin, we generated a structural model of the AAA domain of spastin using template structure of VPS 4 B and p 97 /VCP. The generated model of spastin provided us with a framework to classify the identified missense mutations in the AAA domain from hereditary spastic paraplegia patients into different structural/functional groups. Finally, through co-localization studies in mammalian cells, we show that <b>E</b> <b>442</b> Q mutant spastin acts in a dominant negative fashion and causes redistribution of both wild-type spastin monomer and spastin interacting protein, RTN 1 into filamentous microtubule bundles...|$|E

Inactivating or activating mutations of glucokinase lead to different forms of glucokinase disease, i. e. GCK-monogenic diabetes of youth, permanent neonatal diabetes(inactivating mutations), and congenital hyperinsulinism, respectively. Here we present a novel glucokinase gene (GCK) -activating mutation (p. <b>E</b> <b>442</b> K) found in an infant with neonatal hypoglycemia (1. 5 mmol/liter) and in two other family members suffering from recurrent hypoglycemic episodes in their childhood and adult life.

We also report on functional studies of two inactivating mutations of the GCK (p. E 440 G and p. S 441 W), contiguous to the activating one, that lead to monogenic diabetes of youth. Interestingly, adult family members carrying the GCK pE 440 G mutation show an unusually heterogeneous and progressive diabetic phenotype, a feature not typical of GCK-monogenic diabetes of youth.

40|$|Ribavirin (RBV), used in {{combination}} with alpha interferon to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, is a guanosine nucleotide analog that can increase the error rate of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, imbalance intracellular nucleotide pools, and cause toxicity in many cell types. To determine potential mechanisms of RBV resistance during HCV RNA replication, we passaged HCV replicon-containing cell lines {{in the presence of}} increasing concentrations of RBV. RBV-resistant, HCV replicon-containing cell lines were generated, and the majority of RBV resistance was found to be conferred by changes in the cell lines. The resistant cell lines were defective in RBV import, as measured by [3 H]RBV uptake experiments. These cell lines displayed reduced RBV toxicity and reduced error accumulation during infection with poliovirus, whose replication is known to be sensitive to RBV-induced error. For one RBV-resistant isolate, two mutations in the replicon RNA contributed to the observed phenotype. Two responsible mutations resided in the C-terminal region of NS 5 A, G 404 S, and <b>E</b> <b>442</b> G and were each sufficient for low-level RBV resistance. Therefore, RBV resistance in HCV replicon cell lines can be conferred by changes in the cell line or by mutations in the HCV replicon.

40|$|BACKGROUND: After {{the initial}} {{discovery}} of 1 -(2 -hydroxyethoxymethyl) - 6 -(phenylthio) thymine (HEPT) and tetrahydroimidazo[4, 5, 1 -jk][1, 4]benzodiazepin- 2 (1 H) -one and thione (TIBO) derivatives, several other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTI), including nevirapine (BI-RG- 587), pyridinone derivatives (L- 696, 229 and L- 697, 661), delavirdine (U- 90152), alpha-anilinophenylacetamides (alpha-APA) {{and various other}} classes of NNRTI have been described. The hallmark of NNRTI {{has been based on}} their ability to interact with a specific site ('pocket') of HIV- 1 RT. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether, in addition to HIV- 1, different strains of HIV- 2 (ROD and EHO) and SIV (mac 251, agm 3 and mndGB 1) are sensitive to a selection of NNRTI i. e. delavirdine, the HEPT derivative I-EBU (MKC- 442), 8 -chloro-TIBO (tivirapine), alpha-APA (loviride), nevirapine and the pyridinone derivative L- 697, 661. METHODS AND RESULTS: The NNRTI tested inhibited the replication of the different strains of HIV- 2 and SIV at micromolar concentrations. The inhibitory effects of the NNRTI on HIV- 2 -induced cytopathicity correlated well with their inhibitory effects on HIV- 2 RT activity. Drug-resistant HIV- 2 (EHO) variants containing the Ser 102 Leu and/or Glu 219 Asp mutations in their RT were selected after passaging the virus in MT- 4 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of delavirdine. The EHO virus mutants were at least 20 -fold less susceptible to the antiviral effects of delavirdine. Some cross-resistance, depending on the mutant strain, was observed with the other NNRTI tested (i. <b>e.</b> MKC- <b>442,</b> tivirapine, loviride and pyridinone L- 697, 661). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that NNRTI are not exclusively specific for HIV- 1 but are also inhibitory to different HIV- 2 and SIV strains. These observations will have important implications for the development of new NNRTI with higher activity against both HIV- 1 and HIV- 2. Furthermore, in view of their anti-SIV activity, NNRTI could be evaluated further for their in vivo anti-retrovirus efficacy in non-human primate models. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The reiterated {{nature of}} histone genes has {{hampered}} genetic approach to dissect {{the role of}} histones in chromatin dynamics. We here report isolation of three temperature-sensitive (ts) Schizosaccharomyces pombe strains, containing amino-acid substitutions in the sole histone H 2 B gene (htb 1 +). The mutation sites reside in the highly conserved, non-helical residues of H 2 B, which are implicated in DNA–protein or protein–protein interactions in the nucleosome. In the allele of htb 1 - 72, the substitution (G 52 D) occurs at the DNA binding loop L 1, causing disruption of the gene silencing in heterochromatic regions and lagging chromosomes in anaphase. In another allele htb 1 - 223 (P 102 L) locating in the junction between α 3 and αC, the mutant residue is in contact with H 2 A and other histones, leading to structural aberrations in the central centromere chromatin and unequal chromosome segregation in anaphase.

40|$|Alginate {{production}} in mucoid (MucA-defective) Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{is dependent upon}} several transcriptional regulators, including AlgB, a two-component response regulator belonging to the NtrC family. This role of AlgB was apparently independent of its sensor kinase, KinB, and even the N-terminal phosphorylation domain of AlgB was dispensable for alginate biosynthetic gene (i. e., algD operon) activation. However, it remained unclear whether AlgB stimulated algD transcription directly or indirectly. In this study, microarray analyses were used to examine a set of potential AlgB-dependent, KinB-independent genes in a PAO 1 mucA background that overlapped with genes induced by d-cycloserine, which is known to activate algD expression. This set contained only the algD operon plus one other gene that was shown to be uninvolved in alginate production. This suggested that AlgB promotes alginate production by directly binding to the algD promoter (PalgD). Chromosome immunoprecipitation revealed that AlgB bound in vivo to PalgD but did not bind when AlgB had an R <b>442</b> <b>E</b> substitution that disrupted the DNA binding domain. AlgB also showed binding to PalgD fragments in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay at pH 4. 5 but not at pH 8. 0.
