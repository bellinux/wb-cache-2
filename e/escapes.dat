50|$|<b>Escape</b> {{characters}} {{are part of}} the syntax for many programming languages, data formats, and communication protocols. For a given alphabet an <b>escape</b> character's purpose is to start character sequences (so named <b>escape</b> sequences), which have to be interpreted differently from the same characters occurring without the prefixed <b>escape</b> character. An <b>escape</b> character may not have its own meaning, so all <b>escape</b> sequences are of two or more characters.|$|R

5000|$|Among other things, {{it must be}} {{possible}} to encode the character that normally terminates the string constant, plus {{there must be some}} way to specify the <b>escape</b> character itself. <b>Escape</b> sequences are not always pretty or easy to use, so many compilers also offer other means of solving the common problems. <b>Escape</b> sequences, however, solve every delimiter problem and most compilers interpret <b>escape</b> sequences. When an <b>escape</b> character is inside a string literal, it means [...] "this is the start of the <b>escape</b> sequence". Every <b>escape</b> sequence specifies one character which is to be placed directly into the string. The actual number of characters required in an <b>escape</b> sequence varies. The <b>escape</b> character is on the top/left of the keyboard, but the editor will translate it, therefore it is not directly tapeable into a string. The backslash is used to represent the <b>escape</b> character in a string literal.|$|R
40|$|We adapted a multi-species <b>escape</b> model, {{developed}} for close-in extrasolar planets, {{to calculate the}} <b>escape</b> rates of CH 4 and N 2 from Pluto. In the absence of <b>escape,</b> CH 4 should overtake N 2 as the dominant species below the exobase. The CH 4 profile depends strongly on the <b>escape</b> rate, however, and the typical <b>escape</b> rates predicted for Pluto lead to a nearly constant mixing ratio of less than 1 % below the exobase. In this case the CH 4 <b>escape</b> rate is only 5 - 10 % of the N 2 <b>escape</b> rate. Observations of the CH 4 profile by the New Horizons/ALICE spectrograph can constrain the CH 4 <b>escape</b> rate and provide a unique test for <b>escape</b> models.

50|$|Once Enter has {{integrated}} Messiah Card 07 into himself, {{he is able}} {{to create}} Organic Metaroids, and uses that ability to recreate <b>Escape</b> and assimilated organic life into her data composition. As a result, making her a loyal servant, the recreated <b>Escape</b> can transform into the hybridized <b>Escape</b> Evolve (Organic Unite Form) (46-48). But the first three versions of <b>Escape,</b> each able to become <b>Escape</b> Evolve (Flower Unite Form) (Esukeipu Eborubu (Hana Yūgōtai)), are only incomplete copies of the original with limited intelligence and comprehension as they are created from back-up data of <b>Escape</b> predating her time of creation. However, due to the love data from Tiaraloid, Enter became obsessed with recreating a perfect copy of <b>Escape.</b> This resulted in the creation of an <b>Escape</b> from a snake who is extremely mentally unstable due to her composition being corrupted beyond Enter's ability to repair. Left to her devices, wanting to be like her creator, <b>Escape</b> assimilated various animals to assume her <b>Escape</b> Evolve (Animal Unite Form) (Esukeipu Eborubu (Kemono Yūgōtai)). Fighting the Go-Busters, <b>Escape</b> assimilates the surrounding matter to become <b>Escape</b> Zeta (48) before being fatally wounded in her Megazord body.

40|$|Punishment and <b>escape</b> {{were studied}} {{simultaneously}} by allowing a subject to <b>escape</b> from a stimulus {{situation in which}} responses were punished, into a stimulus situation in which responses were not punished. The frequency of the punished responses {{was found to be}} an inverse function of the intensity of punishment, whereas the frequency of the <b>escape</b> response was a direct function of the intensity of punishment. Both of these functions were obtained under three different schedules of food reinforcement. The strength of the <b>escape</b> behavior was evidenced by (1) the emergence of the <b>escape</b> response even when the frequency of food reinforcement decreased {{as a consequence of the}} <b>escape</b> response, (2) the maintenance of the <b>escape</b> response by fixed-interval and fixed-ratio schedules of <b>escape</b> reinforcement, and (3) the occurrence of <b>escape</b> responses at intensities of punishment that otherwise produced only mild suppression of the punished response when no <b>escape</b> was possible. This last finding indicates that a subject may be driven out of a situation involving punishment even though the punishment is relatively ineffective in suppressing the punished responses when no <b>escape</b> is possible...|$|R
40|$|Atmosphere <b>escape</b> is one {{key process}} {{controlling}} {{the evolution of}} planets. However, estimating the <b>escape</b> rate in any detail is difficult {{because there are many}} physical processes contributing to the total <b>escape</b> rate. Here we show {{that as a result of}} energy conservation the total <b>escape</b> rate from hydrodynamic planetary atmospheres where the outflow remains subsonic is nearly constant under the same stellar XUV photon flux when increasing the <b>escape</b> efficiency from the exobase level, consistent with the energy limited <b>escape</b> approximation. Thus the estimate of atmospheric <b>escape</b> in a planet's evolution history can be greatly simplified...|$|R

Orison then finds Pfaster and takes him at gunpoint. In the woods, Orison digs a grave for Pfaster, who morphs into a demonic beast and kills him, burying him in his own shallow grave. Pfaster then calls the police, telling them where Orison is buried, and goes to Scully's house. He attacks Scully, who tells him {{that the only reason}} he was not given the death penalty was because she asked the judge for life. He overpowers her and locks her in her own closet. Mulder thinks something may be wrong when he hears the same song on his radio and calls Scully. After receiving no answer, he goes over to her house and stumbles upon Pfaster, promptly arresting him. Meanwhile, Scully <b>escapes</b> from the closet and shoots Pfaster, despite him being unarmed, killing him. Scully later confides in Mulder, telling him she's scared because she's not sure who's in control of her, God or something else.|$|E

40|$|Intrahost simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) evolution {{is marked by}} repeated viral <b>escape</b> from cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTLs) response. Typically, the first such CTL <b>escape</b> occurs {{in a matter of}} days, starting around the time of peak viral load. Many authors have developed methods to quantify the strength of CTL response by measuring the rate at which CTL <b>escape</b> occurs, but such methods usually depend on sampling at two or more timepoints, while many datasets capture the dynamics of the first CTL <b>escape</b> at only a single timepoint. Here, we develop inference meth-ods for CTL <b>escape</b> rates applicable to single timepoint datasets. Through a model of early infection dynamics, we construct confidence intervals for <b>escape</b> rates, but since early infection dynamics are not completely under-stood, we also develop a one-sided confidence interval serving as a lower bound for <b>escape</b> rates over a collection of early infection models. We apply our methods to two SIV datasets, using our lower bounds and ex-isting methods to show that <b>escape</b> rates are relatively high during the initial days of the first CTL <b>escape</b> and then drop to lower levels as the <b>escape</b> proceeds. We also compare <b>escape</b> in the lymph nodes and the rectal mucosa, showing that <b>escape</b> in the lymph nodes is initially faster, but as the first <b>escape</b> proceeds, the rate of <b>escape</b> in the lymph nodes drops below the rate seen in the rectal mucosa. ...|$|R
5|$|Although {{the exact}} number of French prisoners who escaped from captivity in Germany is unknown, it has been {{estimated}} at around 70,000, representing approximately five per cent of all French prisoners. The Vichy government did not encourage prisoners to escape, but many of its officials were sympathetic to escapees who reached French territory. Some prisoners, particularly those working in agriculture, spent substantial amounts of time without guards, and prisoners caught by the Germans trying to escape were rarely severely punished. During the period of detention in France, fines were sometimes imposed on locals for mass <b>escapes</b> of prisoners in the region. It was partially to prevent <b>escapes</b> that led to the German decision to deport prisoners to the Reich.|$|E
