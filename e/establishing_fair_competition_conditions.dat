5000|$|Social {{market economies}} aim to combine free {{initiative}} {{and social welfare}} {{on the basis of}} a competitive economy. The social market economy is opposed to laissez-faire policies and to socialist economic systems and combines private enterprise with regulation and state intervention to <b>establish</b> <b>fair</b> <b>competition,</b> maintaining a balance between a high rate of economic growth, low inflation, low levels of unemployment, good working conditions, social welfare, and public services. The term [...] "social" [...] was established by Adenauer to prevent further reference to [...] "christian Socialism", which was used in the early party agenda [...] "Ahlener Programm" [...] in 1947.|$|R
50|$|While the ordoliberal idea of {{a social}} market {{is similar to that}} of the third-way social {{democracy}} advocated by the likes of the New Labour government (especially during the Premiership of Tony Blair), there are a few key differences. Whilst they both adhere to the idea of providing a moderate stance between socialism and capitalism, the Ordoliberal social market model often combines private enterprise with government regulation to <b>establish</b> <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> (although German network industries are known to have been deregulated), whereas advocates of the third-way social democracy model have been known to oversee multiple economic deregulations. The third way social democracy model has also foreseen a clash of ideas regarding the welfare state's establishment, in comparison to the ordoliberal's {{idea of a}} social market model being open to the benefits of social welfare.|$|R
30|$|At present, {{insufficient}} {{policy implementation}} ability and the mandatory planned electricity price prevent effective investment and financing from pouring into China’s renewables. In {{view of the}} lack of policy implementation ability, the Chinese government should <b>establish</b> <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> examination rules, improve the authority of the anti-monopoly law enforcement agencies, and unify the administration, the legislation, the judicature as well as public education [61]. With respect to the mandatory planned electricity pricing, China should continue to promote the reformation of the electric power system, not only by liberating the electricity retail markets and constructing provincial power spot markets, but also by forming energy market pricing combined with some secondary markets, such as the Tradable Green Certificates market and the carbon trading market [62, 63]. If these two problems are properly solved, China’s private capital will have the chance to choose the suitable PPP mode.|$|R

It is sometimes classified as a coordinated market economy. The social market economy was originally promoted and implemented in West Germany by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in 1949.

40|$|Transport {{policy is}} at the cross-roads. Whilst the {{fundamental}} importance of adequate transport facilities to modern societies and economies is generally recognised, concern about increasing congestion, environmental consequences and accidents is mounting. This insight {{has led to a}} review of transport policies in many Member States. Calls for debate at the European level are intensifying and the Cannes Summit has asked that measures should be taken to review policies to <b>establish</b> <b>fairer</b> <b>competition</b> between modes of transport. As part of a comprehensive transport strategy, this Green Paper explores ways of making transport pricing systems fairer and more efficient by giving users and manufacturers incentives to adjust their transport behaviour. Various possible instruments are identified and discussed. The Green Paper argues that fair and efficient pricing should constitute an essential component of a transport policy strategy and can contribute significantly to reducing some of the main transport problems (notably congestion, accidents and environmental problems). Its objective is to launch a broad discussion on this issue. It is proposed that the Commission:-• approves the attached Green Paper; • agrees to its communication to the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers, the Economic and Social Committee and to the Committee of the Regions; • agrees to its publication as a supplement to the EU bulletin...|$|R
40|$|We analyze Italy's recent {{research}} evaluation exercise (VTR) as a salient example in discussing some internationally relevant issues {{emerging from the}} evaluation of research in economics. We claim that evaluation and its criteria, together with its linkage to research institutions' financing, are likely to affect the direction of research in a problematic way. As the Italian case documents, it is specifically economists who adopt unorthodox paradigms or pursue less diffused topics of research that {{should be concerned about}} research evaluation and its criteria. After outlining the recent practice of economic research in Italy and highlighting the relevant scope for pluralism that traditionally characterizes it, we analyze the publications submitted for evaluation to the VTR. By comparing these publications to all the entries in the EconLit database authored by economists located in Italy, we find a risk that the adopted ranking criteria may lead to disregarding historical methods in favor of quantitative and econometric methods, and heterodox schools in favor of mainstream approaches. Finally, by summarizing the current debate in Italy, we claim that evaluation should not be refused by heterodox economists, but rather that a reflection on the criteria of evaluation should be put forward at an international level in order to <b>establish</b> <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> among research paradigms, thus, preserving pluralism in the discipline. © 2010 American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Inc...|$|R
40|$|This article {{looks at}} flaws in theLaw of China on Promotion of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises 2002 (the Chinese Law on Promotion of SMEs 2002) and the Anti-Monopoly Law of China 2007 (the Chinese Anti-Monopoly Law 2007), {{as well as}} {{examining}} the inconsistencies between the State's industrial policy and the current legal framework for Chinese privately owned SMEs. Although legal protection for SMEs {{is not a new}} research area in China, little scholarship has been devoted to conflicts between "law" and 'policy" from a relationship standpoint between State-owned enterprises (SOEs) and privately owned SMEs. It argues that these SMEs are less able than SOEs to obtain chances for robust growth due to their privileges and immunities. By ignoring the market function, but emphasizing the economic role of the State, and by offering no genuine sanctions for senseless intervention from the State's industrial policy, the Chinese Law on Promotion of SMEs 2002 and the Chinese Anti-Monopoly Law 2007 fail to <b>establish</b> <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> circumstances for privately owned SMEs. Why cannot these two laws overcome the State's industrial policy? Different approaches to achieving dissimilar goals in the Chinese market would be the answer. Thus, this article demonstrates that administrative powers granted by the State's industrial policy are the biggest obstacle for privately owned SMEs, and then recommends methods to resolve this dilemma {{from the perspective of the}} Chinese Anti-Monopoly Law 2007...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEnvironmental {{disclosure}} and Environmental performance evaluation are {{the fundamentals of}} <b>establishing</b> a <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> among listed companies in environmental management. This study collects, classifies and evaluates the disclosed information of listed steel companies and also analyzes {{the level of their}} environmental disclosure. In the meantime, this study used the methods and criterions of international environmental performance evaluation to evaluate the real level of environmental performance in listed steel companies. The result shows, there are significant differences in the form of Environmental disclosure, and as well as great difference in disclosed contents and degrees. The disclosed environmental information can not reflect the real environmental performance level of the listed steel companies, and some companies with low level of environment performance are likely to disclose more environment information. In order to obtain the environmental management level of listed companies more accurately, we urgently need a regulation in environmental disclosure to be established...|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{economic growth}} since 1960 's helped {{the standard of}} living improved and absolute poverty decreased, but insufficient social welfare system could not meet the people's needs for a life worthy of man and unequal income distribution exposed new social conflicts. The most representative conflict caused by the unequal income distribution might be the inequality of education, that is, educational gap. This article focused on the education gap by the income and region. The polarization of income and fixation of social strata has been explicitly noticed through the reorganization of economic structure since the economical crisis in 1997. The expansion of the poor and enlarged educational gap caused by economical inequality would disturb the social integration and finally weaken the national competitiveness. To solve this condition, in the short term, the plan to more efficiently execute the budget should be established by understanding the problems of the projects that have been performed. In the long term, the educational base should be <b>established</b> that the <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> in the more diversified fields can be realized through the education paradigm shift...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new class of {{aggregation}} operator based on utility function and apply them to group decision-making problem. First of all, based on an optimal deviation model, a new operator called the interval generalized ordered weighted utility multiple averaging (IGOWUMA) operator is proposed, it incorporates the risk attitude of decision-makers (DMs) in the aggregation process. Some desirable properties of the IGOWUMA operator are studied afterward. Subsequently, under the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility function, another new operator named as interval generalized ordered weighted hyperbolic absolute risk aversion utility multiple averaging-HARA (IGOWUMA-HARA) operator is also defined. Then, we discuss its families and find that it includes a wide range of aggregation operators. To determine the weights of the IGOWUMA-HARA operator, a preemptive nonlinear objective programming model is constructed, which can determine a uniform weighting vector to guarantee the uniform standard comparison between the alternatives and measure their <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> under the <b>condition</b> of valid comparison between various alternatives. Moreover, a new approach for group decision-making is developed based on the IGOWUMA-HARA operator. Finally, a comparison analysis is carried out to illustrate the superiority of the proposed method and the result implies that our operator is superior to the existing operator...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is to analyse {{regulation}} of electronic communication market {{with regard to}} competition law aspects. Electronic communication sector of nowadays globalized world is developing rapidly and represents a precondition for the economic growth. Due to {{the characteristics of a}} network industry and the fact that this sector was regulated historically by monopoly firms owned by the state, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to identify which difficulties this market has to face through the dualistic regulation. To secure a <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> with equal <b>conditions</b> for competitors operating electronic communication networks or providing electronic communication services is not an easy task, nevertheless it's essential for the welfare of the consumers. My thesis is composed of six main chapters. In the first one, I provide the definitions of the main terms which are related to this topic. Moreover, I focus on the characteristics of the electronic communication sector and integrate the topic into the historical context. In particular, I describe the beginning of the liberalisation of this sector and provide an outline of the harmonisation process which is represented by the legal provisions adopted by the European Union. Second and the most extensive chapter is dedicated to ex ante regulation which [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented here}} investigates State {{intervention in the}} marketplace in China, by way of certain laws and industrial policies, to assess how various aspects of these interventions have impacted {{on the development of}} privately-owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in certain traditional State-controlled industries, namely the steel, gas station, and fixed-broadband sectors. This thesis demonstrates weaknesses in the legal framework of Chinese laws designed to promote competition and advance the interests of SMEs, and identifies reasons why this framework has failed, as well as providing recommendations for improvement. During China’s economic transition era, the State-market relationship has been tightly controlled by the Central Government. The Economic Charter, namely the Anti-Monopoly Law of China 2007, did not come into force until 2008. However, although dynamic enforcement of this Law commenced in 2014, it has so far failed to alter the parameters of the State-market relationship: industrial policy retains its traditional prominence and dominance in State intervention, and continues to protect the anti-competitive exercise of specific or exclusive rights by administrative agencies and State-owned enterprises (SOEs). Therefore, privately-owned SMEs often experience confrontations with SOEs. This tendency not only prejudices <b>fair</b> <b>competition,</b> but also harms the uneven-balance between different types of interest groups in the Chinese marketplace. Privately-owned SMEs and consumers suffer discrimination from the anti-competitive application of State industrial policies and the administrative actions of implementation agencies. Accordingly, the “public interest”, the reconciliation between the State’s interest, the interests of enterprises, and consumer welfare, has not been advanced under the 2007 Act. Hence, this thesis proposes key reforms which are necessary in order to establish, and bring about the operation of an effective legal framework for the promotion of the interests of Chinese privately-owned SMEs, in order to ensure their sound growth, and in order to bring about the realisation of the “public interest”: First, this work recommends measures designed to improve the enforcement of the Anti-Monopoly Law of China 2007, by proposing to restrain inappropriate administrative intervention, in order to restrict the State’s industrial policies and the abuse of administrative rights from adversely impacting on SME-generated growth and competition. Second, the work suggests increasing the alignment between the Anti-Monopoly Law of China 2007 and other elements, such as administrative discretion and corporate social responsibility, in order to <b>establish</b> a <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> environment for privately-owned SMEs in traditional State-controlled industries...|$|R
