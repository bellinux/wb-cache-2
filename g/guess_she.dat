Guess founder Paul Marciano said, [...] "Alyssa is the most European-looking American girl I've ever seen!" [...] When she had her breakthrough with <b>Guess,</b> <b>she</b> drew comparisons to Sophia Loren and Brooke Shields and was regarded as something of a throwback.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{said that}} Donen's {{impulsive}} marriage to Coyne showed an emotional immaturity {{and lack of}} good judgment, and stated that [...] "Jeannie's marriage to Stanley was doomed from the start. Because every time Stanley looked at Jeannie, he saw Betsy, whom he loved; and every time Jeannie looked at Stanley, I <b>guess</b> <b>she</b> saw me. One way or another it was all pretty incestuous." [...] Kelly's marriage to Blair ended in 1957, after which he moved in with Coyne. They married in 1960 and had two children together. Coyne died of leukemia in 1973. In November 2012 the musical What A Glorious Feeling depicted both the making of Singin' in the Rain and the love triangle between Donen, Kelly and Coyne.|$|E

500|$|Freya Jarman-Ivens, one of {{the authors}} of Madonna's Drowned Worlds, felt that the song was {{one of the}} last works on pure romanticism by Madonna. [...] "She should come back to the formula from time to time, but I <b>guess</b> <b>she</b> has moved beyond all of that", Jarman-Ivens added. Carol Clerk, author of Madonnastyle noted that the [...] "refreshing" [...] nature of the song was {{particularly}} noticeable if one follows Madonna's catalog chronologically, especially embedded between the anthem like nature of the previous release, [...] "Express Yourself", and the lament of the succeeding release, [...] "Oh Father". Scholar Maria Raha wrote in her book Cinderella's Big Score: Women of the Punk and Indie Underground that the song was full of [...] "trite" [...] lyrics. Andy Goldberg from The Jerusalem Post said that [...] "Cherish" [...] took [...] "Madonna back to her old stomping grounds, the lively bass line and lilting melodies of hit albums past." [...] Kevin Phinney from Austin American-Statesman was surprised by Madonna's contribution to the song and confessed that he [...] " [...] it difficult to be believe that she even wrote this?" [...] Phinney continued that he wanted Madonna to go in a more mature direction and compose songs musically similar to [...] "Cherish". Writing for The Washington Post, Richard Harrington explained that [...] "while songs on Like a Prayer dealt with matters opening her heart, with 'Cherish' Madonna dealt with matters which were close to her heart." [...] This view was also shared by Ian Blair from Chicago Tribune who categorized the song as being sung for the [...] "happy-go-lucky lovers and dreamers". The Dallas Morning News Lennox Samuels appreciated the light-hearted theme of the song and complimented Madonna and Leonard for not sticking with personal subject matters only on the album. Dale Anderson from The Buffalo News opined that the song would become one of Madonna's most forgettable releases, but was also hopeful that it would not. This opinion was shared by Don McCleese of Chicago Sun-Times, who added that [...] "Cherish" [...] was not something expected from Madonna at that point of time. McCleese was disappointed that Madonna went back to the [...] "happy-go-lucky, lovey-dovey" [...] kind of songs, which did not match her self-image. Dan DeLuca from The Philadelphia Inquirer, while reviewing Madonna's Drowned World Tour in 2001, compared [...] "Cherish" [...] with songs by Chris Robinson, humorously adding that [...] "only if he was gay he would sing something like that." ...|$|E

In his written account of the night that followed, Bittaker wrote that Lucinda Schaefer [...] "displayed a magnificent state of self-control and composed acceptance of the conditions of which she had no control. She shed no tears, offered no resistance and expressed no great concern for her safety... I <b>guess</b> <b>she</b> knew what was coming." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ani cites her anti-corporate ethos for {{the main}} reason she decided to start her own label. This has allowed her a {{considerable}} degree of creative freedom over the years, including, for example, providing all instrumentals and vocals and recording the album herself at her home on an analog 8-track reel to reel, and handling much of the artwork and packaging design for her 2004 album Educated <b>Guess.</b> <b>She</b> has referenced this independence from major labels in song more than once, including [...] "The Million You Never Made" [...] (Not a Pretty Girl), which discusses the act of turning down a lucrative contract, [...] "The Next Big Thing" [...] (Not So Soft), which describes an imagined meeting with a label head-hunter who evaluates the singer based on her looks, and [...] "Napoleon" [...] (Dilate), which sympathizes sarcastically with an unnamed friend who did sign with a label.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2003, {{nearly two}} years after the release of Bakit 'Di Totohanin, Santos {{appeared}} opposite Pascual in Till There Was You as Joanna Boborol, an unemployed struggling actress who lands a contractual job feigning as the mother of a novice defense lawyer's (played by Pascual) daughter. The film was predominately a critical and commercial success, earning more than Php110million domestically. Tatiana May of Rotten Tomatoes noted that [...] "Santos is excellent in the portrayal of her role—and in showing the rigors of working hard to earn [...] with witty dialogue, she is off to give better performances but I <b>guess</b> <b>she</b> could always look back at herself here and give it a warm smile." [...] Santos next took the supporting role of the shrewd arbiter Grace Tan, centered around the crisis—stricken Chinese clan, in the ensemble film [...] While Susan Roces, Zsa Zsa Padilla and Lorna Tolentino played the main characters, the film instead marked Santos' breakthrough performance. She won the Entertainment Press Society's Golden Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress. Mario Bautista of Malaya Business Insight News was moved by [...] " [...] quiet but stirring performance [...] very realistic [...] does not only uplift our spirits but awakens our conscience." ...|$|E
