40|$|This study investigates {{rapid changes}} in contact resistance, termed <b>intermittences</b> or short {{duration}} discontinuities, on tin-plated electrical contacts that are undergoing fretting tests. Voltage and current levels {{are comparable to}} the levels found in automotive systems. The thesis begins with {{an overview of the}} theory of mechanical and electrical contact, factors that determine the performance of an electrical contact and previous work on <b>intermittences.</b> Building upon this background information a low frequency fretting apparatus and a high¬speed data acquisition system are developed, capable of monitoring the voltage-drop across and current through the contact with a sample rate of up to 1 gigasamples per second. During the fretting experiments the build-up of debris is observed. As expected in this type of experiment the contact resistance rises with increasing number of fretting cycles. An increase in current accelerates the contact degradation. The contact surface is analysed using SEM and SEM/EDX. Several features are found in the recorded signals. These include plateaus, slopes of several tens of kilovolts per second, voltage-drops across the contact interface of above the melting voltage of tin and <b>intermittences</b> that can occur, when no forced relative motion between the contact partners is present. The observations are combined to a set of requirements of a model to explain intermittency phenomena. Previously proposed models are evaluated {{on the basis of these}} findings. Finally the asperity model is extended to incorporate the results of the experiments. It is proposed that melting of asperiti. es causes short-duration discontinuities and events that occur when no forced relative motion is present. Both could not be explained within the asperity model before. The thesis concludes with a definition of the term 'intermittence' as the temporary disruption of metallic conduction in a closed electrical contact. This definition is an improvement over the previous definition, because it allows setting a specific resistance threshold to detect <b>intermittences</b> in fretting experiments. Future work is suggested...|$|R

Wasted and burning, white furnaces of blasting sand, their broad beds lie ghastly and bare; but here in the moss lands, the soft wings of the sea angel droop still with dew, and the shadows of their plumes falter on the hills; strange laughings and glitterings of silver streamlets, born suddenly, and twined about the mossy heights in trickling tinsel, answering to them as they wave.|$|E
60|$|The great {{organized}} industries, mining, cotton, iron, {{building and}} the like, would differ chiefly in the permanence of employment and the systematic evasion of the social hardship caused now-a-days by new inventions and economies in method. There will exist throughout the world an organized economic survey, which will continually prepare and revise estimates of the need of iron, coal, cloth and so forth in the coming months; the blind speculative production of our own times is due merely to the dark ignorance in which we work in these matters, and with such a survey, employment will lose much of the cruel <b>intermittence</b> it now displays.

And if by adopting some ingenious device we dispense suddenly with the labour of hundreds of men, the Socialist State will send them, not into the casual wards and colonies as our State does, to become a social burthen there, but into the technical schools to train for some fresh use of their energies. Taken all round, of course, these men, even the least enterprising or able, will be better off than they are now, with a fuller share of the product of their industry. Many will no doubt remain as they are, rather through want of ambition than want of push, because under Socialism life will be tolerable for a poor man. A man who chooses to do commonplace work and spend his leisure upon chess or billiards, or in gossip or eccentric studies, or amusing but ineffectual art, will remain a poor man indeed, but not be made a wretched one.

6000|$|I recall then in this {{connexion}} no {{moment of}} subjective <b>intermittence,</b> never {{one of those}} alarms as for a suspected hollow beneath one's feet, a felt ingratitude in the scheme adopted, under which confidence fails and opportunity seems but to mock. If the motive of [...] "The Wings of the Dove," [...] as I have noted, was to worry me at moments by a sealing-up of its face--though without prejudice to its again, of a sudden, fairly grimacing with expression--so in this other business I had absolute conviction and constant clearness to deal with; {{it had been a}} frank proposition, the whole bunch of data, installed on my premises like a monotony of fine weather. (The order of composition, in these things, I may mention, was reversed by the order of publication; the earlier written of the two books having appeared as the later.) Even under the weight of my hero's years I could feel my postulate firm; even under the strain of the difference between those of Madame de Vionnet and those of Chad Newsome, a difference liable to be denounced as shocking, I could still feel it serene. Nothing resisted, nothing betrayed, I seem to make out, in this full and sound sense of the matter; it shed from any side I could turn it to the same golden glow. I rejoiced in the promise of a hero so mature, who would give me thereby the more to bite into--since it's only into thickened motive and accumulated character, I think, that the painter of life bites more than a little. My poor friend should have accumulated character, certainly; or rather would be quite naturally and handsomely possessed of it, {{in the sense that he}} would have, and would always have felt he had, imagination galore, and that this yet wouldn't have wrecked him. It was immeasurable, the opportunity to [...] "do" [...] a man of imagination, for if THERE mightn't be a chance to [...] "bite," [...] where in the world might it be? This personage of course, so enriched, wouldn't give me, for his type, imagination in PREDOMINANCE or as his prime faculty, nor should I, in view of other matters, have found that convenient. So particular a luxury--some occasion, that is, for study of the high gift in SUPREME command of a case or of a career--would still doubtless come on the day I should be ready to pay for it; and till then might, as from far back, remain hung up well in view and just out of reach. The comparative case meanwhile would serve--it was only on the minor scale that I had treated myself even to comparative cases.|$|E

6000|$|The {{scene was}} sordid, the {{arrangements}} primitive, the {{detail of the}} procedure, as it struck me, well-nigh of the rudest; yet I remember rejoicing in it all--as one indeed might perfectly rejoice in the juiciness of joints and the abundance of accessory pudding; for I said to myself under every shock and at the hint of every savour {{that this was what}} it was for an exhibition to reek with local colour, and one could dispense with a napkin, with a crusty roll, with room for one's elbows or one's feet, with an immunity from <b>intermittence</b> of the [...] "plain boiled," [...] much better than one could dispense with that. There were restaurants galore even at that time in New York and in Boston, but I had never before had to do with an eating-house and had not yet seen the little old English world of Dickens, let alone of the ever-haunting Hogarth, of Smollett and of Boswell, drenched with such a flood of light. As one sat there one understood; one drew out the severe séance not to stay the assault of precious conspiring truths, not to break the current of in-rushing telltale suggestion. Every face was a documentary scrap, half a dozen broken words to piece with half a dozen others, and so on and on; every sound was strong, whether rich and fine or only queer and coarse; everything in this order drew a positive sweetness from never being--whatever else it was--gracelessly flat. The very rudeness was ripe, the very commonness was conscious--that is not related to mere other forms of the same, but to matters as different as possible, into which it shaded off and off or up and up; the image in fine was organic, rounded and complete, as definite as a Dutch picture of low life hung on a museum wall. [...] "Low" [...] I say in respect to the life; but that was the point for me, that whereas the smartness and newness beyond the sea supposedly disavowed the low, they did so but thinly and vainly, falling markedly short of the high; which the little boxed and boiled Albany attained to some effect of, after a fashion of its own, just by having its so thoroughly appreciable note-value in a scheme of manners. It was imbedded, so to speak, in the scheme, and it borrowed lights, it borrowed even glooms, from so much neighbouring distinction. The places across the sea, as they to my then eyes faintly after-glowed, had no impinging borders but those of the desert to borrow from. And if it be asked of me whether all the while I insist, for demonstration of the complacency with which I desire to revert, on not regretting the disappearance of such too long surviving sordidries as those I have evoked, I can but answer that blind emotion, in whichever sense directed, has nothing to say to the question and that the sense of what we just could confidently live by at a given far-away hour is a simple stout fact of relief.|$|E
6000|$|Rousseau {{says that}} he tried hard to prevail upon his fallen benefactress to leave Savoy, to come and take up her abode peacefully with him, while he and Theresa would devote their days to making her happy. He had not {{forgotten}} her in the little glimpse of prosperity; he had sent her money when he had it.[234] She was sunk in indigence, for her pension had long been forestalled, but still she refused to change her home. While Rousseau was at Geneva she came to see him. [...] "She lacked money to complete her journey; I had not enough about me; I sent it to her an hour afterwards by Theresa. Poor Maman! Let me relate this trait of her heart. The only trinket she had left was a small ring; she took it from her finger to place it on Theresa's, who instantly put it back, as she kissed the noble hand and bathed it with her tears." [...] In after years he poured bitter reproaches upon himself for not quitting all to attach his lot to hers until her last hour, and he professes always to have been haunted by the liveliest and most enduring remorse.[235] Here is the worst of measuring duty by sensation instead of principle; if the sensations happen {{not to be in}} right order at the critical moment, the chance goes by, never to return, and then, as memory in the best of such temperaments is long though not without <b>intermittence,</b> old sentiment revives and drags the man into a burning pit. Rousseau appears not to have seen her again, but the thought of her remained with him to the end, like a soft vesture fragrant with something of the sweet mysterious perfume of many-scented night in the silent garden at Charmettes. She died in a hovel eight years after this, sunk in disease, misery, and neglect, and was put away in the cemetery on the heights above Chambéri.[236] Rousseau consoled himself with thoughts of another world that should reunite him to her and be the dawn of new happiness; like a man who should illusorily confound the last glistening of a wintry sunset seen through dark yew-branches, with the broad-beaming strength of the summer morning. [...] "If I thought," [...] he said, [...] "that I should not see her in the other life, my poor imagination would shrink from the idea of perfect bliss, which I would fain promise myself in it."[237] To pluck so gracious a flower of hope {{on the edge of the}} sombre unechoing gulf of nothingness into which our friend has slid silently down, is a natural impulse of the sensitive soul, numbing remorse and giving a moment's relief to the hunger and thirst of a tenderness that has been robbed of its object. Yet would not men be more likely to have a deeper love for those about them, and a keener dread of filling a house with aching hearts, if they courageously realised from the beginning of their days that we have none of this perfect companionable bliss to promise ourselves in other worlds, that the black and horrible grave is indeed the end of our communion, and that we know one another no more? ...|$|E
60|$|I now {{began to}} find {{meaning in the}} things, which I had read or heard about the {{importance}} of poetry and art as instruments of human culture. But it was some time longer before I began to know this by personal experience. The only one of the imaginative arts in which I had from childhood taken great pleasure, was music; the best effect of which (and in this it surpasses perhaps every other art) consists in exciting enthusiasm; in winding up to a high pitch those feelings of an elevated kind which are already in the character, but to which this excitement gives a glow and a fervour, which, though transitory at its utmost height, is precious for sustaining them at other times. This effect of music I had often experienced; but, like all my pleasurable susceptibilities, it was suspended during the gloomy period. I had sought relief again and again from this quarter, but found none. After the tide had turned, and I was in process of recovery, I had been helped forward by music, but in a much less elevated manner. I at this time first became acquainted with Weber's Oberon, and the extreme pleasure which I drew from its delicious melodies did me good by showing me a source of pleasure to which I was as susceptible as ever. The good, however, was much impaired by the thought that the pleasure of music (as is quite true of such pleasure as this was, that of mere tune) fades with familiarity, and requires either to be revived by <b>intermittence,</b> or fed by continual novelty. And it is very characteristic both of my then state, and of the general tone of my mind at this period of my life, that I was seriously tormented by the thought of the exhaustibility of musical combinations. The octave consists only of five tones and two semi-tones, which can be put together in {{only a limited number of}} ways, of which but a small proportion are beautiful: most of these, it seemed to me, must have been already discovered, and there could not be room for a long succession of Mozarts and Webers, to strike out, as these had done, entirely new and surpassingly rich veins of musical beauty. This source of anxiety may, perhaps, be thought to resemble that of the philosophers of Laputa, who feared lest the sun should be burnt out. It was, however, connected with the best feature in my character, and the only good point to be found in my very unromantic and in no way honourable distress. For though my dejection, honestly looked at, could not be called other than egotistical, produced by the ruin, as I thought, of my fabric of happiness, yet the destiny of mankind in general was ever in my thoughts, and could not be separated from my own. I felt that the flaw in my life, must be a flaw in life itself; that the question was, whether, if the reformers of society and government could succeed in their objects, and every person in the community were free and in a state of physical comfort, the pleasures of life, being no longer kept up by struggle and privation, would cease to be pleasures. And I felt that unless I could see my way to some better hope than this for human happiness in general, my dejection must continue; but that if I could see such an outlet, I should then look on the world with pleasure; content, as far as I was myself concerned, with any fair share of the general lot.|$|E

Controlled low-temperature vacuum drying (CLTVD) is a method to dry products as cold as possible without freezing. The sample dried by this method could therefore avoid the damage of freezing.

Results indicated that free cells were liable to be killed in high intermittent heating, and no significant difference in viabilities of the immobilized cells among different <b>intermittences</b> was found in controlled low-temperature vacuum drying. In freeze-drying, {{there was a significant difference}} in viabilities between free cells and immobilized cells. It showed that the survivals were close in different pre-freezing temperatures and different <b>intermittences.</b> In conclusion, immobilization by κ-carrageenan could effectively protect L. acidophilus against the damage of drying and freezing. 中文摘要…………………………………………………………i 英文摘要…………………………………………………………iii 壹、前言………………………………………………… 1 貳、文獻整理………………………………………… 3 一、冷凍乾燥………………………………………………… 3 (一) 冷凍乾燥原理………………………………………… 3 (二) 冷凍乾燥應用………………………………………… 9 (三) 冷凍乾燥優缺點………………………………………… 12 (四) 冷凍乾燥結合遠紅外線加熱…………………………… 15 (五) 冷凍乾燥對乳酸菌之影響……………………………… 15 二、乳酸菌紹……………………………………………… 21 (一) 乳酸菌的簡介與分類………………………………… 21 (二) 乳酸菌的代謝特性…………………………………… 25 (三) 乳酸菌為益生菌……………………………………… 33 (四) 乳酸菌於食品工業之應用…………………………… 42 (五) 嗜酸乳桿菌(Lactobacillus acidophilus) ………………… 45 三、細胞固定化…………………………………………… 49 (一) 固定化理論與技術…………………………………… 49 (二) 細胞固定化之優點…………………………………… 52 參、研究目的………………………………………… 55 肆、材料與方法……………………………………… 56 一、試驗材料與儀器…………………………………………… 56 (一) 材料…………………………………………… …… 56 (二) 儀器…………………………………………………… 56 二、試驗方法…………………………………………………… 60 (一) 實驗菌株的製備……………………………………… 60 (二) 膠球製備……………………………………………… 60 (三) 遠紅外線冷凍乾燥…………………………………… 61 (四) 遠紅外線控低溫真空乾燥實驗……………………… 61 (五) 菌體存活率測試……………………………………… 62 (六) 統計分析……………………………………………… 62 伍、結果與討論……………………………………………… 64 一、乾燥時間…………………………………………………… 64 二、 遠紅外線控低溫真空乾燥與遠紅外線冷凍乾燥對L acidophilus 存活率之影響……………………………… 66 (一) 遠紅外線控低溫真空乾燥……………………………… 66 (二) 遠紅外線冷凍乾燥……………………………………… 66 三、固定化之L acidophilus經遠紅外線控低溫真空乾燥與遠 紅外線冷凍乾燥之影響…………………………………… 74 (一) 遠紅外線控低溫真空乾燥……………………………… 74 (二) 遠紅外線冷凍乾燥…………………………………… 74 四、固定化菌體與未固定化菌體……………………………… 81 五、綜合討論…………………………………………………… 84 陸、結論……………………………………………………… 87 柒、參考文獻………………………………………………… 8...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{democratic}} and participatory {{processes in the}} Brazilian society, and specifically in school, have been permeated by <b>intermittences,</b> weaknesses and resistances caused by multiple determinations. The text focuses on aspects concerningthe organization of education work through two lines of analysis: the first angle refers to the social constructs of structural and organic nature linked to relations of power andanti-democratic practices of the society in general. The second angle reference to a kindof ethnographic research, conducted within a public school in the Minas Gerais state. We seek to grasp the challenges on building practices and strategies {{in support of the}} participatory processes of the school community in the pedagogic project design and in the operation of the school board. We propose, with these analyses, to contribute withreflections on the status of teachers, as a subject, in the school organization throughconnections with work activities related to their everyday practice...|$|R

It was kept by a Pomeranian and the waiters without exception were from the Fatherland. I {{might as well have}} sat down with my note-book Unter den Linden, and I felt that, having come here for documentation, or to put my finger straight upon the social pulse, I should project myself as much as possible into the circumstances which are in part the consequence and in part the cause of its activities and <b>intermittences.</b> I saw there could be no well-grounded knowledge without this preliminary operation of my getting a near view, as slightly as possible modified by elements proceeding from a different combination of forces, of the spontaneous home-life of the nation.|$|R
