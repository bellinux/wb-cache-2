40|$|BACKGROUND: The huge {{potential}} of human embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> {{has been a}} subject of wide discussion as regards the ethical and legal justi®cation of using human embryos for establishing such cell lines. The opinions of infertile couples and their willingness to donate their supernumerary <b>embryos</b> for <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research have not been investigated earlier. METHODS: We conducted {{an analysis of the}} answers of couples who were asked to give informed consent as regards donating their <b>embryos</b> for <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research in our IVF unit in 2001 ± 2002. RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of the couples gave informed consent as regards establishing and characterizing embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> lines from the embryos which could not be used in their infertility treatment. Discussion in the Swedish media during May to December, 2001 regarding the importance and ethical justi®cation of <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research made informing the couples easier.

It is this key futuristic element in these arguments that is the focus of this article. We examine how competing visions of utopia or dystopia are defended through the use of diverse vocabularies, metaphors, associations and appeals to authority. Our case study explores how these rhetorical processes play out in the debate about <b>embryo</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research in UK national press and TV news media. The findings show how predictions from those in favour of <b>embryo</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research are supported by both hype and by anti-hype, by inconsistent appeals to the technologies' innovative status and by the selective deconstruction of concepts such as 'potential' and 'hope'. The debate also mobilises binary oppositions around reason versus emotion, science versus religion and fact versus fiction. This article highlights how traditional assertions of expertise are now combined with ideas about compassion and respect for democracy and diversity. It also highlights the fact that although news reporters are often responding to topical events the real focus is often on years, even decades ahead. Close attention to how images of the future are constructed, and the evolution of new strategies for legitimation are, we suggest, important areas of on-going research, particularly in discussions of scientific and medical developments and policy.

Neurospheres derived from human ASCs expressed Nestin and Musashi- 1 genes, which are marker genes for neural stem cells. When these cells were labeled with green fluorescent protein gene transfection by Sendai virus vector and transplanted into the head region of mouse embryos using a whole embryo culture system, these cells were incorporated into the craniofacial development. Some transplanted cells appeared to migrate along the second bran-chial arches, implicating some similarity to the cranial neural crest cells.

The second factor is the willingness of the regulators to strike compromises with their opponents if dignitarianism is not the main bioethical perspective and competes with other ethical perspectives for regulatory relevance.

It also contains cells similar to primitive {{embryonic stem cells}} (ESCs) that can differentiate into pancreatic-like cells.

We expanded previously frozen UCB cells by treatment with Stem Cell Factor (SCF) and Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) {{in the presence of}} valproic acid (VPA). Gene expression profiles for beta-cell differentiation and pluripotency (<b>embryo</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> phenotype) were analysed by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. There was a dramatic expansion (> 150 fold) of hematopoietic progenitors (CD 45 +/CD 133 +) that also expressed embryo markers of pluripotency (nanog, kfl- 4,sox- 2,oct 3 / 4 and c-myc), nestin, pancreatic markers as pax- 4, ngn- 3, pdx- 1 and syt- 1. UCB cells can be expanded to produce large numbers of cells of hematopoietic lineage that naturally (without retroviral vectors or transposons) express a gene pattern compatible with endocrine pancreatic precursors and markers of pluripotency. Our results confirm that frozen UCB cells can be dramatically expanded along the hematopoietic cell lineage (CD 45 +/CD 133 +) which express both markers of pluripotency and a gene pattern compatible with endocrine pancreatic precursors.

Seizing the opportunity, both China and India started to invest proportionally many available resources in advanced technology and hESR, in the hope to achieve economic success. We argue that for the following reasons this field is hazardous especially for large developing countries: a. Capital resources are relatively important to poorer countries; b. Lucrative applications are not guaranteed: losses are harder to compensate in countries with little surplus; c. The benefits of possible profits may not go to the needy; d. It may be harder for China and India to advance in these advanced fields because of their institutional history in the field of science and technology; e.

40|$|The {{trajectory}} {{of stem cell}} research {{in the early years}} of the twenty-first century offers a useful case study for the sociology of expectations. A phase of ‘Visionary Promise’ (2000 onwards) was followed by the ‘Breakthrough phase’ (2004 to mid- 2005); however, in late 2005, key breakthroughs were revealed as highly problematic leading to a period of setback and renegotiation. This article examines the recurring rhetorical themes across each phase (e. g. appeals to imaginative identification), but also highlights how specific rhetorical devices came to the fore in different periods. In 2004 / 5 the apparently landmark achievements in South Korea were used to vindicate past decisions and add urgency to future efforts. However, once fraud was revealed, scientists and policy makers had to work hard to rescue hope for (at least part of) the <b>embryo</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> enterprise. During this phase proponents reiterated the ‘promise’ of (at least some types) of stem cell research and made specific uses of the landmark metaphor to encourage continued support for the enterprise as a whole. They were also involved in sophisticated boundary management techniques: redrawing lines between scientists, between nations and between diverse types of stem cell research. This article argues that it is important to go beyond accusations of ‘hype’ to examine the complex processes involved in the creation, management and repair of hope and that this may best be pursued through tracking promise-making over time—especially through periods of change (around legislation), celebration (around breakthroughs) and setback (around fraud) ...|$|E
40|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} are derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst-stage embryo and are {{characterized}} by the ability to self-renew and differentiate into all cell types of an adult organism, as demonstrated by their transplantation into embryos in the mouse. Isolation of cells with similar properties from human embryos has permitted the study of human cell differentiation in vitro as might occur during development. As such, human ES cells {{may be useful to}} assess and predict the developmental toxicity of environmental compounds capable of epigenetic alterations of the genome and its expression. The first objective of my research was to validate the functional significance to maintenance of an undifferentiated human ES cell state of expressed genes whose epigenetic modification is conserved across diverse lines and/or likely to be deterministic of an <b>embryo</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> associated epigenetic state. The second goal was to determine the sensitivity and relationship of the expression of these genes to environmental factors known to perturb the epigenome, specifically subcytotoxic exposure to diverse organic and metallic compounds and the availability of atmospheric oxygen. siRNA-mediated knockdown of genes previously identified {{on the basis of the}} conserved methylation status of gene associated Cytosine-Guanine islands (i. e. GLIS 2, HMGA 1, PFDN 5, TET 1 and JMJD 2 C) and two related family members (TET 2 & 3) resulted in induction of cell differentiation in two independent human ES cell lines (RH 1 and H 9). Differentiation was reflected by morphological changes, reduction or loss of pluripotency associated markers, qualitative and quantitative reduction in genomic 5 -hmC and upregulation of diverse germinal lineage markers. Subcytotoxic exposure of the same human ES cell lines to diverse compounds known to alter the epigenome (i. e. 5 -azacytidine, sodium arsenite, cadmium chloride and valproic acid) generally induced downregulation of the aforementioned genes, loss of genomic hydroxymethylation and differentiation when applied under normoxia (20...|$|E

40|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> in the {{developing}} embryo proliferate and differentiate while maintaining genomic integrity, failure of which may lead to accumulation of mutations and subsequent damage to the <b>embryo.</b> Embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (ESCs), the in vitro counterpart of <b>embryo</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are highly sensitive to genotoxic stress. Defective ESCs undergo either efficient DNA damage repair or apoptosis, thus maintaining genomic integrity. However, the genotoxicity- and apoptosis-related processes in germ-line derived pluripotent cells, multipotent adult germ-line <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (maGSCs), are currently unknown. Here, we analyzed the expression of apoptosis-related genes using OligoGEArray in undifferentiated maGSCs and ESCs and identified a similar set of genes expressed in both cell types. We detected the expression of intrinsic, but not extrinsic, apoptotic pathway genes in both cell types. Further, we found that apoptosis-related gene expression patterns of differentiated ESCs and maGSCs are identical to each other. Comparative analysis revealed that several pro- and anti-apoptotic genes are expressed specifically in pluripotent cells, but markedly downregulated in the differentiated counterparts of these cells. Activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway cause approximately ∼ 35 % of both ESCs and maGSCs to adopt an early-apoptotic phenotype. Moreover, we performed transcriptome studies using early-apoptotic cells to identify novel pluripotency- and apoptosis-related genes. From these transcriptome studies, we selected Fgf 4 (Fibroblast growth factor 4) and Mnda (Myeloid cell nuclear differentiating antigen), which are highly downregulated in early-apoptotic cells, as novel candidates and analyzed their roles in apoptosis and genotoxicity responses in ESCs.
