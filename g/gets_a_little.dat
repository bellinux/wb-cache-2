500|$|A Billboard {{reviewer}} praised [...] "What Now" [...] {{and called}} the song an [...] "emotional highlight on an album filled with moments of resonance in its second half." [...] Giovanny Caquias of Culture Blues wrote that the song feels like the first [...] "candid" [...] and [...] "insightful" [...] track on Unapologetic. He continued, [...] "Rihanna <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> introspective on What Now, and doesn’t resort to being overtly sexual or defiantly callous (more on that later), which gave me the feeling that she stripped away her armor {{for a moment and}} actually allowed herself to be 'real'."

500|$|During {{the writing}} for the season, Ward and series' head writer Kent Osborne noted that it was {{increasingly}} difficult to produce new episode concepts because the writers had [...] "already used a lot of cool ideas". Osborne called this slump the [...] "season four blues". Ward went on to clarify that, [...] "everything's still coming out super weird and interesting—but it just <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> harder. You have to dig deeper." [...] To combat these issues, the writer staff tried different story writing methods, such as a technique called exquisite corpse, in which one writer starts a story {{on a sheet of}} paper, and the paper is folded and another writer tries to finish it. Ward, however, noted that [...] "the ideas are usually terrible". They also decided to experiment with different types of storytelling and to introduce more new characters to the show.|$|E

The Orlando Sentinels Roger Moore called The Edukators [...] "a {{surprisingly}} generic German 'Stockholm Syndrome' romantic triangle thriller," [...] adding: [...] "It ends interestingly, but it would've ended better, {{and played}} better, {{had it been}} half an hour shorter." [...] In Slant Magazine, Jason Clark wrote that the film needed [...] "a touch of the perverse", but [...] "Weingartner plays out the drama far too earnestly, and the story barely sustains {{the length of a}} movie half of its running time." [...] According to Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News, [...] "The dialogue between the captive and the captors <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> didactic, and the ending is as contrived as it is cynical."

The play of the salt and acid, the silk of the tomato against the salt crunch of the bacon ... It is sheer delight." [...] She discusses ways the combination can be used in soups, appetizers, and salads. Recipes are provided for multiple versions of the BLT sandwich. Jordan writes that to make the best sandwich, one should select the finest ingredients. She recommends shopping at farmers' markets for fresh tomatoes, a butcher for choice bacon, and a bakery for fresh bread. The author recommends mayonnaise brands Hellmann's and Best Foods, and Niman bacon from California. Jordan writes, [...] "For lettuce, remove the first outer leaf and then use only the next three layers. Further in, iceberg lettuce <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cabbagey." ...|$|E

[...] However, Drake said their relationship has improved, and credited the song as opening up a new dialogue, saying: [...] "I think the dialogue actually between us was already opened up, I had already solved that issue. I wrote that a while ago, and I kinda felt guilty changing it. It was a sentiment that I had when I started this album and felt like that's how it should be. The album should start one place and end in another...I haven't talked to her since it's been out. I'm not sure. I haven't spoke to her." ...|$|E

He said, [...] "South Park <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> edgy sometimes, but at their core, they're just social satire, you know? I think it was natural for them to do a dead celebrities episode with this whole summer and how it's been, and I think the way they did it was pretty tasteful for the most part." [...] The spirit of David Carradine is shown wearing lingerie and with a noose around his neck, a reference to his June 3, 2009, death by autoerotic asphyxiation. Among the others featured in the episode were actress Farrah Fawcett, journalist Walter Cronkite, disc jockey Adam Goldstein (DJ AM), politician Ted Kennedy, actress Beatrice Arthur, television personality Ed McMahon, actor Patrick Swayze, actress Natasha Richardson, hot dog magnate Oscar G.

[...] She said that Kevin was too sweet and nervous, and is weakened to Angelina's preying on him. [...] "She loves seeing him squirm" [...] DeGarmo stated. Of working with Rikaart, she said: [...] "Greg and I can't stop laughing during our scenes together." [...] During an interview with MSN, she stated: [...] "I've had the great pleasure sharing the screen with Mr. Greg Rikaart. Angelina <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of a crush on Kevin, and she's not afraid not to show it.

500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy {{felt the}} song was [...] "no great {{departure}} from what he's given us before", but felt the production of Tricky and The-Dream helped give the song a [...] "simple", [...] "big" [...] chorus about [...] "puppy love" [...] that works. Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard said, [...] "The midtempo number's undeniably contagious chorus should keep Bieber's tween fan base satisfied, and Ludacris' brief cameo adds a welcome urban twist." [...] Bertoli went on to say, [...] "The matchup adds a layer of maturity to Bieber's repertoire and should further solidify his growing presence on the charts." [...] Rap-Up magazine said that [...] "the sweet pop fare <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> street cred courtesy of the teen sensation's labelmate Ludacris." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone appreciated the song's vintage doo-wop and fifties aesthetic and hip-hop chants, and said the song included [...] "one of the catchiest choruses concocted by the-Dream and Tricky Stewart, the duo behind [...] "Umbrella" [...] and [...] "Single Ladies." [...] Luke O'Neill of Boston Globe had mixed thoughts about the song calling Ludacris' cameo [...] "goofy", and said, the song [...] "effects a musical anachronism, albeit a catchy one, but in this sped-up recycling moment all styles all at once are grist for the mill." ...|$|E

He added, [...] "Best of all, {{the writing is}} anchored in reality. Coyle lets his film show rather than tell, and lets viewers reach their own conclusions." [...] Lavender magazine writer John Townsend said the film conveyed compassionate views of Christianity and complimented the cinematography. Townsend particularly praised Baumgartner's performance and described the scenes between Sisto and a young boy troubled by his homosexual feelings (John Skelley) as [...] "exquisite". Chelsa Doyle, a writer with the website Blogcritics, called it [...] "a touching and introspective film about faith, hope and choice". Doyle praised the film's quiet tone and the performances of Sisto and Chenoweth, but said it [...] "occasionally <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sleepy in the middle", and that the subplot involving Father John's ex-girlfriend could have been cut altogether. Denver Post film critic Lisa Kennedy praised the performances of Sisto and Chenoweth, and complimented Coyle's understanding of the pastoral work of a parish priest. However, she added that the film [...] "doesn't break ground as a story, even one about redemption". Andrea Gronvall of the Chicago Reader called it a [...] "cheesy melodrama", and wrote, [...] "Writer-director Patrick Coyle tackles such weighty issues as child abuse, alcoholism, hypocrisy, celibacy, and Catholic reforms, but the movie's spiritual agenda is belied by its voyeurism." ...|$|E
500|$|The anime {{adaptation}} of Eyeshield 21 received positive and mixed responses. Bobby Cooper from DVD Talk praised how {{the rules of}} American football are [...] "explained to a foreign audience that has no clue what it's all about", adding that instructions at the commercial breaks [...] "were informative and similar to the Go lessons of Hikaru No Go." [...] He also said the explanations was [...] "hilarious", but that [...] "Eyeshield 21 is an excellent introduction to football". The on-field action was also praised, with he saying the sports action is [...] "where Eyeshield 21 truly shines", although he criticized the scenes away from the football field, [...] "the pacing slows to a crawl and the storyline <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boring". In her review, Erin Finnegan from Anime News Network stated, [...] "he pace of Eyeshield 21 is its saving grace. It's way less boring than all the time outs and commercial breaks in a regular NFL game. Football is hard to understand, but Eyeshield 21 explains the Byzantine rules...in an entertaining way. We're never left waiting for the ref's decision for long minutes like in real life. A lot of dramatic tension carries the action between plays." [...] Finnegan also criticized the artwork, saying, [...] "any episode [...] without a game is clearly farmed out to an inferior animation studio". Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment wrote that Eyeshield 21 [...] "has a good solid story idea, showing a young man finding his way through sports by finding friends and realizing he has potential, {{but it is so}} sidelined so often that it's frustrating to see it deal with situations as it does." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing her character's personality, Smith has stated: [...] "Dr. Hahn is a {{workaholic}} and she's very professional [...] I think {{she feels that}} there should be professionalism at work, and when other people do things that aren't professional she <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> upset.", adding: [...] "She has little rules in her head about how you’re supposed to act at work. That doesn’t mean she can’t break the rules. But everyone else is supposed to follow them." [...] Stacy McKee, writer of season four episode [...] "Kung Fu Fighting", which saw the establishment of Hahn as a main character, has deemed her: [...] "hardcore. [...] a kick ass female surgeon". Smith has explained that the show's writers [...] "didn’t want to rush to make [...] likable, and hoped I didn’t mind. A lot of actors don’t want to be unlikable, even if they’re the bad guy. But I’m okay with that— I’m good with being unlikable." [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes, discussing the rivalry between Hahn and her Resident Cristina Yang – which saw Hahn reprimanded by Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), Seattle Grace's Chief of Surgery, for her lack of encouragement— has given the insight: [...] "Hahn is a brilliant surgeon and is great with her patients but her teaching skills? [...] Well, let's just say she can use a little more loving care with her students, particularly Cristina. [...] I felt sorry for Hahn because Hahn grew up in a surgical world that included even fewer women than there is now (so Hahn is accustomed to a [...] "dog eat dog" [...] kind of surgical world)." [...] Trish Doolan, who consulted with the show's producers on the developing lesbian storyline between Hahn and Callie Torres, said of the character: [...] "She's very strong, very good at what she does, and actually a lot of men are threatened by that. She's very confident with what she does and who she is".|$|E
