5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The Here and Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they were {{listening}} to at the time. The response was polarising. During the publicity for The Here and Now, the band praised it as a progression for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had <b>just</b> <b>released.</b> But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E

5000|$|Nökkvi {{stated in}} a recent {{interview}} that: [...] "...the reason for releasing a full length album is that it's so unheard of within the Icelandic metal scene.

25|$|I {{think we}} were all pretty naive about what we, what we were achieving—we were having too much fun to get kind of caught up.

The rumour was acknowledged and rebutted in the February issue of The Beatles Book fanzine, but it is not known whether the rumour of 1969 is related to it.

5000|$|In {{a series}} of tweets on 11 October 2014, shortly after it was {{announced}} that the album release date had been pushed back by 2 weeks for reasons out of Knife Party's control, Swire spoke up about the decision to make the album; [...] "So close to finishing this thing. Can't believe it. Before we embarked on this thing, some people in our sphere of influence told us [...] "don't bother, <b>just</b> <b>release</b> your previous EPs as an album. EDM is dead, you should <b>just</b> <b>release</b> all your old material on one CD, fulfill the contract and then do something with Pendulum." [...] I realised that if an artist I liked released an album of old tunes, I'd be pissed off. So we wrote 12 from scratch, and it took forever. But I'm so glad we did it. Even if it turns out they were right and no one buys it and we have to sell organs for food." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{start of}} the 2nd {{generation}} of Argentine rock solo artists formerly members of great bands of their era: Gustavo Cerati, Indio Solari, Vicentico, Fidel Nadal, etc. Ex-Soda Stereo member Cerati {{spent most of the}} early part of the decade in the electronic side of music. In 2006 he returned with his first album of all new music since 2002 (Ahi Vamos) where rock was front and center, albeit a more mature rock of a man in the middle age of his life. Ex-Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota Solari's debut album El tesoro de los Inocentes was seen as the best of 2004. Vicentico and his homonymous debut sold well, but his second effort suffered the sophomore slump. He has <b>just</b> <b>released</b> his third solo album, Los Pájaros. Skay Beillinson, also ex-Redonditos, also did well with his fourth solo efforts.|$|E
