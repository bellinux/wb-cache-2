5|$|In {{addition}} to writing on process {{approaches to the}} environment, Palmer has contributed to Christian <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics</b> more broadly, urban <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics,</b> and scholarship on the environment {{in the work of}} English writers. Much of her work in <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics</b> has explored questions concerning animals, including the tension between protecting individuals and protecting species.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Environmental</b> <b>Ethics</b> and Process Thinking, Palmer {{examines}} whether process philosophy, {{in particular}} the philosophies of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne, can provide an appropriate background for engaging in <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics.</b> Process thought, Clark notes, has frequently appealed more to theologically-inclined environmental ethicists than classical theism; in particular, the views of Hartshorne and Cobb have been influential.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{does not}} {{explicitly}} connect <b>Environmental</b> <b>Ethics</b> and Process Thought to Animal Ethics in Context, her second monograph; the latter does, however, address <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics,</b> {{insofar as it}} offers an attempt to bridge <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics</b> and animal ethics. In contrast to more typical approaches to animal ethics which focus on the ethics of harming animals, Palmer asks, in Animal Ethics in Context, about the ethics of aiding animals, {{with a focus on}} the distinction between wild and domestic animals. She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a prima facie duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context.|$|E

40|$|An ecumenical <b>environmental</b> <b>ethic</b> is {{grounded}} on some values, imperatives or {{principles of the}} world’s major religions. Its basic feature is that it prescribes standards of behavior that are appropriate for human relationships with the natural world. In this paper I provide an outline of such an ethic. I do this in two ways. Firstly, by comparing the Hindu, Judeo-Christian, and Buddhist views on the natural environment and human interaction with nature. Secondly, by presenting some of the common values, imperatives or principles that emerge from these religions with regards to human relationships with the natural world. Although this account of an ecumenical <b>environmental</b> <b>ethic</b> is incomplete I believe it provides the basis for further discussions of not just what a complete account of ecumenical <b>environmental</b> <b>ethic</b> will look like but what it has to offer in the overall debate of how best {{to deal with the}} various environmental problems confronting us today...|$|R
5|$|Process ethics, Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics.</b> In {{considering}} collectivist <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics,</b> Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. She argues that Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics,</b> however, is that the former has a theological basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with {{the extension of the}} self, but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and the views of the deep ecology advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} not {{intended}} to either present or defend any particular position in <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics,</b> but rather to explore what process philosophers could say or have said about environmental issues. There are, for Palmer, two key problems with a process approach to <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics.</b> The first concerns the value of human and nonhuman life; for process thinkers, the latter will always be trumped by the former in terms of value. The second concerns human perspectives; as process philosophy invariably models interpretation of all entities on human experience, it is not well-suited to characterising non-human nature. Palmer thus concludes that process philosophy does not provide a suitable basis for <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics.</b>|$|E
40|$|This essay reexamines Holmes Rolston’s evocative {{notion of}} “storied residence” and evaluates it for its fitness for <b>environmental</b> virtue <b>ethics.</b> <b>Environmental</b> virtue <b>ethics</b> (or EVE) {{continues}} to garner attention among environmental philosophers, and recently Brian Treanor has {{argued for the}} indispensability of narrative approaches {{as part of that}} discourse. In this paper, I endorse this indispensability thesis generally, but I argue that narrative <b>environmental</b> virtue <b>ethics</b> must be supplemented either by “storied residence” or a similar environmentally, scientifically, culturally, and historically rich concept of narrative. Rolston himself has criticized <b>environmental</b> virtue <b>ethics</b> for being too agent-centered. Fortunately, an adequate sense of storied-residence is precisely what is needed to avoid triggering the vicious anthropocentrism that concerns Rolston. More concretely, storied-residence makes place(s) central to <b>environmental</b> virtue <b>ethics</b> by giving expression to features of the more-than-human world that often become secondary considerations to agency in accounts of environmental virtue...|$|R
40|$|Understanding Nature {{itself is}} an {{essential}} component of developing an <b>environmental</b> <b>ethic.</b> However, many of the ‘positive ethics’ (i. e. ethics based on aesthetics, biophila, teleology) lack the critical observation that Nature does not act kindly or attempt to preserve an organism’s life and well being, but rather, statistically, operates by continually ending life. This paper develops from this notion that biological concepts such as symbiogenesis and biotic potentials point towards an <b>environmental</b> <b>ethic</b> founded upon aligning with Nature’s process of turning against itself. This paper claims that humans, being within Nature ontologically yet separated experientially, are alienated from the ideal Nature they must respond to. However, this ideal Nature experiences internal alienation as well; to the extent that many nonhuman animals also partake in the same objectification of life to produce self-protecting technology, one can claim Nature violates itself. And the only foundation for an <b>environmental</b> <b>ethic</b> is to mirror the process of Nature in understanding to what aim such self-destruction is aspiring. The answer: biological flux...|$|R

5|$|Gary Edward Varner (born March 10, 1957) is an American philosopher specialising in <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics,</b> {{philosophical}} {{questions related}} to animal rights and animal welfare, and R. M. Hare's two-level utilitarianism. He is currently {{a professor in the}} Department of Philosophy at Texas A University, and has been based at the university since 1990. He was educated at Arizona State University, the University of Georgia and the University of Wisconsin–Madison; at Madison, where he was supervised by Jon Morline, he wrote one of the first doctoral theses on <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics.</b> Varner's first monograph was In Nature's Interests?, which was published by Oxford University Press in 1998. In the book, Varner defended a form of biocentric individualism, according to which all living entities have morally considerable interests.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Environmental</b> <b>Ethics</b> and Process Thinking, {{which was}} based on her {{doctoral}} research, Palmer explores the possibility of a process philosophy-inspired account of <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics,</b> focussing on the work of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. She ultimately concludes that a process ethic is not a desirable approach to environmental questions, despite the fact that process thought has been co-opted by some environmentalist thinkers. In Animal Ethics in Context, Palmer asks about responsibilities to aid animals, in contrast to the typical focus in animal ethics on not harming animals. She defends a contextual, relational ethic according to which humans will typically have duties to assist only domestic, and not wild, animals in need. However, humans will often be permitted to assist wild animals, and may be obligated to do so if there is a particular (causal) relationship between humans and the animals' plight.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to contextual animal ethics and her exploration {{of animals in}} <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics,</b> Palmer has written on disenhanced animals (i.e., animals that have been engineered to lose certain capacities) and companion animals. The latter topic {{was the focus of}} her co-authored text Companion Animal Ethics, which explores ethical issues concerning companion animals, including feeding, medical care, euthanasia and others.|$|E

40|$|This article revisits Lynn White's famous 1967 {{article that}} placed the blame forenvironmental {{problems}} in the Western world on the Judeo-Christian belief system, anddiscusses {{the case of the}} Pomor, a Russian sub-ethnicity who settled on the shores ofthe White Sea in the twelfth century. Although maintaining their Orthodox faith aftermigrating {{to the edge of the}} Slavic cultural zone, the Pomor adopted an entirely newway of life suited to the climate of the far north. Rather than concentrating onagriculture, which proved unreliable at the extreme northern latitude, they turned theirattention to the exploitation of marine resources: fishing, sealing, and whaling. Contending with the harsh elements on a daily basis, the Pomor developed a worldviewcalled "sacral geography," which fused animism with Christian eschatology. Sacralgeography, in addition to providing an interpretive system for the natural world, alsoobligated the Pomor to observe and respect the natural world by limiting their economicstrategies. The result was a unique <b>environmental</b> <b>ethic.</b> In the late nineteenth centuryand early twentieth century, the Pomor <b>environmental</b> <b>ethic</b> came under direct criticismfrom larger social forces-first the local business community and then the Soviet statebecauseof its low productivity. Ultimately, Stalin's aggressive economic and politicalpolicies succeeded in eliminating the Pomor <b>environmental</b> <b>ethic</b> as an effective curb onresource exploitation...|$|R

5|$|The {{book also}} has a {{practical}} dimension, presenting debates between anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric approaches to <b>environmental</b> <b>ethics</b> as of little practical consequence, and suggesting that animal rights goals can be consistent with holistic environmentalist goals. Jensen argues that Varner's own discussion of the reconciliation of environmentalism and animal advocacy is too narrow, but that, nonetheless, Varner's own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area, even despite the limited engagement in the book with practical animal-related issues.|$|E
