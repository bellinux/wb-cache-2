5|$|In 2003, it {{was decided}} that Norway was to extend its {{operations}} in Antarctica by establishing an all-year research station. By then, Norway was the only country with a territorial claim to Antarctica to not have an all-year research station on the continent.

5|$|In the past, {{the species}} (when {{it was known}} as Calvatia utriformis) has been {{separated}} into three varieties (C.utriformis var. utriformis, C.utriformis var. hungarica and C.utriformis var. gruberi) based on differences in the ornamentation of the exoperidium (outer tissue layer of the wall, or peridium) and spores. However, a 1997 study of these characters revealed that the three varieties are not clearly demarcated. This study and others suggest that variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions in which the specimens are grown can affect {{the development of these}} characteristics.|$|E

5|$|On April1, Hudah {{continued}} intensifying while approaching eastern Madagascar, and by 0600UTC that day, the MFR upgraded {{the storm}} to very intense tropical cyclone intensity– the highest rating on the agency's cyclone classification scale. Shortly after, at 1200UTC, {{the storm was}} analyzed to have reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 225km/h (140mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 905mbar (hPa; 26.73inHg), ranking Hudah {{among some of the}} strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded in the Southwest Indian Ocean. The JTWC listed a similar intensity for the storm, with winds of 235km/h (145mph), though these winds were for 1-minute sustained winds instead of 10-minute sustained winds. This intensity was later analyzed to have been very near the theoretical maximum for tropical cyclones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions Hudah was in. At the time, TRMM imagery indicated that the storm featured two concentric eyewalls. Cyclone Hudah maintained peak intensity up until it made its first landfall approximately 28km (17mi) southeast of Antalaha, Madagascar at 1730UTC on April2. Hudah substantially weakened as it traversed the mountainous terrain of northern Madagascar, and was downgraded to tropical depression status by the time it entered the Mozambique Channel at 1200UTC on March3.|$|E
5|$|The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement {{was founded}} by Les U. Knight, a high school {{substitute}} teacher who lives in Portland, Oregon. After becoming involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> movement {{as a college student}} in the 1970s, Knight attributed most of the dangers faced by the planet to human overpopulation. He joined the Zero Population Growth organization, and chose to be vasectomised at age 25. He later concluded that the extinction of humanity would be the best solution to the Earth's environmental problems. He believes that this idea has also been held by some people throughout human history.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of large dams, {{especially in the}} mid and {{upper reaches of the}} system have significantly affected the ability of fish to migrate up and down the river, and into the Sea of Japan. There has also been {{a significant increase in the}} amount of fishing which takes place in the system which is associated with the introduction of invasive fish species and waterbirds into the system. The development of the river, and human settlement, has also resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> degradation of key fish habitat. Changes in the system have affected its ability to support and maintain fish species which are endemic to the river. Some actions have been taken to overcome these issues, including prohibitions on fishing salmon during breeding and stocking certain areas for fishing, especially in areas where Tsukeba fish shacks (popup stores along the riverbank) are regularly set up.|$|E

5|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the Rampart Dam project illustrated the growing shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> movement during the 1960s. Rather than becoming focused singularly on solely preserving {{the natural beauty}} of a particular landscape, as had inspired the creation of the U.S. National Park Service in the United States {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, naturalists and environmentalists began to consider the human cost of development as well. Though opposition to Rampart was founded primarily on economic and natural grounds, it consequences for the Alaska Native population in the region reflected later concerns about industrial development in more urban areas.|$|E
5|$|VHEMT {{was founded}} in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> movement in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth's biosphere and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesman. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, though other writers have applauded VHEMT's perspective. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels. Others maintain that, whatever {{the merits of the}} idea, the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction.|$|E
