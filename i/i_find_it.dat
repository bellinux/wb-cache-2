5|$|<b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> quite nerve-racking {{performing}}, actually. Because {{when you}} write songs, you don't really think about performing in a video. I think it's quite fun. Lots of colour and dancing, and it's about doing something that's {{in keeping with the}} song, actually.|$|E
5|$|Fear of suffocation—something that I have or fear {{is never}} {{being able to}} enjoy myself,... 'Cause I love my work so much, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> really hard {{to go out and}} have a good time.... I don't go to nightclubs,... You don't see {{pictures}} of me falling out of a club drunk. I don't go—and that's because I usually go and then, you know, a whiskey and a half into it, I {{got to get back to}} work.|$|E
25|$|I am very {{disappointed}} that {{this decision was}} not communicated to me personally {{but that it was}} faxed to my lawyers. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> shameful that, after so many years of good cooperation and after all I have done for the team, I am being treated as a fax number.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's funny!" [...] growled the Hip-po-gy-raf; [...] "I {{can smell}} straw, but <b>I</b> can't <b>find</b> <b>it.</b> Well, it's here, somewhere, and I must hunt around until <b>I</b> do <b>find</b> <b>it,</b> for I'm hungry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] I said, [...] "to-morrow is Saturday. And Saturday is a {{day when}} I simply can't take gas. If I take gas, even the least bit of gas on a Saturday, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it's</b> misunderstood----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're two bright lassies, and you're hearty," [...] she said. [...] "I'm auld, {{and just}} out of Cumberland, and <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it's</b> hot enough--and I'm no guid at horseback at all. I dinna know how I'm to get aboot." ...|$|R
25|$|Helen, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> really {{unfortunate that}} you use your front row position, {{bestowed}} upon you by your colleagues, to make such statements. This is a...it is an honor and a privilege {{to be in the}} briefing room, and to suggest that we, the United States, are killing innocent people is just absurd and very offensive.|$|E
25|$|We're all {{involved}} in this: our whole {{way of life}} is structured around the burning of fossil fuels. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> sobering to think that while I've been travelling the world, trying to record the complexity and beauty of our planet, that I too have been making my own contribution to global warming. As I recognised when I presented Life on Earth all those years ago, we are a flexible and innovative species and we have the capacity to adapt and modify our behaviour. Now we most certainly have to do so if we're to deal with climate change. It's the biggest challenge we have yet faced.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> {{amazing that}} he wrote this in the time period he did. It's very prophetic, {{it seems to be}} in line with a more modern {{understanding}} of Jesus that readers of The Course in Miracles and Marianne Williamson are a large part of vocalizing. But even fundamentalists would enjoy this book… being how it is written from the opinion of 80 different points of view, many of which do proclaim him the Son of God. Ultimately, any view can be thoughtfully stimulating because the people of any opinion have personalities and background given that support why they view Jesus with their perspective. The overall impression I received from this beautiful prose is the beauty and message of Jesus, the devotion, admiration, gratitude and love inspired by him, and the grace which he exuded with confident compassion. And whether he was God, man, a combination of both that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be nothing less than relevant to our comprehension.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oakville," [...] {{said the}} cook, {{mentioning}} {{a place he}} had heard of in his wanderings. [...] "At least I was, but <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it’s</b> too much for me. Would you mind doing me the favor of cutting this line?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mum, I {{am sorry}} to say as it be. A chap came in early this morning and told me as summat had happened, so I goes out, and {{half a mile from}} the town <b>I</b> <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> just as he says." ...|$|R

25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded. In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others. He also teaches classes on experimental writing at The New School. He {{is on the board}} of advisors for Guernica Magazine and executive editor of Smyles & Fish. Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part {{of the responsibility for}} this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E
500|$|... "For me, it's {{really easy}} to write {{depressive}} songs and that's why I never do that. I {{try to do}} songs that are a bit happier and a bit more complicated. I think {{there are too many}} songwriters writing sad, depressive songs, and <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> really boring, listening to music where people are just complaining. People should stop whining! <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why I like to do it. I really like to make quite hopeful, happy music {{with a little bit of}} melancholy in it, with a little spice of melancholy." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{hardest thing}} <b>I</b> <b>find</b> {{about being in}} a {{wheelchair}} is not the handicap, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it's</b> people's acceptance. Handicapped people {{have to realize that}} they just cannot sit in the corner and wait for people to approach them. An that's the kind of message that I want to get across. You have to show people you can get out there and have a go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely!" [...] She {{had spoken}} with impatience, but, {{so far as}} that at least, he knew where he was. [...] "If I AM weak <b>I</b> want to <b>find</b> <b>it</b> out.

500|$|OBAMA: Well, look, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> amusing {{that those}} who helped to authorize and {{engineer}} the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me for {{making sure that we}} are on the right battlefield and not the wrong battlefield in the war against terrorism. (Cheers, applause.) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{objectionable}} Italian type {{is found}} only in the South, and not everywhere even there. We also have this type in our own country. When I think of them: Vienna-Ottakring, Munich-Giesing, Berlin-Pankow ! If I compare the two types, that of these degenerate Italians and our type, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> very difficult to say {{which of the two}} is the more antipathetic." ...|$|E
500|$|... "People in the {{industry}} treated me like I didn't deserve to be spoken to and I was some unwanted object. I couldn't speak English fluently and people made fun of me for that. So dealing with rejection {{became a part of}} life.... All that has taken a toll, I guess. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> hard to deal with praise. Today, when people say that I have made it and made it on my own, I feel like locking up myself somewhere... It scares me." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 1967, McCartney met the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the London Hilton {{and later}} went to Bangor in North Wales {{to attend a}} weekend {{initiation}} conference, where {{he and the other}} Beatles learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation. He said, [...] "The whole meditation experience was very good and I still use the mantra... <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> soothing." [...] In 2009, McCartney and Starr headlined a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall, raising threemillion dollars for the David Lynch Foundation to fund instruction in Transcendental Meditation for at-risk youth.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross: Bruce's ex-girlfriend/co-researcher, {{as well as}} estranged {{daughter}} of General Ross. Betty is possibly {{the only way for}} the Hulk to lead back into his transformation of Bruce. Connelly was attracted to the role by way of director Ang Lee. [...] "He's not talking about a guy running around in green tights and a glossy fun-filled movie for kids. He's talking along the lines of tragedy and psychodrama. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> interesting, the green monster of rage and greed, jealousy and fear in all of us." ...|$|E
500|$|One feminist {{viewpoint}} {{sees the}} bikini uniform as objectification of women athletes. US beach volleyball player Gabrielle Reece described the bikini bottoms as uncomfortable with constant [...] "yanking and fiddling." [...] Many female beach volleyball players have suffered injuries by over-straining the abdominal muscles while {{many others have}} gone through augmentation mammoplasty to look appealing in their uniforms. Australian competitor Nicole Sanderson said about match break entertainment that [...] "it's kind of disrespectful to the female players. I'm sure the male spectators love it, but <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> a little bit offensive." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{second example}} may refer {{to an event}} that {{happened}} continuously or habitually in the past. (I.e. [...] "After <b>I</b> used to <b>find</b> <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> would sell it" [...] OR [...] "After <b>I</b> would <b>find</b> <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> would sell it"). The first example, being the preterite, refers only to actions completed once in the remote past, or distant past.|$|R

500|$|In 1960 Leigh {{recalled}} her ambivalence {{towards her}} first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, [...] "that some critics saw {{fit to be}} as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E
500|$|The video caused [...] "a veritable stir in {{the music}} world" [...] because [...] "Boutonnat cast [...] {{as a kind of}} provocative Lolita figure". As she wears a {{transparent}} nightgown in the music video, some French television channels censored it. It was first aired on the French television programme Clip Clap in a shortened version. In an interview, Farmer deplored the censorship, saying: [...] " [...] has shocked many people. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> pretty stupid. Jacques Dutronc said [...] "Merde in France" [...] and everyone went into raptures. As for me, I simply say that I enjoyed the controversy".|$|E
500|$|In January, Davis wrote home, expressing {{frustration}} at the slow logistics of replacement aircraft parts, claiming this was slowing down missions. He {{also began to}} express contempt for the F-86, feeling at times it was being outperformed by the MiG and that [...] "something {{will have to be}} done" [...] to give the UN pilots more of an advantage in combat. He also said that he had begun to grow tired of the constant publicity about him. [...] "They're trying to make a hero of me and <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> rather embarrassing", he wrote in a letter. At other times, Davis indicated he preferred to stay in combat.|$|E
