25|$|After her arrest, Parks {{became an}} icon of the Civil Rights Movement but {{suffered}} hardships as a result. Due to economic sanctions used against activists, she lost {{her job at the}} department store.

500|$|... "Occupation", and {{following}} episode [...] "Precipice" [...] {{were written by}} series creator Ronald D. Moore. The Cylon occupation of New Caprica, and the human resistance fighting them, was inspired by wars and military occupations from history, including the Quartering Acts, World War II, and the more recent occupation in Iraq. In the original writing, Moore did not originally consider including Tigh with an eye removed until the final drafts were written. Portraying actor Michael Hogan was initially hesitant with the idea. He recalled that when the producers called <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> how his character would be maimed, they suggested having an eye removed. Hogan responded by laughing, and the producers assumed he agreed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] Mrs. Makely pleaded, [...] "do let us get <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Altruria on any terms. I {{think all}} {{this about the}} labor {{question}} is so tiresome; don't you, Mrs. Camp?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Young Camp entered at this moment, and the Altrurian hesitated. [...] "Oh, do go on!" [...] Mrs. Makely entreated. She {{added to}} Camp: [...] "We've got <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Altruria at last, and we wouldn't have him stopped for worlds." ...|$|R
50|$|Veronica <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> the 911 caller's wife <b>to</b> get <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Lamb <b>about</b> {{what he saw}} on the bridge. The caller tells Lamb he saw Thumper kill Felix.|$|R
500|$|He {{also gave}} music lessons, and often had other music artists visiting <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> music {{and asking for}} advice. His third and {{youngest}} daughter Puan Sri Dr. Rohana Zubir, a retired lecturer with the University of Malaya, recalled how the family home in Singapore was always filled with music. He was {{the heart of the}} conversation, very enthused and willing to share pearls of wisdom so that others could benefit from his work. This generosity extended to other areas of his life. He helped his own family in Sumatra and families in Singapore he had [...] "adopted", sending them medicine and other items with what little he could afford, even though his own family was not well off at the time.|$|E

Returning to normal social activities, he is disconcerted {{to see one of}} his former clients at a school science fair. Orson is worried for Andrew, which Bree notices and asks him about later that night. Wanting no secrets, Orson confesses that Andrew sold himself for money, and that the man he had been talking to was a {{previous}} client. Bree, shocked, and a friend of the man's wife, confesses all to her. She takes it badly, and tells Bree in return that Danielle is sleeping with her history teacher. Later, Andrew watches the tail end of her argument with Danielle and, concerned, he tries to comfort Bree, explaining that she did instill moral values, [...] "I mean, we know {{the difference between right and}} wrong, we just chose wrong", but also that she pushed them so hard they had to rebel. Bree tries to subtly get <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> his prostitution, but he gently brushes her off. Andrew has since got a job working at Tom's pizzeria, though he takes a fairly lax attitude to his work.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Dwayne and Colby {{escape to}} a freighter. [...] There, they find Mason Lancer (Val Kilmer), a United States {{attorney}} whose birth in Beijing, China, to American parents {{led him to}} spy for the Chinese. [...] While revealing that Colby is indeed a triple agent, Lancer, who possesses some medical training, gives Colby two drugs to induce <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the FBI's investigation into Lancer. [...] At the FBI office, Charlie uses a trust metric to determine Colby's credibility. [...] The {{rest of the team}} analyze NSA satellite photographs of the Port of Los Angeles to find Colby and Dwayne and find Lancer's SUV at the port.

5000|$|Hemraj {{had spoken}} {{of a threat}} to his life before his death. The police {{suspected}} that he knew about Rajesh's alleged extra-marital affair, and Rajesh had threatened <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|R
50|$|Darby also {{received}} a personal letter from Donald Rumsfeld, asking <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> how his identity had been disclosed by Rumsfeld despite receiving assurances of anonymity from military command.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Sandgate took it up straight, {{rounding}} it off, {{as their}} companion only waited. [...] "Leave <b>him</b> free <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the sum offered and the sum taken as practically {{one and the}} same?" ...|$|R
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1884, Gordon {{had no interest in}} the Sudan and had just been hired to work as an officer with the newly established Congo Free State. Gordon [...] despite or rather because of his war hero status [...] disliked publicity and tried to avoid the press when he was in Britain. While staying with his sister in Southampton, Gordon received an unexpected visitor, namely William Thomas Stead, the editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, whom Gordon reluctantly agreed to do an interview with. Gordon wanted to talk about the Congo, but Stead kept on pressing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the Sudan; finally after much prompting on Stead's part Gordon opened up and attacked Gladstone's Sudan policy, coming out for an intervention to crush the Mahdi. Gordon offered up a 19th-century version of the domino theory, claiming: The danger arises from the influence which the spectacle of a conquering Mahometan [...] Power established close to your frontiers will exercise upon the population which you govern. In all the cities of Egypt it will be felt that what the Mahdi has done they may do; and, as he has driven out the intruder, they may do the same. Stead published his interview on 9 January 1884 {{on the front page of}} the Pall Mall Gazette alongside the leader (editorial) he had written entitled [...] "Chinese Gordon for the Sudan". Urban wrote: [...] "With this leader, William Stead's real motive in going to Southampton revealed itself at last. As to who tipped him off that the general would be staying here for just a couple of nights, we can only speculate".|$|E
60|$|After Jonas {{had taken}} his supper, the boys {{gathered}} around <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> their fort, {{every now and then}} running to the door or window, to see the fire on the pond.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Mr. Wright had his reasons," [...] Mrs. Vivian suggested, {{and then}} she ventured to explain: [...] "He still cares for Angela, and it was painful to <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> her marrying some one else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'On {{terms of}} {{familiarity}} with his mistress,' said Mrs. Rolland, 'which were simply sickening to a respectable English servant. She used <b>to</b> encourage <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her <b>about</b> all his affairs--how he got on with his wife, and how pressed he was for money, and such like--just {{as if they were}} equals. Contemptible--that's what I call it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> on <b>about</b> the future. She {{loved to}} hear his clear, {{confident}} voice with its touch of boyish boastfulness. What was there <b>to</b> stop <b>him?</b> Why should he not climb from power to power till he had reached the end! ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1938, {{during a}} meeting with Wilhelm Fabricius, the German ambassador, Cristea praised the anti-semitic policy {{conducted}} by Nazi Germany and supporting such a policy in Romania, and the British Ambassador wrote in his report to London that [...] "Nothing would induce <b>him</b> [...] <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> anything but the Jewish problem." ...|$|R
60|$|I met a British {{officer in}} France {{who is also}} a landowner. I got <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> his {{administrative}} work upon his property. He was very keen upon new methods. He said he tried to do his duty by his land.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{a first-rate}} soldier," [...] the man said, [...] "and I expect {{he will get}} the first vacancy among the sergeants. We all think {{he has been an}} officer, though he never talks about it. He's the best-tempered fellow possible, but you can never get <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the past. However, that makes no {{difference}} to us." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a rap at the door, and Charlie {{charged in}} impetuously. He had been {{released}} from office, and by {{the look in his}} eyes I could see that he had come over for a long talk; most probably with poems in his pockets. Charlie's poems were very wearying, but sometimes they led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the galley.|$|E
50|$|Sitting and Standing: A {{rich man}} {{is sitting on}} a seat, while a poor man is {{standing}} near <b>him.</b> They start <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> being poor or rich.|$|R
60|$|Lady Mary {{wrote to}} her father, declaring that she was most {{particularly}} anxious <b>to</b> see <b>him</b> and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Mrs. Finn.|$|R
2500|$|On the September 5 {{episode of}} SmackDown, {{after a brief}} {{confrontation}} with Kevin Owens, McMahon proceeded to beat down Owens after warning <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> his family. Soon after, Daniel Bryan then came out to announce that Shane had been [...] "suspended indefinitely" [...] by Vince McMahon, who would be returning to Smackdown Live next week.|$|R
60|$|I was {{surprised}} to hear Stephen come out so plump and plain about it, for I hadn't expected {{to get at the}} root of the matter so easily. Stephen wasn't the confidential kind. But it really seemed to be a relief to <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it; I never saw a man feeling so sore about anything. He told me the whole story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hulton's," [...] said Foster, and {{afterwards}} thought she tactfully encouraged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the manufacturing firm, {{although he did}} not mention Fred Hulton's death. Her manner, however, was quite correct; he had been of some small help, which warranted her conversing with him to pass the time. That was all, and when their companion got out and she opened a book he went to the smoking-compartment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. St. Clare is a {{singular}} man," [...] said Marie to Miss Ophelia, in a complaining tone. [...] "I used to think, {{if there was}} anything in the world he did love, it was our dear little Eva; but he seems to be forgetting her very easily. I cannot ever get <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> her. I really did think he would show more feeling!" ...|$|E
50|$|On Thursday November 8, 2007, before Guantanamo captive Omar Khadr's {{military}} commission, {{his military}} defense counsel, Lieutenant Commander William Keubler {{revealed that he}} had been informed just two days earlier about an eyewitness whose testimony could help clear Khadr.Major Jeff Groharing told reporters, in the courtroom, that Hartmann had ordered <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the case.|$|R
60|$|Carley {{was amused}} and interested. She {{could not say}} that Charley had shown any {{indication}} of his mental peculiarity to her. It took considerable restraint not <b>to</b> lead <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> more <b>about</b> Flo and Glenn. Presently they reached the turn in the road, opposite the cottage Carley had noticed yesterday, and here her loquacious escort halted.|$|R
60|$|Jack. Bunbury! Well, I won't have <b>him</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>about</b> Bunbury {{or about}} {{anything}} else. It {{is enough to}} drive one perfectly frantic.|$|R
60|$|In {{the course}} of the evening Major Mallett {{received}} three or four invitations to dances and balls, and, being thus started in society, was soon out every evening. For the first week he enjoyed the novelty of the scene, but very speedily tired of it. At dinners the ladies he took down always wanted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> India; but even this was, in his opinion, preferable to the crush and heat of the dances.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a syllable;--though I {{was most}} anxious {{to ask the}} question. When you are intent upon any matter, it does not do to go away to other things. I should have never made him {{believe that he was}} to leave me in earnest, had I allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Florian and the girls. He has gone now. Well;--good-night, father. You and I, father, are all in all to each other now. Not but what {{somebody}} else will come, I suppose." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wyndham {{thanked him}} {{and when he}} went off Chisholm pondered. Perhaps he had agreed rather weakly; he had meant to be firmer, but Wyndham had led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> his voyage. Anyhow, the fellow had charm. It was hard to refuse him and Chisholm had seen he was sincere. By and by {{he got up and}} lighted his pipe. The thing was done with and he had given his consent. Somehow he had been persuaded and after all if Flora was satisfied---- ...|$|E
50|$|Mitchell and Twofour met {{at least}} once a day <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the things the cameras has been {{following}} and ask Mitchell if he had any concerns or comments. He did not have any editorial control but the relationship with Twofour and Channel 4 enabled <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> openly <b>about</b> things that might concern Mitchell and the staff, and their comments were taken into consideration when the final cut was made.|$|R
50|$|Gordon is {{notified}} by Bullock that a contact in Internal Affairs that IA has re-opened {{the investigation into}} Galavan's murder and that Gordon is the prime suspect. Lee (Morena Baccarin) is terrified since Gordon assured her that the problem was over. Nygma visits Strike Force member, Carl Pinkney (Ian Quinlan) and kills him. Bullock directs Gordon to a payphone where the bomb threat was phoned in, where Gordon discovers Pinkney's corpse. Barnes arrives and assumes Gordon killed Pinkney as Pinkney (Nygma in fact) had texted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Gordon.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose he}} means any harm by it, but I don't {{like to see}} a {{minister}} laugh so much. I can't hardly get <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> seriously <b>about</b> anything. And I just know he makes fun of Lottie. I don't mean that he always makes fun with me. He didn't that night at the vaudeville, where I first saw him." ...|$|R
