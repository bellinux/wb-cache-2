The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce mountain ringlet butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of sphagnum mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> species.|$|E

5000|$|But, it is {{also argued}} in contradistinction that the word Trinity is {{utilized}} with a very similar meaning to its fourth century use.

But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit: withal." [...] From which it most clearly follows that there is no difference in the Trinity, but that which is called the gift of the Spirit is made known through the Son, and operated by God the Father.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, diversity, {{whether it}} be ecological, biological, cultural, or {{linguistic}} diversity, {{has emerged as a}} major cultural value. This paper analyzes whether a single concept <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> can underwrite discussions <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> in different disciplines. More importantly, it analyzes the normative justification for the endorsement <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> as a goal in all contexts. It concludes that no more than a relatively trivial concept <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> as richness is common to all contexts. Moreover, there is no universal justification for the endorsement <b>of</b> <b>diversity.</b> Arguments to justify the protection <b>of</b> <b>diversity</b> must be tailored to individual contexts...|$|R
