50|$|Illuminants {{are unique}} {{location}} to location across the globe, however {{several types of}} illuminant have been standardized by the CIE. <b>Illuminants</b> types <b>D65</b> and D50 are acceptable for use, however D50 illuminant is suggested for a calibrated and accurate color vision test result. Use of different illuminant can sway results in a significant manner due to the spectral power distribution of alternate sources and their incident effect on how displayed information is processed by the human visual system. Illuminants containing varying concentrations of differing wavelength intensity light skews the representation of color on the screen {{in a manner that}} would cause the eye to mismatch color patches. In combination with the spatial acuity function of the human visual system, illumination plays {{a significant role in the}} color accuracy of a display.|$|R

5000|$|The CCTs of the {{canonical}} <b>illuminants,</b> D50, D55, <b>D65,</b> and D75, differ slightly from what their names suggest. For example, D50 has a CCT of 5003 K ("horizon" [...] light), while D65 has a CCT of 6504 K (noon light). As {{explained in a}} previous section, {{this is because the}} value of the constants in Plancks law have been slightly changed since the definition of these canonical illuminants, whose SPDs are based on the original values in Plancks law. In order to match all significant digits of the published data of {{the canonical}} illuminants the values of M1 and M2 have to be rounded to three decimal places before calculation of SD.|$|R
50|$|In 1955 Wyszecki {{joined the}} National Research Council of Canada in Ottawa {{where he became}} the leader of its Optics Section in 1960 and Assistant Director of the Division of Physics in 1982, and where he {{remained}} until his untimely death from leukemia. Wyszecki {{is best known for}} his scientific contributions to and leadership in the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). He was chairman of its Colorimetry Committee from 1963 to 1975, vice president of the organization from 1979 to 1983 and its president from 1983 until his death. During this period the CIE made many important recommendations in colorimetry, remaining valid today, such as 1 nm tables of the color-matching functions of the two CIE standard observers and the standard <b>illuminants</b> A and <b>D65,</b> addition of integrating-sphere reflectance factor measurement as a recommended measuring geometry, the 1964 (U*V*W*) and the 1976 CIELAB and CIELUV uniform color space and color difference formulas, and others.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to find if a {{correlation}} exists between a previously conducted visual whiteness ranking of 128 sheets of white office paper, from various manufacturers, and a ranking generated by affordable hand held colorimeters. Two different hand held colorimeters were used to measure the 128 sheets. The output from the colorimeters was in CIE chromaticity coordinates and CIELAB L* a* b* values. The lightness (L*) value was used to make a ranking for comparison to the visual ranking. The chromaticity coordinates were used for computing CIE Whiteness. The resulting whiteness index values were used to form a ranking for comparison to the visual ranking. The ranking comparisons were plotted, correlations determined, and regression analysis performed. The analysis demonstrated that a correlation does exist between the visual and instrument rankings. The scatter plots show that the relationship is most likely linear. The strongest correlations occurred with CIE Whiteness rankings generated from measurements using an X-Rite 948 hand held colorimeter set to <b>Illuminant</b> C or <b>D₆₅.</b> The strongest correlation had an r value of. 953 with r² value of 90. 8 %...|$|R

5000|$|Starting with {{a sample}} of 59 colored tiles of {{non-uniform}} color differences, the OSA asked 72 observers to judge color differences between the different sample tiles.
