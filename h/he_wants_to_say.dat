500|$|Dick Enberg {{hosted the}} post-match {{ceremony}} during which a victorious del Potro requested to address his fans in Spanish. Enberg declined the request {{saying that he}} was running out of time, but went on to list the corporate sponsored prizes del Potro won. A couple of minutes later, del Potro made the same request again, and only then did Enberg relent saying, [...] "Very quickly, in Spanish, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> hello to his friends here and in Argentina." [...] An emotional del Potro finally spoke a few sentences in Spanish to a cheering crowd. Many viewers expressed disappointment with Enberg and broadcaster CBS over the interview. A CBS executive later defended Enberg, noting that the contract with the United States Tennis Association required that certain sponsors receive time during the ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Presley {{undertook}} three brief tours {{during the}} year, continuing {{to generate a}} crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that [...] "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed." [...] Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver, the crowd rioted {{after the end of}} the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as [...] "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore." [...] Asked for a response, Presley said, [...] "I admire the man. He has a right to say what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it.... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2008, viewers saw Martha {{coming to}} terms with a second pregnancy. The storyline began after Martha left old boyfriend Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) for Jack. She was unsure of the child's paternity, but kept it a secret from Jack. Gordon said this is [...] "Because she doesn't think he ever needs to know. Roman's said he doesn't want to be {{involved}} and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it's Jack's. And so does Martha..." [...] After Martha has a miscarriage scare, Roman wanted to know if the baby was his. Gordon explained that [...] "Roman says he needs to know if he is or isn't the baby's father and Martha has to agree to do a DNA test. [...] They wait till Jack's out of the room then quickly arrange it. Martha's so scared of losing Jack she wants the facts before deciding her next step." [...] Martha's relationship with Jack was at its strongest at that time, but Gordon was concerned about Martha's lies: [...] "Martha and Jack have been through more than most and right now their relationship is as solid as it could be. But she's taking a big chance not being honest about her pregnancy." [...] She described Roman being the baby's father as [...] "Martha's worst nightmare".|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the poem}} is {{concerned}} primarily with the irregular musings of the narrator, {{it can be difficult}} to interpret. Laurence Perrine wrote, [...] " [...] presents the apparently random thoughts going through a person's head within a certain time interval, in which the transitional links are psychological rather than logical". This stylistic choice makes it difficult to determine exactly what is literal and what is symbolic. On the surface, [...] "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" [...] relays the thoughts of a sexually frustrated middle-aged man who wants to say something but is afraid to do so, and ultimately does not. The dispute, however, lies in to whom Prufrock is speaking, whether he is actually going anywhere, what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and to what the various images refer.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, O'Neal reiterated {{his belief}} that Bryant {{deserved}} the MVP award. Bryant {{went on to win}} the award for the first time in his career that season. During the offseason, O'Neal was at a party, and got up to rap in front of the crowd. O'Neal mentioned Bryant multiple times in the rap, saying that [...] "Kobe couldn't do it without me", referring to Bryant and the Lakers loss in the 2008 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics. He also rapped, [...] "Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes". During the rap, O'Neal also blamed his divorce on Bryant's comments to investigators in 2004 about O'Neal paying off women. Bryant commented that he [...] "didn't take (O'Neal's rap) any kind of way whatsoever." [...] O'Neal later said he was freestyling and that [...] "it was all done in fun. Nothing serious whatsoever ... I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all." [...] Rap artist Snoop Dogg, a Laker fan, agreed that [...] "Shaq has all access and the right to do and say what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in fun, in the spirit of rap." ...|$|E

60|$|Forgive my long {{delay in}} writing, but I have been simply {{overwhelmed}} with work. The {{life of an}} assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.

50|$|In an engagingly two-edged assessment, fellow critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki {{wrote that}} Hage’s style of {{literary}} criticism had the great advantage {{that you always}} knew in advance precisely what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{may be a}} {{distinct}} gain to justice in permitting a witness to say whatever <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> If he {{is telling the truth}} he will not contradict himself; if he is lying the more rope he is given the more surely he will entangle himself. To the service of that end defendants and prisoners should, I think, be compelled to testify and denied the advantage of declining to answer, for silence is the refuge of guilt In endeavoring by austere means to make an accused person incriminate himself the French judge logically applies the same principle that a parent uses with a suspected child. When the Grandfather of His Country arraigned the wee George Washington for arboricide the accused was not carefully instructed that he need not answer if a truthful answer would tend to convict him. If he had refused to answer he would indubitably have been lambasted until he did answer, as right richly he would have deserved to be.|$|E
6000|$|These {{are words}} which the writer should have always present to his memory, {{if he has}} {{something}} serious that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> or if he wishes to express himself in the classic and perfect manner. But if it is his fate merely to be obliged to say something, {{in the course of}} his profession, or if he is bid to discourse for the pleasure of readers in the Underground Railway, I fear he will often have to forget Mr. Pater. It may not be literature, the writing of causeries, of Roundabout Papers, of rambling articles [...] "on a broomstick," [...] and yet again, it may be literature! [...] "Parallel, allusion, the allusive way generally, the flowers in the garden"--Mr. Pater charges heavily against these. The true artist [...] "knows the narcotic force of these upon the negligent intelligence to which any diversion, literally, is welcome, any vagrant intruder, because one can go wandering away with it from the immediate subject [...] . In truth all art does but consist in the removal of surplusage, from the last finish of the gem engraver blowing away the last particle of invisible dust, back to the earliest divination of the finished work to be lying somewhere, according to Michel Angelo's fancy, in the rough-hewn block of stone." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{distinguished}} {{man should}} be as particular about his last words as he is about his last breath. He should write them out on {{a slip of paper}} and take the judgment of his friends on them. He should never leave such a thing to the last hour of his life, and trust to an intellectual spirit at the last moment to enable him to say something smart with his latest gasp and launch into eternity with grandeur. No--a man is apt to be too much fagged and exhausted, both in body and mind, at such a time, to be reliable; and maybe the very thing <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> he cannot think of to save him; and besides there are his weeping friends bothering around; and worse than all as likely as not he may have to deliver his last gasp before he is expecting to. A man cannot always expect to think of a natty thing to say under such circumstances, and so it is pure egotistic ostentation to put it off. There is hardly a case on record where a man came to his last moment unprepared and said a good thing--hardly a case where a man trusted to that last moment and did not make a solemn botch of it and go out of the world feeling absurd.|$|E

6000|$|Campbell acted strangely, as if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> more, but did {{not have}} {{authority}} to do so. He looked dismayed. Then he said: [...] "All right, Neale. I'll take your message. But you can expect me back." ...|$|R
6000|$|Philetas, the {{remaining}} {{member of the}} Alexandrian Triad, {{seems to have been}} a more simple, genial, and graceful spirit than the other two, to whom he was accordingly esteemed inferior. Only a few fragments are left; but he was not altogether without his influence, for he was, as I have just said, one of the models on which Propertius and Ovid formed themselves; and some, indeed, call him the Father of the Latin elegy, with its terseness, grace, and clear epigrammatic form of thought, and, therefore, in a great degree, of our modern eighteenth century poets; not a useless excellence, seeing that it is, on the whole, good for him who writes to see clearly what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and to be able to make his readers see it clearly also. And yet one natural strain is heard amid all this artificial jingle--that of Theocritus. It is not altogether Alexandrian. Its sweetest notes were learnt amid the chestnut groves and orchards, the volcanic glens and sunny pastures of Sicily; but the intercourse, between the courts of Hiero and the Ptolemies seems to have been continual. Poets and philosophers moved freely from one to the other, and found a like atmosphere in both; and in one of Theocritus' idyls, two Sicilian gentlemen, crossed in love, agree to sail for Alexandria, and volunteer into the army of the great and good king Ptolemy, of whom a sketch is given worth reading; as a man noble, generous, and stately, [...] "knowing well who loves him, and still better who loves him not." [...] He has another encomium on Ptolemy, more laboured, though not less interesting: but the real value of Theocritus lies in his power of landscape-painting.|$|E
6000|$|What if he {{has often}} copied? What if, in this very scrap, chosen almost at random, {{there should be a}} touch from Tennyson's [...] "Two Voices?" [...] And what if imitations, nay, caricatures, be found in almost every page? Is not the {{explanation}} simple enough, and rather creditable than discreditable to Mr. Smith? He takes as his models Shelley, Keats, and their followers. Who is to blame for that? The Glasgow youth, or the public taste, which has been exalting these authors more and more for the last twenty years as the great poets of the nineteenth century? If they are the proper ideals of the day, who will blame him for following them as closely as possible--for saturating his memory so thoroughly with their words and thoughts that he reproduces them unconsciously to himself? Who will blame him for even consciously copying their images, if they have said better than he the thing which <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> in the only poetical dialect which he knows? He does no more than all schools have done, copy their own masters; as the Greek epicists and Virgil copied Homer; as all succeeding Latin epicists copied Virgil; as Italians copied Ariosto and Tasso; as every one who can copies Shakespeare; as the French school copied, or thought they copied, [...] "The Classics," [...] {{and as a matter of}} duty used to justify any bold image in their notes, not by its originality, but by its being already in Claudian, or Lucan, or Virgil, or Ovid; as every poetaster, and a great many who were more than poetasters, twenty years ago, used to copy Scott and Byron, and as all poetasters now are copying the very same models as Mr. Smith, and failing while he succeeds.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Whosoever believeth on Him {{shall not}} be ashamed.' It seems as if St. Paul thought, that not being ashamed {{had to do with}} salvation, and being saved; ay, that they were almost the same thing: for he says just before, if thou doest so and so, thou shalt be saved; for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth {{confession}} is made unto salvation; for the Scripture saith, 'Whosoever believeth on Him {{shall not be}} ashamed;' as if being ashamed was the very thing from which we were to be saved. And certainly that wise and great man, whoever he was (some say he was St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, in Italy), who wrote the Te Deum, thought the same; for how does he end the Te Deum? 'O Lord, in Thee have I trusted: let me never be confounded,' that is, brought to shame. You see, after he has spoken of God, and the everlasting glory of God, of Cherubim and Seraphim, that is, all the powers of the earth and the powers of the heavens, of Apostles, Prophets, Martyrs, the Holy Church, all praising God, and crying 'Holy, holy, holy. Lord God of Hosts, Heaven and Earth are full of the majesty of Thy glory;' after he has spoken of the mystery of the Trinity, Father and Son and Holy Ghost, of Christ's redemption and incarnation, and ascension and glory; of His judging the world; of His government, and His lifting up His people for ever; after he has prayed God to keep them this day without sin, and to let His mercy lighten upon them; after all this, {{at the end of this}} glorious hymn, all that he has to say is, 'O Lord, in Thee have I trusted: let me never be confounded.'--All he has to say: but that is a great deal: he does not say that merely because <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something more, and has nothing else to say. Not so. In all great hymns and writings like this, the end is almost sure to be the strongest part of all, to have the very pith and marrow of the whole matter in it, as I believe this end of the Te Deum has; and I believe that whoever wrote it thought that being confounded, and brought to shame, was just the most horrible and wretched thing which could happen to him, or any man, and the thing above all others from which he was most bound to pray God to save him and every human being.|$|E
