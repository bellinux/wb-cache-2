40|$|Broad-spectrum {{antimicrobial}} compounds {{have recently}} been identified in the epidermal mucus of fishes and probably serve as a first line of defence against microbial pathogens. Because of the ubiquitous nature of fungi and bacteria in aquatic systems, defence against these pathogens should be required throughout the lifespan of fishes, including the egg stage. We conducted experiments on Etheostoma crossopterum (Percidae: Catonotus), the fringed darter, {{to determine if the}} presence of a guarding male inhibits microbial colonization of eggs. Based on results from a combination of in-stream experiments, in vitro microbial assays, and morphological characteristics and behaviour of breeding males, we propose that antimicrobial <b>egg</b> <b>cleaning</b> by the guarding male is an effective component of parental care in these fish. Although innate antimicrobial compounds have been identified in a variety of organisms ranging from insects to vertebrates, integration of these compounds into a species's reproductive life history has been identified only in a small number of insect species. The results from this study not only indicate that E. crossopterum males provide a novel form of vertebrate parental care, but also have implications regarding the evolution of parental care in fishes and transitional evolutionary stages from no parental care to male parental care...|$|E
40|$|Parental {{care can}} be a costly life history trait, {{therefore}} it has only evolved when the benefits of care outweigh the costs. We investigated the life-history trade-offs in the earwig Anisolabis maritima in which females establish solitary subterranean nests colonies. Females remain with their eggs for three weeks, past the time of hatching, and provide maternal care {{in the form of}} <b>egg</b> <b>cleaning</b> and egg defense. During this egg guarding period adjacent females consistently attempt to invade the nest and, when successful, will cannibalize some fraction of a host female???s clutch. We conducted removal experiments in order to quantify {{the costs and benefits of}} maternal care in a solitary context in the lab and a colonial context in the field.. Our results show that maternal care is essential for the survival of eggs, independent of coloniality, due to the sanitation services that a mother provides. However in the field, maternal care also acts to significantly reduce nest invasion and predation. Providing care, however, is costly to the mother in terms of delayed future reproduction. By following clutch development throughout nesting, we found that mothers consistently engage in filial cannibalism. The purpose of this facultative cannibalism may be to mitigate this cost by cannibalizing a portion of their own clutch to offset the energetic demands of care and/or to speed the time to hatching. Together these results show the multiple benefits of maternal care in earwigs, with the magnitude of these benefits varying across different social contexts...|$|E

Infection of {{fish eggs}} by oomycete watermolds has been {{documented}} among numerous fish species occupying diverse aquatic habitats. In fact, watermolds {{are considered to be}} ubiquitous in freshwater systems and it seems that all species of fish eggs are susceptible to infection. Oomycete infection can result in the loss of large numbers of viable eggs because it can quickly spread from one infected egg to many others. To date, the majority of studies have been conducted using salmonid eggs under artificial rearing conditions, and there has been virtually no research on reproductive ecology or parental care behavior in fish as it relates to watermold infection. Additionally, few studies have utilized microscopy to elucidate the causes or pathways of infection. 	 My research project had two major objectives. First, I looked at two aspects of convict cichlid (Archocentrus nigrofasciatus) behavior, fanning and <b>egg</b> <b>cleaning,</b> in an attempt to quantify the individual and collective effectiveness of each behavior in preventing the spread of infection within a clutch of eggs. Effectiveness was evaluated by comparing egg mortality under different care regimes. Second, I used microscopy and histology techniques to look at and pictorially document modes of egg infection and spatial patterns of egg mortality. My evaluations of parental care effects on watermold infection did not yield any statistically significant differences between treatments, possibly due to unforeseen design flaws and inadequately controlled variables. I discuss these flaws and offer suggestions for additional research that will provide a reference for future studies on this important topic. Additionally, egg samples were evaluated using a variety of histologic and microscopic techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, mortal staining, and paraffin sectioning in an attempt to elucidate the oomycete???s modes of infection and spread. I present {{the results of this study}} as a photographic atlas, which may lead to a better understanding of this phenomenon and suggest alternative methods for control. Although the results of my study do not provide definitive approaches toward controlling oomycete infection, they do contribute to the limited body of information on the incidence of watermold infection in fish eggs.

50|$|H. ligatus worker {{individuals}} experience {{varying levels}} of eusocial behavior and colony organization depending on the environmental conditions. For instance, under harsher environmental conditions, there is more classical eusocial behavior. Therefore, the reproductive efforts of workers are generally focused on assisting the queen to raise the queen’s reproductive offspring by tending to <b>eggs,</b> <b>cleaning</b> the facility, and foraging for food and water. However, under gentler environmental conditions, there is a reduction in overall eusociality.

50|$|Preventative action {{revolves}} around personal hygiene and the cleanliness {{of the living}} quarters. The rate of reinfection can be reduced through hygienic measures, and this is recommended especially in recurring cases.The main measures are keeping fingernails short, and washing and scrubbing hands and fingers carefully, especially after defecation and before meals. Under ideal conditions, bed covers, sleeping garments, and hand towels should be changed daily. Simple laundering of clothes and linen disinfects them. Children should wear gloves while asleep, and the bedroom floor should be kept clean. Food should be covered to limit contamination with dust-borne parasite eggs. Household detergents have {{little effect on the}} viability of pinworm <b>eggs,</b> and <b>cleaning</b> the bathroom with a damp cloth moistened with an antibacterial agent or bleach will merely spread the still-viable eggs. Similarly, shaking clothes and bed linen will detach and spread the eggs.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the use}} of ultrasonic vibration as an aid to the dilute acid method of <b>cleaning</b> <b>eggs.</b> It is expected that ultrasonics could increase the efficiency of cleaning by reducing the length of time the eggs are exposed to the acid solution. To determine whether ultrasonics could be beneficial, penetration of the cleaning solution into the egg, shell thickness, shell cleanliness, interior quality, and microbial, organoleptic, and functional properties were measured. Shell penetration was less, as a result of ultrasonic vibration, when the egg and acetic acid solution were the same temperature (22 C) at time of washing than when the eggs were 22 C and the solution was either 12 or 32 C. When <b>egg</b> and <b>cleaning</b> solution were 22 C, no cleaning solution penetrated the shell after 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 sec of exposure but penetration increased after 160 and 320 sec of exposure. No differences (P>. 05) in shell thickness resulted from cleaning in 1, 2, or 3 % acetic acid with ultrasonic vibration for 30, 60, 120, and 240 sec, and the shell thickness of eggs so treated did not differ (P>. 05) from that of commercially washed eggs. All three solutions produced clean eggs at each exposure time, and their cleanliness was comparable to that of commercially washed eggs. No differences (P>. 05) in Haugh units were caused by length of exposure to the cleaning solution and by exposure to ultrasonics. After 4 weeks storage at 22 C only eggs exposed to ultrasonics in the 1 % solution had lower (P. 05) were found to have been caused by ultrasonic vibration during washing with 3 % acetic acid...|$|R

25|$|European earwigs overwinter about 5mm {{below the}} surface of the ground. The female earwig lays a clutch of about 50 eggs in an {{underground}} nest in the autumn. She enters a dormant state and stays in the nest with the eggs. The female cares for her young by shifting the <b>eggs</b> about and <b>cleaning</b> them to avoid fungal growth. In the spring, she spreads them out into a single layer and the young emerge from the eggs. She guards them until they reach maturity after about one month. It is possible for the female to lay a second brood in one season and by the end of August all of the young reach maturity.|$|R

The Kinect is a new, exciting technology that provides integrated depth sensors to interact with 3 D virtual environment. Moreover, the hardware price (including the Kinect sensor and PC/laptop) is affordable to many rehabilitation centres and home-users. Adopting the latest technology, this project aims at developing new training algorithms in order to benefit the elderly and persons with motor disability after stroke for {{rehabilitation and}} improvement of their quality of life. The project developed a software platform with three rehabilitation games that offers coordinated upper limb exercise, lower limb exercise and trunk balance training tasks such as making <b>egg</b> tart, <b>cleaning</b> the window panels of a tram, and even killing cockroaches. It also supports multi-players, and the platform is free for the public. During the training, 3 D information of body segments could be captured and further analyzed by using our evaluation platform, such as range of motion and quality of motor control. Thus, our system can promote healthy ageing and interactive rehabilitation training at home, hospitals and elderly centres.|$|R
5|$|In some {{parenting}} species, young from {{a previous}} spawning batch may stay with their parents and help care for the new young. This is known to occur in around 19 species of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika. These helpers take part in <b>cleaning</b> and fanning <b>eggs</b> and larvae, <b>cleaning</b> the breeding hole and protecting the territory. They have reduced growth rate but gain protection from predators. Brood parasitism also exists among teleosts; minnows may spawn in sunfish nests as well as nests of other minnow species. The cuckoo catfish is known for laying eggs on the substrate as mouthbrooding cichclids collect theirs and the young catfish will eat the cichlid larvae. Filial cannibalism occurs in some teleost families and may have evolved to combat starvation.|$|R

25|$|Although {{parthenogenetic}} species do occur, most harvestmen reproduce sexually. Mating involves direct copulation, {{rather than}} the deposition of a spermatophore. The males of some species offer a secretion (nuptial gift) from their chelicerae to the female before copulation. Sometimes, the male guards the female after copulation, and in many species, the males defend territories. In some species, males also exhibit post-copulatory behavior in which the male specifically seeks out and shakes the female's sensory leg. This is believed to entice the female into mating a second time. The females lay eggs from an ovipositor shortly after mating to several months later. Some species build nests for this purpose. A unique feature of harvestmen is that in some species, the male is solely responsible for guarding the eggs resulting from multiple partners, often against egg-eating females, and subjecting the <b>eggs</b> to regular <b>cleaning.</b> Depending on circumstances such as temperature, the eggs may hatch at any time after the first 20 days, up to about half a year after being laid. Harvestmen variously pass through four to eight nymphal instars to reach maturity, with most known species having six instars.|$|R
40|$|Ropalidia rufoplagiata Cameron (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), a polistine {{species from}} penisular India, {{appears to be}} unique among all known primitively eusocial wasps. A total of 33 out of 46 {{identified}} females from an observed colony were found to oviposit on 1 - 17 occasions. No single predominant egg-layer could be identified during the 45 -day period. Of the 17 dissected egg-layers, 12 were mated. All egg-layers showed several oviposition-related behavioural patterns including systematic, but indiscriminate, cannibalism of <b>eggs</b> and larvae, <b>cleaning</b> of empty cells, and guarding of freshly-laid eggs. There was no correlation between the egg-laying activity of the females (whether mated or not), oophagy, and {{their position in the}} dominance hierarchy. All nest-maintenance activities were performed exclusively by the egg-layers, while the non-egg-layers were mainly involved in the extranidal task offoraging. No significant morphometric differences between egg-layers and foragers could be discerned. Almost all the older individuals in the colony were egg-layers, while foragers were mainly younger animals. Such a temporal differentiation in reproductive labour suggests the absence of a permanent reproductive caste in this species.

50|$|Routine {{applications}} of anthelmintic drug seem {{to appeal to}} pig farmers for reasons of convenience (Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999). However, merely resorting to anthelmintic treatment could result in little or no improvement due to continuous reinfection. The use of anthelmintics therefore needs to be complemented by higher quality farm hygiene and more effective farm management practices if one strives to reduce the roundworm infection pressure on the farm.There are numerous aspects of farm management that can {{have a major impact}} on the epidemiology of A. suum. Undoubtedly, the type of production system, stable infrastructure and different management factors like the application of a quarantine for imported pigs, all-in-all-out practice, early weaning, and the efficiency of cleaning protocols will affect Ascaris epidemiology. The type of production system that is in use will be a key factor regarding the infection intensity on a farm (Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999). For obvious reasons, there is a higher diversity of parasite species and higher infection intensity on traditional farms and where pigs have access to outdoor facilities when compared to intensive indoor systems (Lai et al., 2011; Roepstorff and Nansen, 1994). Reducing contact of pigs with their own faecal deposits or from pigs from previous rounds is important. Consequentially, housing of pigs on slatted floors seems to reduce the chance of parasite infestation compared to solid or partially slatted floors (Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990; Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2010; Tielen et al., 1978). Increased risk is associated with bedding being present in the pens. The use of bedding material may provide extra refugia that promote egg embryonation and hamper the effectiveness of repeated cleaning and disinfection measures. Evidently, the stocking density in the pig house will also be important (Tielen et al., 1978), as chances of pens containing pigs with patent infections will increase. Positioning the water supply in the dung area instead of in the lying area or the feeding troughs seems to be associated with a decreased prevalence of A. suum (Roepstorff et al., 1999). Water spillage in areas where eggs are present will enhance the chances for survival of the eggs due to constant humidity. Despite the extremely rigid eggshell, eggs do not embryonate when relative humidity is low, for instance in the dry resting areas in pig pens, or when floor temperatures are lower than 15 °C. Additionally, pig urine also seems to exhibit a strong inhibitory effect on the development of A. suum eggs (Nilsson, 1982). Once in the environment, the eggs will embryonate until the infective larvae are present inside the egg. Only then, the egg is infective for a new host. In a Danish study it was shown that A. suum eggs could embryonate on a pasture within 4-6 weeks during a normal Danish summer (Roepstorff and Murrell, 1997). These results were supported by experiments in laboratory conditions, during which it was observed that, although motile larvae were noticed from 4 weeks post-incubation, an incubation period of at least 6 weeks at room temperature was needed for eggs to become infective in mice (Geenen et al., 1999). When environmental factors like temperature, oxygen availability and relative humidity are suboptimal, the time for larvae to become infective increases (Nilsson, 1982). This is reflected by the fact that white spot levels seem to vary within farms depending on the season. Presumably, the rising temperatures in spring and summer allow the eggs that have overwintered in the stables to massively develop into the infective larval stage, leading to heavier infective environments and subsequently higher liver condemnation rates in summer and early autumn (Lai et al., 2011; Menzies et al., 1994; Nilsson, 1982; Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2012).In intensive indoor systems, the presence of a breeding stock on a farm seems to be associated with a lower chance of A. suum being present on the farm. More often than not, farmers are unaware of the parasite status of the pigs that are bought from external producers. Therefore, importing pigs from piglet producers evidently increases the risk of introducing new infections into the herd. Farmers with fattening herds are advised to buy piglets from larger piglet producers with good management and hygiene (Joachim et al., 2001b) and that were preferably treated prior to delivery. Whether weaners need to be treated at the beginning of fattening or not is open for discussion. However, if their worm-free status cannot be warranted, incoming pigs should be treated upon arrival, hereby reducing the risk of introducing the infection into their herd. Once A. suum is present on the farm, it is easily dispersed over the whole farm through moving animals and dirty materials and boots. Even flies have shown to carry A. suum eggs (Forster et al., 2009).Other management practices like the use of the all-in-all-out system, and early weaning are linked to lower prevalence of A. suum (Joachim et al., 2001b; Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990; Roepstorff et al., 1999; Tielen et al., 1978). In the all-in-all-out production system, pigs are moved into and out of facilities in distinct groups with the hope that, by preventing the commingling of groups, the spread of disease is reduced. This practice also allows for a period of thorough cleaning and disinfecting between subsequent groups of animals. Early weaning of piglets (3-5 weeks) also seems to be associated with a reduced risk of A. suum infection (Roepstorff et al., 1999). However it is likely that this can be attributed to the fact that both these parameters are associated with other factors that are more important for parasite survival, like for instance, the use of more traditional rearing methods or poorer general pen hygiene.Frequent cleaning of the pens, preferably after each round, is indispensable to destroy or reduce the amount of eggs in the environment. Clearly, the presence of rough and uneven surfaces would provide a good microenvironment for egg development and have an impact on the efficiency of cleaning protocols. Joachim et al., (2001) indicated that in older pens, the prevalence of Ascaris infections was significantly higher (63,0%) than in the new pens (27,9%). Moreover, Nilsson (1982) found high number of eggs (up to 3,000 EPG) in the crevices of the floor between the slatted dung area and the resting area of the pen. Approximately half of these eggs appeared to be embryonated. In a study by Beloeil et al., (2003) 31% of the farms surveyed had residual dung in the fattening pens when restocking them with new fattening pigs, a practice, favouring the transmission of A. suum eggs. Even though careful cleaning of the pens with high-pressure water will remove most of the residual dung, it seems ineffective to completely remove all infective eggs (Nilsson, 1982). The use of disinfectants is very effective against bacteria, but is rather ineffective against A. suum <b>eggs.</b> Instead, steam <b>cleaning</b> and drying of the pens is a highly recommended management practice for killing roundworm eggs. These are, however, hard to comply with in practice.Looking to the future, the percentage of Ascaris-favourable production systems is expected to rise due to increasing consumer demand for drug free, biologically grown, free-range pork and the forthcoming implementation of new regulations for increased pig wellbeing. In Denmark for example, sprinkler systems should be applied in the pens of growing pigs and sows to accommodate a daily shower. Moreover, sows should not be tethered and housed in groups in enriched environments (bedding, wallowing) for part of the gestation (Roepstorff et al., 2011a; Thamsborg et al., 2010). As a result, the number of eggs surviving in the pens will increase and with it, the prevalence of Ascaris and other pig parasites (Haugegaard, 2010). Good diagnostic assessments will be necessary to evaluate how these changes in farm management will affect parasite epidemiology.|$|R
