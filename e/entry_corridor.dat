40|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} during the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) site selection process that the Mars Global Reference Atmospheric Model (Mars-GRAM) when used for sensitivity studies for Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) MapYear= 0 and large optical depth values, such as tau= 3, is less than realistic. Mars-GRAM's perturbation modeling capability is commonly used, in a Monte-Carlo mode, to perform high fidelity engineering end-to-end simulations for entry, descent, and landing (EDL). Mars-GRAM 2005 has been validated against Radio Science data, and both nadir and limb data from TES. Traditional Mars-GRAM options for representing the mean atmosphere along <b>entry</b> <b>corridors</b> include: (1) TES mapping year 0, with user-controlled dust optical depth and Mars-GRAM data interpolated from NASA Ames Mars General Circulation Model (MGCM) results driven by selected values of globally-uniform dust optical depth, or (2) TES mapping years 1 and 2, with Mars-GRAM data coming from MGCM results driven by observed TES dust optical depth. From the surface to 80 km altitude, Mars-GRAM is based on NASA Ames MGCM. Above 80 km, Mars-GRAM {{is based on the}} University of Michigan Mars Thermospheric General Circulation Model (MTGCM). MGCM results that were used for Mars-GRAM with MapYear= 0 were from a MGCM run with a fixed value of tau= 3 for the entire year at all locations. This choice of data has led to discrepancies that have become apparent during recent sensitivity studies for MapYear= 0 and large optical depths. Unrealistic energy absorption by time-invariant atmospheric dust leads to an unrealistic thermal energy balance on the polar caps. The outcome is an inaccurate cycle of condensation/sublimation of the polar caps and, as a consequence, an inaccurate cycle of total atmospheric mass and global-average surface pressure. Under an assumption of unchanged temperature profile and hydrostatic equilibrium, a given percentage change in surface pressure would produce a corresponding percentage change in density at all altitudes. Consequently, the final result of a change in surface pressure is an imprecise atmospheric density at all altitudes...|$|R

5000|$|The {{simplest}} axisymmetric {{shape is}} the sphere or spherical section. This {{can either be}} a complete sphere or a spherical section forebody with a converging conical afterbody. The aerodynamics of a sphere or spherical section are easy to model analytically using Newtonian impact theory.

[...] The static stability of a spherical section is assured if the vehicle's center of mass is upstream {{from the center of}} curvature (dynamic stability is more problematic). Pure spheres have no lift. However, by flying at an angle of attack, a spherical section has modest aerodynamic lift thus providing some cross-range capability and widening its <b>entry</b> <b>corridor.</b> In the late 1950s and early 1960s, high-speed computers were not yet available and computational fluid dynamics was still embryonic.

During this time, the ship spent at least two extended periods on Yankee Station, the longest being 45 days, due to mechanical problems with the carrier that was to relieve her. A pleasant break {{in the lives of}} Rangers crew came {{with the arrival of the}} Bob Hope show on 24 December 1969. Upon leaving Yankee after one tour and on the way to Sasebo, Ranger was ordered to stand off the coast of Korea for three days due to North Korea forcing down a US C-130 and holding the crew. Initially, Ranger was to leave the line on Yankee Station for a week of R&R in Subic Bay while offloading supplies, then to Japan and on to Australia and home. A day before Ranger was to leave the line she was ordered to hold on station and fly the first sorties on Cambodia. Finally leaving Yankee Station, Ranger made a fast three-day offload in Subic Bay and a two-day port call in Sasebo and back to Alameda, arriving 1 June. Ranger spent the rest of the summer engaged in operations off the west coast, departing for her sixth WestPac cruise in late October 1970. On 10 March 1971, Ranger, along with , set a record of 233 strike sorties for one day in action against North Vietnam. [...] During April, the three carriers assigned to Task Force 77 - Ranger, Kitty Hawk, and [...] - provided a constant two-carrier posture on Yankee Station.

50|$|The {{discovery}} of the Head of Nefertem is controversial, since Howard Carter did not document the piece in his excavation journal. The Head was found in 1924 by Pierre Lacau and Rex Engelbach in KV4 (the tomb of Ramses XI), which {{was used as a}} storehouse, among the bottles in a box of red wine. At this time, Carter was not in Egypt on account of the strike and closure of Tutankhamun's tomb and the withdrawal or cancellation of the excavation license of Lord Carnarvon's widow Lady Almina. Carter later stated that he had found the head among the rubble in the <b>entry</b> <b>corridor</b> of KV62. In his first season of excavations, the head was not mentioned; at the time Carter only noted partially broken and full-standing alabaster vessels and vases of painted clay in the entrance-way.

These facts not only led to further disputes in the study of Egyptian antiquities, but also aroused the suspicion in some quarters to this day that Carter had attempted to steal the head.|$|E

Herbert built the Exton with grouping of bedrooms on alternate floors with the public <b>corridors,</b> <b>entries,</b> and living space on the floor below. The method behind this was the advantage of the use of skip-stop elevator. This reduces the capital and maintenance costs of the public areas by half. The use of the duplex plan allowed Herbert to eliminate long public corridors, private halls, and passageways. All rooms have direct access to one central stair hall. Grouped around the central service stacks were the kitchen and baths, that permitted economical structure. The apartment has a reinforced concrete structure, the elevators are flanked by fire towers, and there is sound insulation provided by the double walls between each unit and public spaces.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{need for}} impromptu {{wireless}} networks arises in emergency {{situations where the}} team responding to the emergency, needs to deploy sensors (such as motion sensors, or even imaging sensors) and a wireless interconnection network, without any prior planning or knowledge of the terrain. In this paper, we consider a simple model for the sequential deployment of wireless relays as a person steps along a “corridor ” of unknown length, so as to create a multihop network for interconnecting a sensor to be placed {{at the end of}} the corridor with a control truck standing near the <b>entry</b> to the <b>corridor.</b> Assuming low traffic and simple link-by-link scheduling, we consider the problem of minimising an end-to-end cost metric (e. g., delay or power from the sensor to the control centre) subject to a constraint on the number of relays. Two kinds of constraints are considered: the expected number of relays is bounded, or the actual number of relays is bounded. In each case, the problem is formulated as a Markov decision process. The problem of deciding whether or not to place a relay at each step is shown to be equivalent to a certain stochastic shortest path problem embedded at relay placement points. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the performance trade-offs. I...|$|R
