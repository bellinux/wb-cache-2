The titers of antibody directed to the 4 -azoquinoline 1 -oxide group were followed {{during the course of}} immunization by passive hemagglutination. 2 -Mercaptoethanol(2 ME) -sensitive antibody to the haptenic group was produced earlier and 2 ME-resistant one appeared later. Higher anti-hapten antibody titers were obtained by immunization with DRSP than with DBSA or DBaA. Therefore, rabbit and mouse anti-DRSP antibodies were employed for immunochemical studies. Anti-bodies to DRSP formed specific precipitates with DBSA. This precipitation reaction was inhibited by carcinogenic 4 -hydroxyaminoquinoline 1 -oxide (4 HAQO), 4 -nitro-quinoline 1 -oxide (4 NQO), non-carcinogenic 4 -aminoquinoline 1 -oxide (4 AQ 0), and 4 -aminoquinoline (4 AQ). The cross-reactivity of these hapten derivatives with anti- 4 -azoquinoline 1 -oxide antibodies was in the following order: 4 HAQ 0 > 4 NQO> 4 AQO> 4 AQ.

40|$|Over 50 % of all {{colorants}} {{which are}} used nowdays are azo dyes and pigments, and among them arylazo pyridone dyes (and pigments) have became of interest in last several decades due to the high molar extinction coefficient, and the medium to high light and wet fastness properties. They find application generally as disperse dyes. The importance of disperse dyes increased in the 1970 s and 1980 s due {{to the use of}} polyester and nylon as the main synthetic fibers. Also, disperse dyes were used rapidly since 1970 in inks for the heat-transfer printing of polyester. The main synthetic route for the preparation of azo dyes is coupling reaction between an aromatic diazo compound and a coupling component. Of all dyes manufactured, about 60 % are produced by this reaction. Arylazo pyridone dyes can be prepared from pyridone moiety as a coupling component, where substituent can be on nitrogen, and diazonim salts which can be derived from different substituted anilines or other heterocyclic derivatives. In addition, arylazo dyes containing pyridone ring can be prepared from arylazo diketones or arylazo ketoesters (obtained by coupling β-diketones or β-ketoesters with diazonim salts) by condensation with cyanoacetamide. Disazo dyes can be prepared by tetrazotizing a dianiline and coupling it with a pyridone or by <b>diazotizing</b> aniline and coupling it with a dipyridone. Trisazo dyes can be also prepared by <b>diazotizing</b> of aniline and coupling it with a tripyridone or by hexazotizing a trianiline and coupling it with a pyridone. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} give a brief review on the synthesis of arylazo pyridone dyes due to the lack of such reviews. In addition, some properties of arylazo pyridone dyes as light fastness and azo-hydrazon tautomerism are disccused...|$|E
40|$|Six monoazo {{acid and}} {{disperse}} dyes were synthesized using compounds of aromatic amine by <b>diazotizing</b> sulphanilic acid, 4 -nitroaniline, sulphanilic acid, and 3 -aminophenol. The coupling components used were 1 -naphthol and 2 -naphthol. The different {{properties of the}} dyes such as molecular structure, molar extinction coefficient, and percentage exhaustion were determined. The thermodynamic parameters of the four dyes on nylon fabrics were also determined. The {{results showed that the}} dyes have very good extinction coefficient, thus can be of commercial significance. The standard affinities of the dyes on nylon varied between 8. 59 kJmol- 1 to 25. 51 kJmol- 1 implying very high equilibrium % exhaustion. The implication of the standard affinities is that dye with-∆µ 0 25. 51 kJmol- 1 has the highest % exhaustion, which means that there are correlation between standard affinity of a dye on fabric and the equilibrium exhaustion...|$|E

40|$|The {{reduction}} of <b>diazotized</b> aromatic amines {{has been observed}} to occur at the drop-ping mercury electrode. The reduction is irreversible and the polarographic waves are too complex to treat with electrochemical equations. Nevertheless distinct waves whose heights vary directly with concentration are obtained. One wave of the reduction occurs at a potential well below that of the azo or nitro groups or nitrite ion.

40|$|Across many environments, nitrate (NO_ 3 ^-) is an {{important}} form of N available for microorganisms and photosynthetic organisms. Accurate NO_ 3 ^- measurements are important for examining N cycling and retention in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, but a common method of NO_ 3 ^- analysis can underestimate NO_ 3 ^- concentrations when soluble iron is present (iron > 10  mg L[*]−[*] 1). The basic method is robust, using copperized cadmium to reduce NO_ 3 ^- and then <b>diazotizing</b> the resulting NO_ 2 ^- in a two-step process to form an easily measured colored product. We show that iron interference is unique to using an NH 4 Cl and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer. We hypothesize that interference is through iron-catalyzed reduction of the intermediate color product, a diazonium ion. We examine three historical buffers as alternatives to NH 4 Cl/EDTA and recommend replacement of EDTA with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, which chelates metals much like EDTA, but unlike EDTA, it does not cause interference {{in the presence of}} iron...|$|E

3000|$|Further, the {{construction}} triazole ring on 15 to provide 16 comprises diazotization reaction followed by cyclization. The reported reactions for diazotization (NaNO 2 -acetic acid) involve highly acidic {{conditions that are}} found to be not suitable as it leads to deprotection compound 15 and formation of other unknown impurities which are difficult to remove. The alternative <b>diazotizing</b> agents such as alkyl nitrite (isoamyl nitrite in bromoform) is not suitable for diazotization on an industrial scale, since they are expensive, decompose during storage, corrosive and requires exclusively organic medium (ether, acetonitrile, THF, etc.,). Diazonium salts obtained under classical conditions are potentially explosive substances and thus need a very safer mechanism to handle in the plant scale. Diazotization using cation exchange resin along with mild acidic reagent such as P-toluene sulphonicacid (TsOH) with sodium nitrite in acetonitrile and water mixture releases brown fumes of gaseous nitrogen oxide which is again not safe in the production environment (Filimonov et al. 2008; Gorlushko et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2010; Moon et al. 2010).
