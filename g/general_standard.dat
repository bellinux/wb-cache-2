5|$|By the 1890s {{food was}} still very limited in variety, with few vegetables. Porridge was given for breakfast, usually too fluid or overly solid, and the <b>general</b> <b>standard</b> of the prison's food was quite low, {{particularly}} in 1897 and 1898.

There is also no indication how often sapa was added or in what quantity.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of the Anarchy, in which the Empress Matilda and Stephen fought for control of England, Southampton was held by William le Gros, the Bishop of Winchester and a {{supporter}} of Stephen. When Henry II came to the throne in 1153, he took back Southampton and carried out improvements to the castle, as part of his attempt to improve the <b>general</b> <b>standard</b> of security in the south. By {{the second half of the}} 12th century, Southampton was increasingly important for coastal defence and as a base for operations on the continent. Following the threat of French invasion in the 1170s, Henry II invested modest additional resources in the castle, but no efforts were undertaken to improve the town's ditches and banks.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} expansion was secured by monetary stability, moderate protectionism and government support of production. Foreign trade doubled between 1900 and 1910, wages rose, and the <b>general</b> <b>standard</b> of living went up. Nevertheless, the period was also marked by social dislocations. There {{was a sharp}} increase in the frequency and duration of industrial action, with major labour strikes in 1904, 1906 and 1908.|$|E

Ever {{since the end of the}} nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society.

25|$|Grove {{focused the}} College's {{attention}} on two main activities: practical training and examining. He {{was determined to}} raise the <b>general</b> <b>standard</b> of orchestral playing by replacing the existing ad hoc methods of apprentice-based training, private lessons, or study abroad. His second focus, examination, followed the Victorian trend to form professional bodies regulating and standardising the activity of members of each profession. An example is the Institution of Civil Engineers to which Grove had been admitted in 1839. When the Royal Charter establishing the College was being drawn up, Grove ensured that, unlike the Royal Academy, the College should have degree-awarding powers. Mackenzie, seeing the prospect that the new institution would overshadow the Academy, successfully proposed that both bodies should award qualifications jointly. Grove agreed, realising that this course would do much to dispel the damaging hostility that existed between the Academy and the College.|$|E
25|$|Averaging {{more than}} 30 {{points per game}} every season, Galis was the indisputable leader of Aris. Playing {{alongside}} other great players at Aris such as Panagiotis Giannakis and Slobodan Subotić (who was known in Greece as Lefteris Soumpotits), Galis won 8 Greek League championships (7 of them consecutively, and 3 undefeated, in the years 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991), 6 Greek Cups (4 of them consecutively, in the years 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992), and led Aris to 3 consecutive appearances at the FIBA European Champions' Cup Final Four ('88, '89, and '90). In the one disappointment of an otherwise glittering career with Aris, all three FIBAEuropean Champions' Cup appearances ended in defeat in the semifinals, thus depriving Galis {{of the opportunity to}} shine all the way on Europe's biggest club, stage at the FIBA European Champions' Cup Finals. The team's performances and <b>general</b> <b>standard</b> of play, however, won the heart of most every basketball fan in Greece. Indeed, cinemas and theaters would often reduce their admission prices on Thursday evenings, when Aris was playing, and the entire country settled down to watch them on television.|$|E

500|$|The {{curriculum}} {{during the}} 17th and 18th centuries {{is not known}} for certain. In 1714 the trustees agreed that the pupils should attend church services at St Denys' Church six days a week; whether this was adhered to is not clear. Religious practice was a stipulation in the 1835 decree, which required pupils to pray at the start and end of each day and engage in daily readings of holy scriptures. However, the emphasis was always on classical education, which likely required instruction in Latin from the earliest times; in 1835, learning the classics was enshrined as the school's primary purpose. In the mid-19th century, Carre's offered this classical education for free, but arithmetic, geometry and algebra were taught as extras {{at a rate of}} two guineas per term. Students were enrolled from the age of eight, and were expected to be able to read, write, recite the Lord's Prayer, the Apostles' Creed and the Ten Commandments, and [...] "be qualified to begin Latin grammar". Students had to supply their own equipment, except pens and ink, which were covered by a 10 shilling payment made each term to the school. The school's inspection in 1865 mentions geography and history teaching, although the <b>general</b> <b>standard</b> of attainment was low.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of the <b>general</b> <b>standards</b> portion of the certification training program for commercial pesticide applicators in Nebraska. Specific objectives were to make determinations of: (1) changes in participant attitudes and in their pesticide storage, handling and use practice; (2) knowledge gain, if any, attributable to training; and (3) the relationship between selected demographic characteristics and scores on pretraining and posttraining tests. ^ Study participants were 475 applicators who attended Cooperative Extension Service training in March 1980 at Lincoln, Grand Island, North Platte, Scottsbluff, Omaha and Norfolk, Nebraska. ^ Demographic, attitudinal and practices data were collected before training. Posttraining attitudinal and practices data were collected by mail survey approximately 10 months later from participants who had qualified for certification. ^ Half of the participants received pretraining matrix knowledge pretests. T-tests, analysis of variance and Duncan 2 ̆ 7 s multiple range test were used to analyze pretest and EPA <b>General</b> <b>Standards</b> Test (posttest) results. <b>General</b> <b>Standards</b> Test scores achieved by the pretested group were not significantly different from those of the nonpretested group. <b>General</b> <b>Standards</b> Test scores of both groups were significantly higher than the pretest mean. Significant differences were found between pretest and <b>General</b> <b>Standards</b> Test scores of participants trained and tested at Lincoln when compared to those at other sites. Participant educational attainment also was positively correlated with scores on both tests. ^ Most certification candidates were high school graduates, relatively inexperienced as commercial pesticide applicators, and had spent little time preparing for certification training. ^ Comparison of the two attitude surveys showed attitudes less positive after training. Perceptions of the Environmental Protection Agency declined most sharply. ^ Practices and procedures relating to following label directions, pesticide container disposal and equipment calibration and maintenance reportedly improved after training. Howver, inconsistencies and contradictions in responses led to the conclusion that applicators may have given 2 ̆ 2 expected 2 ̆ 2 or perceived 2 ̆ 2 correct 2 ̆ 2 answers. ...|$|R
