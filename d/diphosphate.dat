5|$|Prenol lipids are {{synthesized}} {{from the}} five-carbon-unit precursors isopentenyl <b>diphosphate</b> and dimethylallyl <b>diphosphate</b> that are produced mainly via the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway. The simple isoprenoids (linear alcohols, diphosphates, etc.) are {{formed by the}} successive addition of C5 units, and are classified according to number of these terpene units. Structures containing greater than 40 carbons are known as polyterpenes. Carotenoids are important simple isoprenoids that function as antioxidants and as precursors of vitamin A. Another biologically important class of molecules is exemplified by the quinones and hydroquinones, which contain an isoprenoid tail attached to a quinonoid core of non-isoprenoid origin. Vitamin E and vitamin K, {{as well as the}} ubiquinones, are examples of this class. Prokaryotes synthesize polyprenols (called bactoprenols) in which the terminal isoprenoid unit attached to oxygen remains unsaturated, whereas in animal polyprenols (dolichols) the terminal isoprenoid is reduced.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium oxides are basic; they easily {{convert to}} {{hydroxides}} and can form various salts, such as sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, etc. The nitrate is usually white {{but can be}} brown due to radiolytic decomposition. Heating the nitrate in air at 400°C converts it to the white protactinium pentoxide. The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO3)4 can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaF2SO4 with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) under inert gas atmosphere. Heating the product to about 900°C eliminates the reaction by-products such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes Pa(PO3)4 into the <b>diphosphate</b> PaP2O7, which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides. In the <b>diphosphate,</b> the PO3 groups form pyramids of C2v symmetry. Heating PaP2O7 in air to 1400°C decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium.|$|E
5|$|Polysaccharides and glycans {{are made}} by the {{sequential}} addition of monosaccharides by glycosyltransferase from a reactive sugar-phosphate donor such as uridine <b>diphosphate</b> glucose (UDP-glucose) to an acceptor hydroxyl group on the growing polysaccharide. As any of the hydroxyl groups on the ring of the substrate can be acceptors, the polysaccharides produced can have straight or branched structures. The polysaccharides produced can have structural or metabolic functions themselves, or be transferred to lipids and proteins by enzymes called oligosaccharyltransferases.|$|E

In baking, calcium monophosphate is used as a leavening agent. Calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant, calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and calcium acetate is a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.|$|E
5|$|The {{most ancient}} polyadenylating enzyme is polynucleotide phosphorylase. This enzyme {{is part of}} both the {{bacterial}} degradosome and the archaeal exosome, two closely related complexes that recycle RNA into nucleotides. This enzyme degrades RNA by attacking the bond between the 3'-most nucleotides with a phosphate, breaking off a <b>diphosphate</b> nucleotide. This reaction is reversible, and so the enzyme can also extend RNA with more nucleotides. The heteropolymeric tail added by polynucleotide phosphorylase is very rich in adenine. The choice of adenine is most likely the result of higher ADP concentrations than other nucleotides {{as a result of}} using ATP as an energy currency, making it more likely to be incorporated in this tail in early lifeforms. It has been suggested that the involvement of adenine-rich tails in RNA degradation prompted the later evolution of polyadenylate polymerases (the enzymes that produce poly(A) tails with no other nucleotides in them).|$|E

25|$|Terpenoids are biosynthesized {{from two}} 5-carbon precursors, isopentenyl <b>diphosphate</b> (IPP) and dimethylallyl <b>diphosphate</b> (DMAPP). The NMR and MS study by Zjawiony {{suggested}} that the biosynthesis of salvinorin A proceeds via the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate pathway. In the deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate, the intermediates of the glycolysis, are converted into 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate via decarboxylation. Subsequent reduction with NADPH generates 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate, via the intermediates 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol and 4-diphosphocytidyl-2c-methyl-d-erythritol-2-phosphate, which then lead to IPP and DMAPP.|$|E
25|$|More specifically, the {{biosynthesis}} of (−)-menthol {{takes place}} in the secretory gland cells of the peppermint plant.

(−)-Limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH), using O2 and NADPH, then catalyzes the allylic hydroxylation of (−)-limonene at the 3 position to (−)-trans-isopiperitenol. (−)-Trans-isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (iPD) further oxidizes the hydroxy group on the 3 position using NAD+ to make (−)-isopiperitenone. (−)-Isopiperitenone reductase (iPR) then reduces the double bond between carbons 1 and 2 using NADPH to form (+)-cis-isopulegone. (+)-Cis-isopulegone isomerase (iPI) then isomerizes the remaining double bond to form (+)-pulegone. (+)-Pulegone reductase (PR) then reduces this double bond using NADPH to form (−)-menthone. (−)-Menthone reductase (MR) then reduces the carbonyl group using NADPH to form (−)-menthol.|$|E

25|$|Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), {{also known}} as {{ribonucleoside}} <b>diphosphate</b> reductase (rNDP), is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides.

Furthermore, RNR plays a critical role in regulating the total rate of DNA synthesis so that DNA to cell mass is maintained at a constant ratio during cell division and DNA repair. A somewhat unusual feature of the RNR enzyme is that it catalyzes a reaction that proceeds via a free radical mechanism of action. The substrates for RNR are ADP, GDP, CDP and UDP. dTDP (deoxythymidine <b>diphosphate)</b> is synthesized by another enzyme (thymidylate kinase) from dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate).|$|E

25|$|ATP is the {{phosphorylated}} {{version of}} adenosine <b>diphosphate</b> (ADP), which stores energy {{in a cell}} and powers most cellular activities. ATP is the energized form, while ADP is the (partially) depleted form. NADP+ is an electron carrier which ferries high energy electrons. In the light reactions, it gets reduced, meaning it picks up electrons, becoming NADPH.|$|E
50|$|However, {{phosphates}} {{are most}} {{commonly found in}} the form of adenosine phosphates (AMP, ADP, and ATP) and in DNA and RNA, and can be released by the hydrolysis of ATP or ADP. Similar reactions exist for the other nucleoside <b>diphosphates</b> and triphosphates. Phosphoanhydride bonds in ADP and ATP, or other nucleoside <b>diphosphates</b> and triphosphates, contain high amounts of energy which give them their vital role in all living organisms.

Compounds such as substituted phosphines have uses in organic chemistry, but do not seem to have any natural counterparts.|$|R
50|$|In {{all known}} organisms, the Deoxyribonucleotides {{that make up}} DNA are {{synthesized}} {{by the action of}} ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzymes on their corresponding ribonucleotides. These enzymes reduce the sugar residue from ribose to deoxyribose by removing oxygen from the 2′ hydroxyl group; the substrates are ribonucleoside <b>diphosphates</b> and the products deoxyribonucleoside <b>diphosphates</b> (the latter are denoted dADP, dCDP, dGDP, and dUDP respectively.) All ribonucleotide reductase enzymes use a common sulfhydryl radical mechanism reliant on reactive cysteine residues that oxidize to form disulfide bonds {{in the course of the}} reaction.

25|$|A {{catabolic pathway}} {{is a series}} of {{reactions}} that bring about a net release of energy {{in the form of a}} high energy phosphate bond formed with the energy carriers Adenosine <b>Diphosphate</b> (ADP) and Guanosine <b>Diphosphate</b> (GDP) to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), respectively. The net reaction is, therefore, thermodynamically favorable, for it results in a lower free energy for the final products. A catabolic pathway is an exergonic system that produces chemical energy in the form of ATP, GTP, NADH, NADPH, FADH2, etc. from energy containing sources such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The end products are often carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia. Coupled with an endergonic reaction of anabolism, the cell can synthesize new macromolecules using the original precursors of the anabolic pathway. An example of a coupled reaction is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to form the intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by the enzyme phsophofructokinase accompanied by the hydrolysis of ATP in the pathway of glycolysis. The resulting chemical reaction within the metabolic pathway is highly thermodynamically favorable and, as a result, irreversible in the cell.|$|E
