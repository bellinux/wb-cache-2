5|$|Difficulties {{arise in}} tracing {{the history of}} design {{management}}. Even though design management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964, earlier contributions created {{the context in which}} the expression could arise. Throughout its history, design management was influenced by a number of different disciplines: architecture, <b>industrial</b> <b>design,</b> management, software development, engineering; and movements such as system theory, design methodologies. It cannot be attributed directly to either design nor to management.|$|E

Therefore once they are officially registered, all the <b>industrial</b> <b>designs</b> in the world are under the protection of certain laws and regulations for a certain amount of time.

5|$|Absent Miyamoto's direction, the {{development}} team used elements new and {{inconsistent with the}} series as Super Mario Land shrunk elements of the series to fit the portable device's small screen. Yokoi, the head of R, served as producer, and Satoru Okada served as director. They had previously developed Metroid (1986) and Kid Icarus (1986) together, and the two subsequently designed the Game Boy—Yokoi on its <b>industrial</b> <b>design,</b> and Okada on its engineering. Their Super Mario Land was planned as the portable console's showcase title until Henk Rogers brought Tetris to Nintendo of America and convinced Minoru Arakawa that the addictive computer game would help Nintendo reach the largest audience. The company subsequently chose to bundle Tetris with every Game Boy purchase.|$|E
5|$|Unlike unique {{sciences}} such as mathematics, the perspective, activity, or {{discipline of}} design is not {{brought to a}} generally accepted common denominator. The historical beginnings of design are complex {{and the nature of}} design is still the subject of ongoing discussion. In design, there are strong differentiations between theory and practice. The fluid nature of the theory allows the designer to operate without being constrained by a rigid structure. In practice, decisions are often referred to as intuition. In his Classification of Design (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes. Design management operates in and across all three classes: product (e.g. <b>industrial</b> <b>design,</b> packaging design, service design), information (e.g. graphic design, branding, media design, web design), and environment (e.g. retail design, exhibition design, interior design).|$|E
5|$|Pick's {{interest}} in design {{led to his}} involvement in the founding, in 1915, of the Design and Industries Association. The organisation aimed to bring manufacturers and designers together {{to improve the quality of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>design.</b> Through his improvements in the UERL's advertising and branding, Pick was considered by many of its members to be taking a practical lead in achieving the organisation's aims and he was soon lecturing on the subject, giving talks during 1916 and 1917 at the Art Workers Guild in London, at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh and elsewhere. After the First World War, Pick continued to give talks regularly and published articles on design. He also began to set out his ideas on reconstruction and town planning, an area of design he became interested in through its connection to transport planning. He wrote and lectured extensively on this subject during the 1920s and 1930s including presenting a 14,000 word paper to the Institute of Transport in 1927 and addressing the International Housing and Town Planning Congress in 1939. Concerned about the uncontrolled and unchecked growth of London, partly facilitated by the new lines that London Underground was building, Pick was a strong supporter of the need for a green belt around the capital to maintain open space within reach of urban areas.|$|E

5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the <b>industrial</b> <b>design</b> consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become {{president and chief executive}} of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided that the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a screwdriver. To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a 2-way design.|$|E
5|$|Vkhutemas {{was a close}} {{parallel}} to the German Bauhaus in its intent, organization and scope. The two schools {{were the first to}} train artist-designers in a modern manner. Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a Basic Course in aesthetic principles, courses in color theory, <b>industrial</b> <b>design,</b> and architecture. Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus, but it was less publicised and consequently, is less familiar to the West. Vkhutemas's influence was expansive however—the school exhibited two structures by faculty and award-winning student work at the 1925 Exposition in Paris. Furthermore, Vkhutemas attracted the interest and several visits from the director of the Museum of Modern Art, Alfred Barr. With the internationalism of modern architecture and design, there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus. The second Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools, while Hinnerk Scheper of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture. In addition, El Lissitzky's book Russia – an Architecture for World Revolution published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects. Both schools flourished in a relatively liberal period, and were closed under pressure from increasingly totalitarian regimes.|$|E
