40|$|Three {{methods were}} {{utilized}} to analyze {{key components of}} slow-speed, large-bore, natural gas integral engines. These three methods included the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), dynamic modal analysis using finite element analysis (FEA), and a stress analysis method also using FEA. The CFD analysis focuses primarily on the fuel mixing in the combustion chamber of a TLA engine. Results indicate {{a significant increase in}} the homogeneity of the air and fuel using high-pressure fuel injection (HPFI) instead of standard low-pressure mechanical gas admission valve (MGAV). A modal analysis of three engine crankshafts (TLA- 6, HBA- 6, and GMV- 10) is developed and presented. Results indicate that each crankshaft has a natural frequency and corresponding speed that is well away from the typical engine operating speed. A frame stress analysis method is also developed and presented. Two different crankcases are examined. A TLA- 6 crankcase is modeled and a stress analysis is performed. The method of dynamic load determination, model setup, and the results from the stress analysis are discussed. Preliminary results indicate a 10 %- 15 % maximum increase in frame stress due to a 20 % increase in HP. However, the high stress regions were localized. A new hydraulically actuated mechanical fuel valve is also developed and presented. This valve provides equivalent high-energy (supersonic) fuel injection comparable to a HPFI system, at 1 / 5 th of the natural gas <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure.</b> This <b>valve</b> was developed in cooperation with the Dresser-Rand Corporation...|$|R

5000|$|In {{a common}} rail system, the fuel from {{the fuel tank}} is {{supplied}} to the common header (called the accumulator). This fuel is then sent through tubing to the injectors, which inject it into the combustion chamber. The header has a high <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> to maintain the pressure in the header and return the excess fuel to the fuel tank. The fuel is sprayed {{with the help of}} a nozzle that is opened and closed with a needle valve, operated with a solenoid. When the solenoid is not activated, the spring forces the needle valve into the nozzle passage and prevents the injection of fuel into the cylinder.

40|$|Background: Sophisticated shunt valves {{provide the}} {{possibility}} of pressure adjustment and antisiphon control but {{have a higher probability}} of valve dysfunction especially in a posthemorrhagic setting. The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinical outcome of patients with shunt dependent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus after aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in order to identify patients who would benefit from a simple differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve.</b> Methods: From 2000 to 2013, 547 patients with aneurysmatic SAH were treated at our institution, 114 underwent ventricular shunt placement (21. 1 %). 47 patients with available pre- and post-operative computed tomography scans, and an available follow-up of minimum 6 months were included. In order to measure the survival time which a nonprogrammable differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> would have had in an individual patient we defined the initial equalized shunt survival time (IESS). IESS is the time until surgical revisions of fixed differential <b>pressure</b> or flow-regulated <b>valves</b> for the treatment of over- or under-drainage as well as re-programming of adjustable valves due to over- or under-drainage. Results: Twenty patients were treated with fixed differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves,</b> 15 patients were treated with flow-regulated valves, and 12 underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement with differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves</b> assisted by a gravitational unit. Patients who reacted with remarkable changes of the ventricular width after the insertion of external ventricular drainage (EVD), before shunt placement, showed a significantly longer IESS. Conclusions: Decline of the ventricular width after EVD placement was a predictor for successful VP shunt therapy in the later course of disease. Possibly, this could allow identifying patients who benefit from a simple differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> or a flow-regulated valve, and thus could possibly avoid valve-associated complications of a programmable valve in the later course of disease...|$|R

5|$|Upfront, Vettel {{had reduced}} {{the gap between}} himself and Alonso to one second by lap50 as the pair {{continued}} to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit {{and drove to the}} pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) in the space of nine laps. Vettel continued to pressure race-leader Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars. Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap, with the latter spinning around in front of the Toro Rosso, who was quick to avoid a head-on collision. Kovalainen's car suffered a cracked <b>fuel</b> tank <b>pressure</b> release <b>valve</b> and he limped back to the pit lane, the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns. Kovalainen aborted the pit entry, but did not make it much further as his car was consumed by the fire. Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and got out of his car to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team handed him a fire extinguisher. As Kovalainen was off the racing line, yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment.|$|R

40|$|Proportional {{pressure}} regulators are usually used in different automation processes where continuous pressure or force control is required.
