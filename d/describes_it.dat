5|$|Back at FBI headquarters, Scully {{testifies to}} Skinner that she {{believes}} Mulder is mentally sound and fit for duty, noting that Pincus {{and several others}} mysteriously disappeared, {{that there was an}} intruder in Mulder's room, and that Backus did have some sort of chemical in his system. Afterward she tells Mulder that she said it was Folie à deux, and <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> as 'a madness shared by two'. But she does not specify who the two were.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also found}} in brackish-water {{habitats}} and is sometimes seen swimming in salt water. It has been much more successful at colonizing Atlantic and Gulf coast barrier islands than the copperhead. However, even on these islands, it tends to favor freshwater marshes. A study by Dunson and Freda (1985) <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> as not being particularly salt-tolerant.|$|E
50|$|The crested {{chameleon}} {{was first}} described by Stutchbury in 1837. In 1865, Gray <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as the Pterosaurus cristatus. Werner <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as the Chamaeleon cristatus in 1911, and Mertens <b>described</b> <b>it</b> in 1966 as Chamaeleo cristatus. Klaver and Böhme <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as Chamaeleo (Trioceros) cristatus in 1986, and Necas <b>described</b> <b>it</b> {{under the same}} name in 1999. The species was most recently described by Tilbury and Tolley in 2009 as Trioceros cristatus.|$|R
50|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by Gray in 1831 as the Chamaeleon cucullatus. Duméril and Bibron <b>described</b> <b>it</b> in 1836: 227 as Chamaeleo cucullatus, and Gray <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as Bradypodium cucullatum in 1865: 351. The same year, Gray also <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as the Calumma cucullata. In 1911: 32, Werner described the species as Chamaeleon cucullatus. In 1986, Klaver and Böhme <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as Calumma cucullata, {{and the same}} for Glaw and Vences in 1994: 247 and Necas in 1999: 274.

5|$|Like many ancient {{medicinal}} plants (Pliny the Elder <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> in his Naturalis Historia), great mullein {{was linked to}} witches, although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also widely held to ward off curses and evil spirits.

5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale. One theory suggests that the organic material in the Irati oil shale originated from algae deposited in a lacustrine environment with salinity varying from that of freshwater to brackish water. Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been deposited in a shallow, partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> as a marine source oil shale.|$|E

5|$|The biblical view of {{the late}} Iron Age {{political}} and cultural map <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> {{as a set of}} branching genealogies. Biblical figures three generations forward from Terah are invariably described as the eponymous founders of different tribes and polities that interacted with the Kingdom of Judah between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. Such is the case of the Qedarite Arabs, who according to biblical tradition, are the offspring of the Abraham-Ishmael-Kedar genealogical line.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the most}} aquatic species of the genus Agkistrodon, and is usually {{associated}} with bodies of water, such as creeks, streams, marshes, swamps, and the shores of ponds and lakes. The U.S. Navy (1991) <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> as inhabiting swamps, shallow lakes, and sluggish streams, but it is usually not found in swift, deep, cool water. Behler and King (1979) list its habitats as including lowland swamps, lakes, rivers, bayheads, sloughs, irrigation ditches, canals, rice fields, and small, clear, rocky, mountain streams.|$|E
5|$|This {{proposition}} {{is based}} on Galileo’s analysis of a body following a parabolic trajectory under the action of a constant acceleration. In Proposition 10, he <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> as Galileo’s Theorem, and mentions Galileo several other times in relation {{to it in the}} Principia. Combining it with Kepler's Second Law gives the simple and elegant method.|$|E

5|$|A Sea Symphony (1910), {{the only}} one of the series to include a part for full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> as a hybrid work, with {{elements}} of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E
5|$|It {{turns out}} that the aliens are NBC {{executive}} Herb Goodman, played by Elliott Gould, and his associate Curtis, played by Garrett Morris. They announce that the Star Trek series has been cancelled. Captain Kirk orders the crew to fire their hand phasers at the aliens but nothing happens. Mr. Spock assumes that the aliens have a type of weapons de-activator and tries to employ his famous Vulcan nerve pinch on him, but that does not work either. The executive confiscates Mr. Spock's pointed ears. Spock then mind-melds with Goodman only to discover that, as he <b>describes</b> <b>it,</b> his brain is devoid of substance and contains only a few rodents.|$|E

50|$|Trioceros laterispinis {{was first}} {{described}} in 1932 by British herpetologist and biologist Arthur Loveridge as Chamaeleon laterispinis. <b>It</b> was <b>described</b> {{under the same}} name in 1966 by Daan and Hillenius. In 1982, Böhme <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as the Chamaeleo laterispinis brookesiaeformis, and in 1999, Necas <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as the Chamaeleo laterispinis. Tilbury and Tolley <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as Trioceros laterispinis in 2009. It is commonly {{also known as the}} spiny-flanked chameleon.|$|R
5|$|Like their garage rock predecessors, {{these local}} scenes were {{facilitated}} by enthusiastic impresarios who operated nightclubs or organized concerts in venues such as schools, garages, or warehouses, advertised via inexpensively printed flyers and fanzines. In some cases, punk's {{do it yourself}} ethic reflected an aversion to commercial success, {{as well as a}} desire to maintain creative and financial autonomy. As Joe Harvard, a participant in the Boston scene, <b>describes,</b> <b>it</b> was often a simple necessity—the absence of a local recording industry and well-distributed music magazines left little recourse but DIY.|$|E
5|$|Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the Autobiography, modern {{scholars}} tend {{to treat}} him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure {{in the composition of}} the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy. However, MalcolmX biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a critical analysis of the Autobiography, or the full relationship between MalcolmX and Haley, does not support this view; he <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> instead as a collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or clepsydrae, were {{commonly}} used in Ancient Greece following their introduction by Plato, who also invented a water-based alarm clock. One account of Plato's alarm clock <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> as depending on the nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which floated in a columnar vat. The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the Academy. Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a siphon. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm. The Greeks and Chaldeans regularly maintained timekeeping records as {{an essential part of}} their astronomical observations.|$|E

5|$|Alongside {{the second}} series of Life Begins, Bullen {{continued}} developing George the Third. The title {{was changed to}} It Happens until eventually settling on All About George in time for filming in 2005. All About George starred Rik Mayall as George Kinsey, a builder whose life is changed when six generations of his family move into his home. Initially excited about the series when he attended the cast read-throughs, Bullen's optimism waned {{by the time it}} was broadcast as he felt there were too many characters and the series' premise unclear. In a 2008 interview, he <b>describes</b> <b>it</b> as one of his worst TV series. Life Begins returned for a third and final series in 2006. The same year, filming commenced on Tripping Over, a series about intercontinental backpackers in 1976 and 2006. SeaChange writers Andrew Knight and Andrea Denholm conceived the idea in 2003 and asked Bullen, a friend of Knight's, to develop it with them. A co-production between Australia's Channel Ten and Britain's Five, Tripping Over was broadcast in both countries at the end of 2006.|$|E
5|$|As Rosenbaum <b>describes</b> <b>it,</b> Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds {{parallels}} between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E
5|$|Gil met guitarist {{and singer}} Caetano Veloso at the Universidade Federal da Bahia (Federal University of Bahia) in 1963. The two {{immediately}} began collaborating and performing together, releasing a single and EP soon afterwards. Along with Maria Bethânia (Veloso's sister), Gal Costa, and Tom Zé, Gil and Veloso performed bossa nova and traditional Brazilian songs at the Vila Velha Theatre's opening night in July 1964, a show entitled Nós, por Exemplo (Us, for Example). Gil {{and the group}} continued to perform at the venue and he eventually became a musical director of the concert series. Gil collaborated again with members of this collective on the landmark 1968 album , whose style was influenced by The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, an album Gil listened to constantly. Gil describes Tropicália: ou Panis et Circenses as {{the birth of the}} tropicália movement. As Gil <b>describes</b> <b>it,</b> tropicália (or Tropicalismo) was a conflation of musical and cultural developments that had occurred in Brazil during the 1950s and 1960s—primarily bossa nova and the Jovem Guarda (Young Wave) collective—with rock and roll music from the United States and Europe, a movement deemed threatening by the Brazilian government of the time.|$|E
