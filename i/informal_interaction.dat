40|$|This paper finds {{evidence}} for the growing importance of <b>informal</b> <b>interactions</b> between the internal audit function and the audit committee (AC) in Australia - a relatively unexplored topic in the literature - using a survey of Chief Audit Executives (CAEs). It also describes {{the nature of these}} <b>informal</b> <b>interactions.</b> The most innovative elements of this paper are the findings that certain personal characteristics of CAEs, the specific knowledge and expertise of the AC chair, {{as well as some of}} the AC chair&# 039;s personal characteristics are associated with the existence (and increase) of <b>informal</b> <b>interactions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{recognise}} {{the importance}} of informal processes within corporate governance and complement existing {{research in this area}} by investigating factors associated with the existence of <b>informal</b> <b>interactions</b> between audit committees and internal audit functions and in providing directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach – To examine the existence and drivers of <b>informal</b> <b>interactions</b> between audit committees and internal audit functions, this paper relies on a questionnaire survey of chief audit executives (CAEs) in the UK from listed and non-listed, as well as financial and non-financial, companies. While prior qualitative research suggests that <b>informal</b> <b>interactions</b> do take place, most of the evidence is based on particular organisational setting or on a very small range of interviews. The use of a questionnaire enabled the examination of the existence of internal interactions across a relatively larger number of entities. Findings – The paper finds evidence of audit committees and internal audit functions engaging in <b>informal</b> <b>interactions</b> in addition to formal pre-scheduled regular meetings. <b>Informal</b> <b>interactions</b> complement formal meetings with the audit committee and as such represent additional opportunities for the audit committees to monitor internal audit functions. Audit committees’ <b>informal</b> <b>interactions</b> are significantly and positively associated with audit committee independence, audit chair’s knowledge and experience, and internal audit quality. Originality/value – The results demonstrate {{the importance of}} the background of the audit committee chair for the effectiveness of the governance process. This is possibly the first paper {{to examine the relationship between}} audit committee quality and internal audit, on the existence and driver of <b>informal</b> <b>interactions.</b> Policy makers should recognize that in addition to formal mechanisms, informal processes, such as communication outside of formal pre-scheduled meetings, play a significant role in corporate governance...|$|R

40|$|Although {{many studies}} employ social network theory to explain firm innovation, how individual-level factors {{lead to a}} firm's {{collective}} innovation capability remains under-researched.

Integrating the literatures on absorptive capacity and social interaction, the analysis of survey data from 273 Chinese manufacturing firms suggests that employees' <b>informal</b> <b>interactions</b> are positively associated with knowledge acquisition and enhance firms' innovation capabilities.

We conclude that <b>informal</b> <b>interactions</b> among group members influence pay practices and behaviors, but the relationship is complex. No single aspect of group sociology is entirely consistent with all the patterns in the data. Factors emphasized in the economic theory of agency, notably risk aversion, also shape pay policies but these factors cannot account for all the observed empirical relationships...|$|R
40|$|Many {{systems have}} used video to support formal {{distributed}} meetings. Recent research, however, indicates that most workplace interactions are not group meetings.

30|$|A third {{explanation}} for these outcomes might {{be attributed to}} areas that students did not identify as impacting their classroom experience. For instance, the instructors noted, anecdotally, that many teams began to meet socially for non-class related purposes. The students did not report these interactions as being important in their exit interview, thus it did not emerge as a theme. However, these <b>informal</b> <b>interactions</b> may have helped them deepen their respect, communication, and understanding for the distributions of various capabilities and lack thereof held in their team.

40|$|Based on {{a multiyear}} study, this article {{analyzes}} {{the reproduction of}} adult gender segrega-tion in two youth-sports organizations in which most men volunteers become coaches and most women volunteers become “team moms. ” We use interviews and participant observa-tion to explore how these gender divisions are created. While most participants say the divisions result from individual choices, our interviews show how gendered language, essentialist beliefs, and analogies with gendered divisions of labor in families and work-places naturalize this division of labor. Observation reveals how patterned, <b>informal</b> <b>interactions</b> reproduce (and occasionally challenge) it as well. We show how (mostly) nonreflexive <b>informal</b> <b>interactions</b> at the nexus of three gender regimes—youth sports, families, and workplaces—produce a gender formation with two interrelated characteris-tics: an ascendant professional class gender ideology that we call “soft essentialism ” and a “gender category sorting system ” that channels most men into coaching and most women into being “team moms. ...|$|R

40|$|I have designed, built, and {{evaluated}} three devices to encourage <b>informal</b> <b>interactions</b> in the workplace. Previous {{research has found}} that such interactions can lead to increased idea cross-flow, creativity, productivity, and innovation at large, though few attempts to design architectural, organizational, or technological solutions have succeeded in achieving this. I believe this is because these approaches tended to focus too much on fostering an "ambient awareness" of fellow coworkers with hopes that it would indirectly lead to increased <b>informal</b> <b>interactions.</b> My hypothesis is that proactively creating such interactions as intermediated by a smart artifact in the office space would be more effective. For this thesis, I have built two versions of a device called Food Groups, as well as another one called Media Lab Mixer; Food Groups matches coworkers up to get lunch or dinner together, while Media Lab Mixer uses game dynamics to encourage them to spend more time socializing in a common space. After an initial study, the Food Groups devices received little use and were largely ineffective at fostering <b>informal</b> <b>interactions.</b> Media Lab Mixer, however, showed greater engagement and was more effective at creating the desired results, though it did not have a lasting effect after it was removed. by Shaun Salzberg.
