In some areas, these clusters represent a cost-effective alternative to the more expensive supercomputers that are in use today.

This study quantifies the speedup of parallel applications in a cluster environment in an analytical model that takes parallel processing, internode communication, and I/O latency into consideration. The model illustrates the (relative) impact that CPU and I/O parallelism has on the speedup behavior based on the 3 different inter-node communication scenarios: broadcast, nearest-neighbor, and request-response.

40|$|Abstract—Remote Memory Access (RMA) {{programming}} enables {{direct access}} to low-level hardware features to achieve high performance for distributed-memory programs. However, the design of RMA programming schemes focuses on the memory access and less on process synchronization. For exam-ple, in contemporary RMA programming systems, the widely used producer-consumer pattern can only be implemented inefficiently, incurring the overhead of an additional round-trip message. We propose Notified Access, a scheme where the target process of an access can receive a <b>completion</b> <b>notification.</b> This scheme enables direct and efficient synchronization with a minimum number of messages. We implement our scheme in an open source MPI- 3 RMA library and demonstrate lower overheads (two cache misses) than other point-to-point syn-chronization mechanisms. We also evaluate our implementation on three real-world benchmarks: a stencil computation, a tree computation, and a Cholesky factorization implemented with tasks. Our scheme always performs better than traditional message passing and other existing RMA synchronization schemes, providing up to 50 % speedup on small messages. Our analysis shows that Notified Access is a valuable primitive for any RMA system. Furthermore, we provide guidance {{for the design of}} low-level network interfaces to support Notified Access efficiently. Keywords-RMA; synchronization; notification; MP...|$|R

40|$|Project (M. S., Computer Science) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. The {{multi-core}} era brings {{new challenges}} to the programming community. Parallelization requirements of applications in mainstream computing and applications in emergent fields of high performance computing, such as informatics, must be explored. With parallelism now ubiquitous, programmability, composability, and reuse need to be closely examined in applications developed using existing parallel programming tools. Of the available programming models, task parallelism is the most promising {{and is able to}} parallelize regular and irregular applications alike [1, 2, 3]. In order to widely adopt task parallelism it is necessary for a tool to be configurable and extensible without any runtime penalties. Recently, PFunc [4], a novel library for expressing shared-memory task parallelism in C and C++ has been released to the open-source community. PFunc is unique in its heavy use of generic programming - a programming paradigm for developing efficient and reusable software libraries. PFunc can be used as is and does not require any configuration or extensions. It introduces the ability to deliver multiple task <b>completion</b> <b>notifications</b> and the notion of task groups and also provides production-grade exception handling and performance monitoring mechanisms to assist software developers. However, to validate PFunc???s utility, it is necessary to demonstrate its ability to deliver parallel performance for a variety of applications. In this thesis, we present a task parallel version of three NAS parallel benchmarks: Gaussian random variates (EP), integer sort (IS), and conjugate gradient (CG) [5]. These three benchmarks are then compared against their OpenMP counterparts. Computer Scienc...|$|R

40|$|Bulk memory copies incur large {{overheads}} such as CPU stalling (i. e., no overlap of computation with memory copy operation), small register-size data movement, cache pollution, etc. Asynchronous copy engines {{introduced by}} Intel’s I/O Acceleration Technology help in alleviating these overheads by offloading the memory copy operations using several DMA channels. However, the startup overheads {{associated with these}} copy engines such as pinning the application buffers, posting the descriptors and checking for <b>completion</b> <b>notifications,</b> limit their overlap capability. In this paper, we propose two schemes to provide complete overlap of memory copy operation with computation by dedicating the critical tasks to a single core in a multi-core system. In the first scheme, MCI (Multi-Core with I/OAT), we offload the memory copy operation to the copy engine and onload the startup overheads to the dedicated core. For systems without any hardware copy engine support, we propose a second scheme, MCNI (Multi-Core with No I/OAT) that onloads the memory copy operation to the dedicated core. We further propose a mechanism for an applicationtransparent asynchronous memory copy operation using memory protection. We analyze our schemes based on overlap efficiency, performance and associated overheads using several micro-benchmarks and applications. Our microbenchmark results show that memory copy operations can be significantly overlapped (up to 100 %) with computation using the MCI and MCNI schemes. Evaluation with MPI-based applications such as IS-B and PSTSWM-small using the MCNI scheme show up to 4 % and 5 % improvement, respectively, as compared to traditional implementations. Evaluations with data-centers using the MCI scheme show up to 37 % improvement compared to the traditional implementation.

40|$|Successfully {{managing}} an Institutional Repository (IR) is {{a complex}} and ongoing affair. A single IR undergoes constant changes including the import of new records {{as well as the}} modification and removal of existing records and their associated identifiers,data streams, metadata and harvest feeds. Completing all tasks thoroughly and efficiently ensures accurate results for end users and service providers. Use Case: To appreciate the complexity of managing such tasks, consider one of the many possible use case scenarios. A scholar has relocated from institution X to institution Y and would like their past publication data added to institution Y repository. Areas of difficulty updating institution Y repository include (but are not limited to) : • incompatibility between the export and ingest mechanisms of repository software used by both institutions prevents forms of automated migration resulting in a laborious process using tradition methods of managing tasks. • the lack of availability of research documents from X due to copyright and embargo delays forcing future reminders and tasks to be set using traditional methods. • redundancy issues of records entered manually by different members of institution Y. • unmanageable task management using spreadsheets generated as checklists due to size and redundancy issues. ManagIR is an application that harnesses the versatility of the web and implementation of the open archives initiative. ManagIR is integrated with an existing application known as The Fascinator which provides existing harvesting, storage and indexing technologies. This poster demonstrates how ManagIR is able to solve this (and other) case scenarios. ManagIR The Application: • is web based, the granularity of deployment can range from a desktop within an institution to a server the cloud. • can be shared by repository managers, library staff and scholars from multiple locations using user and group style authentication. • maintains a fresh copy of the OAI-PMH feed relating to the given repository. Re-harvesting intervals can be customised in accordance with IR requirements. • allows users to select record/records and assign tasks associated to those records. • allows additional information to be associated with a task such as email notification, calendar appointment requests, progress of task and reassignment and <b>completion</b> <b>notification.</b> • provides visual notification by color coding individual records relating to importance.

40|$|Many modern {{embedded}} systems {{have a need}} for minimal downtime due to failures, maintenance, or upgrades, that are addressed by permitting insertion and removal of boards while the system is active. Both CompactPCI and VME systems support live insertion and/or removal of boards called “Hot Swap”. It is important that notification of such a change in configuration is communicated appropriately throughout the system {{so that it can}} react properly, perhaps by redistributing work between the available resources or shutting down any direct communication between boards before the boards involved are physically removed from the system. In a CompactPCI system, the notification takes the form of an interrupt to a System Host that takes the appropriate action. However, not only does the System Host constitute a single point of failure, but in many systems where there is no other traffic over the CompactPCI bus, handling this interrupt may be the only reason for the System Host to be present at all. Elimination of this centralized control function would therefore lead to a cheaper, more robust and optimal system architecture. In an embedded multiprocessor system, entities that need to know about insertion or removal events may be distributed throughout the system. Such entities may care about Hot Swap events in one of two ways. They may be interested in knowing about a Hot Swap event within some defined time of it having occurred, or they may need to know about an impending Hot Swap event and take some action before it occurs. In the former case, asynchronous <b>notification</b> of <b>completion</b> of the event is sufficient, however the latter case demands synchronous action {{on the part of the}} interested entity. The mechanism used for both cases should ideally provide complete decoupling of interested entities and sources of Hot Swap events and achieve an acceptable response time so that <b>completion</b> and <b>notification</b> of events is not unduly delayed. This article discusses how a modified version of the Real-Time CORBA Notification Service may be used to meet these requirements...|$|R

The i-Con Drill String Dynamics Logging Tool has been developed by Trican Completion Solutions to be used for downhole data acquisition in wells during completion operations. It contains sensors that measure downhole parameters such as pressure inside the installation string, annular pressure, torque, temperature and axial loads. As of June 2016, the i-Con tool has been run during the <b>installation</b> of lower <b>completion</b> in five wells at the Ivar Aasen Field. The wells are all long, horizontal oil producers from 4600 m MD to 6200 m MD, completed with sand screens. During the installation, the tool was located directly above the liner hanger running tool as this was the main point of interest in the well. The downhole data acquired by the tool in the five oil producers was analyzed, with particular attention payed to five specific downhole events: 1 - Installation of the lower completion 2 - Anchoring the lower completion 3 - Circulation through the lower completion 4 - Isolating the lower completion 5 - Pressure testing the lower completion The goal of this analysis was to determine the typical fingerprint behavior for each event, and to evaluate areas of improved visibility that appear when using downhole data in addition to surface data.

Another more general conclusion is that downhole data sets like these can be used to adjust and optimize future completion operations.

This well was drilled in the spring of 1999 as part of the U. S. Department of Energy's hydrogeologic {{investigation}} well program in the Western Pahute Mesa - Oasis Valley region just west of the Test Site. A 44. 5 -centimeter surface hole was drilled and cased off to the depth 675. 1 meters below the surface. The hole diameter was then decreased to 31. 1 centimeters for drilling to a total depth of 1, 524. 0 meters. A preliminary composite, static, water level was measured at the depth of approximately 566. 3 meters prior to <b>installation</b> of the <b>completion</b> string. One completion string with three isolated, slotted intervals was installed in the well. Detailed lithologic descriptions with preliminary stratigraphic assignments are included in the report. These are based on composite drill cuttings collected every 3 meters and 31 sidewall samples taken at various depths below 680 meters, supplemented by geophysical log data. Detailed chemical and mineralogical studies of rock samples are in progress. The well penetrated Tertiary-age lava and tuff of the Timber Mountain Group, the Paintbrush Group, the Calico Hills Formation, the Crater Flat Group, and the Volcanics of Quartz Mountain. The preliminary geologic interpretation of data from Well ER-EC- 1 indicates the presence of a structural trough or bench filled with a thick section of post-Rainier Mesa lava. These data also suggest that this site is located on a buried structural ridge that may separate the Silent Canyon and Timber Mountain caldera complexes...|$|R
40|$|Well ER-EC- 2 A was drilled for the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Operations Office, {{in support}} of the Nevada Environmental Restoration Project at the Nevada Test Site, Nye County, Nevada. This well was drilled in January and February of 2000 as part of a hydrogeologic {{investigation}} program in the Pahute Mesa - Oasis Valley region just west of the Nevada Test Site. A 44. 5 -centimeter surface hole was drilled and cased off to a depth of 412. 9 meters below the surface. The hole diameter was then decreased to 31. 1 centimeters for drilling to a total depth of 1, 516. 1 meters. One completion string with three isolated slotted intervals was installed in the well. A preliminary composite, static water level was measured at the depth of 228. 0 meters, approximately two months after <b>installation</b> of the <b>completion</b> string. Detailed lithologic descriptions with preliminary stratigraphic assignments are included in this report. These are based on composite drill cuttings collected every 3 meters, and 81 sidewall samples taken at various depths below 212 meters, supplemented by geophysical log data. Detailed petrographic, chemical, and mineralogical studies of rock samples were conducted on 30 samples. The well was collared in rhyolite lava and penetrated Tertiary-age lava and tuff of the Volcanics of Fortymile Canyon and the Timber Mountain Group. The preliminary geologic interpretation of borehole data indicates that this well was drilled within the margins of the buried Rainier Mesa and Ammonia Tanks calderas, and that caldera collapse in this area was deeper than expected, resulting in a section of Volcanics of Fortymile Canyon (caldera-filling deposit) that is much thicker than expected...|$|R
40|$|Well ER-EC- 7 was drilled for the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office {{in support}} of the Nevada Environmental Restoration Project at the Nevada Test Site, Nye County, Nevada. This well was drilled in the summer of 1999 as part of the Department of Energy's hydrogeologic {{investigation}} program in the Western Pahute Mesa - Oasis Valley region just west of the Test Site. A 44. 5 -centimeter surface hole was drilled and cased off to a depth of 265. 8 meters below the surface. The hole diameter was then decreased to 31. 1 centimeters for drilling to a total depth of 422. 5 meters. The planned depth of 762 meters was not reached due to borehole stability problems. One completion string with two isolated slotted intervals was installed in the well. A preliminary composite, static, water level was measured at the depth of 227. 8 meters, 20 days after <b>installation</b> of the <b>completion</b> string. Detailed lithologic descriptions with stratigraphic assignments are included in the report. These are based on composite drill cuttings, supplemented by geophysical log data, and incorporating data from detailed chemical and mineralogical studies of rock samples. Beneath a thin alluvial deposit, the well penetrated 410 meters of lava and bedded tuff of the Volcanics of Fortymile Canyon Group, deposited in the Timber Mountain caldera moat after caldera collapse. The geologic interpretation of data from this well provides information on the thickness, lithologic composition, and hydrogeologic character of moat-filling rocks in the southern portion of the Timber Mountain caldera complex in the southwestern Nevada volcanic field...|$|R

Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office {{in support}} of the Nevada Environmental Restoration Project at the Nevada Test Site, Nye County, Nevada. This well was drilled in the summer of 1999 as part of the U. S. Department of Energy's hydrogeologic {{investigation}} program in the Western Pahute Mesa - Oasis Valley region just west of the Nevada Test Site. A 44. 5 -centimeter surface hole was drilled and cased off to a depth of 129. 8 meters below the surface. The hole diameter was then decreased to 31. 1 centimeters for drilling to a total depth of 609. 6 meters. One completion string with three isolated slotted intervals was installed in the well. A preliminary composite, static water level was measured at the depth of 98. 4 meters, 24 days after <b>installation</b> of the <b>completion</b> string. Detailed lithologic descriptions with stratigraphic assignments are included in the report. These are based on evaluation of composite drill cuttings collected every 3 meters, and 20 sidewall samples taken at various depths below 157. 9 meters, supplemented by geophysical log data and results of detailed chemical and mineralogical studies of rock samples. Drilling began in Tertiary-age tuff of the Thirsty Canyon Group, and penetrated tuffs of the Beatty Wash Formation, tuff of Buttonhook Wash, and the upper portion of the Ammonia Tanks Tuff. The geologic interpretation of data from this well helps define the location of the western margin of the Timber Mountain caldera complex in the southwestern Nevada volcanic field.

40|$|Since 2003, the United States {{has been}} {{actively}} pursuing {{the creation of}} a Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA) as part of its post- 9 / 11 broader strategy to use bilateral trade agreements and regional reform as weapons against global terrorism. While the strategy has had some early successes – notably with the <b>completion</b> <b>installation</b> of lesser bilateral trade and investment protection treaties with a number of Middle East countries, and free trade agreements (FTAs) with Jordan, Bahrain and Oman – it now threatens to stall on a number of counts. FTA negotiations between the United States and the UAE, which commenced {{at the same time as}} the Oman negotiations have now ground to a halt. Qatar and Kuwait, which had shown a willingness to commence discussions soon after the completion of the Oman FTA, have since indicated that they now are in no hurry to enter into FTAs. Domestically, the MEFTA strategy has encountered further problems as the balance of power in Congress shifts from the Republicans to the Democrats. The growing opposition in Congress to the President’s Middle East policies has caused the non-renewal of the Administration’s Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which provided the framework for ‘fast-track’ Congressional approval process for the Administration’s bilateral trade agreements. The TPA expired on 1 July 2007, and even at this late stage there is uncertainty as to whether Congress will belatedly renew it at least until the end of the President’s final term. As the Bush Presidency enters the winter of its final term, the future of the MEFTA strategy and the consequent bilateral trade agreements in the Middle East are experiencing the stagnation that can mark the administration of an outgoing president...|$|R
