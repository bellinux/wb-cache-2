5|$|This form is {{very common}} in castles adapted for guns, found in Egypt, Italy, Scotland, and Spain, and {{elsewhere}} in between. Other types of port, though less common, were horizontal slits– allowing only lateral movement– and large square openings, which allowed greater movement. The use of guns for defence gave rise to artillery castles, {{such as that of}} Château de Ham in France. Defences against guns were not developed until a later stage.

5|$|The {{petrification}} motif {{also appears}} in non-scriptural works. The Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa (generally dated 4th century CE) {{notes that the}} wife of Gautama (unnamed here) momentarily becomes the wife of Indra. Without explicitly mentioning the curse, it relates further that she regains her beautiful form and casts away her stony appearance, owing to the grace provided by the dust of Rama's feet, which redeems her. Gautam Patel, author of many works about Kalidasa, credits him as {{the first person to}} introduce the petrification motif. In the Ramavataram too, Rama does not have to touch Ahalya with his foot; the dust from his feet is enough to bring her back to life. As in other versions of the tale, the repentant Ahalya is turned to stone, only to be liberated by Rama, and Indra runs away disguised as a cat but is cursed to bear the marks of a thousand vulvae. The Ramavataram <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bhakti-era poets who exalt Rama as a saviour.|$|E
5|$|Turkey schnitzel is an Israeli {{adaptation}} of veal schnitzel, and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transformations common in Israeli cooking.

Furthermore, a Wiener schnitzel is cooked in both butter and oil, but in Israel only oil is used, because of kashrut. Today, most cooks buy schnitzel already breaded and serve it with hummus, tahina, and other salads for a quick main meal. Other immigrant groups have added variations from their own backgrounds; Yemenite Jews, for example, flavor it with hawaij. In addition, vegetarian versions have become popular and the Israeli food company, Tiv′ol, was the first to produce a vegetarian schnitzel from a soya meat-substitute.|$|E

This is exemplified by many significant monuments in the city. Delhi is also identified as the location of Indraprastha, the ancient capital of the Pandavas. The Archaeological Survey of India recognises 1200 heritage buildings and 175 monuments as national heritage sites. In the Old City, the Mughals and the Turkic rulers constructed several architecturally significant buildings, such as the Jama MasjidIndia's largest mosque built in 1656 and the Red Fort. Three World Heritage Sitesthe Red Fort, Qutab Minar and Humayun's Tombare located in Delhi.

The Laxminarayan temple, Akshardham temple,Bangla Sahib the Bahá'í Lotus temple and the ISKCON temple are examples of modern architecture. Raj Ghat and associated memorials houses memorials of Mahatma Gandhi and other notable personalities.
