40|$|Abstract. We give several {{examples}} of Douglas Algebras that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> maximal subalgebra. We find a condition on these algebras that guarantees that some <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> minimal superalgebra. We {{also show that}} if A is the only maximal subalgebra of a Douglas algebra B, then the algebra A <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> maximal subalgebra. 1...|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} August 1915, about 150 Armenians with Russian {{citizenship}} were deported from Constantinople to holding centers. A few of the detained, including writer Alexander Panossian (1859–1919), {{were released}} the same weekend before even being transferred to Anatolia.

This was followed up with applications and instructions sent by mail. Hawaii's two nursing schools were not eligible for the program {{because they were in}} the war zone; Alaska <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> nursing schools at the time.|$|E

5|$|The Browns <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> draft choices from 1996 to 1998, because then-owner Art Modell {{took all}} the team's players to Baltimore, Maryland, {{effectively}} stopping the franchise. However, the NFL mandated that the Browns' name, colors, and franchise history remain in Cleveland and that the team would reactivate by 1999. In 1999, the Browns selected number one overall, drafting University of Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch.|$|E

5|$|The {{data also}} allowed for an {{investigation}} into whether visual prominence {{is an important factor}} in the name-letter effect. Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> impact on people in those countries liking those letters relatively more.|$|E

5|$|When Weston died, the King Caesar House {{passed to}} his son, Alden B. Weston (1805–1880). The Weston family fortune was spent rapidly by Alden’s two {{brothers}} and he consequently lived frugally. Alden Weston married at age 55 but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> children. His wife predeceased him and Alden Weston died alone in the King Caesar House in 1880.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E

Later that morning, at approximately 7:30a.m., Loughner was stopped by an Arizona Game and Fish Department officer after running a red light, but was released with a reminder when it was determined that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> outstanding warrants.|$|E

5|$|Even {{following}} the conversion to cylindrical smokeboxes, {{it was still}} possible to distinguish some non-streamliners from ex-streamliners. On the former (Nos. 46230-46234 and 46249-46252, but not 46253-46257) the running plates veered downwards {{at right angles to}} connect with the buffer beam {{in the style of the}} Princess Royal Class. The ex-streamliners <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> such connection, except No.46242 City of Glasgow which was rebuilt in 1952 following a serious collision.|$|E
5|$|Karl {{holds the}} record for the northernmost {{formation}} of a November tropical or subtropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean. It also attained hurricane strength at an unusual latitude, and contributed {{to one of the most}} active Novembers on record in terms of tropical cyclones. However, it stayed over open waters and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> effects on land. It was the 11th named storm of the season, and due to the lack of damage, its name was not retired.|$|E
5|$|Many Southerners {{believed}} his warnings and read every political news {{story from the}} North as {{further evidence of the}} planned destruction of the white southern way of life. The climax came a decade after Calhoun's death with the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860, which led to the secession of South Carolina, followed by six other Southern states. They formed the new Confederate States, which, in accordance with Calhoun's theory, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> organized political parties.|$|E
