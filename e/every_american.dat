5|$|Obama {{called for}} Congress to pass {{legislation}} reforming {{health care in the}} United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require <b>every</b> <b>American</b> to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.|$|E
5|$|Steve Prefontaine {{arrived on}} campus in 1969 and immediately, head coach Bowerman and {{assistant}} coach Bill Dellinger had their hands full {{to rein in}} the rebellious new athlete.

At one point, Prefontaine held <b>every</b> <b>American</b> distance record above the 2,000 meters and was thought of by many {{to be one of the}} greatest American runners in history.
