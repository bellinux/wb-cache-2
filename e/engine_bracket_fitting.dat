40|$|An {{integral}} part of the design route for many automotive components is the analysis of them using finite element (FE) techniques. As a result of the analysis the designer will either approve the design or make design changes during the post-processing stage of the analysis. These design changes will be based on product cycle rules and could involve geometry modification or a material change for example. As these design decisions are rule based it is feasible that this process could be automated within a Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) environment.

By attaching the engine at only two points ("fore-and-aft"), on two points defining an axis that passes through the engine's center of mass, the engine would be able to rotate slightly about this axis and reduce the transmission of torsional vibration to the chassis.

40|$|The use of {{aluminum}} alloy castings for safety critical structural components such as <b>engine</b> mount <b>brackets,</b> steering knuckles, and control arms, offers significant opportunities for achieving weight reduction in automobiles, {{since they are}} typically about half {{the weight of the}} steel, cast iron, or ductile iron component that they replace. Metal Compression Forming (MCF) is a variant of the squeeze casting process, in which molten metal is allowed to solidify under pressure in order to close porosity and form a sound part. However, the MCF process applies pressure on the entire mold face, thereby directing pressure on all regions of the casting and producing a uniformly sound part. The process is capable of producing parts with properties close to those of forgings, while retaining the near net shape, complexity in geometry, and relatively low cost of the casting process. The paper describes the casting process development involved in the production of an aluminum A 357 alloy motor mount bracket, including the use of a filling and solidification model to design the gating and determine process parameters.

40|$|Abstract. The Council for Science and Industrial Research has {{developed}} and patented a rheocasting process. The process involves {{the preparation of}} semi-solid slurries from liquid metal, by controlled cooling and MHD stirring using induction coils. An industrial prototype was designed and built to test the system in an industrial environment. A semi-solid high pressure die casting cell was set up with an industrial partner and the system was tested under normal production conditions. The production cell consisted of the CSIR rheocasting system, a six axis robot, dosing furnace and 400 ton H- 400 SC shot controlled Bühler HPDC machine. An <b>engine</b> mounting <b>bracket</b> originally designed for liquid HPDC was redesigned for SSM forming (casting) taking into consideration the flow and thermal behaviour of semi-solid casting process, {{the function of the}} component and the required mechanical properties.

40|$|Al-Si-Mg casting alloys {{are being}} used in {{automotive}} applications, aerospace applications and other applications requiring heat-treatable permanent mould castings that combine good weldability with high strength and toughness (ASM). These casting alloys are also known for their excellent castability, corrosion resistance and, in particular,. a range of mechanical properties in the heattreated condition. A 357 aluminum alloy has been extensively used for semi-solid processing {{for more than three}} decades, and a large amount of components like fuel rails, <b>engine</b> mounts, <b>engine</b> <b>brackets</b> and suspension parts have been produced. This alloy is also included in the Statement for Work between the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Boeing Co, USA. F 357, a hypo-eutectic aluminium alloy, Al- 7 %Si- 0. 6 %Mg without beryllium, was processed with CSIR-Rheo technology to the Semi-Solid Metal (SSM) state and cast in plates with a 50 Ton High Pressure Die Casting machine. The castings were either left in the as-cast (F) condition or subjected to T 4, T 4 + or T 6 heat treatments prior to laser welding. Welding of aluminium alloys poses many problems like porosity, loss of alloying elements, poor bead geometry and softening of the heat affected zone. Laser welding is however widely used in industrial production owing to the advantages such as low heat input, high welding speed and high production rate. Due to these unique advantages, the potential of autogenous Nd: Y AG laser welding as manufacturing process for this cast aluminium alloy was evaluated. A welding operating window was established and the optimum parameters were found to be a laser power of 3. 8 kW at the workpiece and a welding speed of 4 m/min with a twin spot laser light configuration. These laser welding parameters were applied for the welding of the heat treated plates and resulted in very low weld joint porosity and almost no loss of alloying elements. The mechanical properties of age-hardenable Al-Si-Mg alloys are dependent on {{the rate at which the}} alloy is cooled after the solution heat treatment Because of the high cooling rate during laser welding, the possibility of producing weld seams through deep penetration laser welding, with mechanical properties matching those of the T 6 temper condition, but without a post-weld solid solution heat treatment, was investigated. The quench rate after laser welding was measured and compared well with that measured after solution treatment. The resulting mechanical properties of F 357 aluminium welded in the T 4 condition and only artificially aged after welding (T 4 + condition), compares very well with the T 6 base material properties. The strengthening mechanisms obtained during laser welding and the different heat treatments were studied by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and are consistent with the expected precipitation hardening processes in Al-Si-Mg alloys. The quench sensitivity of SSM F 357 aluminium alloy is thus sufficiently low to obtain such an increase in strength values during laser welding, that no postweld solution heat treatment is necessary to achieve mechanical properties to the T 6 performance specification...|$|R
40|$|During {{test and}} {{verification}} of the Norwegian Navy’s {{fast patrol boat}} KNM Storm some problems with the lift fan machinery have been experienced. The problem observed is that occasionally, triggered by the firing of the 76 mm cannon, the port fan diesel engine is set into vibrations. In order to investigate the possible causes and the transient dynamic behavior of the system, several models have been explained, built and simulated throughout the master thesis. The bond graph notation and the computer software program 20 Sim have been used. A non linear rigid body model of the diesel engine is built. The rigid body model is connected to {{a model of the}} complete drive train, including the fan load. Excitation models for the inertial force and moments from crank kinematics, counteracted torque loading of the fan, displacement of foundation and air pressure pulse propagation into the fan compartment are built and simulated. The eigenfrequency calculation of the rigid body (diesel engine and gear) has been reviewed. The inherit physical properties of the rigid body show that we can expect amplification and phase shifts in the frequency range of approximately 4. 5 - 25 Hz. Installing snubbers at the <b>engine</b> <b>brackets</b> may lead to increased transverse stiffness and eigenfrequencies within the diesel engine operating speed range. A velocity pulse, in transverse direction based on SKF measurements, to the diesel engine and gear foundation, reveals a 0. 7 mm transverse displacement contribution of the diesel engine and gear at the center of gravity. The pseudo bond graph model of the air blast pressure pulse propagation from deck through the fan compartment reveals that the pressure pulse will flatten out, with a decrease in pressure amplitude and an increase in pulse length, at the fan volute intake. The effects on pressure pulse at fan inlet have been investigated. Disturbance in the fan inlet flow field by a pressure pulse causes a negative torque loading transient as well as a positive engine speed transient. This affects the inertial forces from crank kinematics excitation vector and the counteracting torque fan loading excitation vector, which results in a diesel engine displacement. The potential of diesel engine displacement from the counteracting torque loading is greater than the velocity pulse to the engine foundation. The governor engine speed set point has been given a 2 Hz oscillation at 2100 rpm. This results in a 2 Hz oscillation of the fan load, counteracted torque loading, displacement in y-direction and angular displacement around the x-axis. The 2 Hz transverse displacement of the diesel engine is in accordance with the observations by crewmembers and yard. We can also observe the phase delay between the engine speed regulator and the actual engine speed and fan load. In order to create a continuation of the oscillation, a phase difference of 180 degree is required. A further model implementation of the physical effects of the gas dynamic processes together with the actual speed governor properties and exact physical data of the diesel engine are needed in A non linear rigid order to possible recreate this phenomena, and increase the accuracy of the simulation results.    </p...|$|R
