Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 90 pediatric patients receiving 7 mg/kg of body weight levofloxacin and two studies of 47 healthy adults receiving 500 and 750 mg/kg levofloxacin were used for the pharmacometric analyses. Body weight was found to be a significant covariate for levofloxacin clearance and the volume of distribution. Consistently with developmental physiology, clearance also was found to be reduced in pediatric patients under 2 years of age due to immature renal function. Different dosing regimens were simulated to match adult exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h at steady state, maximum concentration of drug in serum at steady state, and minimum concentration of drug in serum at steady state) following the approved adult dose of 500 mg once a day.

40|$|Bacillus anthracis, the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} anthrax, is a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium. The <b>inhalational</b> form of <b>anthrax</b> {{is the most}} severe and is associated with rapid progression {{of the disease and}} the outcome is frequently fatal. Transfer from the respiratory epithelium to regional lymph nodes appears to be an essential early step in the establishment of infection. This transfer is believed to occur by means of carriage within alveolar macrophages following phagocytosis. Therefore, the ability of B. anthracis to transit through the host macrophage or dendritic cell appears to be an early and critical step in B. anthracis pathogenesis. In this work, we examined the cytokine responses to spore infection in mouse primary peritoneal macrophages, in primary human dendritic cells, and during a spore aerosol infection model utilizing the susceptible A/J mouse strain. We demonstrated that both mouse peritoneal macrophages and human dendritic cells exhibited significant intracellular bactericidal activity during the first hours following uptake, providing the necessary time to mount a cytokine response prior to cell lysis. Strong tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) responses were seen in mouse peritoneal macrophages. In addition to TNF-α and IL- 6, human dendritic cells produced the cytokines IL- 1 β, IL- 8, and IL- 12. A mixture of Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines were detected in sera obtained from infected animals.

40|$|Outbreaks of Bacillus anthracis in the US and Europe {{over the}} past 10 years have {{emphasized}} the health threat this lethal bacteria poses even for developed parts of the world. In contrast to cutaneous <b>anthrax,</b> <b>inhalational</b> disease in the US during the 2001 outbreaks and the newly identified injectional drug use form of disease in the UK and Germany {{have been associated with}} relatively high mortality rates. One notable aspect of these cases has been the difficulty in supporting patients once shock has developed. Anthrax bacilli produce several different components which likely contribute to this shock. Growing evidence indicates that both major anthrax toxins may produce substantial cardiovascular dysfunction. Lethal toxin (LT) can alter peripheral vascular function; it also has direct myocardial depressant effects. Edema toxin (ET) may have even more pronounced peripheral vascular effects than LT, including the ability to interfere with the actions of conventional vasopressors. Additionally, ET also appears capable of interfering with renal sodium and water retention. Importantly, the two toxins exert their actions via quite different mechanisms and therefore have the potential to worsen shock and outcome in an additive fashion. Finally, both toxins have the ability to inhibit host defense and microbial clearance, possibly contributing to the very high bacterial loads noted in patients dying with anthrax. This last point is clinically relevant since emerging data has begun to implicate other bacterial components such as anthrax cell wall in the shock and organ injury observed with infection. Taken together, accumulating evidence regarding the potential contribution of LT and ET to anthrax-associated shock supports efforts to develop adjunctive therapies that target both toxins in patients with progressive shock...|$|R
40|$|Anthrax is {{an often}} fatal {{bacterial}} infection {{that occurs when}} Bacillus anthracis endospores enter the body through one of three major routes: inhala-tional, cutaneous, or gastrointestinal [1]. Although the disease most commonly affects herbivores, which become infected after ingesting spores from the soil, humans {{are at risk of}} acquiring naturally occurring anthrax from contact with an-thrax-infected animals or anthrax-contaminated animal products [2]. Before the anthrax terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001, there was very little interest in anthrax as a serious human pathogen. Anthrax was viewed mainly as a veterinarian problem of minor importance, with most cases attributed to occupational exposure. In fact, before 2001, there were only 18 cases of inha-lational anthrax reported this century within the United States, the last of which was reported in 1976 [3]. However, this cavalier attitude toward anthrax changed following the 2001 terrorist attacks. From October 3, 2001 through November 16, 2001 there were 22 confirmed cases of <b>inhalational</b> and cutaneous <b>anthrax</b> in the United States, with 5 deaths [4]. Although the number of cases was relatively small, the attacks of 2001 have heightened concern about the feasibility of large-scale aerosol bioweapons attacks by terrorist groups. Historical perspective Although B anthracis has caused disease and death in animals and humans for centuries, it is only over the last several decades that research on anthrax as a biologic weapon has commenced. Despite the widespread ratification of and signing of the Biologic Weapons Conference (BWC) in the early 1970 s banning offensive bioweapons programs, it is believed that at least 17 nations continue to engage in such weapons programs [5].

50|$|Respiratory {{infection}} in humans is relatively rare and presents as two stages. It infects {{the lymph nodes}} in the chest first, rather than the lungs themselves, a condition called hemorrhagic mediastinitis, causing bloody fluid to accumulate in the chest cavity, therefore causing shortness of breath. The first stage causes cold and flu-like symptoms. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, and chills. This can last hours to days. Often many fatalities from <b>inhalational</b> <b>anthrax</b> are when the first stage is mistaken for the cold or flu and the victim doesn't seek treatment until the second stage, which is 90% fatal. The second (pneumonia) stage occurs when the infection spreads from the lymph nodes to the lungs. Symptoms of the second stage develop suddenly after hours or days of the first stage. Symptoms include high fever, extreme shortness of breath, shock, and rapid death within 48 hours in fatal cases. Historical mortality rates were over 85%, but, when treated early (seen in the 2001 anthrax attacks), observed case fatality rate dropped to 45%.

We conducted a simulation study to compare clinical case finding with syndromic surveillance for detection of an outbreak of <b>inhalational</b> <b>anthrax.</b> After simulated release of 1 kg of anthrax spores, the proportion of outbreaks detected first by syndromic surveillance was 0. 59 at a specificity of 0. 9 and 0. 28 at a specificity of 0. 975. The mean detection benefit of syndromic surveillance was 1. 0 day at a specificity of 0. 9 and 0. 32 days at a specificity of 0. 975. When syndromic surveillance was sufficiently sensitive to detect a substantial proportion of outbreaks before clinical case finding, it generated frequent false alarms. In the early stage of an <b>inhalational</b> <b>anthrax</b> outbreak, a 1 -day delay in the initiation of chemoprophylaxis and treatment of exposed persons can result in thousands of additional deaths and millions of dollars of additional expenditures (1, 2).

Bioterrorist attacks with <b>inhalational</b> <b>anthrax</b> have prompted {{the development of more}} effective treatments. Antibodies against anthrax toxin have been shown to decrease mortality in animal studies. Raxibacumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody developed against <b>inhalational</b> <b>anthrax.</b> The drug received approval after human studies showed its safety and animal studies demonstrated its efficacy for treatment as well as prophylaxis against <b>inhalational</b> <b>anthrax.</b> It works by preventing binding of the protective antigen component of the anthrax toxin to its receptors in host cells, thereby blocking the toxin&# 39;s deleterious effects. Recently updated therapy guidelines for Bacillus anthracis recommend the use of antitoxin treatment.
