40|$|Using {{a set of}} hand-collected data, I {{study the}} {{economic}} consequences of APB 14 - 1, adopted in 2008, which requires that issuers of cash-settled convertible debt divide the total proceeds from the issuances into liability and equity components (“bifurcation”). First, I find that issuers {{are more likely to}} reduce the outstanding amount of cash-settled convertible debt when the increase (decrease) in interest expense (leverage ratio) resulting from the bifurcation process is higher (lower). The probability of <b>early</b> <b>repurchase</b> is higher when mandatory accounting changes are included in the calculation of debt covenant compliance. This finding is consistent with the debt contracting hypothesis that APB 14 - 1 increases the probability of debt covenant violations. Next, I examine whether credit rating agencies evaluate the issuers’ accounting information differently after the adoption of APB 14 - 1. I find that the financial ratios in the post- 2008 period, such as interest coverage ratios and leverage ratios, can better explain the issuers’ credit ratings than those in the pre- 2008 period. Finally, I find that shareholders of cash-settled convertible bond issuers experience an overall loss of wealth of 2. 1 % associated with APB 14 - 1. The negative shareholder reactions are greater when issuers use rolling GAAP in their bank loan agreements to calculate debt covenant compliance than if they do not. These empirical results are consistent with the notion that mandatory changes in financial reporting of cash-settled convertible debt have real effects on managerial behavior and the usefulness of information from financial statements used by the credit market...|$|E
50|$|During {{this same}} period, the Revlon board had {{commenced}} discussions with Forstmann, Little regarding a possible leveraged buyout led by Forstmann {{as an alternative}} to the acquisition by Pantry Pride. It quickly reached agreement in principle on a transaction at a price of $56. The terms of the proposed deal importantly included a waiver of the restrictive covenants contained in the notes issued by Revlon in the <b>earlier</b> <b>repurchase.</b> The announcement of the proposed deal, and in particular the anticipated waiver of the covenants, sent the trading value of the notes into a steep decline, engendering threats of litigation from now irate noteholders.|$|R
40|$|The global luxury market reached € 223 {{billion in}} sales in 2014 (Bain 2 ̆ 6 Company, 2014). There are various factors {{surrounding}} the behavior of luxury consumption, such as emotional brand attachment, brand-self congruity, perceived investment, and repurchase intentions. This study investigated influences of generational cohorts—older BB, younger BB, generation X, and Millennials—on consumer trait variables introduced <b>earlier</b> and <b>repurchase</b> intentions of luxury goods among affluent US consumers to offer insights regarding the variances and/or similarities among the cohorts to the luxury marketing and retail industries...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} how repurchase announcements {{affect the}} stock price of the repurchasing firm and its competing firms in the same industry. We test mimicking hypothesis and similarity hypothesis. The mimicking hypothesis assumes that repurchase announcement, sends a positive signal about the repurchasing firm but a negative one on its competitors. To avoid the negative impact, the competing firms to mimic the repurchasing firm by repurchasing themselves. The similarity hypothesis assumes that the firms announcing repurchase policies have few investment opportunities, and do not need much cash. The other firms in the same industry repurchase because they face similar prospects as those firms that made <b>earlier</b> <b>repurchase</b> announcements. We use the data of Taiwan listed firms from 2000 to 2008. Our results support the mimicking hypothesis. Repurchases are chosen as a strategic reaction to other firms' repurchasing decisions but not driven {{by the desire to}} take advantage of an undervalued stock price. 本研究分析上市公司宣告實施庫藏股後，對該公司股價及同產業未宣告公司的影響。我們以Massa, Reham, and Vermaelen (2007) 提出的模仿假說與相似假說來檢驗公司實施庫藏股的動機。模仿假說是指，當公司宣告庫藏股買回，同產業內其他對應公司若未跟進，市場可能做出負面解讀，因此對應公司也跟進買回庫藏股。相似假說主張，一個成熟公司宣告實施庫藏股，隱含的意義是預期投資機會的減少，同產業之對應公司，因為處於相似的環境，所以也做出實施庫藏股的決策。 本研究使用 2000 年 8 月至 2008 年 12 月，台灣上市公司實施庫藏股的資料進行檢定，結果支持模仿假說，台灣公司實施庫藏股是模仿行為，並不是因為股價被低估。第一章 緒論	 1 第一節 研究動機	 1 第二節 研究架構	 2 第二章 文獻探討	 3 第一節 庫藏股與績效相關文獻	 3 第二節 模仿假說與相似假說	 6 第三章 研究方法	 9 第一節 資料來源	 9 第二節 研究假設	 9 第三節 研究方法及變數說明	 12 第四章 實證研究	 15 第一節 敘述統計表	 15 第二節 宣告庫藏股買回公司的成熟度	 16 第三節 宣告庫藏股買回後的市場反應	 16 第四節 宣告庫藏股買回對同產業未宣告公司的影響	 20 第五節 庫藏股買回決策	 23 第五章 結論	 28 附錄：變數定義	 30 參考文獻	 3...|$|R
5000|$|A {{wash sale}} (not to be {{confused}} with a wash trade) is a sale of a security (stock, bonds, options) at a loss and repurchase of the same or substantially identical security shortly before or after. [...] The regulations around wash sales are to protect against an investor who holds an unrealized loss and wishes to make it claimable as a tax deduction within the current tax year. The security is then repurchased in the hope that it will recover its previous value, which would only become taxable in some future tax year. A wash sale can take place {{at any time during the}} year. In the UK, a similar practice which specifically takes place at the end of a calendar year is known as bed and breakfasting. In a bed-and-breakfasting transaction, a position is sold on the last trading day of the year (typically late in the trading session) to establish a tax loss. The same position is then <b>repurchased</b> <b>early</b> on the first session of the new trading year, to restore the position (albeit at a lower cost basis). The term, therefore, derives its name from the late sale and <b>early</b> morning <b>repurchase.</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose - China is the world’s largest {{consumer}} market for smartphones. Early adopters are highly influential in consumers’ decisions of new technologies. Therefore, understanding Chinese early adopters’ {{decision making in}} the smartphone market is of crucial importance to smartphone companies. There is a dearth of in-depth studies on the factors affecting consumers’ repurchase intention for smartphones. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to narrow this knowledge gap by developing a new conceptual framework explaining <b>early</b> adopters’ <b>repurchase</b> intention of smartphones. Design/methodology/approach - Using 30 face-to-face interviews with Chinese early adopters of smartphones, the authors built a new theoretical framework to explain the factors that influence their repurchase intention. Findings - Repurchase intention of smartphones is determined by aesthetic and utilitarian product-related factors (design appeal, perceived usefulness), socio-cultural factors (subjective norms, mianzi/face considerations), and brand-related factors (brand popularity, brand’s country of origin, perceived brand quality, and brand loyalty). The emerging framework also explores the factors affecting enhancing, maintaining, and saving mianzi/face. Originality/value - In contrast to existing technology-driven models, the study’s emerging framework shows how aesthetic, socio-cultural, and brand-related factors can offer new insights in understanding repurchase intention in a rapidly developing market. As these factors are rarely examined in the information technology and/or marketing literatures, potential knowledge contribution can be highly expected...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{changes in}} managers’ financial reporting around two major corporate financing events, accelerated share repurchases (ASRs) and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). The first essay provides evidence on managerial motives for initiating ASRs, a recent and important innovation in repurchase methods, by examining managers’ financial reporting behavior around ASRs and post-ASR performance. ASR firms report positive discretionary accruals {{in the quarter}} of the repurchase announcement and that the upward earnings management increases with the percentage of equity repurchased, initiation of the <b>repurchase</b> <b>earlier</b> in the quarter, and CEO’s bonus compensation as a fraction of total compensation. There is however a negative association between the ASR announcement returns and pre-repurchase positive discretionary accruals, suggesting that investors perceive the positive discretionary accruals {{as the result of}} managerial opportunism (i. e., boosting EPS) rather than managerial optimism (i. e., signaling undervaluation). Further, ASR announcements are not followed by an increase in operating performance. There is also no evidence of positive long-run abnormal stock performance during the post-ASR period. The results suggest that managers use ASRs along with positive discretionary accruals to manage reported EPS rather than to signal their favorable private information about firms’ prospects. 	The second essay examines the relation between firms’ financial constraints and their financial reporting during periods when they attempt to raise equity capital. Specifically, I investigate whether financially constrained firms tend to manage their earnings more aggressively around SEOs as compared to financially unconstrained firms. By using different measures of financial constraints, I document that constrained issuers, which cannot credibly signal the absence of aggressive earnings management, report higher income-increasing accruals than unconstrained issuers. I also find that investors correctly conjecture this greater earnings inflation and adjust issuers’ stock prices accordingly {{at the time of the}} offering. The evidence suggests that the aggressive earnings management by constrained issuers is not simply the result of managerial opportunism but rather a rational response to anticipated market behavior at offering announcements. ...|$|R
