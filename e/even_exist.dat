5|$|During {{most of the}} 4th century, the Christian {{community}} was small, poor, and carried no influence in the city. The church was insignificant and its members {{were not allowed to}} hold political office. However, conversion to Christianity in Gaza was spearheaded under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420. In 402, after obtaining a decree from the emperor, he ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed and idol worship was forbidden by the Byzantine government. Paganism continued and Christians were still persecuted in the city, forcing St. Porphyrius to undertake more measures. As a result of his persuasion, Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas in 406. (Note that according to MacMullen it is likely that Porphyrius did not <b>even</b> <b>exist.)</b> Persecution against Christians did not cease, but it was less harsh and frequent than previously. A large 6th century synagogue with a mosaic tile floor depicting King David was discovered in Gaza. An inscription states that the floor was donated in 508–509 CE by two merchant brothers. Around 540, Gaza became the starting point for pilgrimages to the Sinai Peninsula. It was an important city in the early Christian world and many famous scholars taught at its academy of rhetoric, including 6th-century scholar Procopius of Gaza. The celebrated Church of Saint Sergius was built in this century.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} as to {{the early}} seat of the ruling clan. Modern archeology {{has shown that the}} gord in Gniezno did not <b>even</b> <b>exist</b> before about 940. This fact eliminates the possibility of Gniezno's early central role, which is what had long been believed, based on the account given by Gallus Anonymus. The relics found in Giecz (including a great concentration of silver treasures), where the original gord was built some 80 years earlier, point to that location. Other likely early capitals include the old gords of Grzybowo, Kalisz or Poznań. Poznań, which is older than Gniezno, was probably the original site of Mieszko's court in the earlier years of his reign. The first cathedral church, a monumental structure, was erected there. The events of 974–78, when Mieszko, like his brother-in-law Boleslaus II of Bohemia, supported Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, in his rebellion against Otto II, created a threat of the emperor's retribution. The situation probably motivated Mieszko to move the government to Gniezno, which was safer due to its more eastern location. The emperor's response turned out to be ineffective, but this geographical advantage continued in the years to come. The growing importance of Gniezno was reflected in the addition around 980 of a new southern part to the original two segments of the gord. In the existing summary of the Dagome iudex document written in 991-92 before Mieszko's death, Mieszko's state is referred to as Civitas Gnesnensis, or the Gniezno State.|$|E

25|$|Adult Nursing Relationship (ANR): The {{suckling}} of {{milk from}} a female's breast {{on a regular}} basis from one or more partner(s).

Couples may begin an ANR by transferring regular suckling from a child to a sexual partner (e.g. spouse). Such a relationship may form as an expression of close intimacy and mutual tenderness, and may <b>even</b> <b>exist</b> without sex. Breastfeeding can have a strong stabilizing effect on the partnership. The breastfeeding woman may experience orgasms or a pleasurable let-down reflex.|$|E
25|$|The first {{setback for}} the {{expedition}} was the ridicule of the Scandinavian press, publishing stories in February 1939 claiming the expedition {{was based on}} false ideas about Icelandic heritage and sought old church records which did not <b>even</b> <b>exist.</b> An enraged Himmler publicly shut down the trip completely, but after calming down he allowed the planning of the trip to be secretly continued. The final setback occurred when Himmler’s personal staff was unable to get enough Icelandic crowns—Iceland’s currency. Not being able to quickly solve this problem, the trip was rescheduled for the summer of 1940. In May 1940, the British invaded neutral Iceland, but when the war had started the expedition had already been shelved.|$|E
25|$|Semiotics {{operates}} {{under the}} theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective.

Rosalind Krauss espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. Mieke Bal argued similarly that meaning does not <b>even</b> <b>exist</b> until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.|$|E

The raid would have passed without any loss to the commandos but for the death of a commando officer by friendly fire from an over-alert commando soldier and the capture of 70 men who, after getting lost, ended up on the wrong evacuation beach and became prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|After her resurrection, Psylocke {{was shown}} to be immune to all forms of psionic {{manipulations}} such as mind-reading, mind-control or mental attacks, and attempts of telepathic communication. This {{is a result of}} her brother Jamie's manipulation of the quantum strings that comprise her body. She is also immune or at least highly resistant to other psionic-based powers like the Savage Land Mutate Vertigo's disorientation power, or Nocturne's mind possessing abilities. Due to Jamie's alterations, Psylocke is also immune to any physical and mental alteration by beings who can radically restructure reality, such as Proteus. She can, however, still be killed in more traditional manners, such as being stabbed or shot. She is also at least partially resistant to magical manipulation. Somehow these various immunities also affect her detectability from higher order technological equipment. For example, all sensor-arrays of the Exiles Crystal Palace are not able to detect her—as if she does not <b>even</b> <b>exist.</b> Beside this immunity, she is able to use her telekinesis to modify her own molecular structure to render herself invisible to at least the naked eye.|$|E

500|$|The 2010 TIP {{report also}} {{condemned}} Canada's {{lack of a}} national action plan, and said that Canada is a destination, source, and transit country for forced prostitution, unfree labour, the prostitution of children, {{and other forms of}} human trafficking. The report said that the federal and provincial governments of Canada were not cooperating sufficiently with respect to policing these crimes, and that a strategy for cooperation should be formulated in a national action plan. York Regional Police vice unit Detective Thai Truong agreed with the report's assessment, and said that [...] "a unified understanding and approach" [...] to human trafficking [...] "does not <b>even</b> <b>exist</b> at the municipal level of policing" [...] in Canada. Also in 2010, retired Toronto Police Service officer Dave Perry said that Canada's lack of a national action plan had resulted in the country failing to adequately deal with North Preston's Finest, a gang that engages in sex trafficking between Nova Scotia and Toronto. Perry had led a police taskforce against the gang in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but he said that without a national action plan, politicians lost interest in the endeavour and funding ran out.

500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed, {{triggering a}} media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy. The Edge said, [...] "A lot of nights {{it felt like}} quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed {{by a lot of}} people in the audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality and it was quite hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said, [...] "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to have been a part of a group who were trying to do something." [...] During a transmission for the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via satellite, [...] "We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we <b>even</b> <b>exist.</b> And we're all going to die." [...] Some people close to the band joined the War Child charity project, including Brian Eno. Writer Bill Flanagan believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of [...] "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV". U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, eventually fulfilling this commitment on their 1997 PopMart Tour.|$|E
500|$|Ron Guidry {{was named}} the Yankees' {{starting}} pitcher for the October 2 playoff game at Fenway Park. Guidry was able to pitch [...] "because of Lemon's good planning." [...] The Yankees defeated Boston for the division title in the tie-breaker game, punctuated both by a dramatic three-run home run by Bucky Dent in the seventh inning, and an eighth-inning homer by Reggie Jackson that proved the game's winning run. Lemon became the third manager in MLB history to replace another mid-season and win the pennant. Lemon's Yankees then beat the Royals in the ALCS and defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the World Series title. With the Series win, Lemon became the first AL manager and third MLB manager {{to take over a}} team mid-season and win a World Series. Before the World Series, one columnist wrote, [...] "...many observers feel that Lemon's low-keyed approach with the Yankees' temperamental millionaires as compared to the combativeness of Martin served to mold a spirit of togetherness among the Yankees that did not <b>even</b> <b>exist</b> last year when they won it all." [...] Lemon and his handling of the season was described in The New York Times as [...] "an island of calm in a stormy summer." [...] Changes Lemon made during the season included returning Thurman Munson to the team's every day catcher (he had been playing in the outfield), putting Jackson in the clean-up spot in the batting order and becoming the regular right fielder, and pitching Ed Figueroa every fourth day (instead of fifth).
