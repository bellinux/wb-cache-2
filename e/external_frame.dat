25|$|<b>External</b> <b>frame</b> packs were {{designed}} to carry heavy loads (>20kg or 40lb), giving the wearer more support and protection and better weight distribution than a simple, frameless strapped bag. Wooden pack frames were used for centuries around the world. Ötzi the Iceman may have used one in Copper Age Alpine Italy, though some archaeologists believe the frame found with the body {{was part of a}} snowshoe. Such packs are common in military and mountaineering applications; metal versions first appeared in the mid-20th century.|$|E
25|$|Precession, nutation, and {{intrinsic}} rotation (spin) {{are defined}} as the movements obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. These motions are not {{expressed in terms of}} the <b>external</b> <b>frame,</b> or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system, where the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis z, the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves.|$|E

25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack {{is a recent}} innovation, invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, {{who went on to}} found Lowe Alpine and Lowepro, companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment. An internal-frame pack has a large fabric section around an {{internal frame}} composed of strips of either aluminum, titanium or plastic, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. A complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The internal frame permits the pack to fit closely to the wearer's back and minimizes shifting of the load, which is desirable when participating in activities that involve upper-body movement such as scrambling over rocky surfaces and skiing. However, the tight fit reduces ventilation, so these type of packs tend to be more sweaty than <b>external</b> <b>frame</b> packs. The internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment; a few lash points (including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items) may be present, but as the frame is completely integrated, it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the pack. Internal frame packs originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking, but newer models have improved greatly in these respects. In addition, because of their snug fit, the improved internal frame models have largely replaced <b>external</b> <b>frame</b> backpacks for many activities.|$|E
25|$|Euler {{rotations}} {{provide an}} alternative {{description of a}} rotation. It is a composition of three rotations defined as the movement obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. Euler rotations are never {{expressed in terms of}} the <b>external</b> <b>frame,</b> or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system, where the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis z, the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves.|$|E
25|$|The second {{competing}} proposal, that of {{the national}} Meteorology Committee, emerged in January 1932 and was soon abandoned, also {{for the lack of}} finance. This allowed the third competitor, the Air Forces, a solid lead in time. USSR-1, the Air Forces stratospheric balloon, was designed by Georgy Prokofiev with assistance of Vladimir Chizhevsky, Konstantin Godunov and the Air Force Academy staff. Their balloon, built in Moscow by professional aircraft technicians, proved to be far safer than Vasenko's. It had two airtight hatches with fast-opening locks; ballast was carried externally and could be instantly released on demand. The gondola was reinforced with an internal and an <b>external</b> <b>frame</b> that prevented direct contact between the airtight compartment's skin and suspension cables. Osoaviakhim-1 lacked all these safety features.|$|E
30|$|Negative OTL experiences, {{coupled with}} strong {{internal}} or <b>external</b> <b>framing,</b> {{are indicative of}} a loss of agency of either the student or the instructor. Strong <b>external</b> <b>framing</b> that mandates a strong internal framing indicates that the instructor has limited agency in providing positive OTL for her students. Similarly, strong internal framing coupled with a negative OTL experience indicates the students have reduced agency {{in their ability to}} learn. This sense of loss of student agency is of particular importance in Calculus I, as self-efficacy is a strong predictor of first-year college GPA (Zajacova et al. 2005).|$|R
30|$|Instructors {{are likely}} to feel {{the least amount of}} agency in the {{classroom}} when there is strong <b>external</b> <b>framing</b> coupled with weak internal framing—such as in a highly coordinated course being taught with a student-centered approach. Instructors {{are likely to}} feel the most agency when there is weak <b>external</b> <b>framing</b> coupled with strong internal framing—such as in a course with high instructor autonomy being taught in a rigid, lecture-based approach. Students’ perceptions of agency in the classroom are likely less based on external framing; their perception of having the most agency in the classroom will likely occur with weak internal framing, regardless if this is coupled with strong or weak <b>external</b> <b>framing</b> as they are often unaware of external factors. If the course is taught {{in a way that does}} not respond to students’ needs, the students will likely feel that they have little control over the OTL in class, whether this be because of a packed and rigid common curriculum or because of the individual instructor’s decision to teach in such a way. Thus, we would expect that students will feel that they did not have enough time to understand difficult ideas in classes where students have the least agency in the classroom, i.e., in classes with strong internal framing. Similarly, we would expect instructors to feel that there was not enough time for their students to understand difficult ideas when there is strong <b>external</b> <b>framing.</b>|$|R

25|$|Backpacks {{in general}} fall {{into one of}} four categories: frameless, <b>external</b> <b>frame,</b> {{internal}} frame, and bodypack. A pack frame, when present, serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body more appropriately, by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs. Most of the weight is therefore taken off the shoulders, reducing the chance of injury from shoulder strap pressure (many backpacks equipped solely with shoulder straps can affect the posture of a person carrying more than 14kg (30lbs)), as well as being less restrictive of the upper body range of motion. Most backpacks are capable of being closed with either a buckle mechanism, a zipper, or a dry-bag type closure though a few models use a drawstring fitted with a cord lock for the main compartment.|$|E
25|$|Empathy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of humanistic therapy. This idea focuses on the therapist’s ability to see the world through the eyes of the client. Without this, therapists can be forced to apply an <b>external</b> <b>frame</b> of reference where the therapist is no longer understanding the actions and thoughts of the client as the client would, but strictly as a therapist which defeats the purpose of humanistic therapy. Included in empathizing, unconditional positive regard {{is one of the}} key elements of humanistic psychology. Unconditional positive regard refers to the care that the therapist needs to have for the client. This ensures that the therapist does not become the authority figure in the relationship allowing for a more open flow of information as well as a kinder relationship between the two. A therapist practicing humanistic therapy needs to show a willingness to listen and ensure the comfort of the patient where genuine feelings may be shared but are not forced upon someone. Marshall Rosenberg, one of Carl Rogers' students, emphasizes empathy in the relationship in his concept of Nonviolent Communication.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>external</b> <b>frame</b> is {{typically}} made from aluminum, other lightweight metal alloy, and recently reinforced synthetic polymers or plastic and {{is equipped with}} a system of straps and tautly-stretched netting which prevents contact between the metal frame and user's back. In addition to comfort, this [...] "stand-off" [...] provides the additional benefit of creating air circulation between the frame and the wearer's back. For this reason, <b>external</b> <b>frame</b> packs are generally considered to be a [...] "cooler load" [...] than internal frame designs. <b>External</b> <b>frame</b> packs have a fabric [...] "sack" [...] portion which is usually smaller than that of internal frame packs, but have exposed frame portions above and below the sack to accommodate attachment of larger items.

Military packs are often <b>external</b> <b>frame</b> designs due to their ability to carry loads of different shapes, sizes and weights.|$|E
30|$|Both <b>external</b> and {{internal}} <b>framing</b> {{can either be}} strong or weak, where the degree of framing {{is indicative of the}} degree to which different actors control, or feel they have agency to control, what happens in the class (Hoadley 2003). A strong <b>external</b> <b>framing</b> indicates that the instructor has little control over what or how she teaches. For instance, we may expect a new graduate teaching assistant who is teaching a coordinated section of calculus to have strong <b>external</b> <b>framing.</b> A weak <b>external</b> <b>framing</b> indicates that the instructor has more freedom related to content, exposure, and emphasis in the course, and thus provides the instructor more control over the OTLs she provides. A strong internal framing indicates that the teacher sets the pace and emphasis of the course, regardless of cues from the students, whereas a weak internal framing indicates that the instructor has a less ridged structure for the course, yielding some of the agency and power to the students. For instance, a classroom where the teacher regularly adjusts the lesson based on feedback from the students has weak internal framing. While this can occur during a very interactive lecture, this sort of weak framing is typical of classrooms implementing student-centered instructional approaches, as these approaches are, by design, guided by the students rather than the instructor (Haugen 2011).|$|R

2500|$|The {{other type}} of <b>external</b> <b>frame</b> which {{recently}} was proposed, is made from composite plastic which is not flexible like current backpack straps and also {{it is a kind}} of material that can be shaped like human spine curvature. In this type of backpack, load directly transfers to the shoulders through the non-flexible straps. This non-flexible structure diminishes the momentum at lumbar region of the back. Strap curvature is shaped close to spine curvature and there are two flexible drawstrings to prevent backpack movement in transverse plane. The straps of this backpack are wide enough to distribute the pressure on shoulders and also a white glass wool layer is added to the internal part of them to absorb dynamic forces, which could be produced through walking. This backpack type is an experimental sample that need further options to be prepared for [...] usage. One of the benefits of backpack with <b>external</b> <b>frame</b> is preventing the spine to incline forward during walking that would be helpful in preventing damage of long term backpack carrying.|$|E

30|$|<b>External</b> <b>framing</b> {{also has}} a strong {{influence}} over how much control the instructor can yield to the students (i.e., the internal framing). For instance, an instructor might be very aware that the content, exposure, or emphasis of their course is not supporting student learning, but strong <b>external</b> <b>framing</b> prohibits adjusting the OTL for her students (e.g., {{she does not have}} the option to alter the pacing in class based on feedback from students because of the external constraints). Alternatively, it may be the case that an instructor is not adjusting the OTL for her students because she is teaching in a way that inhibits her from receiving feedback from students (e.g., by not asking for students to give input in class) or not attending to this feedback (e.g., by not adjusting her teaching based on student input). In either scenario, the students would experience strong internal framing that results in the students lacking the ability to influence their OTL.|$|R

40|$|Equistiffness of elastic {{suspension}} in Dynamically Tuned Gyroscopes (DTG) {{is a necessary}} condition of its effective operation.

In this work we obtained relations between the geometric parameters of the elastic elements in different frames of the considered elastic suspension that are necessary for the fulfillment of the equistiffness condition. We have also shown theoretical ability of achieving linear equistiffness in the considered double-framed elastic suspension through the selection of appropriate geometric dimensions of the elastic elements of the internal and <b>external</b> <b>frames.</b> It is observed that in order to achieve maximum accuracy in real DTG one has to consider complience in internal and <b>external</b> <b>frames.</b> ????? ??????????????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????? ?? ?????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????????

30|$|Similarly, {{from the}} instructor’s {{perspective}} {{not having enough}} time to help students understand difficult ideas {{may be related to}} a variety of things, such as the instructor felt that she had to teach faster than she would have preferred because of <b>external</b> <b>framing,</b> or that the students were not capable of learning the material presented in the amount of time available (and perhaps may not be capable of learning the material regardless of the amount of time available).|$|R

30|$|From instructors’ perspectives, {{multiple}} factors {{contribute to}} how they decide to structure a course in regard to content coverage, exposure, and emphasis. For instance, 99 % of Calculus I students are not math majors, with 30 % coming from engineering (Bressoud et al. 2013). As a result, Calculus I is primarily a service course, where the client disciplines (e.g., engineering, physics, chemistry) have a strong influence over what topics are taught. Additionally, {{because of the large}} number sections taught at a university in any given semester, Calculus I courses are often coordinated (Rasmussen and Ellis 2015). This coordination frequently includes a common syllabus, schedule, textbook, exams, and homework. These factors, all external to the student-teacher interactions within the classroom, contribute the <b>external</b> <b>framing</b> of the course. <b>External</b> <b>framing</b> refers to the influence of agents outside of the classroom—such as administrators, professional societies, policy documents, and parents—over various aspects of teaching, including coverage and pacing (Hoadley 2003). Internal framing refers to the amount of influence, or perceived influence, of the students over various aspects of teaching (Haugen 2011). Internal factors influencing content coverage, exposure, and emphasis include interactions between the instructor and the students, student preparation, or perceptions thereof, and the results and influence of formative and summative assessments.|$|R
