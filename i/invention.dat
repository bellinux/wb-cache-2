40|$|Abstract This paper {{looks at}} the special {{characteristics}} of radical <b>inventions.</b> It tries to identify those variables that differentiate radical <b>inventions</b> from non-radical <b>inventions.</b> Since radical <b>inventions</b> are {{very important for the}} economy as a whole and for the individual firm performances, understanding what makes radical <b>inventions</b> differ from non-radical <b>inventions</b> is very important. For our research we made use of the EPO (European Patent Office) database on patents. We used the number of forward patent citations per patent to identify radical from non-radical <b>inventions.</b> For our analysis we used the backward patent citations per patent. In order to test if the two groups we are considering are truly different and to see on what factors they differ we made use of discriminant function analysis. Some of our main conclusions are that radical <b>inventions</b> are to a higher degree based on existing knowledge than non-radical <b>inventions.</b> Also the combination of emergent and mature knowledge is more important for radical <b>inventions.</b> A further result that follows from our analysis is that radical <b>inventions</b> are induced by the recombination over more knowledge domains as compared to non-radical <b>inventions.</b> Our research hints also on the importance of alliances and an open innovation system for the development of radical <b>inventions.</b> Key words radical <b>inventions,</b> patents, organizational learning, alliances...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to trace}} down {{the origins of}} radical <b>inventions.</b> In spite of many {{theoretical}} discussions {{on the effect of}} radical <b>inventions,</b> the specific nature of radical <b>inventions</b> has received much less attention in the theoretical and empirical literature. We try to fill that void by an empirical investigation into the specific origins of radical <b>inventions.</b> We explore this issue by a close examination of 157 individual patents, which are selected from a pool of more than 300, 000 patents. In contrast to the conventional wisdom that radical <b>inventions</b> are based less on existing knowledge, we find that they are to a higher degree based on existing knowledge than non-radical <b>inventions.</b> A further result that follows from our analysis is that radical <b>inventions</b> are induced by the recombination over more knowledge domains. The combination of knowledge from domains that might usually not be connected seems to deliver more radical <b>inventions.</b> Radical <b>inventions</b> Patents Alliances Open innovation Organizational learning...|$|R

In the Chinese agricultural text Qimin Yaoshu written by the Northern Wei Dynasty official Jia Sixie. Harrows were originally called iron-teeth rakes due to its shaping. According to it's shape, the Chinese harrow was divided into three sub-classifications: Strip rake, Y-shaped rake, and square rake. The harrows seen in the murals of the Wei and Jin Dynasties are strip rakes.|$|E

Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb the <b>invention</b> of the whiskey sour—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.|$|E
