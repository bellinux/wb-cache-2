From the first of its 900-odd pages, I knew, and my friends at the University of Sussex knew, that this was something else. We talked about it in the bar and on the bus and in the refectory queue. Imagine that: young male students more interested in a book than in gooseberry tart and custard.|$|E
500|$|Four Jeremy {{letters were}} written at about 1910 to Drew Fayle who thought Jeremy should marry. In one letter, Sir Isaac {{promises}} Master Fayle {{a piece of}} wedding cake should Jeremy marry and, in another letter, Ptolemy writes that Jeremy's parties [...] "would be much more agreeable {{if there were a}} lady to preside at the table." [...] Jeremy writes in the third letter: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> sprigged waistcoat & my maroon tail-coat I had hopes ... but I am alone ... if there were a 'Mrs. Jeremy Fisher' she might object to snails. It is some satisfaction {{to be able to have}} as much water & mud in the house as a person likes." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{his playing}} career, Maxwell {{received}} several offers to turn professional. [...] the National Hockey Association's Toronto Blueshirts offered him $1,500 {{to join their}} team, while representatives of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association made an offer of $1,800 the following season. [...] He turned both offers down, preferring to remain an amateur. His feelings on what constituted an amateur player were so strong that he quit playing hockey following the 1915 Allan Cup as {{the nature of the}} senior game at the time failed to meet his expectations: [...] "When I played, <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> own skates and boots. When I found out some of the others were getting paid, I quit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The former cabinet-maker did not {{restrict}} {{himself to}} the income from the Lord Mayor of London. In fact, his famous words: [...] "What do you think <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> place for, but {{to make the most}} of it?" [...] used to justify his crimes, describe the readiness with which he embraced his [...] "duties". Not being the first to use the position as a form of legal theft, he regularised the practice. He had probably acted as a middleman or receiver between thieves and victims several years before taking the post, otherwise it would be difficult to explain his familiarity with London's underworld. He made full use of his authority as a leverage to build or extend his thief-taking business and stayed as a middleman in it. Hitchen managed to regulate about 2000 thieves and organise for them to steal and fence the stolen merchandise through him, a practice pickpockets would find more profitable or less dangerous than going to a pawnbroker, since most desperate victims of the theft were ready to pay a fee negotiated by the [...] "finder" [...] (Hitchen) for the return of their stolen items.|$|E

60|$|I took a lead to {{the extent}} of another £500, which was all that I could afford. I admit that it was a shock to such trust in human nature as {{remained}} to me when I discovered subsequently that the 1,000 shares which <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> for <b>my</b> £500 had really been the property of Jacob, although they appeared to be sold to me in various other names.|$|R
60|$|The {{landlord}} {{was quiet}} and reasonable, even friendly, in the morning. He {{wanted to talk to}} me: where had <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> boots, was his first question.

He was much impressed by them: such good boots, of such soft, strong, beautiful leather; he had not seen such boots for a long time.|$|E

60|$|We {{remained}} not {{the less}} friends with that mystery between us; and <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> last melon {{of him on}} my last morning, when the early September had turned somewhat sharply chill. That turn made me ask what the winter was in York, and he boasted it very cold, with ice and snow aplenty, and degrees of frost much like our own. But apparently those York women resisted it and remained of a tenderness which contrasted to their advantage with the summer hardness of our women.|$|E
6000|$|My {{photograph}} {{shows the}} new suit which <b>I</b> had <b>bought</b> on <b>my</b> own responsibility this time, but no camera could possibly catch {{the glow of}} inward satisfaction which warmed my heart. It was a brown cassimere, coat, trousers and vest all alike,--and the trousers fitted me! Furthermore as <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> it without <b>my</b> father's help, my selection was made for esthetic reasons without regard to durability or warmth. It was mine--in the fullest sense--and when I next entered chapel I felt not merely draped, but defended. I walked to my seat with confident security, a well-dressed person. I had a [...] "boughten" [...] shirt also, two boxes of paper cuffs, and two new ties, a black one for every day and a white one for Sunday.|$|R

I will leave it with you, and any name that you fix on she shall have. Only, please choose one that {{only two or}} three boats, and those not about the same size, have got.

But I warn you, that it will involve your having to go down to Poole to christen her." ...|$|R

Thirty guineas on the seaside, or sixty if ye set me on the Linnhe Loch. Take it, if ye will; if not, ye can do your worst." ...|$|E
60|$|I think I {{committed}} {{every possible}} absurdity {{in the way}} of preparation for this blessed event. I turn hot when I remember the cravat <b>I</b> <b>bought.</b> <b>My</b> boots might be placed in any collection of instruments of torture. I provided, and sent down by the Norwood coach the night before, a delicate little hamper, amounting in itself, I thought, almost to a declaration. There were crackers in it with the tenderest mottoes that could be got for money. At six in the morning, I was in Covent Garden Market, buying a bouquet for Dora. At ten I was on horseback (I hired a gallant grey, for the occasion), with the bouquet in my hat, to keep it fresh, trotting down to Norwood.|$|E
6000|$|The {{austerity}} of Waterloo Station was lightened on {{the following}} morning at ten minutes to eleven, when I arrived to catch the train to Combe Regis, by several gleams of sunshine {{and a great deal}} of bustle and activity on the various platforms. A porter took my suitcase and golf-clubs, and arranged an assignation on Number 6 platform. <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> ticket, and made my way to the bookstall, where, in the interests of trade, I inquired in a loud and penetrating voice if they had got Jeremy Garnet's [...] "Manoeuvres of Arthur." [...] Being informed that they had not, I clicked my tongue reproachfully, advised them to order in a supply, as the demand was likely to be large, and spent a couple of shillings on a magazine and some weekly papers. Then, with ten minutes to spare, I went off in search of Ukridge.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{exactly what}} I did," [...] John agreed, smiling. [...] "I had a {{sovereign}} {{in my pocket}} when <b>I</b> had <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> ticket; {{and by the time}} I had paid for my dinner on the train, and tipped the men--well, I hadn't a great deal left to go shopping with. I stayed at the St. Pancras Hotel, and telephoned to my solicitor before I got up this morning to have him send me some money. The joke of it was," [...] he went on, joining in the girls' laughter, [...] "that Mr. Appleton has been worrying me for months to come up and talk over reinvestments, and take control of the money my uncle left me; and when I came at last, I arrived like a pauper. He went out himself and <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> shirt." ...|$|R

6000|$|The forenoon of {{the next}} day was {{occupied}} in making sundry small purchases. We laid in seven days' provisions for the journey; repacked our boxes, polished and loaded our arms, and attired ourselves appropriately for the road. By the advice of Amm Jamal[FN#15] I dressed as an Arab, in order to avoid paying the Jizyat, a capitation tax [FN#16] which, upon this road, the settled tribes extort from stranger travellers; and he warned me not to speak any language but Arabic, even to my [...] "slave," [...] in the vicinity of a village. <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> for <b>my</b> own convenience a Shugduf or litter[FN#17] for which I paid two dollars.

60|$|The first {{answer that}} {{naturally}} occurs to one is that, although different people {{may see the}} table slightly differently, still they all see more or less similar things {{when they look at}} the table, and the variations in what they see follow the laws of perspective and reflection of light, so that it is easy to arrive at a permanent object underlying all the different people's sense-data. <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> table from the former occupant of my room; I could not buy his sense-data, which died when he went away, but I could and did buy the confident expectation of more or less similar sense-data. Thus it is the fact that different people have similar sense-data, and that one person in a given place at different times has similar sense-data, which makes us suppose that over and above the sense-data there is a permanent public object which underlies or causes the sense-data of various people at various times.|$|E
60|$|They had {{an upper}} {{floor of the}} house, which stands {{at the base of}} a stone terrace {{dropping}} from the wide, dusty, fly-blown street, where I stayed long enough to buy a melon (I was always buying a melon in Spain) and put it into my cab before I descended the terrace to revere the house of Cervantes on its own level. There was no mistaking it; there was the bust and the inscription; but it was well <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> melon before I ventured upon this act of piety; I should not have had the stomach for it afterward. I was not satisfied with the outside of the house, but when I entered the open doorway, meaning to mount to the upper floor, it was as if I were immediately blown into the street again by the thick and noisome stench which filled the place from some unmentionable if not unimaginable source.|$|E
60|$|On threshing, I found {{things as}} I expected,--the ears not filled, {{some of the}} {{capsules}} quite empty, and several others containing only withered, hungry grain, inferior to the appearance of rye. My best ears and grain were not fine; never had I grain of so low a quality: yet I sold one load for 21l. At the same time <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> seed wheat (it was excellent) at 23l. Since then the price has risen, and I have sold about two load of the same sort at 23l. Such was {{the state of the}} market when I left home last Monday. Little remains in my barn. I hope some in the rick may be better, since it was earlier sown, as well as I can recollect. Some of my neighbors have better, some quite as bad, or even worse. I suspect it will be found, that, wherever the blighting wind and those frosts at blooming-time have prevailed, the produce of the wheat crop will turn out very indifferent. Those parts which have escaped will, I can hardly doubt, have a reasonable produce.|$|E
6000|$|Steve {{shook his}} head. “No, Wilcox.

We were about a degree and a half south at noon before that cyclone struck us, but I don’t see that that would help us now.” ...|$|R
60|$|The rainy season, and the dry season, began now {{to appear}} regular to me, and I learnt to divide them {{so as to}} provide for them accordingly. But <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> all <b>my</b> {{experience}} before I had it; and this I am going to relate, {{was one of the}} most discouraging experiments that I made at all. I have mentioned, that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley: and now I thought it a proper time to sow it after the rains, the sun being in its southern position going from me.|$|R

[...] The telling of his wrongs had worked Wilton Sargent into a very fine temper, and I do not think that my conversation soothed him. In the course of the dinner, prompted by a devil of pure mischief, I dwelt with loving insistence on certain smells and sounds of New York which go straight {{to the heart of the}} native in foreign parts; and Wilton began to ask many questions about his associates aforetime--men of the New York Yacht Club, Storm King, or the Restigouche, owners of rivers, ranches, and shipping in their playtime, lords of railways, kerosene, wheat, and cattle in their offices. When the green mint came, I gave him a peculiarly oily and atrocious cigar, of the brand they sell in the tessellated, electric-lighted, with expensive-pictures of the nude adorned bar of the Pandemonium, and Wilton chewed the end for several minutes ere he lit it. The butler left us alone, and the chimney of the oak-panelled diningroom began to smoke.|$|E
6000|$|A temper of {{scrutiny}} and dissent {{broke out in}} every direction. In almost every relation men and women asked themselves by what right Conformity levied its tax, and whether they were not false to their own consciences in paying it. 'What a fertility of projects for the salvation of the world! One apostle thought that all men should go to farming; and another thought that no man should buy or sell--that use of money was the cardinal evil; another thought the mischief was in our diet--that we eat and drink damnation. These made unleavened bread, and were foes to the death to fermentation. Others attacked the system of agriculture, the use of animal manures in farming, and the tyranny of man over brute instinct. These abuses polluted his food. The ox must be taken from the plough, and the horse from the cart; the hundred acres of the farm must be spaded, and the man must walk wherever boats and locomotives will not carry him.... Others assailed particular vocations.... Others attacked {{the institution of marriage}} as the fountain of social evils.... Who gave me the money with which <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> coat?

60|$|The same {{disposition}} to scrutiny and dissent appeared in civil, festive, neighborly, and domestic society. A restless, prying, conscientious criticism {{broke out in}} unexpected quarters. Who gave me the money with which <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>my</b> coat? Why should professional labor {{and that of the}} counting-house be paid so disproportionately to the labor of the porter and woodsawyer? This whole business of Trade gives me to pause and think, as it constitutes false relations between men; inasmuch as I am prone to count myself relieved of any responsibility to behave well and nobly to that person whom I pay with money; whereas if I had not that commodity, I should be put on my good behavior in all companies, and man would be a benefactor to man, as being himself his only certificate that he had a right to those aids and services which each asked of the other. Am I not too protected a person? is there not a wide disparity between the lot of me and the lot of thee, my poor brother, my poor sister? Am I not defrauded of my best culture in the loss of those gymnastics which manual labor and the emergencies of poverty constitute? I find nothing healthful or exalting in the smooth conventions of society; I do not like the close air of saloons. I begin to suspect myself to be a prisoner, though treated with all this courtesy and luxury. I pay a destructive tax in my conformity.|$|E
60|$|And as for us, {{our work}} was done, {{for the great}} shadow had been cleared away from Europe, and should no longer be thrown across {{the breadth of the}} lands, over {{peaceful}} farms and little villages, darkening the lives which should have been so happy.

But in the quiet, peaceful days that pass now, each as like the other as so many Scotch tups, I can hardly get the young folks to believe that even here we have had our romance, when Jim and I went a-wooing, and the man with the cat's whiskers came up from the sea.|$|R
