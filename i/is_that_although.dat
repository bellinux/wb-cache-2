5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly with time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5to 3.0million years ago was predominately felsic, producing large volumes of rhyolite and trachyte lava. This {{can be explained by}} the presence of thick granitic structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American Plate margin. A unique characteristic of the felsic lava flows <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10–30times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. Evidence for explosive volcanism exists in the form of pumice flows, bedded tuffs, intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in rhyolite breccias.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} the population believes {{that at least some}} UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) are spacecraft piloted by aliens. While most of these are unrecognized or mistaken interpretations of mundane phenomena, there are those that remain puzzling even after investigation. The consensus scientific view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> they may be unexplained, they do not {{rise to the level of}} convincing evidence.|$|E
25|$|One {{contributing}} {{factor in the}} popularity of the game in Europe <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> the Catholic Church forbade many forms of recreation on the sabbath, they made no objection to puzzle games such as the tangram.|$|R
30|$|Another {{challenge}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> most Iranian-Americans surveyed {{were born}} outside the USA, {{we failed to}} ask if they were refugees. The psyche, mentality, and culture of a refugee are significantly {{different from that of}} an immigrant.|$|R

25|$|Another {{possible}} issue <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> the Alcubierre metric {{is consistent}} with Einstein's equations, general relativity does not incorporate quantum mechanics. Some physicists have presented arguments {{to suggest that a}} theory of quantum gravity (which would incorporate both theories) would eliminate those solutions in general relativity that allow for backwards time travel (see the chronology protection conjecture) and thus make the Alcubierre drive invalid.|$|E
25|$|The extreme {{absence of}} {{westerly}} winds meant that unlike 1956, 1973 and 1974, the year 1950 was not uniformly wet over Australia: indeed, {{in much of}} Tasmania and Western Australia the anticyclonic control associated with the moist airflow over New South Wales and Queensland produced unusually dry conditions. (A remarkable statistic associated with this <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> the fourth wettest year averaged over Australia, 1950 had {{a higher proportion of}} Australia in the lowest 10 percent than 68 out of 106 other years since 1900.|$|E
25|$|In recent times, reaction–diffusion {{systems have}} {{attracted}} much interest as a prototype model for pattern formation. The above-mentioned patterns (fronts, spirals, targets, hexagons, stripes and dissipative solitons) {{can be found}} in various types of reaction-diffusion systems in spite of large discrepancies e.g. in the local reaction terms. It has also been argued that reaction-diffusion processes are an essential basis for processes connected to morphogenesis in biology and may even be related to animal coats and skin pigmentation. Other applications of reaction-diffusion equations include ecological invasions, spread of epidemics, tumour growth and wound healing. Another reason for the interest in reaction-diffusion systems <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> they are nonlinear partial differential equations, there are often possibilities for an analytical treatment.|$|E

5000|$|Although Kluckholn <b>was</b> using {{language}} <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{popular at}} the time (e.g. [...] "savage tribe") but which is now considered antiquated and coarse by most anthropologists, his point <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> moral standards <b>are</b> rooted in one's culture, anthropological research reveals {{that the fact that}} people have moral standards is a universal. He was especially interested in deriving specific moral standards <b>that</b> <b>are</b> universal, <b>although</b> few if any anthropologists think <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> successful.|$|R
50|$|National's {{argument}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Captain Marvel's main {{powers and}} characteristics (super-strength, super-speed, invulnerability, a skin-tight costume with a cape, and a news reporter alter ego) were derived directly {{from those of}} Superman. Fawcett's counterargument <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> the two characters were indeed similar, the similarity was not infringing.|$|R
25|$|The {{chronology}} of this era is particularly uncertain due to difficulties {{in our understanding}} of the text, our understanding of the material culture of the Early Dynastic period and a general lack of radiocarbon dates for sites in Iraq. Also, the multitude of city-states made for a confusing situation, as each had its own history. The Sumerian king list is one record of the political history of the period. It starts with mythological figures with improbably long reigns, but later rulers have been authenticated with archaeological evidence. The first of these is Enmebaragesi of Kish, c. 2600 BC, said by the king list to have subjected neighboring Elam. However, one complication of the Sumerian king list <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> dynasties are listed in sequential order, some of them actually ruled at the same time over different areas.|$|E
25|$|One {{limitation}} of flash memory <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> {{it can be}} read or programmed a byte or a word {{at a time in}} a random access fashion, it can be erased only a block at a time. This generally sets all bits in the block to 1. Starting with a freshly erased block, any location within that block can be programmed. However, once a bit has been set to 0, only by erasing the entire block can it be changed back to 1. In other words, flash memory (specifically NORflash) offers random-access read and programming operations, but does not offer arbitrary random-access rewrite or erase operations. A location can, however, be rewritten as long as the new value's 0 bits are a superset of the over-written values. For example, a nibble value may be erased to 1111, then written as 1110. Successive writes to that nibble can change it to 1010, then 0010, and finally 0000. Essentially, erasure sets all bits to 1, and programming can only clear bits to 0. File systems designed for flash devices can make use of this capability, for example, to represent sector metadata.|$|E
25|$|Adalia bipunctata, the two-spotted ladybird, {{is highly}} polymorphic. Its basic form is red with two black spots, {{but it has}} many other forms, the most {{important}} being melanic, with black elytra and red spots. The curious fact about this morphism <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> the melanic forms are more common in industrial areas, its maintenance {{has nothing to do}} with cryptic camouflage and predation. The Coccinellidae as a whole are highly noxious, and experiments with birds and other predators have found this species quite exceptionally distasteful. Therefore, their colour is warning (aposematic) colouration, and all the morphs are quite conspicuous against green vegetation. The field studies identify differing proportions of morphs at different times of year and in different places, which indicates a high level of selection. However, the basis of that selection is still not known for sure, though many theories have been proposed. Since all the morphs are aposematically coloured, it seems unlikely that the difference between the colour of morphs is directly under selection. Perhaps pleiotropic effects of the genes acting on colour also affect the beetle's physiology, and hence its relative fitness. A similar polymorphic system is found in many other species in this family: Harmonia axyridis is a good example.|$|E

An alternative explanation <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> the filmmakers wanted Cale's version for the film, licensing issues prevented its use in the soundtrack album, because Wainwright was an artist for DreamWorks but Cale was not.|$|E

The journalist and author Christopher Hitchens observed that [...] "the central paradox of the classic Bond stories <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans". David Seed, in his examination of spy fiction, disagrees, and writes that while Bond beats Le Chiffre, his [...] "activities are constantly supported by American agencies, financing and know-how".|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that in Singapore administrative law, [...] "extensive reference is made to the landmark English cases", and in particular English administrative law has largely influenced {{the adoption of the}} doctrine of fettering of discretion in Singapore. One exception <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> a contractual fetter on discretion has been established in English law to be a separate ground of review, this has yet to be recognized by the Singapore courts. In Birkdale District Electricity Supply Co. v. Southport Corporation (1926), the House of Lords held that if legislation entrusts a public authority with certain powers and duties to be exercised for public purposes, it is illegal for the authority to enter into a contract that prevents itself from exercising its powers.|$|E
500|$|The work is {{formally}} titled Variations on an Original Theme; {{the word}} [...] "Enigma" [...] appears {{over the first}} six bars of music, {{which led to the}} familiar version of the title. The enigma <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> there are fourteen variations on the [...] "original theme", there is another overarching theme, never identified by Elgar, which he said [...] "runs through and over the whole set" [...] but is never heard. Later commentators have observed that although Elgar is today regarded as a characteristically English composer, his orchestral music and this work in particular share much with the Central European tradition typified at the time by the work of Richard Strauss. The Enigma Variations were well received in Germany and Italy, and remain to the present day a worldwide concert staple.|$|E

500|$|The {{historian}} Nicholas Vincent {{argues that}} the entire basis of this account, which ultimately rests on the Chronicle of Battle Abbey, {{is part of the}} forgeries produced by the Battle monks.

Vincent's point <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>although</b> there was no doubt a dispute between Hilary and the abbey over a claimed exemption, as evidenced by an 1170 letter of Becket's referring to some sort of settlement between the monks and the bishop, the actual account in the Chronicle is untrustworthy. Unfortunately, the 1170 letter does not give any details of the dispute, merely stating that the bishop was [...] "forced to make public peace with the abbot".|$|E
