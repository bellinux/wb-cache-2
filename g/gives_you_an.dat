One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> idea of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E
25|$|Downtown Makati {{is the one}} of {{the most}} easily {{accessed}} business districts in the Philippines. Public transportation within the city is facilitated mostly using inexpensive jeepneys and buses for commuters working in the district. Most of the buses and jeepneys come from EDSA, the main thoroughfare in Metro Manila. Buses plying the avenue from Parañaque to Caloocan pass through the central business/financial district daily. EDSA Carpark Building in Ayala Center is the main public transport terminal inside the district. It is accessible for shoppers going to SM Makati and Glorietta. This can also accommodate the vehicles of passengers riding the MRT. There are also available intercity bus in downtown that plies routes from Ayala Center to Fort Bonifacio via McKinley Road operated only by Bonifacio Transport Corporation. The city will open the new transport hub of Makati called the McKinley Exchange, which is also along EDSA outside downtown. It <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> efficient and convenient transport experience for both commuters and tourists. People enter and leave the city through this new central transport hub.|$|E

500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{revelation of}} Danielle's identity {{was set at}} Archie's wedding to Peggy (Barbara Windsor), matriarch of the Mitchell family. Crace deemed the wedding [...] "the perfect opportunity" [...] for the storyline to conclude, and Santer explained: [...] "Weddings are great because they bring the community together. A wedding gives you a stage, it <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> event, the context to play things out, so it felt right that these big Mitchell stories would collide at Peggy's wedding." [...] Writer James Payne concurred that setting the reveal at the wedding helped to make the moment [...] "as dramatic and sensational" [...] as it could possibly be. The episode saw Danielle announce that she was Ronnie's daughter {{in front of the}} entire wedding reception party, in what Crace has named her favourite scene on the show. She opined that the disbelief Danielle was faced with was [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and served to highlight the fact that [...] "she came as the outsider and she still is the outsider because no one steps in to help her".|$|E

Lasker explicitly cited {{a mirror image of}} this position (White: king on f3, queen on h4; Black: king on g1, rook on g2) as an example of zugzwang in Lasker's Manual of Chess. The British master George Walker analyzed a similar position in the same endgame, giving a maneuver that resulted in the superior side reaching the initial position, but now with the inferior side on move and in zugzwang. Walker wrote of the superior side's decisive move: [...] "throwing the move upon Black, in the initial position, and thereby winning".|$|E

2500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{revelation of}} Danielle's identity {{was set at}} Archie's wedding to Peggy. Santer explained: [...] "Weddings are great because they bring the community together. A wedding gives you a stage, it <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> event, the context to play things out, so it felt right that these big Mitchell stories would collide at Peggy's wedding." [...] Writer James Payne concurred that setting the reveal at the wedding helped to make the moment [...] "as dramatic and sensational" [...] as it could possibly be. In the episode, Danielle announces that she is Ronnie's daughter {{in front of the}} entire wedding reception party. She is met with disbelief, and thrown out by Ronnie. Soon thereafter, however, Ronnie discovers that Danielle has an identical locket to her own. Having given the matching locket to her daughter, Ronnie realises that Danielle was telling the truth. She hurries to find her, but just as they are about to be reunited, Danielle is run down by local resident Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), and subsequently dies in Ronnie's arms. Although different outcomes to the storyline were considered, Santer explained that Danielle dying best preserved Ronnie's status as EastEnders [...] "tragic heroine character". Treadwell-Collins felt that to allow Ronnie to have her daughter, the [...] "one thing that is key to her character" [...] would serve to progressively weaken her character, and Santer agreed that while it may initially be touching, ultimately the relationship would become boring. In December 2009, Archie was murdered in a [...] "whodunit" [...] storyline. Santer hoped that his death would bring Ronnie closure, but suggested conversely that it might damage her further.|$|E
