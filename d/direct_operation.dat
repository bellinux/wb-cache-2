5|$|The team {{originally}} {{wanted to}} release the global version at {{the same as the}} Japanese version. However, since they also wanted to maintain a direct level of control over the development and operation of the title rather than outsourcing it like Square Enix usually does, the global version was delayed by a year. <b>Direct</b> <b>operation</b> allows them to ensure quality and directly take player feedback and reflect it into the service.|$|E
25|$|In March 2016 Nexus {{announced}} {{that they did not}} intend to renew the contract with DB Regio when it expired in 2017, after stating that they were dissatisfied with the operator due to missed performance targets. On 1 April 2017, Nexus took over <b>direct</b> <b>operation</b> of the system for a planned period of two years, until a new operating contract can be agreed. The RMT union, however, has argued that the <b>direct</b> <b>operation</b> should be made permanent, and operation of the system should remain in public ownership.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{location}} of the camshaft, the cam operates the valves either directly or through a linkage of pushrods and rockers. <b>Direct</b> <b>operation</b> involves a simpler mechanism and leads to fewer failures, but requires the camshaft to be positioned {{at the top of the}} cylinders. In the past when engines were not as reliable as today this was seen as too much trouble, but in modern gasoline engines the overhead cam system, where the camshaft is on top of the cylinder head, is quite common.|$|E

25|$|In electronics, {{a remote}} control is a {{component}} of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance. For example, in consumer electronics, {{a remote control}} {{can be used to}} operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance. A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for <b>direct</b> <b>operation</b> of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise {{would not be able to}} reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.|$|E
500|$|Brownlee was {{similarly}} successful in divesting {{the government of}} its railways. [...] When his initial attempts to sell them to the CNR or CPR failed, the provincial government took over <b>direct</b> <b>operation</b> of the lines in 1927. [...] In 1928, they began to show a profit, {{and one of the}} lines was soon sold to the CPR. [...] A joint offer from the CPR and CNR for the remaining lines was judged too low, and they were sold to the CPR near the end of 1928 for $25 million.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Henry {{questioned}} {{the authority of}} the Philadelphia Convention to presume to speak for [...] "We, the people" [...] instead of [...] "We, the states". In his view, delegates should have only recommended amendments to the Articles of Confederation. Edmund Randolph had changed from his opposition in the Philadelphia Convention to now supporting adoption for the sake of preserving the Union. He noted that the Confederation was [...] "totally inadequate". George Mason countered that a national, consolidated government would overburden Virginians with direct taxes in addition to state taxes, and that government of an extensive territory must necessarily destroy liberty. Madison pointed out that the history of Confederations like that provided in the Articles of Confederation government were inadequate in the long run, both with the ancients and with the modern (1700s) Germans, Dutch and Swiss. They brought [...] "anarchy and confusion", disharmony and foreign invasion. Efficient government can only come from <b>direct</b> <b>operation</b> on individuals, it can never flow from negotiations among a confederation's constituent states.|$|E

500|$|In 1925, the Alberta {{government}} owned {{four small}} railways whose founding syndicates, on whose behalf {{the government had}} made guarantees to financiers, had collapsed. [...] The Greenfield government's attempts to sell these lines to {{one or both of}} Canadian Pacific (CP) or Canadian National (CN) had failed. [...] By 1925, the money-losing lines represented an annual drain of $1.5 million on the provincial budget. [...] Brownlee reprised old attempts in January 1926, making direct offers to CN President Henry Thornton and CP President Edward Wentworth Beatty, but neither was interested, owing to the Alberta lines' debts and operating losses. [...] Faced with no buyers, potential leasers willing to operate the lines only on terms unfavourable to the province, and in Vernor Smith a Minister of Railways who vigorously supported public ownership, Brownlee's government opted to take over <b>direct</b> <b>operation</b> of the lines in 1927. [...] It also moved its contract for the transcontinental transport of the lines' freight from CP to CN, in the hopes that doing so would ensure that both companies would have firsthand knowledge of the lines' freight levels and be interested in acquiring them in better economic times.|$|E

2500|$|The 232 {{car order}} of Silverliner IV cars, {{delivered}} between 1973 and 1976, represented the largest {{order of the}} Silverliner series to date and allowed for the retirement {{of most of the}} Reading 'Blueliner' and PRR MP54 MU cars, dating from at least the 1930s, that were still running on their respective Reading and Pennsylvania Railroad systems.

2500|$|Another {{operating}} {{model for}} publicly operated EMS {{is what is}} generally {{referred to in the}} industry as the 'third service' option. [...] In this option, rather than being an integral part of (or in some cases, an 'add-on' to) one of the traditional 'emergency' services (fire and police), the service is organized as a separate, free-standing, municipal department, with organization that may be similar to, but operated independently from, either the fire or police departments,. In a variant of this model, the EMS system may be recognized as a legitimate third emergency service, but provided under a contractual agreement with another organization, such as a private company or a hospital, instead of <b>direct</b> <b>operation.</b> [...] This model is sometimes referred to as the 'public utility' model. [...] This may be a cost-saving measure, or it may be because the community feels that they lack the resident expertise to deal with medical oversight and control issues, and the legal requirements that typically surround an Emergency Medical Service.|$|E

2500|$|George Mason {{countered that}} a national, {{consolidated}} government would overburden Virginians with direct taxes {{in addition to}} state taxes, and that government of an extensive territory must necessarily destroy liberty. Although he conceded that the Confederation government was [...] "inefficient”, he wanted a clear line between the jurisdictions of {{the federal and state}} governments, including the judiciary, because he feared the shared powers would lead to [...] "the destruction of one or the other." [...] Madison pointed out that the history of Confederations like that provided in the Articles of Confederation government were inadequate in the long run, both with the ancients and with the modern (1700s) Germans, Dutch and Swiss. They brought [...] "anarchy and confusion", disharmony and foreign invasion. Efficient government can only come from <b>direct</b> <b>operation</b> on individuals, it can never flow from negotiations among a confederation’s constituent states. The proposed Constitution creates a republic with each branch of government grounded in the people without hereditary offices. Its mixed nature was both federated and consolidated, but in all cases was based on “the superior power of the people”. The states would remain important because the House of Representatives were chosen by people in each state, and the Senate was chosen by the state legislatures. The Constitution limited the national government to enumerated powers.|$|E
