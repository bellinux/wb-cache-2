50|$|Programmer's <b>File</b> <b>Editor</b> (PFE) is a {{freeware}} {{text editor}} targeted {{particularly to the}} needs of software programmers. It was written by Alan Phillips of Lancaster University in the north of England. Development of Programmer's <b>File</b> <b>Editor</b> ceased in 1999, but the program is still in use by some programmers.|$|E

5000|$|From March 1, 1932, {{until the}} fall of 1933, Miller worked as a rewrite man and night <b>filing</b> <b>editor</b> for the Associated Press at its Columbus, Ohio bureau. Few records of his tenure there survive. Nevertheless, Miller's first A. P. {{assignment}} may arguably {{have been the most}} important job he ever held as it was in Columbus that he acquired and first applied the knowledge that allowed him to excel as an [...] "A.P. man." [...] Perhaps even more significantly, it was in Columbus where he met and married twenty-five year-old Louise Johnson.|$|R

50|$|Modedit was a MOD <b>file</b> <b>editor</b> (a form of Tracker) for MS-DOS {{written by}} Norman Lin and {{distributed}} as Shareware in 1991 and 1992. It was notable for {{being one of}} the first MOD software available for the PC. Its ability to play MODs through the PC speaker without requiring additional sound hardware, was achieved by using code written by Mark J. Cox.|$|E
50|$|Bit-Twist is a libpcap-based packet {{generator}} and packet capture file modifier and replayer. It complements tcpdump, {{a packet}} capturing tool also built upon the packet capturing engine libpcap. Bit-Twist {{allows you to}} regenerate packets from one or more pcap files. It also comes with a comprehensive pcap <b>file</b> <b>editor</b> to allow advance manipulation of packet information, e.g. fields in Ethernet, ARP, IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP headers, prior to regenerating the packets onto the network.|$|E

50|$|A {{side effect}} of the line-based file system is that {{programs}} can read and write individual lines incrementally. If one edits a file (usually a text file) with the MTS <b>file</b> <b>editor</b> ($EDIT), any changes made to lines are written immediately, as are insertions and deletions of specific lines. This makes it quite different from most (byte-oriented) file systems where a file is usually read into and changed in memory, and then saved to disk in bulk.|$|E
50|$|Beginning with version 9, Tabbed Console Interface and 4NT {{have been}} merged into the Take Command product line. 4NT was renamed to Take Command Console, with a Lite Edition (TCC/LE) {{released}} as freeware. Take Command includes a tabbed interface, configurable toolbars, and an integrated graphical file explorer. Take Command adds a built-in batch <b>file</b> <b>editor</b> and debugger, FTP and HTTP file access in commands, network file system access, Active Scripting integration, system monitoring commands, and Windows service controls.|$|E
50|$|The {{software}} {{uses the}} model of a dual-pane user interface, which is well-known from {{the domain of the}} Windows applications such as Total Commander. This approach assumes offering multi-tab browsing user interface with features enabling advanced search of files or folders, comparing files and folders, navigation in archive files, and a batch renaming tool with regular expression support. Such programs also include a built-in File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client, working with local and network drives, and a built-in <b>file</b> <b>editor</b> and viewer.|$|E
5000|$|Inspired by Occam's razor, the aphorism was popularized in {{this form}} and under this name by the Jargon File, a {{glossary}} of computer programmer slang. In 1990, it appeared in the Jargon File described as a [...] "'murphyism' parallel to Occam's Razor".Later that same year, the Jargon <b>File</b> <b>editors</b> noted {{lack of knowledge about}} the term's derivation and the existence of a similar epigram by William James. In 1996, the Jargon File entry on Hanlon's Razor noted the existence of a similar quotation in Robert A. Heinlein's short story [...] "Logic of Empire" [...] (1941), with speculation that Hanlon's Razor might be a corruption of [...] "Heinlein's Razor". (A character in Heinlein's story described the [...] "devil theory" [...] fallacy, explaining, [...] "You have attributed conditions to villainy that simply result from stupidity.") ...|$|R

50|$|A poll in December 1946 {{showed that}} 72 {{percent of the}} student body read The Daily. In May 1956, a libel suit was <b>filed</b> against <b>editor</b> George Gravely and faculty {{supervisor}} Louise B. Moore. The suit was dismissed as groundless, but it marked the first time The Daily had been sued for libel.|$|R
50|$|Windows Media Encoder 9 enables two-pass {{encoding}} {{to optimize}} quality for on-demand (streamed or download-and-play) content. It also supports variable bitrate (VBR) encoding for download-and-play scenarios. True VBR {{can be applied}} over the entire duration of a high-motion sequence, ensuring the highest quality. This version also enables scripted encoding with the wmcmd.vbs VBScript file allowing content developers to encode large numbers of prerecorded media files. Bundled with the program are the applications Windows Media <b>File</b> <b>Editor,</b> Windows Media Profile Editor, and Windows Media Stream Editor.|$|E
50|$|A hex editor (or binary <b>file</b> <b>editor</b> or byte editor) {{is a type}} of {{computer}} program that allows for manipulation of the fundamental binary data that constitutes a computer file. The name 'hex' comes from 'hexadecimal': a standard numerical format for representing binary data. A typical computer file occupies multiple areas on the platter(s) of a disk drive, whose contents are combined to form the file. Hex editors that are designed to parse and edit sector data from the physical segments of floppy or hard disks are sometimes called sector editors or disk editors.|$|E
50|$|In {{this same}} time period Phoenix {{purchased}} a non-exclusive license for Seattle Computer Products 86-DOS. Phoenix developed customized versions of 86-DOS (or sometimes called PDOS for Phoenix DOS) for various microprocessor platforms. Phoenix also provided PMate {{as a replacement for}} Edlin as the DOS <b>file</b> <b>editor.</b> Phoenix also developed C language libraries, called PForCe, along with Plink-86/Plink-86plus, overlay linkers, and Pfix-86, a windowed Debugger for DOS. These products only provided a small revenue stream to Phoenix during the early 1980s and the company did not significantly expand in size.|$|E
50|$|Target {{platforms}} include Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, iPhone, iPad, Windows Mobile based Smartphones, GP2X and Handhelds. It {{is possible}} to make builds, or export game data only, so that designers can store the game or its parts in non-executable <b>files.</b> The <b>editor</b> itself runs on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.|$|R
2500|$|... a {{language}} that differs from the file type (for example when editing source code in an extension-less <b>file</b> in an <b>editor</b> that uses <b>file</b> extensions to detect the language).|$|R
5000|$|Because bencoded files contain binary data, {{and because}} {{of some of the}} intricacies {{involved}} in the way binary strings are typically stored, it is often not safe to edit bencode <b>files</b> in text <b>editors.</b>|$|R
