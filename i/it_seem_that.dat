5|$|At {{the science}} fair, Steve causes a panic by announcing his pet {{tarantula}} has escaped, and Carly Beth is terrified of tarantulas. Steve creeps {{up behind her}} during the chaos, and pinches her leg to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> the tarantula is biting her. Carly Beth flies into a frenzied panic, destroys her and Sabrina's project and is again humiliated {{in front of her}} teachers and classmates. Carly Beth vows that she will definitely make Steve pay for what he did to her. She plots to go to a new store that has opened, which sells frightening costumes, and plans to scare Steve and Chuck as payback.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} the episode {{came from a}} story idea by Greg Daniels, and the writing staff came up with three major concepts. The first involves the Simpson family moving out of Springfield, which the writers initially hoped would fool the audience into thinking it was a permanent move. As a result, they tried to work in as many characters as they could during the first act of the episode to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> the family really was leaving. The second involved Homer getting a new job for an employee-friendly boss {{in contrast to the}} tyrannical Mr. Burns. The third was that Homer's new boss would be a supervillain resembling Ernst Stavro Blofeld. This element was meant to be in the background and Homer would be ignorant to it.|$|E
5|$|After Italy's {{declaration}} of war against Austria-Hungary on 23 May, Admiral Anton Haus, the fleet commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy sortied his fleet to bombard the Italian coast {{on the night of}} 23/24 May in an attempt to disrupt the Italian mobilization. Of the many targets, Ancona was hardest hit, with disruptions to the town's gas, electric, and telephone service; the city's stockpiles of coal and oil were left in flames. All of the Austrian ships safely returned to port, making <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> they had been able to attack with impunity, putting political pressure on the Regia Marina from Rome. When the Austrians resumed attacks on the Italian coast in mid-June, Italian Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel responded by sending Amalfi and the other armored cruisers at Brindisi—the navy's newest—to Venice to supplement the older ships already there. Historian Lawrence Sondhaus argues that the arrival of the four fast armored cruisers in Venice should have been a major deterrent against future Austrian coastal raids, but concedes that they ended up becoming more inviting targets for Austrian U-boats instead.|$|E

25|$|As well as {{in cancer}} cells, chromothripsis has also be {{reported}} in patients with developmental and congenital defects, i.e. germ line cells. Using multiple molecular techniques of these germ line cells that have appeared to have undergone a chromothripsis like process, as {{well as in}}versions and translocations, duplications and triplications were also seen and hence increases in copy number. This {{can be attributed to}} replicative processes that involve the restoration of collapsed replication forks such as fork stalling and template switching model (FoSTeS) or microhomology mediated break induced replication (MMBIR). This makes <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> it would be more appropriate to name the phenomenon 'chromoanasynthesis' which means chromosome reconstitution rather than chromothripsis. However most samples displaying chromothripsis that are analysed have low copy states and hence have paired end joining predominating repair mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|Shapland {{had murdered}} Springer, who had caught {{her while she}} was searching the Sports Pavilion for the jewels. She also murdered Mademoiselle Blanche, the would-be blackmailer. But she did not kill Miss Vansittart, and has a perfect alibi for that night. Vansittart was killed by Chadwick, in an unpremeditated fit of passion. Chadwick had found Vansittart, whom she disliked, in the Sports Pavilion the second night, {{kneeling}} in front of Shaista's locker. Chadwick was carrying a sandbag for protection, and there was Vansittart in a perfect position to be coshed. Chadwick apparently suffered a psychotic break and bludgeoned Vansittart. The same murderer committed {{the first and third}} murders, while the second and third murders were by the same method (a sandbag); Shapland had used the sandbag only to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> the second and third murders were linked.|$|E
25|$|Sandoz {{becomes a}} slave/pet of a famed poet-songwriter, whose {{broadcasts}} first alerted Earth to Rakhat's existence. Sandoz is physically disfigured. In that culture, {{it is considered}} an honour to be dependent upon another, and likewise to have a dependent, a mutilation analogous {{to the practice of}} foot binding. The flesh between Sandoz's metacarpal bones is cut away to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> he has long elegant fingers like the hasta'akala plant (which grows on a stronger tree and is thus dependent). The disfiguration starts at Sandoz' wrists, and with which he cannot even feed himself. Sandoz, imprisoned in his master's home, is routinely forced to sexually satisfy the musician, along with his friends and colleagues. It is later revealed the songs which Sandoz had originally considered to be a divine revelation are in fact a kind of ballad pornography celebrating rape, relating the songwriter's sexual exploits on broadcast to the populace.|$|E
25|$|Smaïl-aga's {{contribution}} to the Ottoman victory at Grahovo {{was so great that}} the Porte had granted him a personal fiefdom that stretched from Gacko to Kolašin and was larger than all the Montenegrin-held territories combined. These land acquisitions were met with much trepidation by Smaïl-aga's fellow beys, who feared that his rise would threaten their hold on power. In 1839, Serbia's Prince Miloš sent a letter to Ali Pasha informing him that Smaïl-aga would conspire with the Porte to have him removed as vizier of Herzegovina. Ali Pasha promptly wrote to Njegoš, asking that he arrange for Smaïl-aga's murder. He felt that Njegoš—who held Smaïl-aga primarily responsible for the slaughter at Grahovo—would be enthusiastic about the prospect of avenging his kinsmen. Ali Pasha also reasoned that by allowing the Montenegrins to kill the ambitious Herzegovinian bey he would be deflecting suspicion from himself, as the Montenegrins had more than enough reason to want Smaïl-aga dead. In mid-1839, Njegoš began exchanging letters with Smaïl-aga. The letters made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> he had forgiven Smaïl-aga for the deaths, and were meant to lull him into a false sense of security.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{problems}} encountered will benefit from special attention, as problems are often related more to “input and output” issues than to intellectual impairment. Problems with eye movement control {{make it difficult for}} people with A-T to read, yet most fully understand the meaning and nuances of text that is read to them. Delays in speech initiation and lack of facial expression make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> they do not know the answers to questions. Reduction of the skilled effort needed to answer questions, and an increase of the time available to respond, is often rewarded by real accomplishment. It {{is important to recognize that}} intellectual disability is not regularly a part of the clinical picture of A-T although school performance may be suboptimal because of the many difficulties in reading, writing, and speech. Children with A-T are often very conscious of their appearance, and strive to appear normal to their peers and teachers. Life within the ataxic body can be tiring. The enhanced effort needed to maintain appearances and increased energy expended in abnormal tone and extra movements all contribute to physical and mental fatigue. As a consequence, for some a shortened school day yields real benefits.|$|E
25|$|During his {{period at}} Contimporanul, Dan {{embarked}} on a conflict with the Surrealist and far leftist group at unu, the magazine of poet Sașa Pană. This controversy reflected the major discrepancies between Contimporanul and other avant-garde venues. By 1930, Sergiu's brother Mihail Dan had left Bilete de Papagal and had become involved with unu, {{of which he was}} later editor in chief. However, documents first made public in 2008 show that he was secretly an informant for the Kingdom of Romania's intelligence agency, Siguranța Statului, with a mission to supervise unus ongoing flirtations with communism. He had for long been suspected of this by the literary society at Sburătorul. Also in 1930, shortly after the forceful return of Romanian King Carol II to the throne, Sergiu Dan was working, as political editor, on the staff of Dreptatea, the platform of the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ). According to the later account of communist journalist Petre Pandrea, Dan and Vinea together stole the original draft of an article by PNȚ economist Virgil Madgearu, and forged it in such manner as to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> Madgearu was an anti-Carlist; they then sold a copy to Madgearu's rival, the corporatist theorist Mihail Manoilescu. Manoilescu took a copy of this document to Carol, discrediting himself when the forgery was exposed. Pandrea claimed that, between them, Dan and Vinea made off with 150,000 lei from the affair, whereas their victim Manoilescu fell into permanent disfavor.|$|E

Historian James C. Klotter opined [...] "It is doubtful whether Johnson's administration had any more political scandal than others, but the publicity made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> way." ...|$|E

500|$|Moore {{commented on}} the writing process: [...] "The theme I {{had to deal with}} in Inchon was too big for a movie that was less than two hours. When Toho was {{originally}} involved, they wanted a love story between an American boy and a Korean girl. My technique is to research and then fictionalize, a technique I used successfully in French Connection. But I had to fictionalize the real landing at Inchon, making <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> a lighthouse was a pivotal factor when in fact it wasn't. I couldn't do that, which is why other writers were brought in." ...|$|E
500|$|Cardozo {{has been}} praised for {{his style of}} writing in Palsgraf. Posner noted that in {{the facts of the}} case Cardozo [...] "saw {{instantiated}} the basic principles of negligence law and was able to articulate them in prose of striking freshness, clarity, and vividness", in an opinion mostly written in short sentences and lacking footnotes or block quotes. University of Pennsylvania Law School Professor Kim Lane Scheppele noted that the opinion was [...] "written by Judge Benjamin Cardozo at the height of his formidable powers". Richard Polenberg, in his study of that jurist, stated, [...] "Cardozo had a genius for making <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> the results he reached were logical, inevitable, and legally unassailable". Prosser stated, [...] "with due respect to the superlative style in which both [...] are written, neither of them wears well on long acquaintance. Both of them beg the question shamelessly, stating dogmatic propositions without reason or explanation." [...] Herzog was also less enthusiastic, noting that [...] "the majority opinion is unfortunately written in the curious idiolect I sometimes call Cardozo-speak." ...|$|E
500|$|Reactions to {{the merger}} were widespread. Amid {{descriptions}} of the team as a [...] "super-team" [...] from at least one analyst were [...] manager Bjarne Riis' claims that he simply looked forward to defeating them. Cervélo co-founder and former [...] manager Gerard Vroomen saw the merger on a strictly business level, with neither side having sufficient resources to field a team at the level they would like, while cooperatively they would. Trek had been bike supplier for both teams in 2011, and funneling money they would normally spend on two teams into one, coupled with an expected reduction in support from the electronics company RadioShack, would {{make it all the}} simpler for them to back a top-level team. The merger also drew criticism, as the two sides' initial press releases describing it did not make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> they were in agreement over their perception of the merger and the newly combined entity. The fact that neither ridership nor lower-level management nor ousted sponsors seemed to know about the move at all ahead of time also drew criticism.|$|E

500|$|In 1947, Eva {{embarked}} on a much-publicized [...] "Rainbow Tour" [...] of Europe, meeting with numerous dignitaries and heads of state, such as Francisco Franco and Pope Pius XII. Biographers Fraser and Navarro write that the tour had its genesis in an invitation the Spanish leader had extended to Juan Perón. For political reasons {{it was decided that}} Eva, rather than Juan Perón, should make the visit. Fraser and Navarro write that Argentina had only recently emerged from its [...] "wartime quarantine", thus taking its place in the United Nations and improving relations with the United States. Therefore, a visit to Franco, with António Salazar of Portugal the last remaining west European authoritarian leaders in power, would be diplomatically frowned upon internationally. Fraser and Navarro write that Eva decided that, if Juan Perón would not accept Franco's invitation for a state visit to Spain, then she would. Advisors then decided that Eva should visit many European countries in addition to Spain. This would make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> Eva's sympathies were not specifically with Franco's fascist Spain but with all of Europe. The tour was billed not as a political tour but as a non-political [...] "goodwill" [...] tour.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of FutureSex/LoveSounds, Ben Williams of New York cited the album's first five tracks, {{including}} [...] "FutureSex/LoveSound", as updating the early 1980s Minneapolis sound: [...] "tense drum machines, high-pitched synth squiggles and staccato funk bass lines". While reviewing the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted that the first three songs of the album include the word [...] "sex" [...] in their titles, [...] "as if mere repetition of the word will magically conjure a sex vibe, when in truth it has the opposite effect: it makes <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> Justin is singing about it because he's not getting it." [...] Lucy Davies of BBC Music stated that it is initially [...] "difficult {{to listen to the}} lyrics of the opening tracks and give an objective opinion". She wrote that it is like Timberlake is [...] "trying to find redeemable qualities about some guy who has zero social skills and stares at women on his own from the corner of a bar. Only he seems to have found some similarly unreconstructed creepy friends shouting words of encouragement to his clunky chat-up lines, like Timbaland".|$|E
500|$|The {{theoretical}} biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard {{reviewed the}} book in detail for the Quarterly Review of Biology as a work [...] "of special significance". She began it with a fable of a [...] "small community of modest scholars called natural historians" [...] who all practised their own sciences, until one day a man who [...] "had been called Entomologist, Ecologist, and even Biochemist" [...] arose among them and pronounced [...] "there shall be a new science". She wrote that Wilson had [...] "assumed god-like powers with this book", attempting to reformulate {{the foundations of the}} social sciences, making ethology and comparative psychology obsolete, and restructuring behavioural biology. She marvelled at the [...] "sustained enthusiasm and authoritativeness" [...] across a wide range of fields not Wilson's own, and the usefulness of many of the chapters. [...] "In this book sociobiology is a patchwork neatly stitched from relevant pieces of other fields, without a bold new theoretical pattern of its own". She objected strongly to what she considered Wilson's [...] "confused and misleading" [...] discussion of altruism and group selection, arguing that kin selection provided an alternative (fully Darwinian) explanation and that Wilson was wrong to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> group selection was necessary.|$|E

5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> Heisenberg in 1927 was {{thinking}} in terms of a classical diffractor. According to Bacciagaluppi & Crull (2009), Heisenberg in 1927 recognized that [...] "the electron is deflected only in the discrete directions that depend on the global properties of the grating." [...] Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> this did not lead him to think that the collective global properties of the grating should make it a diffractor with corresponding quantal properties, such as would supply the diffracted electron with a definite trajectory. <b>It</b> <b>seems,</b> rather, <b>that</b> he thought of the diffraction as necessarily a manifestation of wave character belonging to the electron. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> he felt this was necessary to explain interference when the electron was detected far from the diffractor. Thus <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> possible <b>that</b> in 1927, Heisenberg was not {{thinking in terms}} of Duane's hypothesis of quantal transfer of translative momentum. By 1930, however, Heisenberg thought enough of Duane's hypothesis to expound it in his textbook.|$|R
