5|$|The {{enterprise}} {{version of}} Windows 10 offers additional security features; administrators {{can set up}} policies for the automatic encryption of sensitive data, selectively block applications from accessing encrypted data, and enable Device Guarda system which allows administrators to enforce a high security environment by blocking the execution of software that is not digitally signed by a trusted vendor or Microsoft. Device Guard is designed to protect against zero-day exploits, and runs inside a <b>hypervisor</b> so that its operation remains separated from the operating system itself.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 (excluding PlayStation 3 Slim) also {{supports}} running Linux OS on firmware versions prior to 3.21 {{without the need}} for buying additional hardware purchase. Yellow Dog Linux provides an official distribution that can be downloaded, and other distributions such as Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu have been successfully installed and operated on the console. The use of Linux on the PlayStation 3 allowed users to access 6 of the 7 Synergistic Processing Elements; Sony implemented a <b>hypervisor</b> restricting access to the RSX. The feature to install a second operating system on a PlayStation 3 was removed in a firmware update released in 2010.|$|E
25|$|The ARMv7 {{architecture}} implements three privilege levels: application, operating system, and <b>hypervisor.</b> Unusually, level0 (PL0) is the least-privileged level, while level2 (PL2) is the most-privileged (<b>hypervisor)</b> level.|$|E
5000|$|These <b>hypervisors</b> run {{directly}} on the host's hardware to control the hardware and to manage guest operating systems. For this reason, they are sometimes called bare metal <b>hypervisors.</b> The first <b>hypervisors,</b> which IBM developed in the 1960s, were native <b>hypervisors.</b> These included the test software SIMMON and the CP/CMS operating system (the predecessor of IBM's z/VM). Modern equivalents include Xen, Oracle VM Server for SPARC, Oracle VM Server for x86, Microsoft Hyper-V and VMware ESX/ESXi.|$|R
5000|$|These <b>hypervisors</b> {{run on a}} {{conventional}} operating system (OS) just as other computer programs do. A guest operating system runs as a process on the host. Type-2 <b>hypervisors</b> abstract guest operating systems from the host operating system. VMware Workstation, VMware Player, VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop for Mac and QEMU are examples of type-2 <b>hypervisors.</b>|$|R
3000|$|Type I <b>hypervisors</b> run {{directly}} on available hardware, {{eliminating the need}} for other layers, such as an OS, and providing high efficiency compared to its counterpart. Xen [7], VM Ware ESX [8] and Microsoft HyperV [9] are well-known Type I <b>hypervisors.</b> As these <b>hypervisors</b> run directly over hardware, they are also known as [...] "bare metal hypervisors".|$|R

25|$|Hyper-V {{implements}} {{isolation of}} virtual machines {{in terms of}} a partition. A partition is a logical unit of isolation, supported by the <b>hypervisor,</b> in which each guest operating system executes. A <b>hypervisor</b> instance has to have at least one parent partition, running a supported version of Windows Server (2008 and later). The virtualization stack runs in the parent partition and has direct access to the hardware devices. The parent partition then creates the child partitions which host the guest OSs. A parent partition creates child partitions using the hypercall API, which is the application programming interface exposed by Hyper-V.|$|E
50|$|The {{supported}} <b>Hypervisors</b> on the VRTX Chassis are Windows Hyper-V, VMware ESXi 5.1, and VMware ESXi 5.5. At {{this time}} other <b>hypervisors,</b> like Citrix Xenserver, are not supported.|$|R
50|$|Platform {{virtualization}} software, specifically emulators and <b>hypervisors,</b> are {{software packages}} that emulate the whole physical computer machine, often providing multiple virtual machines on one physical platform. The table below compares basic information about platform virtualization <b>hypervisors.</b>|$|R
30|$|Live VM {{migration}} {{leads to}} number of security threats in CDC’s that maybe directed at <b>hypervisors</b> like KVM, Xen and VMware. <b>Hypervisors</b> {{are not able}} to secure sensitive information during migration and are vulnerable for attack. Attacker gets complete control of hosted VM and on VMM.|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s, IBM further {{abstracted}} {{the supervisor}} state from the hardware, {{resulting in a}} <b>hypervisor</b> that enabled full virtualization, i.e. the capacity to run multiple operating systems on the same machine totally independently from each other. Hence the first such system was called Virtual Machine or VM.|$|E
25|$|Included with Office 2004 for Mac Professional Edition, Microsoft Virtual PC is a <b>hypervisor</b> which emulates Microsoft Windows {{operating}} systems on Mac OS X which are PowerPC-based. Virtual PC {{does not work}} on Intel-based Macs and in August 2006, Microsoft announced {{it would not be}} ported to Intel-based Macintoshes, effectively discontinuing the product as PowerPC-based Macintoshes are no longer manufactured.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hypervisor</b> {{provides}} isolation {{between different}} virtual machines. The administrative domain, {{also referred to}} as Dom0 (a term inherited from Xen), has direct access to all the hardware by default. Dom0 hosts the GUI domain and controls the graphics device, as well as input devices, such as the keyboard and mouse. The GUI domain runs the X server, which displays the user desktop, and the window manager, which allows the user to start and stop the applications and manipulate their windows.|$|E

25|$|While {{monolithic}} kernels execute all {{of their}} code in the same address space (kernel space) microkernels try to run most of their services in user space, aiming to improve maintainability and modularity of the codebase. Most kernels do not fit exactly {{into one of these}} categories, but are rather found in between these two designs. These are called hybrid kernels. More exotic designs such as nanokernels and exokernels are available, but are seldom used for production systems. The Xen <b>hypervisor,</b> for example, is an exokernel.|$|E
25|$|Another PowerPC {{emulator}} is SheepShaver, {{which has}} been around since 1998 for BeOS on the PowerPC platform, but in 2002 was open sourced, and efforts began to port it to other platforms. Originally it was not designed for use on x86 platforms and required an actual PowerPC processor present in the machine it was running on similar to a <b>hypervisor.</b> Although it provides PowerPC processor support, it can run only up to Mac OS 9.0.4 because it does not emulate a memory management unit.|$|E
25|$|Since version 10.10, {{the server}} edition (like the desktop version) {{supports}} hardware virtualization {{and can be}} run in a virtual machine, either inside a host operating system or in a <b>hypervisor,</b> such as VMware ESXi, Oracle, Citrix XenServer, Microsoft Hyper-V, QEMU, a Kernel-based Virtual Machine, or any other IBM PC compatible emulator or virtualizer. Ubuntu 7.10 and later turn on the AppArmor security module for the Linux kernel by default on key software packages, and the firewall is extended to common services used by the operating system.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{possible}} to run the Mac OS as a virtual machine inside other operating systems installed on standard PC hardware, by using virtualization software such as Oracle's VirtualBox (though this is not officially supported by Oracle). It is {{also possible}} to install Mac OS X on VMware {{but this is not}} supported. This method typically utilizes some of the modified OS software listed above to perform the actual install, or requires {{a modified version of the}} <b>hypervisor</b> that unlocks native OS X support.|$|E
25|$|Parallels Desktop for Mac is a {{hardware}} emulation virtualization software, using <b>hypervisor</b> technology that works by mapping the host computer’s hardware resources {{directly to the}} virtual machine’s resources. Each virtual machine thus operates identically to a standalone computer, with virtually all the resources of a physical computer. Because all guest virtual machines use the same hardware drivers irrespective of the actual hardware on the host computer, virtual machine instances are highly portable between computers. For example, a running virtual machine can be stopped, copied to another physical computer, and restarted.|$|E
500|$|... bhyve, a new {{virtualization}} {{solution was}} introduced in FreeBSD 10.0. bhyve allows a user to run a number of guest operating systems (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, and Microsoft Windows) simultaneously. Other operating systems such as Illumos are planned. bhyve was written by Neel Natu and Peter Grehan and was announced in the 2011 BSDCan conference for the first time. The main difference between bhyve and FreeBSD jails is that jails are an operating system-level virtualization and therefore limited to only FreeBSD guests; but bhyve is a type 2 <b>hypervisor</b> and {{is not limited to}} only FreeBSD guests. For comparison, bhyve is a similar technology to KVM whereas jails are closer to LXC containers or Solaris Zones.|$|E

2500|$|A child {{partition}} {{does not}} have access to the physical processor, nor does it handle its real interrupts. Instead, it has a virtual view of the processor and runs in Guest Virtual Address, which, depending on the configuration of the <b>hypervisor,</b> might not necessarily be the entire virtual address space. Depending on VM configuration, Hyper-V may expose only a subset of the processors to each partition. The <b>hypervisor</b> handles the interrupts to the processor, and redirects them to the respective partition using a logical Synthetic Interrupt Controller (SynIC). [...] Hyper-V can hardware accelerate the address translation of Guest Virtual Address-spaces by using second level address translation provided by the CPU, referred to as EPT on Intel and RVI (formerly NPT) on AMD.|$|E
