50|$|On 2 December 2010, an Aero VIP Dornier Do 228, {{registration}} CS-TGG, flight 854 on {{a domestic}} route (Lisbon-Vila Real-Bragança), was on final approach to Braganca (LPBG) around 17:20 local time. There was snowfall and fog at the time. The airplane got too {{low and the}} nose <b>gear</b> <b>cut</b> a power line. The crew went around and landed the aircraft safely. The aircraft was not damaged and no injuries occurred. The incident left 2000 customers without electricity for two hours.|$|E
5000|$|Gear oil has a {{characteristic}} aroma {{due to the}} addition of sulfur-bearing anti-wear compounds. These compounds are used to reduce the high sliding friction by the helical <b>gear</b> <b>cut</b> of the teeth (this cut eliminates the characteristic whine of straight cut spur gears). On motorcycles with [...] "wet" [...] clutches (clutch is bathed in engine oil), there is usually nothing separating {{the lower part of}} the engine from the transmission, so the same oil lubricates both the engine and transmission. The original Mini placed the gearbox in the oil sump below the engine, thus using the same oil for both. The clutch was however a fairly conventional dry plate clutch.|$|E
5000|$|Trent C. Ward of IGN {{gave the}} game a 7.3 out of 10 and praised its dinosaur and {{environment}} sounds, but noted, [...] "The biggest problem with Carnivores is that it's too damn easy. Even {{with all of}} the <b>gear</b> <b>cut</b> off, most players will be able to fill their trophy rooms in a couple of play sessions. ... in two days I felt like I had exhausted every option available to me. It's really too bad that once you kill off a T-Rex you aren't given different options to play with. ... All in all, Carnivores is a surprisingly entertaining game that just doesn't have enough options to keep players busy for the long term." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes the {{computerized}} tooth profile generation of spur <b>gears</b> <b>cut</b> with shaper cutters. A complete geometrical mathematical {{model of a}} spur shaper cutter is proposed, including the protuberance, the involute region and semi-topping. The profiles of standard or non-standard spur <b>gears</b> <b>cut</b> with the shaper cutter are obtained based on the theory of gearing. In addition, {{the effects of the}} cutter parameters on the generated tooth profile are investigated and illustrated with computer simulation, while the appropriate shaper cutter parameters corresponding to the required gear profile, are also determined using an optimization method. # 2000 Elsevier Science S.

50|$|Another is a pinion-shaped cutter {{that is used}} in a {{gear shaper}} machine. It is {{basically}} when a cutter that looks similar to a <b>gear</b> <b>cuts</b> a <b>gear</b> blank. The cutter and the blank must have a rotating axis parallel to each other. This process works well for low and high production runs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Transition {{curve is}} very {{important}} to bending strength and life of gear. In order to improve the bending strength of gear, the shape of three kinds of transition curve (ordinary fillet cutter tip, single circle arc cutter tip and double circle arc cutter tip) was analyzed respectively, the relationship of double circle arc cutter tip parameters was established, the relation model of sensitive part of gear and stress concentration factor (J and γ) was determined, the effect of different transition curves of gear on bending strength (minJ) was explored. The results of analysis show that the bending strength of <b>gear</b> <b>cut</b> by double circle arc cutter tip increases by 10 % comparing with that of <b>gear</b> <b>cut</b> by ordinary fillet cutter tip. It provides theories foundation for the design of high bending strength gear...|$|E
5000|$|Undergarments: Just like in ice hockey, wearing {{undergarments}} {{under the}} playing <b>gear</b> <b>cuts</b> {{back on the}} chances of skin infections in cuts and scratches. It also provides a layer to protect the skin from damage when a hard shot finds a [...] "bare spot" [...] of skin. Traditionally, goalies have worn shorts and tee-shirts or long underwear, {{but in recent years}} sweat-weeping clothing has been designed to better suit the needs of athletes.|$|R
25|$|It is {{the most}} widely used gear cutting process for {{creating}} spur and helical gears and more <b>gears</b> are <b>cut</b> by hobbing than any other process as it is relatively quick and inexpensive.|$|R
50|$|The {{cutting tool}} is also gear shaped {{having the same}} pitch as the <b>gear</b> to be <b>cut.</b> However number of cutting teeth must be {{less than that of}} the <b>gear</b> to be <b>cut</b> for {{internal}} <b>gears.</b> For external gears the number of teeth on the cutter is limited only {{by the size of the}} shaping machine.For larger gears the blank is sometimes gashed to the rough shape to make shaping easier.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Night Gwen Stacy Died" [...] was loosely adapted in the 2014 film The Amazing Spider-Man 2. The Green Goblin drops Gwen Stacy {{through the}} top of a clock tower. Spider-Man saves her and knocks Green Goblin off of his glider. The glider hits into the clock tower gears that Gwen is {{standing}} on, and she falls. Spider-Man catches her again and she dangles below until the turning <b>gears</b> <b>cut</b> the web Gwen is hanging by. Spider-Man dives, shooting a web to catch her. She dies in a similar way to the comics. When the web catches her, the sudden stop snaps her spine, as evidenced by a cracking sound. The clock stops at 1:21, a reference to the issue of the comic book in which Gwen died.|$|R
50|$|There are 8 cutters (excluding {{the rare}} half sizes) that will <b>cut</b> <b>gears</b> from 12 teeth {{through to a}} rack (infinite diameter).|$|R
50|$|VFR400 engines {{produce a}} {{noticeable}} whine when {{the engine is}} running, due to the cams being driven by straight <b>cut</b> <b>gears,</b> rather than chains or belts.|$|R
50|$|The Locher rack system, {{invented by}} Eduard Locher, has <b>gear</b> teeth <b>cut</b> in the sides {{rather than the}} top of the rail, engaged by two cog wheels on the locomotive. This system allows use on steeper grades than the other systems, whose teeth could jump out of the rack. It is used on the Pilatus Railway.|$|R
5000|$|For large engines, muscle powered barring is {{sufficiently}} difficult that barring engines are frequently installed. [...] These are small engines with <b>gear</b> teeth <b>cut</b> {{to mate with}} the teeth on the flywheel. Generally, the drive gears of the barring engine are designed to automatically disengage if the engine begins running under its own power while the barring gears are engaged.|$|R
50|$|In gear form cutting, {{the cutting}} edge of the cutting tool has a shape {{identical}} with the shape of the space between the gear teeth. Two machining operations, milling and broaching can be employed to form <b>cut</b> <b>gear</b> teeth.|$|R
50|$|Whereas a hob {{engages the}} work {{much as a}} mating <b>gear</b> would (and <b>cuts</b> the blank {{progressively}} until it reaches final shape), a thread milling cutter operates much like an endmill, traveling around the work in a helical interpolation.|$|R
50|$|Spur may be cut {{or ground}} on {{a milling machine}} or jig grinder {{utilizing}} a numbered gear cutter, and any indexing head or rotary table. The number of the gear cutter {{is determined by the}} tooth count of the <b>gear</b> to be <b>cut.</b>|$|R
50|$|The trestle {{has been}} {{embedded}} in solid foundations, {{on which the}} restored post has been mounted. The buck (body) has been restored and resized according to photographs of the original taken in 1929, and the gear ratio between the windshaft and crankshaft has been adjusted, with a new <b>gear</b> wheel <b>cut.</b> An easily removable roof has been installed and new sails have been designed and constructed. The visually restored windpump was unveiled on Sunday 11 May 2008, during National Mills Weekend.|$|R
50|$|Henry Hindley {{designed}} and constructed a screw-cutting lathe circa 1739. It featured a plate guiding the tool and power supplied by a hand-cranked series of gears. By changing the <b>gears,</b> he could <b>cut</b> screws with different pitch. Removing a gear permitted {{him to make}} left-handed threads.|$|R
40|$|In this report, {{the case}} where the work surface profile is given by {{mathematical}} expressions, namely given by not discrete but continuous data, is treated. Tool path calculation method for the work shape requiring 4 -axis control machining is shown. Mathematical formulas expressed in cylindrical coordinate system are derived to calculate the tool path for helical gear cutting as an application of Gradient Matching Method. As an example of cutting, tooth spaces of a helical <b>gear</b> are <b>cut.</b> The cutting accuracy measured by a gear tooth profile tester is shown...|$|R
50|$|The {{recirculating}} ball steering mechanism contains {{a worm gear}} inside a block with a threaded hole in it; this block has <b>gear</b> teeth <b>cut</b> into the outside to engage the sector shaft (also called a sector gear) which moves the Pitman arm. The steering wheel connects to a shaft, which rotates the worm gear inside of the block. Instead of twisting further into the block, the worm gear is fixed so that when it spins, it moves the block, which transmits the motion through the gear to the Pitman arm, causing the roadwheels to turn.|$|R
5000|$|The tool-post is {{operated}} by lead-screws that can accurately position the tool {{in a variety}} of planes. The tool-post may be driven manually or automatically to produce the roughing and finishing cuts required to turn the workpiece to the desired shape and dimensions, or for cutting threads, worm <b>gears,</b> etc. <b>Cutting</b> fluid may also be pumped to the cutting site to provide cooling, lubrication and clearing of swarf from the workpiece. Some lathes may be operated under control of a computer for mass production of parts (see [...] "Computer numerical control").|$|R

At p. 105, [...] "But it {{had been}} {{recognized}} that the worm {{was a form of}} continuous rack and all that was necessary to <b>cut</b> <b>gears</b> with it was to provide cutting edges on it [...] to make a hob (Fig. 45).

40|$|Abstract: To {{determine}} the {{bending fatigue strength}} of precision forged spur gears and to compare the results with those obtained from conventional <b>cut</b> <b>gears,</b> single tooth bending fatigue tests were carried out on both through-hardened and induction-hardened gear teeth. The gears were produced from rolled bar cut blanks, disc forged blanks or precision forged teeth blanks. For this purpose, a special test fixture was designed and built for an Amsler high-frequency vibrophore fatigue testing machine. The {{results show that the}} endurance limit of precision forged gears is significantly higher than those obtained from <b>cut</b> <b>gears.</b> The bending fatigue strength of forged gears was some 12. 5 per cent higher than the cut teeth in a through-hardened condition and 8. 4 per cent higher for the induction-hardened teeth. The eVect of surface roughness at the tooth root area on the bending fatigue strength of the forged gears is also shown...|$|R
50|$|Gears {{have been}} {{included}} within Lego Technic sets since 1977 {{as a way of}} transferring rotary power, and of gearing-up or down the speed. Gears come in several sizes: 8 tooth, 16 tooth, 24 tooth and 40 tooth spur gears; 12 tooth, 20 tooth and 36 tooth double bevel gears; and 12 tooth and 20 tooth single bevel gears. The double bevel <b>gears</b> are <b>cut</b> so they can also be meshed as spur gears. There is also a 16 tooth clutch gear, and a 24 tooth friction gear that slips when a certain amount of torque is put on it to prevent motors from damaging any parts or burning themselves out.|$|R
5000|$|The V8SuperTourer utilises a strictly-controlled, one make, all-alloy, fuel {{injected}} and dry sumped 7-litre V8 ST engine.

40|$|Northern {{right whales}} {{in the western}} North Atlantic number about 300 animals and have shown little sign of {{recovery}} in recent decades. Mortality and serious injury due to human activities, particularly commercial fishing and shipping, {{are thought to be}} significant factors limiting their recovery. From 1970 - 1999, 45 right whale deaths were reliably documented. Sixteen of these fatalities (35. 5 %) were due to ship collisions, and three (6. 7 %) were due to entanglement in fishing gear. The remainder were neonates (13; 28. 9 %) and ‘unknown cause’ mortalities (13; 28. 9 %). Criteria for defining serious injuries and mortalities from entanglement or ship strikes were developed and include any animal carrying fishing <b>gear,</b> <b>cuts</b> from entanglement or ship strike deeper than 8 cm, swelling or necrosis, evidence of poor health from such interactions, and, in carcasses, evidence of haematoma, haemorrhaging or broken bones. A total of 56 animals fitting the defined criteria were documented from 1970 - 1999 : 31 (55. 4 %) from entanglement and 25 (44. 6 %) from ship strikes. Nineteen were fatal (16 ship strikes, 3 entanglements), 10 were possibly fatal (2 ship strikes, 8 entanglements) and 27 were non-fatal (7 ship strikes, 20 entanglements). The breakdown of potentially serious injuries by age and sex reveals no difference in levels between sexes but shows a 3. 3 : 1 higher level of interaction in juveniles and calves versus adults. The data show that ship strikes are more immediately lethal, but entanglements can result in long term deterioration of an animal and may be responsible for higher levels of mortality than previously thought. Considering that some animals become entangled, drown and never return to the surface, even these levels may be underestimated. Between 1986 and 1999, 84 animals were presumed dead based on a lack of resightings for six years. There were 32 confirmed deaths during this time period suggestin...|$|R
40|$|The {{hobbing machine}} {{of recent years}} has {{positively}} introduced a computer numerical control (CNC) system, but many traditional hobbing machines with gear trains are still being used to produce gears. These traditional machines generally prepare many indexing change gears for gear cutting. But when we <b>cut</b> the <b>gear</b> of a prime number of teeth, the indexing change gear is not prepared for more than about 100 teeth of the gear. In such a case, we have to correct the indexing {{of the number of}} teeth using a differential <b>gear</b> to <b>cut</b> a helical <b>gear,</b> but when we apply the prime number of teeth on the helical gear, we cannot choose an arbitrary feed speed. Therefore, in this paper, we report on a new indexing mechanism for the prime number of gear teeth using a double differential gear device, which reduces the number of indexes the change gear must go through...|$|R
