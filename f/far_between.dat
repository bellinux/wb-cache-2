5|$|Although {{this was}} a good start, Hastings was not a {{particularly}} well-known barrister, and cases were few and <b>far</b> <b>between.</b> To get around the lack of funds Hastings accepted a pupil, and for the next year Hastings lived almost exclusively off the fees that the pupil paid him. To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, claiming that they were cases of Hastings.|$|E
5|$|In August 1867, the {{commander}} of the Department of Washington wrote to the Chief of Ordnance, asking how much longer he needed Fort Greble as an ordnance depot for materiel removed from dismantled forts. When it could do so, the Ordnance Department removed its property to the Washington Arsenal, now Fort McNair, or transferred it to a still-garrisoned fort, though with post-war budget cuts, these were becoming few and <b>far</b> <b>between.</b>|$|E

Skirmishes were few and <b>far</b> <b>between,</b> but some French units suffered heavy losses. For the attack, the Germans had used the new C-250 Flammbombe (Flame Bomb) which had only been cleared for use 24 hours earlier. The incendiary bomb did some damage to hangars and parked aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Political {{parties had}} {{developed}} in the United States before Kentucky became a state. Because most early Kentuckians were Virginians, they naturally allied with the Democratic-Republicans, the party of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison; the latter was a cousin of George Madison, the state's sixth governor. Political victories were few and <b>far</b> <b>between</b> for Federalists in Kentucky, and none of Kentucky's governors {{were members of the}} Federalist Party. Military service was the most important consideration for voters in Kentucky's early gubernatorial elections. John Breathitt, elected Kentucky's eleventh governor in 1832, was the first Kentucky governor not to have served in the military.|$|E
5|$|Adult dusky sharks have a {{broad and}} varied diet, {{consisting}} mostly of bony fishes, sharks and rays, and cephalopods, but also occasionally crustaceans, sea stars, bryozoans, sea turtles, marine mammals, carrion, and garbage. This species is viviparous with a three-year reproductive cycle; females bear litters of 314 young after a gestation period of 2224 months, after {{which there is a}} year of rest before they become pregnant again. Females are capable of storing sperm for long periods, as their encounters with suitable mates may be few and <b>far</b> <b>between</b> due to their nomadic lifestyle and low overall abundance. Dusky sharks are one of the slowest-growing and latest-maturing sharks, not reaching adulthood until around 20 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The communists {{moved out}} to take the Plain of Jars again in 1967. Laotian {{victories}} were few and <b>far</b> <b>between</b> {{and by the end}} of the year the situation had become critical, even with the support provided by the American and Laotian Air Forces. PAVN, having a complete understanding of the American military system, began to attack TACAN facilities. U.S. intelligence indicated that between December 1967 and August 1968, the combined strength of PAVN and Pathet Lao forces increased from about 51,000 to over 110,000. The PAVN contingent comprised an estimated 34,000 combat troops, 6,000 advisors, and 18,000 support troops. On 6 December Lima Site 44 was overrun and on the 25th PAVN forces captured Lima Site 61, the site of a mobile facility. All of these attacks were part of a coordinated effort to reduce the ability of the Americans to strike the communist logistical system during the Tet Offensive.|$|E

5|$|The {{image of}} a Wild West filled with countless gunfights was a myth {{generated}} primarily by dime-novel authors in the late 19th century. An estimate of 20,000 men in the American West were killed by gunshot between 1866 and 1900, and over 21,586 total casualties during the American Indian Wars from 1850 to 1890. The most notable and well-known {{took place in the}} states/territories of Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Actual gunfights in the Old West were very rare, very few and <b>far</b> <b>between,</b> but when gunfights did occur, the cause for each varied. Some were simply the result of the heat of the moment, while others were longstanding feuds, or between bandits and lawmen. Lawless violence such as range wars like the Lincoln County War and clashes with Indians were also a cause. Some of these shootouts became famous, while others faded into history with only a few accounts surviving. To prevent gunfights from happening, many cities in the American frontier, such as Dodge City and Tombstone, put up a local ordinance to prohibit firearms in the area.|$|E

50|$|Al-Rāmahurmuzī's {{specific}} date {{of birth}} remains undetermined, but can be approximated based upon the dates of his teachers' deaths, placing his birth roughly 100 years prior to his own death. Therefore, 871/260 is a fairly sound estimate, according to The Encyclopaedia of Islam, based the long life spans generally assumed for early hadith specialists. The name al-Rāmahurmuzī is an ascription to Rām-hurmuz a town in Khūzistān in present-day south-western Iran. The significance of Rām-hurmuz was its central location {{at the intersection of}} Ahwāz, Shūshtar, Iṣfahān and <b>Fārs</b> <b>between</b> the Āb -i Kurdistān and the Gūpāl rivers.|$|R
