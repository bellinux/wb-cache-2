The centrifuge test results show that the lateral resistance of a new pile, located among existing piles, shows slight increases. The existing piles increase the <b>horizontal</b> subgrade <b>reaction</b> of {{the upper part of the}} new pile, but slightly decrease that of the lower part of the new pile.

5000|$|The {{vertical}} column supporting a plate with an offset weight {{must be in}} axial compression and flexure. Here the axial compression is carried by the bearing at the top beam in most balance scales, the lower beam just being supported horizontally at midpoint by {{the body of the}} scales by a simple peg-in-slot arrangement, so it effectively hangs beneath the top beam and stops the platforms from rotating. The flexural force in the column (a.k.a. bending moment) is taken by a pair of equal and opposite forces in the horizontal beams. So if the offset weight is towards the outside of the platform, further from the centre of the scales, the top beam will be in axial tension and the bottom beam will be in axial compression. These tensions and compressions are carried by <b>horizontal</b> <b>reactions</b> from the central supports, {{the other side of the}} scales is not affected at all, nor is the balance of the scales.|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of Finite Element Analyses (FEA) used to simulate sliding contact in two (2 D) and three dimensions (3 D) between two interfering elasto-plastic bodies. Cylinders are used to model sliding contact in 2 D, simplified by the assumption of plane strain. Sliding is studied between two cylinders modeled with material properties of steel, and separately with a Glidcop cylinder sliding over an Al 6061 -T 651 cylinder. All materials are modeled as elastic-perfectly plastic and follow the von Mises yield criterion. Both frictionless as well as frictional sliding are investigated. The FEA results in trends in the deformation, reaction forces, stresses, and net energy loss as a function of sliding distance. All these results are found {{to be related to the}} magnitude of vertical interference. This work shows that for the plastic loading cases of frictionless sliding, the ratio of the vertical force to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>reaction</b> force is not zero at the point where the bodies are perfectly aligned about the vertical axis. This work also presents empirical equations that relate the net energy loss due to sliding under an elasto-plastic deformation as a function of the sliding distance. In addition, a load ratio of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>reaction</b> force to the vertical one is defined for frictionless sliding. Although this is analogous to the common definition of the coefficient of friction between sliding surfaces, it just contains the effect of energy loss in plasticity. The contact dimensions are obtained for different vertical interferences as sliding progresses. Comparisons are drawn between the FEA results of frictional and frictionless sliding. 3 D modeling has been initiated to yield similar result parameters. M. S.

40|$|Tractors {{of today}} come {{equipped}} with a CAN-system. A CAN-system sends information from sensors to electronic control units who process the signals. The sensors measure several interesting parameters such as force, pressure and speed for various components of the tractor. This thesis discuss a force sensor which {{is placed in the}} pivot of the tractors three point linkage, the sensor measure the <b>horizontal</b> <b>reaction</b> force from the load that the tractor is exposed to. Signals from this sensor can be used to measure the force from any implement that the tractor is exposed to during an operation. The results from this thesis can be used for research purposes, for example, to compare implements from different manufacturer or to optimize the implement settings during an operation. However, there is a problem that this thesis aimed to solve by developing a method which can be put into practice. When a constant force from an implement is acting on the three point linkage, the reaction force in the pivot of the three point linkage (where the force sensor is attached) is going to vary depending on the angel of the lower lift arm. It is not uncommon that the angel of the lower lift arm is varying, because different implement and soil require different settings on the linkage. This means that the force which is measured by the sensor may vary in size even though the actual force does not vary. To solve this problem, theoretical calculations have been performed and equations to describe the variation of the reaction force depending on the geometry have been created. The theory has also been verified by a finite element analysis and a practical verification test. The conclusions from these three parts correspond to each other. Theoretically that means by knowing the <b>horizontal</b> <b>reaction</b> force (measured by the force sensor) and the angles of the geometry on the three point linkage (can be measured with a position sensor) you can calculate the force an implement influence the tractor with. However, there is a problem which prevents this method from being completely reliable. It is only working when the impact force is completely parallel to the horizontal plane. Since many implements are being pulled to the soil (plow, cultivator, etc.) in practice there are also vertical forces affecting the tractor. This is no problem to solve in theory, but in practice this method does not compensate for the vertical force. This vertical force should be examined more carefully before the method can be used reliably in full scale...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{performance}} of a standing reaching task that necessitates some forward bending requires: (1) the coordination of multiple joints (i. e., the trunk and limb segments) to reach the target, and (2) the preservation of postural stability. It has been proposed that the neural control of multijoint reaching tasks can be simplified by time scaling of joint motions while keeping joint excur-sions the same. To determine if time scaling of joint motions {{was used in this}} more complex reaching task, we had 20 healthy subjects (10 male and 10 female) reach for two targets located in a parasagittal plane while standing on a force platform. Subjects reached for the targets at a comfortable speed and a fast paced speed. Sagittal plane motions of the right shank, thigh, pelvis, trunk, humerus, and forearm were measured. At the fast paced movement speeds subjects had significantly larger excursions of the thigh, pelvis, humerus, and forearm compared to the comfortable speed. Thus, segment motions are not simply time scaled for standing multijoint reaches. We explored three possible reasons for not obeying time scaling: (1) to reduce scaling of peak kinetic energy, (2) to reduce scaling of peak <b>horizontal</b> ground <b>reaction</b> force, and (3) a convergence of movement strategies at faster speeds. While subjects modified their movement strategy in relationship to movement speed, these changes had no significant effect on the expected scaling of peak kinetic energy, or peak <b>horizontal</b> ground <b>reaction</b> forces. Given the intersubject differences in movement strategies used to perform these reaching tasks at the fast speeds, a convergence of movement strategies was ruled out. We propose that the increase in segment motions with speed may be a consequence of rules underlying motor output, the increases being greater for segments in which viscoelastic resistance to movement is more significant compared to inertial resistance...|$|R

Quantifying agility skill remains a challenge because measuring rapid changes of direction and quantifying agility skill from those measurements are difficult to do in ways that replicate real task/game play situations. The objectives {{of this study were}} to define and to measure agility performance for a (five-cone) agility drill used within a military obstacle course using data harvested from two foot-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). Thirty-two recreational athletes ran an agility drill while wearing two IMUs secured to the tops of their athletic shoes. The recorded acceleration and angular rates yield estimates of the trajectories, velocities and accelerations of both feet as well as an estimate of the horizontal velocity of the body mass center. Four agility performance metrics were proposed and studied including: 1) agility drill time, 2) horizontal body speed, 3) foot trajectory turning radius, and 4) tangential body acceleration. Additionally, the average <b>horizontal</b> ground <b>reaction</b> during each footfall was estimated. We hypothesized that shorter agility drill performance time would be observed with small turning radii and large tangential acceleration ranges and body speeds. Kruskal-Wallis and mean rank post-hoc statistical analyses revealed that shorter agility drill performance times were observed with smaller turning radii and larger tangential acceleration ranges and body speeds, as hypothesized. Moreover, measurements revealed the strategies that distinguish high versus low performers. Relative to low performers, high performers used sharper turns, larger changes in body speed (larger tangential acceleration ranges), and shorter duration footfalls that generated larger <b>horizontal</b> ground <b>reactions</b> during the turn phases. Overall, this study advances the use of foot-mounted IMUs to quantify agility performance in contextually-relevant settings (e. g., field of play, training facilities, obstacle courses, etc.) ...|$|R
