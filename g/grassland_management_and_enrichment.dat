40|$|Product {{quality and}} a {{sustainable}} food chain of ruminant products are largely determined by animal nutrition, in which forage {{is the major}} feed source. Forages and grasslands play a unique role in agriculture because they contribute through animals to our food supply and to the abatement of environmental problems. Interest in <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> grass utilization for dairy production in temperate and subtropical regions has recently led to considerable research efforts. In the past this research often emphasized on plant and animal aspects separately. However, the interrelationship between pasture and the grazing ruminant is a dynamic, two-way process. Many people {{are not aware of}} these complex relations, and scientists often focus on either soil-plant interactions, plant production, animal nutrition, animal production or product quality issues. This book contains the contributions of researchers and experts in the field of <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> grass utilization. Chapters are arranged in an order that allows progressive development within the food chain, moving from the big picture to basic principles of <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> effects on herbage quality, intake and nutrient flows...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> grazing {{strategy}} on cow health in organic dairy farming in Germany {{have not yet}} been explored. On the basis of comprehensive data sets of 124 organic dairy farms generated within the Federal Organic Farming Scheme, the aims of this study were 1) to assess <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> pasture use, 2) to identify the grazing strategies and, 3) to investigate the effects of grazing on health and other welfare indicators of organic dairy cows in Germany. In this paper, we describe selected animal-based parameters for herd health and compare groups of farms with different grazing strategies. Farms using pasture especially for grazing had a lower lameness prevalence and less cows with dirty hind legs, but grazing strategy had no effect on udder health state or metabolic disorders. The results further suggest that organic dairy farms using pasture mainly as outdoor runs (not especially aiming at feed intake from the pasture), produce milk on a more intensive production <b>and</b> <b>management</b> level <b>and</b> are characterized by higher milk yield and larger herds. To disentangle other farm structure <b>and</b> <b>management</b> effects from <b>grassland</b> <b>and</b> pasture <b>management</b> measures, further multivariate analysis will be carried out...|$|R

Semi-structured interviews, a scaled survey instrument, and participant observation were carried out in three case-study villages in New Barag Right Banner. The author hypothesized that because they maintain a livestock management strategy {{more closely related to}} the nomadic grazing traditionally practiced in the region, mobile pastoralists would have significantly more positive attitudes than their sedentary counterparts. Results show that herders representing both sedentary <b>and</b> mobile livestock <b>management</b> strategies share the same attitudes towards cooperation, <b>grassland</b> <b>management,</b> <b>and</b> the future viability of pastoralism in Inner Mongolia.

The objectives {{of the present study}} were to compare the effects of long-term vs. short-term <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> in organic <b>and</b> conventional dairy production systems, compare organic and conventional production systems and assess seasonal variation on phytoestrogen concentrations in bulk-tank milk. The concentrations of phytoestrogens were analyzed in bulk-tank milk sampled three times in two subsequent years from 28 dairy farms: Fourteen organic (ORG) dairy farms with either short-term or long-term <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> were paired with 14 conventional (CON) farms with respect to <b>grassland</b> <b>management.</b> <b>Grassland</b> <b>management</b> varied in terms of time since establishment. Short-term <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> (SG) was defined as establishment or reseeding every fourth year or more often, <b>and</b> long-term <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> (LG) was defined as less frequent establishment or reseeding. The proportion of red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) in the herbage was positively correlated with milk concentrations of the mammalian isoflavone equol. Therefore, organically produced bulk-tank milk contained more equol than conventionally produced milk, and milk from ORG-SG farms had more equol than milk from ORG-LG farms. Milk produced during the indoor-feeding periods had more equol than milk produced during the outdoor feeding period, because pastures contained less red clover than fields intended for silage production. Organically produced milk had also higher concentrations of the mammalian lignan enterolactone, but in contrast to equol, concentrations increased in the outdoor-feeding periods compared to the indoor-feeding periods. There were no indications of ertility problems on ORG-SG farms who had the highest red clover proportions in the herbage. This study shows that Production system, <b>grassland</b> <b>management,</b> <b>and</b> season affect milk concentrations of phytoestrogens. However, compared to soy products, milk concentrations of phytoestrogens are low and future studies are required to investigate if the intake of phytoestrogens from dairy products has physiological effects in humans...|$|R

There was no detectable role for competition for soil resources in diversity loss. Thus, competition for light is a major mechanism of plant diversity loss after eutrophication and explains the particular threat of eutrophication to plant diversity.

40|$|International audienceAgricultural {{intensification}} {{has greatly}} decreased grassland surface area in some regions, thus changing <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> modifying environmental and socio-economic systems. Therefore, knowledge about <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> practices in farming systems {{is needed for}} sustainable agriculture. In this context, the PaturMata model simulates <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> at the farm scale. The PaturMata model simulates grassland dynamics and several factors such as farming practices, grass consumption, and fertilization. The model takes into account environmental and farming system parameters such as climate, field number, size, and location; livestock units; and conventional or organic agriculture. Here, we first ran the model under climatic conditions favorable to grass growth for four farms on an experimental site located in western France. Biophysical variables extracted from remote-sensing images were used to initialize PaturMata, whose predictions were compared to on-site surveys. We generated forecasting scenarios of the same farms under different climatic conditions. Results show that PaturMata predicts a 70 % decrease in grass consumption, a 50 % {{decrease in the number}} of annual grazing periods, and a 60 % increase in the amount of conserved forage consumed, when conditions are unfavorable to grass growth. We conclude that the PaturMata model can help design farms <b>and</b> <b>management</b> strategies capable of coping with a wide range of conditions...|$|R

Specifically, we discuss two scenarios of grassland degradation, i. e. unsuitable <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> complete change of land use, sometimes followed by spontaneous recovery. We illustrate the framework with the case of south Brazilian grasslands, which are rich in biodiversity, but suffer {{from a series of}} degradation processes and are poorly considered from a conservation perspective.

The plots were cut 2 - 4 times per year depending on given dose of fertiliser. During 2013 â 2016, the regular <b>management</b> was ceased <b>and</b> the grasslands were completely abandoned.

This study design made it possible to address the following objectives in the present thesis: to understand how soil microbial biomass, microbial community composition, and enzyme activities are influenced by <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> soil properties across the regional scale, to investigate enzyme activities and nutrient supply and demand for whole soil profiles in forests, and to evaluate the proportion of the total variance in enzyme activities that can be attributed to large scale differences between regions, long term forest <b>management,</b> <b>and</b> soil properties in different soil horizons, and to assess the organic carbon storage and radiocarbon signatures in three density fractions of forest and grassland sites under diverse <b>management</b> practices <b>and</b> soil properties in different regions.

Clear differences in microwear patterning are identified between Gotland sheep, {{which included a}} high proportion of leaves, bark and twigs of deciduous trees and shrubs in their diet, and those which primarily had access to graze species, with the browsing group exhibiting enamel surfaces dominated by pitted microwear features, the grazers a predominance of striations. Analysis of abrasives in dung suggests that these trends can be attributed to higher levels of soil ingestion in the grazing population and are a consequence both of <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> practices <b>and</b> height of feeding within the vegetation canopy. These findings question previous interpretations of microwear patterning in browsing and grazing ungulates, which have equated striated enamel features with the ingestion of high levels of opal phytoliths, and thus have significant implications for palaeodietary reconstruction in such species, both within archaeological and palaeontological contexts. To address further the implications of these results, comparison is made between the Gotland sheep and modern grazing and fodder-fed sheep and goats from elsewhere in Europe.

40|$|Abstract Grazing removal {{is widely}} used in grass-land management. Plant {{responses}} following grazing removal at different organizational levels, however, are not well understood. We examined plant responses at different stocking rates in an Inner Mongolia grassland ecosystem dominated by Leymus chinensis and Stipa grandis. Our results indicated that plant response patterns differed significantly among stock-ing rates, {{at different levels of}} organization, and between wet and dry years. Community aboveground net primary production (ANPP) recovered more quickly at low and moderate stocking rates than those at high stocking rates. Response of aboveground net primary production (RANPP) was significantly posi-tively correlated with both individual biomass and density responses of L. chinensis. Overcompensation of L. chinensis after grazing removal contributed greatly to positive RANPP at the community level. Significant compensatory effects were found between the two dominant species and between dominant species and the remaining non-dominant species. Variation in precipitation significantly affected com-munity ANPP, relationships between community and species responses, and compensatory effects between species. Our study suggests that periodic grazing removal {{is likely to be a}} useful method for <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> that a combination of species with compensatory effects can be advantageous for reseed-ing practices in grassland restoration...|$|R

Its winter annual life-cycle is remarkable for a species of permanent grasslands. The aim of this study is to determine the habitat preference <b>and</b> optimal <b>management</b> of B. racemosus in the Netherlands and surrounding countries. Vegetation, soil and hydrological data from 28 sites in the Netherlands have been compared with B. racemosus cover, and with vegetation data from surrounding countries. The results indicate that B. racemosus is characteristic of Molinio- Arrhenatheretea meadows with good mineralisation and aftermath grazing. The optimum lies in grasslands of the alliance Alopecurion pratensis (Deschampsion cespitosae), but the species ranges from wetter Calthion palustris meadows to drier Arrhenatherion elatioris and Cynosurion cristati grasslands. It prefers intermediate nutrient levels and hydrological conditions (mesic sites), but within this range the highest cover is found in relatively nutrient rich and dry sites. Because of the absence of a seedbank and a low dispersal capability, B. racemosus is vulnerable to changes in <b>grassland</b> <b>management.</b> A management of mowing after 15 June and aftermath grazing is most suitable, since it enables fruit ripening and the maintenance of an open sward, needed for germination and development.

40|$|This report {{addresses}} Goal no. 4 of the NYU Division of Librariesâ Strategic Plan 2013 - 2017, namely, âEstablish {{processes and}} support structures that ensure we can select, acquire, preserve, and {{provide access to}} {{the full spectrum of}} research materials,â and specifically Initiative 4. 3, âa plan to provide intellectual access to NYU-curated digital collections via the library's primary discovery-and-access interfaces. â Since the Initiativeâs inception in July 2013, participants have identified and prioritized eligible collections, collected user stories, prototyped the âIchabodâ tool for metadata aggregation and normalization, mapped metadata elements to a local Nyucore schema, and harvested the processed metadata into the development instance of BobCat. The Ichabod tool is based on Fedora, Hydra, Solr, and Blacklight. It was implemented using Agile methodology and involving developers from DLTS, KADD, and Web Services. The emerging code base, processes, and working relationships place NYU in a strong position to solve local discovery problems as well as innovate in the field of repository metadata <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>enrichment...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} of 38 dairy farms {{was set up}} to {{determine}} the relationships between feeding <b>management,</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> feed costs/ 100 kg milk, 305 -day milk yield and nitrogen surplus/ha. Data of the farms were on management (based on questionnaires), grassland calendar, milk yield and economic data for May 1996 to May 1997. Partial Least Squares (PLS) was used to analyse data, because of the large number of variables relative to the number of farms. The R 2 of the models varied between 0. 32 (nitrogen surplus model) and 0. 60 (feed costs model). The nitrogen surplus model did not have predictive relevance. The PLS-model for feed costs resulted in the hypotheses that (1) a high percentage of pasture that cannot be grazed by the cows results in an increase in feed costs, (2) a high percentage of grazings lasting > 4 days increases feed costs, (3) mistakes in set-up of the paddocks cannot be compensated for by exact planning, and (4) farmers who have not organized their grazing management well, also tend to have worse results as to their silage management. The milk yield model showed that a high milk yield/cow is realized on farms with too low a number of growing days for cutting...|$|R
