Se analizaron un total de 1433 crías mestizas (cruce de hembras Yorkland entre {{la tercera}} y cuarta paridad con machos CC- 21, L- 35 y Duroc). De estas, 715 corresponden a la tecnología de origen chino y 718 a la tecnología de origen español, alojadas aproximadamente a 10 crías por bóxer. Se tuvo en cuenta el tamaño de la camada al nacer (TCN) y peso al nacer (PN), peso al destete(PD) y ganancia media diaria (GMD); además de los indicadores de salud(enfermos y muertes) por tecnología. En los indicadores evaluadosinicialmente que no son influenciados por las tecnologías no sepresentaron diferencias estadísticamente significativas (p> 0, 05). En los indicadores productivos por tecnología no se encontraron diferencia estadísticamente significativa, encontrándose las medias del peso al destete entre 7. 08 y 7. 15 y una ganancia media diaria de 219. 11 y 221. 09 respectivamente. No siendo así para los indicadores de salud, quien fue desfavorable para la tecnología de origen chino donde se presentaron 27 animales enfermos por encima de los enfermos en la tecnología de origen español.

5000|$|The Royal Navy {{captured}} {{a handful of}} the new French frigates during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748) and were impressed by them, particularly for their inshore handling capabilities. They soon built copies and started to adapt the type to their own needs, setting the standard for other frigates as the leading naval power. The first British frigates carried 28 guns including an upper <b>deck</b> <b>battery</b> of twenty-four 9-pounder guns (the remaining four smaller guns were carried on the quarter deck) but soon developed into fifth-rate ships of 32 or 36 guns including an upper <b>deck</b> <b>battery</b> of twenty-six 12-pounder guns, with the remaining six or ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle. From around 1778, a larger [...] "heavy" [...] frigate was developed with a main battery of twenty-six or twenty-eight 18-pounder guns (again with the remaining ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle).|$|R

50|$|Another deck {{structure}} {{that can be}} seen is a ski-jump ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on <b>flat</b> <b>decks.</b> Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller <b>flat</b> <b>deck</b> ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.|$|R
5000|$|The {{invention}} of the seaplane in 1910 with the French Fabre Hydravion led to the earliest development of ships designed to carry airplanes, albeit equipped with floats. In 1911, the first such vessel appeared in the French Navy - [...] - she was the world's first seaplane carrier. She was commissioned as a seaplane tender, and carried float-equipped planes in hangars on the main deck, from where they were lowered on the sea with a crane. La Foudre was further modified in November 1913 with a 10 m <b>flat</b> <b>deck</b> to launch her seaplanes. In spite of proposals of the French inventor Clément Ader in 1909 to build a ship with a <b>flat</b> <b>deck</b> to operate aeroplanes at sea, similar to modern aircraft carriers, the French Navy built its first aircraft carrier only in the 1920s and did not go further in developing aircraft carriers before World War II.

As there was no lift or hangar, aircraft maintenance was limited and the aircraft spent the entire trip sitting on the deck.|$|R
