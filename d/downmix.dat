50|$|MPEG Surround encoder {{receives}} a multichannel audio signal,x1 to xN where {{the number of}} input channels is N. The {{most important aspect of}} the encoding process is that a <b>downmix</b> signal, xt1 and xt2, which is typically stereo, is derived from the multichannel input signal, and it is this <b>downmix</b> signal that is compressed for transmission over the channel rather than the multichannel signal. The encoder may be able to exploit the <b>downmix</b> process so as to be more advantageous. It not only creates a faithful equivalent of the multichannel signal in the mono or stereo <b>downmix,</b> but also creates the best possible multichannel decoding based on the <b>downmix</b> and encoded spatial cues as well. Alternatively, the <b>downmix</b> could be supplied externally (Artistic <b>Downmix</b> in before Diagram Block). The MPEG Surround encoding process could be ignored by the compression algorithm used for the transmitted channels (Audio Encoder and Audio Decoder in before Diagram Block). It could be any type of high-performance compression algorithms such as MPEG-1 Layer III, MPEG-4 AAC or MPEG-4 High Efficiency AAC, or it could even be PCM.|$|E

50|$|<b>Downmixing</b> is {{the process}} of {{converting}} a program with a multiple-channel configuration into a program with fewer channels. Common examples include <b>downmixing</b> from 5.1 surround sound to stereo, and stereo to mono. In the former case, the left and right surround channels are blended with the left and right front channels. The centre channel is blended equally with the left and right channels. The LFE channel is either mixed with the front signals or not used. Because these are common scenarios, it is common practice to verify the sound of such <b>downmixes</b> during the production process to ensure stereo and mono compatibility.|$|R

Computational evaluations showed that the method may be implemented to run in real time with reasonable hardware requirements also with a larger number of input channels, such as with 22. 2 surround.

30|$|First of all, {{when the}} ICC is 1, the IPD is {{identical}} to the PDS, regardless of the values of the IID and ICC. When the ICC is close to 1, the IPD roughly matches the PDS in most cases. However, it is noted that when the IID is low (0 dB, for example), even fairly high ICCs produce {{a significant difference between the}} PDS and IPD, and the difference becomes insignificant as the IID increases. 0 dB IID corresponds to the case where the sound image is positioned in the median plane, which is very common in practice. Thus, it can be said that, in the conventional PS, a slight decrease of the ICC could result in a significant phase error in the synthesized stereo. It should be noted that, when the IID was 0 dB and the IPD was Π(Figure 4 a), the PDS always became zero, regardless of the ICC. This is due to the out-of-phase relationship between the channel signals, so that the signals are cancelled out during <b>downmixing.</b> Therefore, a special case should be considered for <b>downmixing</b> when the channel signals have an out-of-phase or near out-of-phase relationship. The <b>downmixing</b> problem is beyond the scope of this article, but the related research has been studied [15, 16].|$|R

30|$|The {{well-known}} Spatial Audio Coding (SAC) models {{the signals}} as virtual sound {{sources in the}} frequency domain, extracts the interchannel level difference (ICLD) and interchannel time difference (ICTD) and interchannel coherence (IC) to represent the direction and width of virtual sound source and <b>downmixes</b> the multichannels to reduce redundancy [8 – 11]. The idea of using <b>downmixed</b> sources with spatial parameters was later developed into Spatial Audio Object Coding (SAOC) for efficiently coding the multiple input spatial audio objects with interactive and personalized rendering ability [12]. Recently, some other investigations have been published to increase the compression efficiency for multichannel 3 D audio signals. In 2007, Goodwin and Jot proposed a PCA-based multichannel compression framework for parametric coding [13], which can enhance specific audio scenarios and provide robust spatial audio coding. In 2008, Cheng et al. proposed the Spatially Squeezed Surround Audio Coding (S 3 AC) for parametrically compressing the Ambisonics signal [14]. In 2009, Hellerud used an inter-channel prediction-based coding method to remove the redundancy between Ambisonics channels [15], which has low algorithm delay but high computational complexity. Tzagkarakis used a sinusoidal model and linear prediction to parameterize the separate spot microphone channels, then <b>downmixed</b> the residual signals. This coding scheme is more suitable for multichannel signals with weak correlation, and such scenarios require Independent channel decoding [16]. In 2010, Pinto et al. utilized a space/time-frequency transform to decompose the WFS signals into plane waves and evanescent waves. By discarding the evanescent waves and perceptually coding the plane wave signals, coding gain is obtained. Coding efficiency increases along {{with the number of}} audio channels, because the transform decomposition accuracy depends on the spatial resolution which is the number of WFS channels [17, 18]. In 2013, Cheng further proposed a Spatial Localization Quantization Point (SLQP) codec using localization cues to compress the 3 D audio signals [19, 20]. Since SLQP extracts the spatial cues and <b>downmixes</b> the channels, it achieved high compression ratio for SLQP signals and other 3 D audio systems.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a stereo coding technique {{used as an}} extension for the Enhanced Voice Services (EVS) codec [10] [8]. EVS is an audio codec recently standardized by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) for compressing mono signals at chosen rates from 7. 2 to 128 kbit/s (for xed bit rate) and around 5. 9 kbit/s (for variable bit rate). The main goal of the thesis is to present the architecture of a parametric stereo codec and how the stereo extension of EVS may be built. Parametric stereo coding relies on the transmission of a <b>downmixed</b> signal, sum of left and right channels, and the necessary audible cues to synthesize back the stereo image from it at the decoding end. The codec has been implemented in MATLAB with use of the existing EVS codec. An {{important part of the}} thesis is dedicated to the description of the implementation of a robust <b>downmixing</b> technique. The remaining parts present the parametric coding architecture that has been adapted and used to develop the EVS stereo extension at 24. 4 and 32 kbit/s and other open researches that have been conducted for more specic situations such as spatial coding for stereo or binaural applications. Whereas the <b>downmixing</b> algorithm quality has been confronted to subjective testing and proven to be more ecient than any other existing techniques, the stereo extension has been tested less extensively. Yet the quality reached with the proposed reconstruction algorithms tends to highlight the potential of the codec that could be revealed by future work...|$|R
