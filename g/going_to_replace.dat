5|$|In mid-September, {{the press}} {{announced}} that on 8 May 1996 NSB had agreed that Class 71's axles could receive a steel quality substandard to European standard and recommendation from the International Union of Railways. The {{reason was that}} the class would have a much higher weight than planned, and that this would cause the trains to operate more slowly and thus {{not be able to}} reach the airport in the desired 19 minutes. Class 73 inherited the same axle quality from the Class 71 order. On 11 September, Adtranz accepted responsibility for the axle problems, and stated that they would replace all axles free of charge, an operation which would cost them NOK70 million. In October, Adtranz announced that they would also replace all the wheels on both classes. NSB was spending NOK1.5 million on brake discs and brake shoes per month. The parties continued to disagree on the size of compensation Adtranz should give NSB, with NOK100 million separating the two. In July, NSB replaced DNV with CorrOcean as their inspection supplier for the class. NSB stated that this halved the cost of the inspections. The same month, Bombardier Transportation, who by then had taken over Adtranz, stated that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> the bogie frames for all the Class 71 and 73, as well as Class 93 trains, as part of the compensation deal with NSB.|$|E
25|$|Elastic modulus {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} ratio of stress to strain within the {{proportional}} limit. Physically, it represents the stiffness of a material within the elastic range when tensile or compressive load are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar deformable properties with the material it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace.</b> These force-bearing materials require high elastic modulus with low deflection. As the elastic modulus of material increases fracture resistance decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial elastic modulus is similar to bone. This is because if {{it is more than}} bone elastic modulus then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. The Elastic modulus of a material is generally calculated by bending test because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or tensile load. However, biomaterials (for bone replacement) are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine the elastic modulus of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of elastic modulus measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.|$|E
500|$|The band were {{adamant about}} not {{replacing}} Duane's {{position in the}} band. Les Dudek, the guitarist who would eventually record [...] "Jessica" [...] and [...] "Ramblin' Man," [...] had entered the sessions {{when he was asked}} to jam with Betts through mutual friends. The band enjoyed how Dudek played and Phil Walden, the band's manager, seemed set on Dudek being in the band. Word of mouth, propagated by Dudek himself, was that he [...] "got the gig" [...] and had become the Allman Brothers' new co-lead guitarist. [...] "We went looking for this dude to kick his ass. Nobody was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> Duane and the very thought of it was infuriating to us," [...] said Trucks. After recording completed, Dudek went on the road with Boz Scaggs and the Steve Miller Band. He wanted to end his contract with Phil Walden at Capricorn, and part of his release granted him no part of the publishing deal for Brothers and Sisters, including a songwriting credit for [...] "Jessica", as he had no written contract.|$|E

But after a terrible disaster during the New Zealand tour of 2015–16, when Sri Lanka lost all three forms and lost the number one spot of Twenty20 team rankings as well, a Sri Lankan cricket fan at Eden Park after the second T20 match against New Zealand, was overheard asking Dilshan to retire from cricket immediately. Dilshan was somewhat angry at this and asked the fan, [...] "Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> me?" [...] The issue came on social media as well. After Dilshan landed in Sri Lanka, he stated to the media that he would know when to retire, just as he had in test cricket and Sri Lankans who are engaged outside the country must know their limits.|$|E
2500|$|The new wing entered {{production}} in 1939/1940 at SAI Ambrosini and became standard on the aircraft manufactured by Aermacchi and Breda, a licensed manufacturer. After the modified {{wings of the}} Saetta were introduced, the C.200 proved to be, for a time, the foremost Italian fighter. As a weight-saving measure, the first production C.200 series did not have armour fitted to protect the pilots. Armour plating was incorporated when the units were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> the Saettas with the new Macchi C.202 Folgore and often in {{only a limited number}} of aircraft. After the armour was fitted, the aircraft could become difficult to balance, and during aerobatic manoeuvres could enter an extremely difficult to control flat spin, forcing the pilot to bail out. On 22 July 1941, Leonardo Ferrulli, one of the top-scoring Regia Aeronautica pilots, encountered the problem and [...] was forced to bail out over Sicily.|$|E
