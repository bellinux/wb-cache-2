He has taught himself Italian and French to go along with his childhood languages of Catalan and Spanish plus English. While with the Lakers, he and Kobe Bryant spoke to one another during games in Spanish to keep opponents <b>from</b> <b>knowing</b> their plans. Gasol also regularly reads historical novels, plays the works of French classical composers on his keyboard, and attends concerts and operas; he is a friend of Spanish tenor Plácido Domingo, and often visits him backstage after performances.|$|E
5|$|The {{spelling}} system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered, {{with elements}} of French, Latin, and Greek spelling {{on top of}} the native Germanic system. Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace. Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess <b>from</b> <b>knowing</b> how a word is pronounced. There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{criticism}} continued even a {{week after}} the storm, especially over the scale of the disaster. The government claimed that only 27 people had been killed by Giri while numerous local and international agencies stated significantly higher totals. They were also blamed for downplaying the amount of damage, resulting in slower distribution of aid to areas in desperate need. Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by the Junta. The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries out of the area and prevent them <b>from</b> <b>knowing</b> {{what was going on in}} the hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the region. On November8, local media discovered that the Junta was threatening to sever aid to the region if residents did not vote for them in the national election. According to Mizzima, the opposing party won landslide victories in numerous townships; however, in the cyclone affected areas, the Junta had complete victories.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{agreement}} was ineffective in the meantime. The VNQDD kidnapped Giap and the Propaganda Minister Tran Huy Lieu and held them for three weeks until Ho agreed to remove Giáp and Lieu from the cabinet. As a result, the VNQDD's Vũ Hồng Khanh became defence minister, with Giap as his deputy. What the VNQDD and other non-communist nationalists thought to be an equitable power-sharing agreement {{turned out to be}} a ruse. Every non-communist minister had a communist deputy, and if the former refused to approve a decree, the Vietminh official would do so. Many ministers were excluded <b>from</b> <b>knowing</b> the details of their portfolio; Khanh was forbidden to see any military statistics and some were forbidden to attend cabinet meetings. In one case, the Minister of Social Works became a factory worker because he was forced to remain politically idle. Meanwhile, Giáp was able to stymie the activities of VNQDD officials of higher rank in the coalition government. Aside from shutting down the ability of the VNQDD officials to disseminate information, he often ordered his men to start riots and street brawls at public VNQDD events.|$|E
5|$|Barry Lyndon (1975) is an {{adaptation}} of William Makepeace Thackeray's The Luck of Barry Lyndon (also known as Barry Lyndon), a picaresque novel about the adventures of an 18th-century Irish rogue and social climber. John Calley of Warner Bros. agreed in 1972 to invest $2.5 million into the film, on condition that Kubrick approach major Hollywood stars, to ensure it of success. Like previous films, Kubrick and his art department conducted {{an enormous amount of}} research, and he went <b>from</b> <b>knowing</b> very little about the 18th century {{at the start of the}} production to becoming an expert on it. Extensive photographs were taken of locations and artwork in particular, and paintings were meticulously replicated from works of the great masters of the period in the film. The film was shot on location in Ardmore, County Waterford, Ireland, beginning in the autumn of 1973, at a cost of $11 million with a cast and crew of 170. The decision to shoot in Ireland stemmed from the fact that it still retained many buildings from the 18th century period which England lacked. The production was problematic from the start, plagued with heavy rain and political strife involving Northern Ireland at the time. After Kubrick received death threats from the IRA in the New Year of 1974 due to the shooting scenes with English soldiers, he fled Ireland with his family on a ferry from Dún Laoghaire under an assumed identity, and filming resumed in England.|$|E

25|$|The Apology of Socrates {{begins with}} Socrates {{addressing}} {{the jury to}} ask if the men of Athens (the jury) have been persuaded by the Orators Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus, who have accused Socrates of corrupting the young people {{of the city and}} of impiety against the pantheon of Athens. The first sentence of his speech establishes the theme of the dialogue — that philosophy begins with an admission of ignorance. Socrates later clarifies that point of philosophy when he says that whatever wisdom he possesses comes <b>from</b> <b>knowing</b> that he knows nothing (23b, 29b).|$|E

Aquinas saw two groups of people who prohibited themselves <b>from</b> <b>knowing</b> Christ.

25|$|Throughout linguists' testing, {{the size}} of Genie's {{vocabulary}} and {{the speed with which}} she expanded it continued to outstrip all anticipations. By mid-1975 she could accurately name most objects she encountered, and clearly knew more words than she regularly used. By contrast, Genie had far more difficulty with learning and using basic grammar. She clearly mastered certain principles of grammar, and her receptive comprehension consistently remained significantly ahead of her production, but the rate of her grammar acquisition was far slower than normal and resulted in an unusually large disparity between her vocabulary and grammar. In everyday conversations Genie typically spoke only in short utterances and inconsistently used what grammar she knew, although her use of grammar remained significantly better in imitation, and her conversational competence markedly improved during her stay but remained very low, which the scientists found unsurprising and suggested provided evidence that the ability to engage in conversation was a separate skill <b>from</b> <b>knowing</b> language.|$|E
25|$|While one Days follows their Lord, their {{counterpart}} {{lives in}} a monastery-type environment in the far north of Orwynne, kept away from anything other than their principal purpose, to compile the life journal of their chosen Runelord. The power of the Days order comes <b>from</b> <b>knowing</b> that {{at any given time}} they can find out what is happening to any particular noble at any place in the world. Therefore, should they wish to, the Days could influence events on a kingdom-wide scale. However, their service is completely focused upon observation, with a strict policy of noninterference – {{even in the face of}} cataclysmic war they would not act to save millions, nor would a Days stop to save a single drowning person. Rumors and legends abound, though, of some Days or another betraying his vows of noninterference and sharing knowledge with his lord. They also seem to use their knowledge to tear down lords who attempt to drive them away, sharing the lord's plans and secrets with his enemies.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} {{evidence}} based practice {{has also had}} an influence {{in the field of}} education. Here, some commentators have suggested that the putative lack of any conspicuous progress is attributable to practice resting in the unconnected and noncumulative experience of thousands of individual teachers, each re-inventing the wheel and failing to learn from hard scientific evidence about 'what works'. Opponents of this view argue that hard scientific evidence is a misnomer in education; knowing that a drug works (in medicine) is entirely different <b>from</b> <b>knowing</b> that a teaching method works, for the latter will depend on a host of factors, not least those to do with the style, personality and beliefs of the teacher and the needs of the particular children (Hammersley 2013). Some opponents of EBP in education suggest that teachers need to develop their own personal practice, dependent on personal knowledge garnered through their own experience. Others argue that this must be combined with research evidence, but without the latter being treated as a privileged source.|$|E
25|$|Wheat {{normally}} needs between 110 and 130 days between sowing and harvest, {{depending upon}} climate, seed type, and soil conditions (winter wheat lies dormant during a winter freeze). Optimal crop management {{requires that the}} farmer have a detailed understanding of each stage of development in the growing plants. In particular, spring fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and growth regulators are typically applied only at specific stages of plant development. For example, it is currently recommended that the second application of nitrogen is best done when the ear (not visible at this stage) is about 1cm in size (Z31 on Zadoks scale). Knowledge of stages {{is also important to}} identify periods of higher risk from the climate. For example, pollen formation from the mother cell, and the stages between anthesis and maturity are susceptible to high temperatures, and this adverse effect is made worse by water stress. Farmers also benefit <b>from</b> <b>knowing</b> when the 'flag leaf' (last leaf) appears, as this leaf represents about 75% of photosynthesis reactions during the grain filling period, and so should be preserved from disease or insect attacks to ensure a good yield.|$|E

A recent paper by Klibanoff, Marinacci and Mukerji (KMM, 2005) generalizes a smooth {{version of the}} max-min expected utility model with multiple priors. We construct the uncertainty premium based on the KMM model (generalizing Pratt’s risk premium). We show that when consumer preferences are characterized by constant relative risk and ambiguity aversion, the uncertainty premium can decrease {{with an increase in}} agent risk aversion. This happens because increasing risk aversion always results in a lower ambiguity premium. Similar qualitative results hold for the case of constant absolute ambiguity aversion. The positive ambiguity premium might give an additional explanation to the equity premium puzzle...|$|R
