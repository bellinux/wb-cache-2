Professor Gangadean will explore a deep evolutionary trend in and amongst our great spiritual traditions {{and bring to}} the fore an emergent consensus and convergence of our diverse sacred traditions toward Global Spirituality and a profound common ground in shared Global Sacred Space. The Quaker Tradition has been exemplary in moving towards such an open global sacred space. The untapped resources and potential of this tradition are enormous as spiritual communities self-evolve to this next inevitable stage of spiritual awakening for our global age. This call to an unprecedented spiritual experiment is designed to meet this urgent need and to open sacred space in which diverse people across our different worlds, perspectives and orientations may come together <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>dialogue</b> and celebration to discover and co-create the power of global sacred space...|$|E

Sister Maria Gabriella, called by her vocation to be apart from the world, devoted her life to meditation and prayer centered on chapter seventeen of Saint John's Gospel, and offered her life for Christian unity. ...The example of Sister Maria Gabriella is instructive; it helps us to understand that there are no special times, situations or places of prayer for unity.

However, this diversity gives rise to a fundamental question, that is, how can we dilate our minds in order to appreciate and understand a way of life different from our own? The art of crossing worlds through dialogue {{lies at the heart of}} philosophy, and it is for this reason that education must now address the issues relevant to our time by nurturing students' dialogical and rational abilities in order to pave the way to a societal structure grounded in mindfulness, critical and meditative reasoning, and compassion, that does not objectify the Other. Philosophical education should develop students' intelligence and awareness, and give them the skills of how to think (not what to think) so that they can question their assumptions and their worldview, strengthen their reasoning abilities and their awareness, and learn how to communicate and connect with others regardless of their worldview. This need to promote and facilitate the ethics of dialogue across worldviews can be accomplished through the philosophy for children pedagogy, and by engaging <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> <b>dialogue.</b> Thus, the primary objective of this thesis is to explore pre-college philosophical education and pedagogy, and the way in which it creates a space where students can learn the art and ethics of dialoging across worlds in a non-objectifying manner.

These matters are not always explicitly stated, but they underlie the challenges felt by all to adapt to new realities. Adaptation, the article thankfully concludes is ultimately a shared experience in {{that we want to}} and can help one another. A new way of integration is proposed, that doesn't cower in the face of increasing complexity, and plurality, and resulting hybridisations - all characteristic of the age. Commencing with locating ourselves in relation to modernity and globalization, the article proceeds to examine the significance of Bildung; ‘meta-transitioning' as Dowson terms it; and the call for integrity. The second-half of the article considers such matters as the place of corporate responsibility; leadership today; ‘cooperant’-style volunteering and work experiences for students; and the employment market in the face of inequality. Here also Paul Dowson sets out to introduce some of the key ideas covered in his forthcoming (2015) textbook: Personal and professional development for business students.

40|$|This generic {{qualitative}} study {{was aimed at}} enculturating, through a four staged intervention, access students at Lerotholi Polytechnic in Maseru, Lesotho. The core purpose was to give students an opportunity to practice using Discourses of science as the meaningful way of learning. The intervention predetermined stages were named Conceptual Foundation, Conceptual Initiation, Conceptual Formulation, and Conceptual Application. This two week intervention introducing the concept of interaction of magnetic field patterns, was implemented in 2002 and 2003 academic years. The design of the intervention was informed by sociocultural theory and situated cognition. The basic tenet therefore {{in this study is}} that learning science is a social phenomenon, it is situated and distributed across physical and social aspects. On the basis of this position, this study adapted learning science as enculturation into community of practice. Data collected in this study was analysed using a discourse analysis approach in which the main tool comprised studying semiotic, activity, material, political, and sociocultural aspects (acronym SAMPS) of a situation. Two aspects, activity and semiotic, were identified as being critical in understanding meaning – making and therefore foregrounded. The activity aspect of Discourse analysis highlighted emergent categories comprising each predetermined stage. Activities identified in these emergent categories reveal students’ talk, and/or practicing of Discourses of science, commencing from a level of talk that is dominated by prior knowledge recollection. Then it becomes ventriloquation, gradually developing to higher cognitive demand than mere recollection of prior knowledge. Lastly the activities show own talk used to develop and express understanding of application. The semiotic aspect analysis underlines the importance of the following issues during the process of introduction as well as practicing of ways of engaging scientific Discourses; Communicative approaches and discourse patterns, Practicing of Discourses of science, and Language of learning and teaching. Evidently, construction of meaning is related to communicative approaches and discourse patterns that students engage. The four communicative approaches identified, Statement – Answer – Statement, Statement – Question – Statement, Explanation – Answer – Explanation, and Explanation – Answer – Explanation lead to two discourse patterns that students engaged in interpersonal communication; the surface and <b>deep</b> <b>dialogue</b> discourse patterns. Surface Dialogue refers to a communication between two or more people engaging Statement – Accept – iii Statement or Explanation – Accept – Explanation approach. <b>Deep</b> <b>Dialogue</b> refers to an interpersonal communication between two, or more, people engaging Statement – Question – Statement or Explanation – Question – Explanation patterns. Though <b>deep</b> <b>dialogue</b> approach occurred throughout the four stages of the intervention, it is observed that the occurrence improved during the last two stages. Interestingly, during the Conceptual Initiation stage, <b>deep</b> <b>dialogue</b> incidences were scarce. Arguably the classification of interpersonal talk is a pertinent conclusion insofar as talking, coupled with other stuff Discourses, is taken as critical step in enculturation. When drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of the intervention, the following considerations are important. Firstly, the core understanding of the practicing of Discourses of science is that in any classroom members of the setting, students participate by practising Discourses of a different, but aspired, community. Secondly, the proficiency of the language of learning and teaching (LoLT) is a critical element, with enormous potential of contributing negatively towards construction of meaning. Three important conclusions have been made in relation to this study in general. Firstly, the strategy to enculturate access students, coming from different backgrounds with different learning styles, has helped them to construct meaning of the physics phenomenon. Secondly, Communicative approaches and discourse patterns, practising of Discourses of science, and the language of learning and teaching enabled, and/or disabled, students to use the language of science. Lastly, the intervention implemented in this study proved to be beneficial in enhancing the sharing of meaning among students and, in general, encouraging talk which otherwise would not have taken place...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} {{evaluation}} is {{at a critical}} juncture as it faces new scrutiny and questions about what constitutes good research and good practice. I argue {{in this study that}} if the discipline is to be rooted in a sound empirical foundation, we need a clear understanding of key terms employed by scholars and practitioners alike. In particular, greater clarity concerning the term "evaluative thinking" will allow evaluators to engage <b>in</b> <b>deeper,</b> more meaningful <b>dialogue</b> about their work, thereby advancing and strengthening the field. This study empirically articulates an operational definition of evaluative thinking by systematically soliciting and analyzing opinion data from 28 evaluation experts using the Delphi technique, an iterative survey method developed by the RAND Corporation. Results across three rounds of survey administration indicate that evaluative thinking is primarily linked to one's use of data and evidence in argumentation and secondarily focused on reasoning and practice in the face of contextual constraints. Thinking evaluatively also requires striking a balance between objectivity, professional judgment, and personal conviction. With these findings in mind, the study leads to a working definition for evaluative thinking that recognizes it as a particular kind of critical thinking and problem-solving approach that is germane to the evaluation field. Specifically, it is the process by which one marshals evaluative data and evidence to construct arguments that allow one to arrive at contextualized value judgments in a transparent fashion. In light of these findings, this investigation challenges the idea that evaluation is strictly about determining an evaluand's merit and worth. Rather, it is more productive to recognize that evaluators create knowledge during the evaluative process through {{the ways in which they}} address context. As such, the evaluative act and the thinking that accompanies it can [...] and should [...] be extended to include considerations for other dimensions that provide a more nuanced understanding of the evaluand and enable one to make evaluative claims about it. Understood in this way, the notion of evaluative thinking anchors the field's sense of professional identity in the goal of solving social problems and in fulfilling an educative function...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a practical}} theology study of spiritual companionship with the saints, working with Teresa of Avila as a case study. Teresa’s writing reflects a robust understanding and practice of spiritual companionship with saints. While contemporary literature on spiritual companionship exists {{and the notion of}} friendship with saints can be found in some theological works on the communion of saints, practical theology studies that attend to the rich potential and theological meaning of friendship with saints have been lacking. This dissertation seeks to fill that gap, arguing that the relationship of saints to contemporary Christians is one of companionship within the communion of saints. This allows saints to serve as spiritual companions to contemporary Christians in ways that are analogous to contemporary personal relationships of spiritual companionship. This is an interdisciplinary study, working across disciplines of practical theology and spirituality studies while deeply engaging historical studies. Due to the importance of historical context in spirituality studies and concerns with issues of appropriation, the practical theology methodology is modified, strengthening the historical theology movement. The dissertation provides a textual and historical-contextual analysis of Teresa of Avila’s understandings and practices of friendship, including friendship with the saints. Current literature on spiritual companionship is explored and brought into a mutually critical dialogue with Teresa’s own descriptions—demonstrating common themes of journey and intimacy, affirmation and challenge, and personal transformation and growth in relationship with God. These themes are placed in dialogue with two contemporary understandings of the communion of saints, Anglican theological reflections based on liturgical practice and Elizabeth Johnson’s systematic treatment, yielding a model for companionship with saints that is grounded in norms of mutuality, deep knowledge, mutually critical dialogue, and living with differences. These norms suggest personal practices of companionship as well as contemplative pedagogical techniques for teaching the saints in an academic setting The dissertation thus presents a practical theology study of spiritual companionship with the saints, rooted <b>in</b> a <b>deep</b> historical-contextual <b>dialogue</b> with Teresa of Avila.

40|$|This article {{considers}} the historical {{development of the}} Groupe des Dombes and its significant contribution to the ecumenical movement. It begins with a presentation of the origins, identity and method of the Groupe and then traces the two main stages in its ecumenical hermeneutics: the first focused on doctrines, especially ecclesiological doctrines, the second on the important transition from dogmatics to history. Identity (in its various aspects) and conversion (as a critical re-examination of the church-dividing claims of the denominational Churches) are the two keys of the historical understanding and the ecclesiological interpretation of the Groupe des Dombes. The originality of the Groupe lies in its permanent characteristics and in the evolution of its ecumenical hermeneutics. The article articulates the main challenge for the ecumenical movement in the new cultural and inter-religious context as that of making all members of the Churches aware of the relevance and necessity of ecumenism for the authenticity of Christianity, and thus for a richer and <b>deeper</b> <b>dialogue</b> between Christianity and non-Christian religions...|$|R
40|$|The author {{begins by}} {{presenting}} two experiences {{of what he}} terms “dazzling darkness,” one in a Christian context {{and the other in}} a Buddhist context. He then looks at the Buddhist traditions in India and China to propose an explanation for the experience in the Buddhist context. In so doing, he connects darkness to suffering and light to Nirvana and Buddha-nature. Then he turns to the mystical writings of Chiara Lubich to propose an explanation for the Christian experience and its relation to suffering and the luminosity of God in suffering through Jesus Forsaken. In the section on the writings of Chiara Lubich, the author also explores (1) her experiences of the relational arising and mutual indwelling of beings, and the indwelling of the light and love of God in the darkness of suffering existence, and (2) the experiences of Buddha-nature, dependent arising, mutual indwelling, and the identity of Nirvana and samsāra in Buddhism. He proposes that while there are certainly differences, considering dazzling darkness on the experiential level provides a platform for a <b>deeper</b> <b>dialogue</b> between Buddhism and Christianity...|$|R
