5|$|Prior to federation, {{the various}} Australian colonies could, and often did, charge tariffs on goods {{from the other}} colonies, ostensibly for the {{protection}} of their domestic manufacturing industries, mainly based in the larger cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. For a border community such as the southern Riverina, these tariffs were a sore burden, making <b>goods</b> <b>purchased</b> from Melbourne, the closest large city, more expensive and reducing the competitiveness of these towns supplying the Melbourne and Adelaide markets. In addition, crossing the border on the Murray River was a tiresome experience as each border crossing had customs posts inspecting goods and luggage to ensure all duty was paid and to reduce smuggling, a popular activity. Another item of concern was the lack of adequate river crossings. Along the Riverina the Murray was—and remains—part of New South Wales, who had no interest in assisting border residents to access goods and services in Victoria that may otherwise have been sourced from Sydney.|$|E

At an {{altitude}} of , there was no ready availability of food or supplies and, lacking warm clothing, several soldiers froze to death or lost limbs in the high-altitude cold climate. Kagame {{spent the next two}} months reorganising the army, without carrying out any military operations. Alexis Kanyarengwe, a Hutu colonel who had previously worked with Habyarimana but had fallen out with him and gone into exile, joined the RPF and was appointed chairman of the organisation; the appointment of Kanyarengwe was motivated by a desire to appear inclusive, but most of the other senior recruits at the time were Ugandan-based Tutsi. Rank and file numbers grew steadily, with volunteers coming from the exile communities in Burundi, Zaire and other countries. Kagame maintained tight discipline in his army, enforcing a regimented training routine, as well as a large set of rules for soldiers' conduct. Soldiers were expected to pay for <b>goods</b> <b>purchased</b> in the community, refrain from alcohol and drugs, and to establish a good reputation for the RPF amongst the local population.

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the possibility that luxury purchasing among older consumers is related to their cognitive age (i. e., the age they feel) and, accordingly, the study reported herein assesses {{the effects of the}} underlying luxury motives on cognitive age. Results show that older consumers who relate luxury <b>goods</b> <b>purchasing</b> mainly to status reasons tend to feel younger than those who consider luxury <b>goods</b> <b>purchasing</b> primarily as a means to express their individual style. Furthermore, the study finds that, in order to meet their needs and wants, older consumers with a lower cognitive age rely more on brands than specific products; so their luxury <b>goods</b> <b>purchasing</b> intention is influenced more by brand images than product characteristics. These findings have marketing implications in the context of planning ad hoc advertising strategies aimed at luxury selling to older consumers...|$|R
5|$|Following the {{diplomatic}} venture of Zhang Qian into Central Asia {{during the reign}} of Emperor Wu of Han (r.141–87BC), the Han Empire of China sent a delegation to Mithridates II's court in 121BC. The Han embassy opened official trade relations with Parthia via the Silk Road yet did not achieve a desired military alliance against the confederation of the Xiongnu. The Parthian Empire was enriched by taxing the Eurasian caravan trade in silk, the most highly priced luxury good imported by the Romans. Pearls were also a highly valued import from China, while the Chinese purchased Parthian spices, perfumes, and fruits. Exotic animals were also given as gifts from the Arsacid to Han courts; in 87 AD Pacorus II of Parthia sent lions and Persian gazelles to Emperor Zhang of Han (r.75–88AD). Besides silk, Parthian <b>goods</b> <b>purchased</b> by Roman merchants included iron from India, spices, and fine leather. Caravans traveling through the Parthian Empire brought West Asian and sometimes Roman luxury glasswares to China. The merchants of Sogdia, speaking an Eastern Iranian language, served as the primary middlemen of this vital silk trade between Parthia and Han China.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} in Europe remained volatile into 1794. Off Northern France, the French Atlantic Fleet had mutinied due to errors in provisions and pay. In consequence, the French Navy officer corps suffered greatly {{from the effects}} of the Reign of Terror, with many experienced sailors being executed, imprisoned or dismissed from the service for perceived disloyalty. The shortage of provisions was more than a navy problem though; France itself was starving because the social upheavals of the previous year had combined with a harsh winter to ruin the harvest. By this time at war with all her neighbours, France had nowhere to turn for overland imports of fresh provisions. Eventually a solution to the food crisis was agreed by the National Convention: food produced in France's overseas colonies would be concentrated on board a fleet of merchant ships gathered in Chesapeake Bay, and augmented with food and <b>goods</b> <b>purchased</b> from the United States. During April and May 1794, the merchantmen would convoy the supplies across the Atlantic to Brest, protected by elements of the French Atlantic Fleet.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{the decision}} of when to buy a durable good affects both non-durable consumption and business cycle dynamics. At the individual level, we show that the timing of durable <b>goods</b> <b>purchases</b> {{plays an important role}} in smoothing consumption over time. In the benchmark case, the time at which the agent <b>purchases</b> the durable <b>good</b> is the only variable that reacts to changes in wealth, while other variables, such as the consumption of non-durables or the amount of the durable that the individual purchases, remain unchanged. At the aggregate level, we show that timing decisions can serve as a mechanism for the amplification and propagation of aggregate shocks. A decline in wealth causes individuals to delay their durable <b>goods</b> <b>purchases</b> which reduces demand dramatically for some time. ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{letters of}} the poet which were first sent to the press were given by Cromwell to his mistress, Elizabeth Thomas, who sold them in her {{distress}} to Curll for ten guineas. She was a shameless woman, and boldly justified her conduct. [...] "Everyone," [...] she said, [...] "knows that the person to whom a letter is addressed has the same right to dispose of it as he has of <b>goods</b> <b>purchased</b> with his money." [...] The right which originally belonged to Cromwell, of publishing to the world whatever had been written {{to him in the}} confidence of friendship, he had, by his gift, transferred to herself; and thus it appeared that Cromwell had a right to be treacherous to Pope, and Mrs. Thomas a right to be treacherous to both Pope and Cromwell. With more reason she inferred that neither of them at heart would be vexed at the proceeding. Cromwell, she urged, could not be angry that the world should know [...] "the professions of love, gratitude, and veneration made him by so celebrated an author," [...] and Pope could not resent the exhibition of the [...] "early pregnancy of his genius." [...] "And yet," [...] she continued, [...] "had either of you been asked, common modesty would have obliged you to refuse what you would not be displeased with if done without your knowledge."[15] There can be little doubt, from his subsequent conduct, that this was the light in which the publication was viewed by the poet, notwithstanding his assertion in a note to the Dunciad, [...] "that he was ashamed of the letters as very trivial things, full not only of levities, but of wrong judgments of men and books, and only excusable from the youth and inexperience of the writer." [...] Mrs. Thomas did him an incalculable injury, not by revealing his secrets, but by flattering his vanity. The favourable reception of his correspondence originated the desire to give some further specimens to the world, and led him into the miserable series of falsehoods and frauds by which he endeavoured to accomplish his design without seeming to be privy to it.|$|E
6000|$|During {{his stay}} upon this station he had ample {{opportunity}} of observing the scandalous {{practices of the}} contractors, prize-agents, and other persons in the West Indies connected with the naval service. When he was first left with the command, and bills were brought him to sign for money which was owing for <b>goods</b> <b>purchased</b> for the navy, he required the original voucher, that he might examine whether those goods had been really purchased at the market price; but to produce vouchers {{would not have been}} convenient, and therefore was not the custom. Upon this Nelson wrote to Sir Charles Middleton, then Comptroller of the Navy, representing the abuses which were likely to be practised in this manner. The answer which he received seemed to imply that the old forms were thought sufficient; and thus, having no alternative, he was compelled, with his eyes open, to submit to a practice originating in fraudulent intentions. Soon afterwards two Antigua merchants informed him that they were privy to great frauds which had been committed upon government in various departments; at Antigua, to the amount of nearly L500,000; at Lucie, L300,000; at Barbadoes, L250,000; at Jamaica, upwards of a million. The informers were both shrewd sensible men of business; they did not affect to be actuated by a sense of justice, but required a percentage upon so much as government should actually recover through their means. Nelson examined the books and papers which they produced, and was convinced that government had been most infamously plundered. Vouchers, he found, in that country, were no check whatever: the principle was, that [...] "a thing was always worth what it would bring;" [...] and the merchants were in the habit of signing vouchers for each other, without even the appearance of looking at the articles. These accounts he sent home to the different departments which had been defrauded; but the peculators were too powerful, and they succeeded not merely in impeding inquiry, but even in raising prejudices against Nelson at the Board of Admiralty, which it was many years before he could subdue.|$|E
