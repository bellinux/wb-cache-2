The present paper proposes a finite element based methodology for the stochastic buckling simulation of <b>I-sections,</b> which uses random fields to accurately describe the fluctuating size and spatial correlation of imperfections. The stochastic buckling behaviour is evaluated by crude Monte-Carlo simulation, based on {{a large number of}} <b>I-section</b> samples, which are generated by spectral representation and subsequently analyzed by nonlinear shell finite elements. The application to an example <b>I-section</b> beam-column demonstrates that the simulated buckling response is in good agreement with experiments and follows key concepts of imperfection triggered buckling. The derivation of the buckling load variability and the stochastic interaction curve for combined compression and major axis bending as well as stochastic sensitivity studies for thickness and geometric imperfections illustrate potential benefits of the proposed methodology in buckling related research and applications. © Springer-Verlag 2010...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental {{results of a}} push-out test on the bond behavior between {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) <b>I-section</b> and concrete. The specimen {{is in the form of}} a concrete rectangular column with the GFRP <b>I-section</b> (<b>I-section)</b> encased in the middle. Four specimens with different configurations were cast and tested. The main parameters involved bond length and the transverse stirrups. The specimens were divided into two groups in accordance to the bond length. The two specimens in Group A had the same bond length of 300 mm, and the transverse steel stirrups were used at one of the specimens. The bond length of the two specimens in Group B was 450 mm, and one of the specimens was also reinforced with stirrups. Push-out was used to conduct this test and all the <b>I-sections</b> were pushed out. The experimental results show that <b>I-sections</b> with longer bond length have high ultimate bond strength. The development of cracks on the concrete is reduced by the stirrups. Nevertheless, the ultimate bond strength of the specimen is not improved when stirrups were used. In addition, a preliminary bond stress-slip model is proposed, and the theoretical results are in close agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—An {{experimental}} and analytical research on shear buckling of a comparably large polymer composite <b>I-section</b> is presented. It {{is known that}} shear buckling load of a large span composite beam {{is difficult to determine}} experimentally. In order to sensitively detect shear buckling of the tested <b>I-section,</b> twenty strain rosettes and eight displacement sensors were applied and attached on the web and flange surfaces. The tested specimen was a pultruded composite beam made of vinylester resin, E-glass, carbon fibers and micro-fillers. Various coupon tests were performed before the shear buckling test to obtain fundamental material properties of the <b>I-section.</b> An asymmetric four-point bending loading scheme was utilized for the shear test. The loading scheme resulted in a high shear and almost zero moment condition {{at the center of the}} web panel. The shear buckling load was successfully determined after analyzing the obtained test data from strain rosettes and displacement sensors. An analytical approach was also performed to verify the experimental results and to support the discussed experimental program.

The first objective is to propose a complex finite strip method for distortional buckling analysis of <b>I-section</b> beams with slender webs and check the suitability for such analysis by comparing its accuracy with other methods and the second objective is to propose a simple method for predicting the distortional buckling loads of I-beams.

Ten column lengths were investigated, covering the range from stocky up to very slender columns. A nonlinear analysis of buckling and postbuckling was carried out using the displacement control method. It was observed that, {{in the case of}} stocky columns, the ultimate conditions are governed by the web failure, whereas, in the case of slender columns, the flange failure is attained due to the longitudinal compression.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study on the bond behaviour of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) <b>I-section</b> embedded in concrete. A total of five specimens with the same cross-section dimension were cast and tested using push-out test. The main parameters investigated in this study were bond length (300 mm and 450 mm), transverse stirrups and sand coating. The experimental results show that the ultimate bond stress can be improved by a longer bond length and sand coating. However, the ultimate bond stress was reduced when stirrups were used, and the reason may be because the application of stirrups affected the vibration of the concrete, causing a weak bond at the interface. The bond stress distribution at the web and the flange is analysed based on the strain of the <b>I-section.</b> Finally, a bond stress-slip model is proposed for the GFRP <b>I-section</b> with a smooth surface.

Since the compressive forces are {{much higher than the}} tensile force, therefore the cross-section of the {{connecting rod}} is designed as a different cross section and the rankine formula is used. A connecting rod subjected to a cyclic as well as axial load W may buckle with x-axis as neutral axis in the plane of rotation of the connecting rod, or y-axis is a neutral axis In our analysis, Ansys Static Structural and Linear Buckling was used a model was developed on NX- 5. In order to verify the present Ansys model, the slenderness ratio and the critical buckling stress, radius of gyration are compared with the available experimental results present in the literature and the design of X-section connecting rod having different shank cross section width. i. e. 26 mm, 25 mm, 24 mm, 23 mm, 22 mm. In this analysis, the simulations of X-section connecting rod at static load of 64. 7 KN and the configurations of connecting rod <b>I-section</b> and X-section design are proposed. The results show that converting <b>I-section</b> to X-cross section could reduce the slenderness ratio and increase a radius of gyration simultaneously. The slenderness ratio of the X-section is lower than that of <b>I-section</b> at the static load due to this strength and durability of connecting rod increases.

40|$|Tbe study {{consists}} of an experimental and analytical investigation into the lateral buckling behaviour of steel <b>I-section</b> girders braced by continuous or discrete U-frames. Scaled down laboratory tests on twin <b>I-section</b> girders {{have been carried out}} under full instrumentation and are reported. Lateral deflection of the compression flanges and final buckling modes were recorded and the coupling effect of U-frame action is clearly demonstrated. The failure loads obtained were generally higher than the corresponding design values according to BS 5400. Using a large displacement elasto-plastic finite element package, ABAQUS, finite element idealisations of the tests were established and analysed. Good correlation between the experiments and the numerical analyses was reached. Validity of the ABAQUS package was confirmed and first order elements were sufficiently effective for the analysis. This was followed by further investigation of a wider range of <b>I-section</b> girders using ABAQUS. The ultimate bending resistance of the girders obtained from finite element analysis was in general greater than the corresponding design values to BS 5400, particularly so with girders of high slendemess. Thus the present design method is considered to be unduly conservative. The cause of this conservatism in BS 5400 is discussed. The expression for the calculation of effective length of U-frame braced girders was found to be reasonable. Based on the results from ABAQUS and reviews of the limited research directly related to this study, two main parameters in the BS 5400 expression for beam slenderness seem inappropriate for lateral buckling of an <b>I-section</b> girder under U-frame restraint. These are the radius of gyration of the whole girder section and the ratio of overall depth of a girder to mean flange thickness. Instead, radius of gyration of the compression flange together with a contribution from the adjoining web section was found to be more appropriate as also was the web slenderness. In addition, a modification is proposed to the present limiting stress curve for lateral buckling of bare steel <b>I-section</b> girders. Empirically derived factors have been introduced. The general procedures in the existing design method to BS 5400 remain similar, however. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{buckling}} {{behavior of}} thin-walled <b>I-sections</b> is {{very sensitive to}} imperfections. The experi-mental buckling load of an imperfect I-beam is drastically reduced {{as compared to the}} theoretical ultimate strength of the perfect member. Additionally, the fluctuating size and appearance of imperfections result in a wide scattering in experimental buckling loads of nominally equal mem-bers. So far, only little experience exists in modelling imperfection triggered buckling in <b>I-sections</b> from a stochastic point of view. The present study is targeted at simulating the buckling variability of an example series of 6 slender I-beams combining advanced methods of nonlinear structural finite elements and modern stochastic process theory. Closely based on experimental imperfection measurements, appropri-ate models for residual stresses, geometric and thickness imperfections are developed ranging from conventional deterministic approaches to non-homogeneous random fields. For the estima-tion of corresponding evolutionary power spectra, a wavelet based method for separable processes is established. Sampled by spectral representation, random imperfection data are finally intro-duced into a numerical finite element model. For stability analysis, a Fortran implementation of the triangular composite facet shell element TRIC with geometric and material nonlinearity is used. A large scale Monte Carlo simulation is then conducted to determine the response variability of a series of <b>I-section</b> samples with random imperfections under pure compression, pure major axis bending and varying combinations thereof. The results reproduce the stability behavior of experimental tests very well and offer insights into the role of imperfections in the buckling process of the examined I-beams. i...|$|R
