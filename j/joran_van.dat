5|$|Holloway {{was last}} seen by her classmates around 1:30a.m. on Monday, May 30 as she was leaving the Oranjestad bar and nightclub Carlos'n Charlie's. She left {{in a car with}} 17-year-old <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> der Sloot—a Dutch honors student who was living in Aruba and {{attending}} the International School of Aruba— and his two Surinamese friends, 21-year-old Deepak Kalpoe (the owner of the car) and 18-year-old Satish Kalpoe. Holloway had been scheduled to fly home later that day, but did not appear for her return flight. Her packed luggage and passport were found in her Holiday Inn room. Aruban authorities initiated searches for Holloway throughout the island and surrounding waters, but did not find her.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, the Kalpoes filed a slander and {{libel suit}} against Skeeters (who died in January 2007) and Dr. Phil. in Los Angeles. Holloway's parents responded by filing a {{wrongful}} death {{lawsuit against the}} Kalpoes in the same venue. The wrongful death suit was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction on June 1, 2007; the libel and slander case was initially set for trial on October 12, 2011 but was later set for April 2015. An earlier suit had been filed in New York City by the parents against Paulus and <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> der Sloot and served on them {{on a visit to}} New York. The case had been dismissed in August 2006 as filed in an inconvenient forum.|$|E
500|$|<b>Joran</b> Andreas Petrus <b>van</b> der Sloot ( [...] ; born 6 August 1987) is a Dutch {{convicted murderer}} who killed Stephany Flores Ramírez in Lima, Peru in 2010. He {{is also the}} prime suspect in the 2005 {{disappearance}} of Natalee Holloway in Aruba.|$|R
5|$|<b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> der Sloot {{was born}} in Arnhem, Netherlands. He {{is one of three}} sons born to Paulus van der Sloot (1952–2010), a lawyer, and Anita van der Sloot-Hugen, an art teacher. In 1990, his family moved from Arnhem to Aruba, where he was an honor student at the International School of Aruba. He was {{considered}} a star soccer and tennis athlete at the school. Van der Sloot competed in doubles tennis with his father at the Moët et Chandon Anniversary Cup in 2005 and hoped to play for Saint Leo University near Tampa, Florida. Van der Sloot's mother said he had a problem with lying and had a tendency to sneak out of the house at night to go to casinos.|$|E
5|$|Holloway was {{scheduled}} to fly home from Aruba on May 30, 2005, but she failed to appear for her flight. She was last seen by her classmates outside of Carlos'n Charlie's, a restaurant and nightclub in Oranjestad. She {{was in a car}} with local residents <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak and Satish. When the three men were questioned, they said that they dropped off Holloway at her hotel and denied knowing what had become of her. Upon further investigation by authorities, Van der Sloot was arrested twice on suspicion of involvement in her disappearance and the Kalpoes were each arrested three times. Due to lack of evidence, the three suspects were released each time without being charged with a crime. Holloway's parents have criticized Aruban police for the lack of progress in the investigation and interrogation of the three men who were last seen with their daughter. The family also called for a boycott of Aruba, which gained Alabama Governor Bob Riley's support but failed to gain widespread backing.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 2006, <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> der Sloot and {{his father}} Paul were in New York City for an {{interview}} with ABC Primetime when they were served with a lawsuit filed by Twitty and her former husband David Holloway. The lawsuit alleged personal injury against Natalee Holloway and also alleged that Van der Sloot's father created a permissive environment. However, the case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds on August 3, 2006.|$|E
25|$|Around March 29, 2010, <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> der Sloot {{contacted}} Twitty's attorney John Q. Kelly with {{an offer}} to reveal the location of her daughter's body and the circumstances surrounding her death for an advance of US$25,000 against a total of $250,000. Kelly said that he secretly went to Aruba in April to meet with Van der Sloot, who was desperate for money, and gave him $100. Kelly notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation {{to set up a}} sting operation with the Aruban authorities. On May 10, Van der Sloot accepted the amount of $15,000 by wire transfer from Birmingham to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Natalee's remains in the foundation of a house. Authorities determined that the information that he in return provided was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Natalee's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the Office of the U.S. Attorney in Birmingham later claimed in a joint statement that they were working as quickly as possible and that the Lima murder was in no way the result of them allowing Van der Sloot to flee Aruba with the extorted money.|$|E
500|$|On November 24, 2008, Fox News aired an {{interview}} with Van der Sloot in which he alleged that he sold Holloway into sexual slavery, receiving money both when Holloway was taken, and later on to keep quiet. Van der Sloot also alleged that his father paid off two police officers who had learned that Holloway was taken to Venezuela. Van der Sloot later retracted the statements made in the interview. The show also aired part of an audio recording provided by Van der Sloot, which he alleged is a phone conversation {{between him and his}} father, in which the father displays knowledge of his son's purported involvement in human trafficking. According to Mos, this voice heard on the recording is not that of Paulus van der Sloot—the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reports that the [...] "father's" [...] voice is almost certainly that of <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> der Sloot himself, trying to speak in a lower tone. Paulus van der Sloot {{died of a heart attack}} on February 10, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Twitty {{was criticized}} for her focus on <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers, to the {{exclusion}} of any other theory as to what happened to Natalee. According to the lawsuit filed by the Kalpoe brothers, she has (on various television programs) repeatedly accused them and van der Sloot of [...] "sexual assault" [...] and [...] "gang rape" [...] of her daughter.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2005, Twitty's {{daughter}} Natalee was in Aruba on {{a graduation}} trip with fellow students from Mountain Brook High School. Natalee {{was scheduled to}} fly home on May 30, but failed to appear for her flight. [...] She was last seen by her classmates outside Carlos'n Charlie's, a Caribbean restaurant and nightclub in Oranjestad, {{in a car with}} locals <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> der Sloot and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe.|$|E
2500|$|Twitty also {{alleged that}} the person who van der Sloot {{supposedly}} called that evening was his father Paul, who according to Holloway [...] "orchestrated what to do next". She and Dave Holloway alleged that <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> der Sloot was receiving [...] "special legal favors". After the court decision not to rearrest Van der Sloot was affirmed, Twitty stated, [...] "I think that what I do take comfort in, his life is a living hell", later adding, [...] "I'd be good with a Midnight Express prison anywhere for Joran." ...|$|E
2500|$|Twitty {{was also}} criticized for making what have been {{deemed to be}} {{inconsistent}} and contradictory statements (for example, as to whether there were operating security cameras at the Holiday Inn). [...] According to Julia Renfro, U.S.-born editor of the Aruban tourist-oriented newspaper, Aruba Today, who befriended Holloway {{in the early days}} of the investigation, Holloway pandered to tabloid television and her [...] "behavior was odd from the get-go". Renfro noted that [...] "Holloway immediately concluded that her daughter had been kidnapped and made no effort to check hospitals or police", adding that within a couple of days, after fixing responsibility on <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> der Sloot, Twitty [...] "was telling TV interviewers that she knew her daughter had been gang-raped and murdered".|$|E
2500|$|Beth Twitty alleged in {{televised}} {{interviews that}} <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers {{knew more than}} they told, and {{that at least one}} of them sexually assaulted or raped her daughter. Holloway stated that she received copies of police statements stating that van der Sloot admitted having sex with Natalee at his home and described intimate details of her. She has never released copies of the alleged statement, though she characterizes them as admissions of [...] "sexual assault" [...] However, Vinda de Sousa, former Holloway/Twitty family attorney from Aruba understood that the admission may have been for consensual sex. In addition, former Aruban deputy police commissioner Gerold G. Dompig denied that any such statement was made, stating that Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers consistently denied having sex with Natalee.|$|E
2500|$|On April 19, 2009, Lifetime aired Natalee Holloway, {{starring}} Tracy Pollan as Beth Holloway-Twitty, Grant Show as George [...] "Jug" [...] Twitty, Amy Gumenick as Natalee Holloway and Jacques Strydom as <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> der Sloot. The film re-enacts Natalee's disappearance and stages re-creations {{of various}} scenarios, {{based on the}} testimony of key players and suspects. The broadcast of the film attracted 3.2 million viewers, garnering the highest television ratings in the network's history at the time. Although it set ratings records for Lifetime, the movie was not received well by critic Alec Harvey of The Birmingham News. Harvey called the movie [...] "sloppy and uneven, a forgettable look at the tragedy that consumed the nation's attention for months". However, Jake Meaney of PopMatters found the film to be surprisingly [...] "calm and levelheaded", and praised Tracy Pollan's portrayal of Beth. Twitty {{said that she was}} honored by Pollan's portrayal and that there [...] "could not have been a better choice." ...|$|E
