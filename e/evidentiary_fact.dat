60|$|When a fact is {{supposed}}, though incorrectly, to be evidentiary of, or a mark of, {{some other}} fact, {{there must be}} a cause of the error; the supposed <b>evidentiary</b> <b>fact</b> must be connected in some particular manner with the fact of which it is deemed evidentiary—must stand in some particular relation to it, without which relation it would not be regarded in that light. The relation may either be one resulting from the simple contemplation of the two facts side by side with one another, or it may depend on some process of mind, by which a previous association has been established between them. Some peculiarity of relation, however, there must be; the fact which can, even by the wildest aberration, be supposed to prove another fact, must stand in some special position with regard to it; and if we could ascertain and define that special position, we should perceive the origin of the error.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{hearsay rule}} is {{directed}} only at references to statements asserted {{for the truth}} of their contents, the courts were alive {{to the dangers of}} circumstantial as well as direct evidence: the hearsay rule operates in two ways: (a) it forbids using the credit of an absent declarant as the basis of an inference, and (b) it forbids using in the same way the mere <b>evidentiary</b> <b>fact</b> of the statement as having been made under such and such circumstances. The nature of the genuine danger of allowing a jury to make an inappropriate inference about the nature of such evidence has led to misunderstandings about the nature of hearsay.|$|E
40|$|The {{foundation}} {{theory of}} evidence requires well-founded evidence as its initial basis {{in order to}} create an effective inferential chain between the <b>evidentiary</b> <b>fact</b> and the fact of consequence. The fact of consequence is the essential element of the claim. Well-founded evidence means the evidence satisfied with the “foundation” requirement. To achieve this “foundation” requirement, the evidence must be case-specific, assertive and probably true. This requirement of “foundation” derives from the rule against speculation. “Speculation” is the inferential process of substituting generalizations for facts that are unsupported by evidence. Generalizations must be distinguished from evidence although they are inevitable in the inferential process of fact-finding. They should always be supported by evidence. The foundation theory of evidence requires well-founded evidence as the initial basis of the inferential chain in order to prevent speculation...|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{the term}} [...] "recusal" [...] is used most often {{with respect to}} court proceedings. Two {{sections}} of Title 28 of the United States Code (the Judicial Code) provide standards for judicial disqualification or recusal.

[...] The section also provides that a judge is disqualified [...] "where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed <b>evidentiary</b> <b>facts</b> concerning the proceeding"; when the judge has previously served as a lawyer or witness concerning the same case or has expressed an opinion concerning its outcome; or when the judge {{or a member of}} his or her immediate family has a financial interest in the outcome of the proceeding.|$|R
40|$|The current {{interpretation}} of the Fourth Amendment allows evidence obtained from improper searches to be suppressed and not used in trial. This practice, known as the Exclusionary Rule, prohibits the jury from hearing all <b>evidentiary</b> <b>facts</b> about the crime being tried and at times, allows a defendant to go free due to illegally obtained evidence. The Exclusionary Rule {{has been a part}} of criminal proceedings for 83 years and has been modified often since its inception. This research examines the current beliefs about the usefulness of the Exclusionary Rule among criminal justice professionals and possible alternatives as it pertains to the rights of individuals versus the safety of the general public. In general, the study indicates the belief that the Exclusionary Rule is inseparable from the Fourth Amendment and viable constitutional alternatives do not exist. Also indicated is the belief that police officers’ misunderstanding and lack of training are responsible for evidence being suppressed...|$|R
40|$|There aremany {{types of}} bothminor andmajor crime. In some cases, {{offenders}} are rapidly identified and apprehended and {{the cases are}} easily resolved. Others are more puzzling, and their resolution confronts us with a challenge because of their complexity and, at times, repetitiveness. Criminal profiling applies particularly to the latter {{because of the difficulty}} often encountered in identifying criminals and detecting theirmotives. Crime is frequently an interpersonal event and takes place in a given ambience. Therefore, the crime scene assumes great importance for investigators, who attempt to draw from their observations the typology of both the victim and the victimizer. One could argue that criminal profiling consists of two stages, the first being general profiling and the second specific profiling. Gen-eral profiling is part of the general investigative analysis of any crime. Themeticu-lous collection of data at the crime scene is important to arrive at the mechanics and dynamics of the crime itself. Specific profiling becomes more refined in the collection of <b>evidentiary</b> <b>facts</b> at the crime scene, with the main purpose of draw-ing a typology of the behavioral characteristics and psychological makeup of th...|$|R

5000|$|Moot {{court is}} an extracurricular {{activity}} at many law schools {{in which participants}} take part in simulated court proceedings, usually involving drafting memorials or memoranda and participating in oral argument. The term [...] "moot" [...] traces its origins to Anglo-Saxon times, when a moot (gemōt) was a gathering of prominent men in a locality to discuss matters of local importance. The modern activity differs from a mock trial, as moot court usually refers to a simulated appellate court or arbitral case (appellate advocacy), while a mock trial usually refers to a simulated jury trial or bench trial (trial advocacy). Moot court does not involve actual testimony by witnesses, cross-examination, or the presentation of evidence, but is focused solely on {{the application of the}} law to a common set of <b>evidentiary</b> assumptions and <b>facts</b> to which the competitors are introduced. In most countries, the phrase [...] "moot court" [...] may be shortened to simply [...] "moot" [...] or [...] "mooting." [...] Participants are either referred to as [...] "mooters" [...] or [...] "mooties".|$|R
40|$|The chief {{practical}} difficulty today, as always, lies in {{the particular}} application of a mass of evidentiary rules, in determining the bearing of various principles upon a given <b>evidentiary</b> issue of <b>fact</b> here and now.

40|$|DNA {{evidence}} {{is one of}} the most prominent types of physical evidence utilised within forensic investigations. There is a sound reasoning behind this – the resources afforded to the development of DNA analysis techniques are immense, allowing the discipline almost unparalleled <b>evidentiary</b> weighting. This <b>fact</b> is reinforced by the popular knowledge of DNA within society, even those who do not have an understanding of the processes involved in DNA analysis are aware of the statistical power carried by this form of evidence. This power comes from the development of more sensitive and discriminatory forms of analysis, culminating to the point that samples previously impossible to analyse can now be a viable source of information. While this progress has allowed DNA its position at the forefront of forensic science, there needs to be awareness of the limitations and risks involved. The sensitivity now found within the science may allow more samples to be tested, but it also means that the concepts of transfer and background DNA are more relevant than ever before. There has been an influx in the amount of literature reporting on these issues and how they can affect the entire process of DNA analysis. Overall, a clear consensus emerged that the risk of contamination or corruption of DNA evidence by DNA present within the environment is a real issue, but one that can be minimised through awareness and effective decontamination protocols...|$|R
40|$|A RIGHT TO NO MEANINGFUL REVIEW: THE AFTERMATH OF SHALALA v. ILLINOIS COUNCIL ON LONG TERM CARE, INC. Ruqaiijah A. Yearby The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment {{has been}} perverted {{in the federal}} {{administrative}} system. Federal agencies, such as the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), regularly deprive individuals of liberty and property with little to no review. In its regulation {{of the health care}} industry through the Medicare program, HHS often turns a blind eye to procedural Due Process protections, such as providing individuals an opportunity to challenge the deprivation of property at a hearing, even though law grants these protections. This is evidenced by the case Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc [...] In Ill. Council, the Illinois Council of Long Term Care, a trade association of nursing homes, asserted that there was no meaningful review before they were deprived of their property, i. e. Medicare payments, because HHS would not grant a hearing. Without an agency hearing, nursing homes cannot seek federal review because under the Medicare statute they are barred from obtaining federal review until a final agency action has been issued. HHS responded by submitting an interpretation of the Medicare regulations that allowed all constitutional and procedural challenges to be heard by the agency at a full evidentiary hearing and thus move to federal court. Due to HHS’ statements, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of HHS and upheld the statutory bar to federal review until after a final agency action. Unfortunately, HHS’ interpretation of the Medicare regulations that the Court relied upon in making its decision was never adopted by the agency. As a result, HHS regularly dismisses cases brought by nursing homes to prevent the deprivation of their property. Additionally, HHS has whittled away even more of the procedural Due Process rights granted under the Medicare regulations such as a right to a full <b>evidentiary</b> hearing. In <b>fact,</b> some Administrative Law Judges of HHS are now forgoing a full evidentiary hearing to determine a case based on written submissions. The failure of HHS to provide the Due Process rights guaranteed by the agency’s governing statute, regulations, and policy statements made in court contravenes the protections guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the U. S. Constitution: the fundamental right of Americans regulated by the federal government to receive due process of law when deprived of life, liberty, or property. The hearing process of nursing homes presents an excellent opportunity to study the Due Process rights granted individuals challenging the actions of Federal Administrative Agencies. These issues are particularly compelling now because the federal government and insurance industry are using the findings of nursing home compliance hearings as the basis for fraud and abuse actions and for determining if a nursing home will receive liability insurance. This recent occurrence has made the amount of process provided during compliance hearings even more important. Furthermore, although the Supreme Court seemingly addressed this issue of process required in compliance hearings in the Shalala case, the regulatory system has substantially changed since their ruling. Thus, what the Supreme Court deemed as sufficient process in 2000, is no longer what HHS provides under the Medicare regulations calling into question whether the process given nursing homes is Constitutional...|$|R
