5|$|For the {{hand-held}} camera footage, Soderbergh used Panavision Millennium XLs {{that were}} smaller and lighter than previous cameras and {{allowed him to}} move freely. In order to tell the three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel. For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted to have different looks for each story because the audience had {{to keep track of}} many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did not want them to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> which story they were watching.|$|E
5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E
500|$|The ending {{left many}} filmgoers confused. In his scathing {{review of the}} film, Roger Ebert says that he cannot believe [...] "that the director, Joseph Sargent, would film this final climactic scene so incompetently {{that there is not}} even an {{establishing}} shot, so we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what happened on the basis of empirical evidence." ...|$|E

After winning his Emmy, Fontana made an emotional acceptance speech about the need to save the hour-long television drama, in which he said: [...] "It's not the fault of the American public that the drama is in trouble. It's us: the writers, producers, the network executives, the studio money-crunchers. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> a way to reignite the imagination of the American people."

The claim on behalf of The Gap Band and Lonnie Simmons was entered into YouTube’s content management system preventing payments to the publisher. Later, on August 12, Serbian pop artist Viktorija has also argued that [...] "Uptown Funk" [...] infringed on her track [...] "Ulice mračne nisu za devojke". She stated that she had no hurry to sue them, since [...] "these processes take a long time, and my life and career does not depend on lawsuits."

Ebner stated that [...] "Hacking their site is not really the best way to go about taking them (the Church of Scientology) down. Most critics you talk to want the Scientology site to be up there so that people who are interested can see the stupidity they have on the web and at the same time they can go - they are a few keystrokes from getting a thousand other opinions." [...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea. It's the usual thing they used to do when they really hadn't had a thought out plan, and here they're realizing they actually <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> some real plan against a real enemy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Craven {{stated that}} within the ten years that have passed between Scream 3 and Scream 4, {{there have been no}} [...] "real life" [...] Ghostface murders but have been {{numerous}} sequels to the film-within-a-film Stab. He also commented on the life status of Sidney Prescott, [...] "She's done her best to move on from the events that occurred in the previous films, even releasing a successful book". Craven said that endless sequels, the modern spew of remakes, film studios, and directors are the butts of parodies in the film.

2500|$|The {{writing is}} also notable for its minimal use of dialogue. Josh Brolin {{discussed}} his initial nervousness with having so little dialogue to work with: I {{mean it was}} a fear, for sure, because dialogue, that's what you kind of rest upon as an actor, you know? [...] Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue motivated. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because {{the fear is that}} you're going to be boring if nothing's going on. You start doing this and this and taking off your hat and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't need to be there. So yeah, I was a little afraid of that in the beginning.|$|E
2500|$|Shamrock {{was portrayed}} badly on the show, feuding with his fighters and often {{appearing}} uninterested.

So I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> {{a way to get}} this...back in the driver's seat", Shamrock said during the show. Shamrock responded to his critics in an interview: [...] "I trained three fighters that were the first three (UFC) Middleweight Champions: Jerry Bohlander, Guy Mezger and Frank Shamrock. And I’ve trained dozens of guys to be champs in other organizations. In Pancrase, I had eight fighters in the top ten at one point. I was the champion and (Masakatsu) Funaki was the number one contender. The rest were all Lion's Den fighters. My reputation doesn’t have to be spoken for or defended.

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} game's {{competitive}} play mode was released, Kotakus Nathan Grayson stated that [...] "Overwatchs competitive mode [...] all that bad, for how new and unpolished it is," [...] but opined that [...] "high-stakes competition and toxicity {{tend to go}} hand-in-hand, and Overwatchs competitive mode already has an ugly toxic stain." [...] Grayson concluded his piece with [...] "Overwatch is, most of the time, a feel-good team game. Introducing high-stakes competition with a muddled message {{about the importance of}} individual skill drags the game into confused, oftentimes negative territory. If Blizzard wants this thing to work, they're gonna <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> a competitive framework that's true to Overwatchs spirit, rather than just the spirit of competition." [...] Kaplan acknowledged that with the introduction of competitive mode that the whole of the Overwatch community has become more toxic, and they are constantly adapting elements behind the scenes to help deal with aggressive players in a more responsive manner, while trying to promote more enjoyable matches.|$|E
2500|$|Rothenberg {{said he had}} {{not always}} planned on killing Lexa, but the fact that Debnam-Carey was {{simultaneously}} on another show (Fear the Walking Dead), and was therefore unlikely to ever become a series regular on The 100, he felt use of the character would be limited or absent in the future. This is when the writers decided to craft a death scene for her to propel the story forward. [...] "I remember as we were breaking the season, we talked about reincarnation in the Grounder world and how that was how commanders were selected. I didn't want to throw that out as nonsense, which is how Clarke had received it, but I also didn't want {{to say that it was}} real reincarnation," [...] he said, adding he had been reading The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil at the time, which [...] "talks quite a bit about a future where we'll be able to upload our minds—literally upload our consciousness—into a computer and live forever." [...] This gave Rothenberg the idea for incorporating a [...] "technological reincarnation" [...] storyline. [...] "The commander A.I. would need to be able to pass itself from person to person over time and [...] Lexa was just the most recent recipient of this artificial intelligence augmentation of her consciousness. So once we came up with that idea, that was the point at which everything jelled and sort of came together storytelling-wise," [...] he stated. [...] "And of course, if you're dealing with a story about reincarnation, you've got to die before you can be reincarnated. So Lexa dying became a very tragic necessity." [...] Rothenberg said Clarke was in love with Lexa, that they were soulmates, and Lexa's death will haunt Clarke. [...] " [...] is going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how to compartmentalize, the way that all of us have to do in the real world when people are suddenly and tragically taken away from us," [...] he added. [...] "That's kind of the point of The 100 in many ways. These horrible things happen and yet we still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> a way to move on and be the heroes of our own stories." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "As {{far as the}} {{expression}} 'Failure is not an option,' you are correct that Kranz never used that term. In preparation for the movie, the script writers, Al Reinart and Bill Broyles, came down to Clear Lake to interview me on 'What are the people in Mission Control really like?' One of their questions was 'Weren't there times when everybody, {{or at least a}} few people, just panicked?' My answer was 'No, when bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them. We never panicked, and we never gave up on finding a solution.' I immediately sensed that Bill Broyles wanted to leave and assumed that he was bored with the interview. Only months later did I learn that when they got in their car to leave, he started screaming, 'That's it! That's the tag line for the whole movie, Failure is not an option. Now we just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> who to have say it.' Of course, they gave it to the Kranz character, and the rest is history." ...|$|E

Williams were close up behind Alonso, as BMW were running lower in the field than usual. Although Kubica was not complaining, Nick Heidfeld said that [...] " [...] was difficult to drive, so we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> why."
