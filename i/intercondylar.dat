5|$|Similar to OATS, arthroscopic {{articular}} cartilage paste grafting is a surgical procedure offering cost-effective, long-lasting results for stage IV lesions. A bone and cartilage paste derived from crushed plugs of the non-weight-bearing <b>intercondylar</b> notch can achieve pain relief, repair damaged tissue, and restore function.|$|E
5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques {{have been designed to}} fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the <b>intercondylar</b> notch of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.|$|E
25|$|Hip-knee-shaft angle (HKS), {{an angle}} formed between a {{line through the}} {{longitudinal}} axis of the femoral shaft and its mechanical axis, which is {{a line from the}} center of the femoral head to the <b>intercondylar</b> notch of the distal femur.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{the large}} joints {{of the lower}} limb are aligned in a {{straight}} line, which represents the mechanical longitudinal axis of the leg, the Mikulicz line. This line stretches from the hip joint (or more precisely {{the head of the}} femur), through the knee joint (the <b>intercondylar</b> eminence of the tibia), and down {{to the center of the}} ankle (the ankle mortise, the fork-like grip between the medial and lateral malleoli). In the tibial shaft, the mechanical and anatomical axes coincide, but in the femoral shaft they diverge 6°, resulting in the femorotibial angle of 174° in a leg with normal axial alignment. A leg is considered straight when, with the feet brought together, both the medial malleoli of the ankle and the medial condyles of the knee are touching. Divergence from the normal femorotibial angle is called genu varum if the center of the knee joint is lateral to the mechanical axis (intermalleolar distance exceeds 3cm), and genu valgum if it is medial to the mechanical axis (<b>intercondylar</b> distance exceeds 5cm). These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh's adductors and abductors.|$|E
2500|$|As regards {{other parts}} of the skeleton, the {{proposed}} synapomorphies of pelagornithids and waterfowl are found mainly in the arm- and handbones: the ulna had a strongly [...] upper backside at its elbow end – at the handward end of which the scapulotricipital muscles attached –, a point-tipped dorsal cotyle and only a shallow depression to house the meniscus between ulna and radius; towards the elbow, the <b>intercondylar</b> sulcus of the ulna becomes wide and is bordered by a long winding ridge on the belly side. The radius, meanwhile, has a convex ventral border to the humeral cotyle, which prominently continues the hind edge of the knob where the biceps brachii muscle attaches; towards the upper side of the radius bone the surface becomes flat and triangular handwards of the articular surface for the ulna. The carpometacarpus of both Anseriformes and pseudotooth birds has a prominent pisiform process, which extends from the carpal trochlea far fingerwards along the bone's forward side. On the carpometacarpus' underside, there is a long but narrow symphysis of the distal metacarpals, with the large metacarpal bone having a mid-ridge that at its outer end curves tailwards, and the thumb joint has a well-developed knob on the hind side of its articular surface. The leg and foot bones, as is to be expected from birds not as specialized for swimming as waterfowl are, show less similarities between Anseriformes and pseudotooth birds: on the tibiotarsus there is a wide incision between the condyles and the middle condyle is narrower than the side condyle and protrudes forwards; the tarsometatarsus has a low distal vascular [...] with recessed opening on its plantar surface and a middle toe trochlea that is elongated, slightly oblique, projects to the underside of the foot and is pointed at the tip.|$|E
50|$|The <b>intercondylar</b> {{area is the}} {{separation}} between the medial and lateral condyle on the upper extremity of the tibia. The <b>intercondylar</b> eminence composed of the medial and lateral <b>intercondylar</b> tubercle divides the <b>intercondylar</b> area into anterior and posterior part.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} <b>intercondylar</b> area (or anterior intercondyloid fossa) {{is an area}} on the tibia, a bone in {{the lower}} leg. Together with the posterior <b>intercondylar</b> area it makes up the <b>intercondylar</b> area.|$|E
50|$|The medial {{and lateral}} condyle are {{separated}} by the <b>intercondylar</b> area, where the cruciate ligaments and the menisci attach. Here the medial and lateral <b>intercondylar</b> tubercle forms the <b>intercondylar</b> eminence. Together with the medial and lateral condyle the <b>intercondylar</b> region forms the tibial plateau, which both articulates with and is anchored to the lower extremity of the femur. The <b>intercondylar</b> eminence divides the <b>intercondylar</b> area into an anterior and posterior part. The anterolateral region of the anterior <b>intercondylar</b> area are perforated by numerous small openings for nutrient arteries.The articular surfaces of both condyles are concave, particularly centrally. The flatter outer margins are {{in contact with the}} menisci. The medial condyles superior surface is oval in form and extends laterally onto the side of medial <b>intercondylar</b> tubercle. The lateral condyles superior surface is more circular in form and its medial edge extends onto the side of the lateral <b>intercondylar</b> tubercle. The posterior surface of the medial condyle bears a horizontal groove for part of the attachment of the semimembranosus muscle, whereas the lateral condyle has a circular facet for articulation with the head of fibula.Beneath the condyles is the tibial tuberosity which serves for attachment of the patellar ligament, a continuation of the quadriceps femoris muscle.|$|E
50|$|The intercondyloid {{eminence}} {{is composed}} of the medial and lateral <b>intercondylar</b> tubercles, and divides the <b>intercondylar</b> area into an anterior and a posterior area.|$|E
50|$|The <b>intercondylar</b> {{area is the}} {{separation}} between the medial and lateral condyle on the upper extremity of the tibia. The anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the menisci attach to the <b>intercondylar</b> area.|$|E
5000|$|... the {{proximal}} tibial <b>intercondylar</b> groove is strongly situated medially ...|$|E
5000|$|The lateral <b>intercondylar</b> {{tubercle}} is a protrusion on {{the lateral}} condyle.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} <b>intercondylar</b> area is {{the location}} where the anterior cruciate ligament attaches to the tibia.|$|E
5000|$|Their opposed {{surfaces}} are small, rough, and concave, and form {{the walls of}} the <b>intercondylar</b> fossa.|$|E
50|$|The pair of tibial condyles are {{separated}} by the <b>intercondylar</b> eminence composed of a lateral and a medial tubercle.|$|E
5000|$|The infrapatellar plica, {{in front}} of the {{anterior}} cruciate ligament, reaches from the <b>intercondylar</b> notch to the infrapateller fat pad ...|$|E
5000|$|The medial {{meniscus}} {{also has}} firm attachments laterally to the <b>intercondylar</b> {{area of the}} tibia and medially to the tibial collateral ligament.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} tubercle of the tibia, a leg bone {{which is more}} {{commonly known as the}} shinbone or shankbone, is the tibial tuberosity. The tibial tuberosity is located on the tibia's anterior surface, distal to the medial condyle. It creates a bony prominence just below the patella, and can be easily located with the fingers. It creates an attachment point for the ligamentum patellae, or patellar ligament. Other tubercles of the tibia include the medial <b>intercondylar</b> tubercle, the lateral <b>intercondylar</b> tubercle, and Gerdy's tubercle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>intercondylar</b> fossa {{of femur}} (intercondyloid fossa of femur, <b>intercondylar</b> notch of femur) {{is a deep}} notch between the rear {{surfaces}} of the medial and lateral epicondyle of the femur, two protrusions on the distal end of the femur (thigh bone) that joins the knee. On {{the front of the}} femur, the condyles are but much less prominent and are separated from one another by a smooth shallow articular depression called the patellar surface because it articulates with the posterior surface of the patella (kneecap).|$|E
5000|$|Anteriorly, the condyles are {{slightly}} prominent and {{are separated by}} a smooth shallow articular depression called the patellar surface. Posteriorly, they project considerably and a deep notch, the <b>intercondylar</b> fossa of femur, is present between them.|$|E
50|$|The knee is {{stabilized}} {{by a pair}} of cruciate ligaments. The {{anterior cruciate}} ligament (ACL) stretches from the lateral condyle of femur to the anterior <b>intercondylar</b> area. The ACL is critically important because it prevents the tibia from being pushed too far anterior relative to the femur. It is often torn during twisting or bending of the knee. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) stretches from medial condyle of femur to the posterior <b>intercondylar</b> area. Injury to this ligament is uncommon but can occur {{as a direct result of}} forced trauma to the ligament. This ligament prevents posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur.|$|E
50|$|Posteriorly, {{the medial}} condyle and lateral condyle are {{separated}} from each other by a shallow depression, the posterior intercondyloid fossa (or <b>intercondylar</b> area), which gives attachment to part of the posterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint.|$|E
50|$|Similar to OATS, arthroscopic {{articular}} cartilage paste grafting is a surgical procedure offering cost-effective, long-lasting results for stage IV lesions. A bone and cartilage paste derived from crushed plugs of the non-weight-bearing <b>intercondylar</b> notch can achieve pain relief, repair damaged tissue, and restore function.|$|E
50|$|The <b>intercondylar</b> fossa {{of femur}} and/or the patellar surface {{may also be}} {{referred}} to as the patellar groove, patellar sulcus, patellofemoral groove, femoropatellar groove, femoral groove, femoral sulcus, trochlear groove of femur, trochlear sulcus of femur, trochlear surface of femur, or trochlea of femur.|$|E
50|$|The {{posterior}} {{cruciate ligament}} (or PCL) {{is one of the}} four major ligaments of the knee. It connects the posterior <b>intercondylar</b> area of the tibia to the medial condyle of the femur. This configuration allows the PCL to resist forces pushing the tibia posteriorly relative to the femur.|$|E
50|$|Blumensaat's {{line is a}} line which {{corresponds}} {{to the roof of}} the <b>intercondylar</b> fossa of femur as seen on a lateral radiograph of the knee joint. The angle at which this line appears on the radiograph can be used to determine the position of the patella or diagnose an ACL injury.|$|E
50|$|The lateral {{meniscus}} has firm attachments medially to the <b>intercondylar</b> area via {{the ends}} of the meniscus, and posteromedially via the posterior meniscofemoral ligament, which attaches the posterior limb of the meniscus to the posterior cruciate ligament and medial femoral condyle. The lateral meniscus is not directly connected to the fibular collateral ligament, and is thus more movable than the medial meniscus.|$|E
50|$|Between the {{articular}} facets in the <b>intercondylar</b> area, but {{nearer the}} posterior than the anterior {{aspect of the}} bone, is the intercondyloid eminence (spine of tibia), surmounted on either side by a prominent tubercle, on {{to the sides of}} which the articular facets are prolonged; in front of and behind the intercondyloid eminence are rough depressions for the attachment of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the menisci.|$|E
50|$|Its origin is the superolateral {{aspect of}} the ischial {{tuberosity}} and it inserts on the medial condyle and nearby margin of tibia; <b>intercondylar</b> fossa of femur and lateral condyle of femur; and the ligament of the popliteal region (at {{the back of the}} knee). It arises by a thick tendon from the upper and outer impression on the ischial tuberosity, above and medial to the biceps femoris and semitendinosus.|$|E
50|$|The intercondyloid {{eminence}}, (<b>intercondylar</b> eminence or tibial spine), is {{a structure}} of the tibia. It lies between the articular facets of the proximal tibia, but nearer the posterior than the anterior aspect of the bone, surmounted on either side by a prominent tubercle, on {{to the sides of}} which the articular facets are prolonged. In front of and behind the intercondyloid eminence are rough depressions (fossae, for the attachment of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the menisci.|$|E
50|$|A tibial plateau {{fracture}} is a {{bone fracture}} or {{break in the}} continuity of the bone occurring in the proximal part of the tibia or shinbone called the tibial plateau; affecting the knee joint, stability and motion. The tibial plateau is a critical weight-bearing area located on the upper extremity of the tibia and is composed of two slightly concave condyles (medial condyle and lateral condyle) separated by an <b>intercondylar</b> eminence and the sloping areas in front and behind it. It can be divided into three areas: the medial tibial plateau (the part of the tibial plateau that is nearer {{to the center of the}} body and contains medial condyle), the lateral plateau (the part of the tibial plateau that is farthest away from the center of the body and contains the lateral condyle) and the central tibial plateau (located between the medial and lateral pleateaus and contains <b>intercondylar</b> eminence). Depending on the injury pattern, lesions may be restricted to the tibia or may have significant soft tissue injury as well as meniscal and ligamentous injuries to the knee. However, a standard tibial plateau fracture involves either cortical interruption, depression or displacement of the articular surfaces of the proximal tibia without significant injury to the capsule or ligaments of the knee.|$|E
50|$|According {{to recent}} studies, female athletes are two to eight {{times more likely}} to strain their {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) in sports that involve cutting and jumping as compared to men who play the same particular sports (soccer, basketball, and volleyball). Differences between males and females identified as potential causes are the active muscular protection of the knee joint, the greater Q angle putting more medial torque on the knee joint, relative ligament laxity caused by differences in hormonal activity from estrogen and relaxin, <b>intercondylar</b> notch dimensions, and muscular strength.|$|E
50|$|The cranial {{cruciate}} ligament {{runs from the}} cranial mid part of the tibial <b>intercondylar</b> eminence to the lateral condyle of the femur. Normally, the CrCL prevents caudal (backward) movement of the Femur relative to the Tibia. Due to selective breeding the tibial plateau slope has become sloped too far backwards {{so there is a}} constant stress on the Cranial cruciate liagment. Over time this leads to a degenerative rupture. When it ruptures, the joint becomes unstable which causes pain and can lead to chronic progressive arthritis in the stifle if untreated.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{characteristics}} of the tibiotarsus allow Garganornis to be placed definitely in the order Anseriformes: the medial condyle is angled medially and bears a projection at its front end; and the canal of the extensor tendon is placed centrally over the <b>intercondylar</b> fossa. Features of the carpometacarpus allow for a more specific assignment to the family Anatidae: the extensor process {{is parallel to the}} trochlea carpalis and is not tilted towards the bottom; the pisiform process is wide and unpointed; and a small knob is present above the caudal carpal [...]|$|E
50|$|In the female, the acetabula, the concave {{surfaces}} {{to which}} the balls of the femurs attach via ligaments, are located farther apart, which increases {{the distance between the}} most outer points of the femurs (their greater trochanters) and thus the width of the hips; female femurs are therefore, more generally angled (laterally, further away from vertical). This greater angle applies a larger portion of the gravitational/vertical load as valgus torque (rotational force against the knee). This, combined with the female's weaker tendons & ligaments and a narrower <b>intercondylar</b> notch, causes increased susceptibility to injury of the ACL in female athletes.|$|E
50|$|The deepest (most anterior) {{structure}} in the fossa, the popliteal artery runs {{in close proximity to}} the joint capsule of the knee as it spans the <b>intercondylar</b> fossa. Five genicular branches of the popliteal artery supply the capsule and ligaments of the knee joint. The genicular arteries are the superior lateral, superior medial, middle, inferior lateral, and inferior medial genicular arteries. They participate {{in the formation of the}} periarticular genicular anastomosis, a network of vessels surrounding the knee that provides collateral circulation capable of maintaining blood supply to the leg during full knee flexion, which may kink the popliteal artery.|$|E
