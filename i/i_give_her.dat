Henry was fluent in Latin and, according to the chronicler Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, was [...] "distinguished by gifts of knowledge, wreathed in flowers of eloquence, and learned in canon and Roman law". He was a patron of poets and poetry, and he almost certainly composed the song Kaiser Heinrich, now among the Weingarten Song Manuscripts. According to his rank and with Imperial Eagle (Reichsadler), regalia, and a scroll, {{he is the first}} and foremost to be portrayed in the famous Codex Manesse, a 14th-century songbook manuscript featuring 140 reputed poets; at least three poems are attributed to a young and romantically minded Henry VI. In one of those he describes a romance that makes him forget all his earthly power, and neither riches nor royal dignity can outweigh his yearning for that lady (ê ich mich ir verzige, ich verzige mich ê der krône – before <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> up, I’d rather give up the crown).|$|E

60|$|Agnes is downstairs, when I go {{into the}} parlour; and <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> the message. She disappears, leaving me alone with Jip.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> my money--it was, of course, only paper I had brought. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> it <b>her,</b> {{to be her}} marriage-portion, I declared.|$|R
50|$|Thirdly, King Richard <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> in {{marriage}} to Baldwin de Béthune.|$|R
50|$|On 20 February 1693, Leopold <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> {{the title}} Reichsgräfin von Rochlitz.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou, Pélé, madest answer: 'My son, <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> thee.' Thou didst turn uneasily in thy flaming home, and {{threaten}} the Hawaiians {{with a deadly}} vengeance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{while you}} live. Nothing {{would make her}} {{comfortable}} while you live," [...] returned Rigg, in his cool high voice. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her,</b> you'll take." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are right,' {{said the}} prince; 'but {{it is with}} sorrow <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> up to you, for though I have wounded her yet I love her deeply.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> {{money in}} notes,--just fifty pounds. When <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> it <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> it all; and yet {{afterwards}} I thought I remembered {{that in my}} illness I had found the cheque with the dean's money. But it was not so." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> one or {{two reasons}} why I did not {{altogether}} hate them.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> my {{hand and}} told her yes {{and that she was}} very little altered.|$|R

6000|$|... “Akoon would buy,” Porportuk went on, “but {{he has no}} money. Wherefore I {{will give}} El-Soo to him, as he said, without price. Even now will <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> to him.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I ain't fit {{to think}} of her," [...] he groaned. [...] "I never did a decent thing in my life, as they say. But how can <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> up--God, how can I?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> {{a little}} time to compose herself; and then asked what she had to say.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> an {{imaginary}} check, {{and now she}} is suing me for substantial dollars. It looks inconsistent.|$|R

60|$|You'd have laughed--or the rewerse--it's {{according}} to your disposition--if you could have seen me trying to teach Sophy. At first I was helped--you'd never guess by what--milestones. I got some large alphabets in a box, all the letters separate on bits of bone, and saying we was going to WINDSOR, <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> those letters in that order, and then at every milestone I showed her those same letters in that same order again, and pointed towards the abode of royalty. Another time <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> CART, and then chalked the same upon the cart. Another time <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> DOCTOR MARIGOLD, and hung a corresponding inscription outside my waistcoat. People that met us might stare a bit and laugh, but what did I care, if she caught the idea? She caught it after long patience and trouble, and then we did begin to get on swimmingly, I believe you! At first {{she was a little}} given to consider me the cart, and the cart the abode of royalty, but that soon wore off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Long or short, you'll {{never make}} that out," [...] muttered the master. [...] "The Folly has more folly about her than <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> credit for, {{if we get}} another look at her this summer." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{hair was}} shining, and her brows were shining too; [...] Her face was like herself, her mouth {{pleasant}} and sweet. [...] She is the pride, and <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> the branch, [...] She is the shining flower of Ballylee.|$|E
60|$|GRACE. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> {{a lecture}} on her {{behavior}} which she will remember to {{the last day of}} her life.|$|R

6000|$|The Judge coughed a little. [...] "We {{never had}} but one child--a boy. He was killed while out hunting"--he broke off quickly. [...] "Now here's the meal for the cow. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> about a panful twice a day--when I don't forget it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--my whole idea. The way I've been justified. That's the joy <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her.</b> If for HER, either, it had failed--!" [...] That, however, was {{not worth}} talking about; he had broken off. [...] "You think then you could now risk Fawns?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Wressley {{bore the}} first {{copy of his}} book to Simla and, {{blushing}} and stammering, presented it to Miss Venner. She read a little of it. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> review verbatim:--"Oh, your book? It's all about those how-wid Wajahs. I didn't understand it." ...|$|E
60|$|The servant {{was still}} waiting a {{favourable}} opportunity to announce me. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> a shilling not to, and got away unperceived.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> a hug to {{take away}} the turn, or to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> another turn in the right direction, and then stood before her, looking at her in anxious inquiry.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> into Philip's care. It was his {{privilege}} to console and support her. It was {{my duty to}} say the decisive words: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your insinuations are childish, Arthur," [...] I answered. [...] "Lady Delahaye is an {{old friend}} of the Archduchess's, and their {{interest}} in Isobel is identical. For many reasons I am going to know Isobel's history before <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> up to either of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will help}} you all I can and hope you won't prosecute me. I will see that Dora S. gets {{something}} to eat, even if <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> my share. They intend to go to Sand Haven if they can give you the slip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be {{best for}} her health," [...] said Joceline, [...] "lest <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> a ducking for digestion.--But give me the pitcher, Mistress Alice--meeter I bear it than you.--How now? what jingles at the bottom? have you lifted the pebbles {{as well as the}} water?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{when that}} unfortunate girl, her niece, {{was to be}} married to poor Sir Griffin Tewett, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> a whole service of plate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nobody but Dora. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> the figures, so {{she could}} get the safe open in case {{anything}} happened to me, or I was away." ...|$|R
