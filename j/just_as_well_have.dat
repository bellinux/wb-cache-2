And I could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> called it the 'Central Hypothesis,' or — you know. Which is what I meant to say. Dogma was just a catch phrase." ...|$|E
2500|$|This is how Bohr {{arrived at}} his model. Since only the level spacing is {{determined}} heuristically by the correspondence principle, one could always add a small fixed offset to the quantum number— [...] could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been [...]|$|E
2500|$|Dagbladet {{commented that}} the film downplayed the left-wing {{political}} aspect {{of the book and}} instead focused on the storyline and action. It commented that with increased funding for special effects, Solum was able to achieve his true potential as an action director. It praised Paalsgard for the cinematography and the natural integration of nature footage and backdrops. Following the presentation of the shortened and new ending version, Dagbladet stated that [...] "they could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> kept the old one". Klassekampen praised the film for its action and accepted that it had reduced the amount of intrigue in the novel. The character of Jansen was applauded, as it showed how small an individual is against the superpowers. As the only newspaper, Klassekampen praised the film music. Variety stated that the film was [...] "a superbly mounted, convincingly told adventure thriller. Action scenes, such as the helicopter attack, are excitingly staged, and the suspense never lets up. As the rugged Tom, Helge Jordal is very good." [...] However, the magazine criticized the title.|$|E

"No {{sooner had}} he got here than {{he found the}} font wouldn't hold water, as it hadn't for years off and on; and when I told him that Mr. Grinham never minded it, but used to spet upon his vinger and christen 'em <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> <b>'a</b> said, 'Good Heavens! Send for a workman immediate. What place have I come to!' Which was no {{compliment}} to us, come to that." ...|$|R

2500|$|Tyler has {{occasionally}} been {{classified as}} a “Southern author” or a “modern American author.” [...] The Southern category apparently results {{from the fact that}} she grew up and went to college in the South. [...] Also she admired and/or studied under well-known Southern authors Eudora Welty and Reynolds Price. In a rare interview with The New York Times, Tyler cited Eudora Welty as a major literary influence: [...] "Reading Eudora Welty when I was growing up showed me that very small things are often really larger than the large things". [...] However, poet and author Katha Pollitt notes, “It is hard to classify Anne Tyler’s novels. [...] They are Southern in their sure sense of family and place but lack the taste for violence and the Gothic that often characterizes self-consciously southern literature. [...] They are modern in their fictional techniques, yet utterly unconcerned with contemporary moment as a subject, so that, with only minor dislocations, her stories could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> taken place in twenties or thirties.” ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{reference}} to the DNA tests, Witherington wrote in his blog: [...] "he most the DNA evidence can show is that several of these folks are interrelated…. We would need an independent control sample from some member of Jesus' family to confirm that these were members of Jesus' family. We do not have that at all." [...] This quote clarifies {{the fact that the}} documentarians do not believe they have tested the DNA and have proven it to be Jesus. They simply used DNA testing to prove that the [...] "Jesus son of Joseph" [...] and the [...] "Mariamne" [...] in this tomb were not maternally related (i.e. {{that they did not have}} the same mother or grandmother). The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage. Mariamne could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been the wife of one of the other two males in the ossuary.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most intense}} {{work on the}} book was done {{during the winter of}} 1850–1851, when Melville had changed the noise of New York City for a farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The move may well have delayed {{finishing}} the book. During these months, he wrote several excited letters to Hawthorne, including one of June 1851 in which he summarizes his career: [...] "What I feel most moved to write, that is banned, — it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the other way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches." [...] This is the stubborn Melville who stood by Mardi and talked about his other, more commercial books with contempt. The letter also reveals how Melville experienced his development from his 25th year: [...] "Three weeks have scarcely passed, at any time between then and now, that I have not unfolded within myself. But I feel that I am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb, and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould." [...] One other theory holds that getting to know Hawthorne first inspired him to write Ahab's tragic obsession into the book, but Bryant and Springer object that Melville already had experienced other encounters which could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> triggered his imagination, such as the Bible's Jonah and Job, Milton's Satan, Shakespeare's King Lear, Byron's heroes.|$|E

60|$|Oh, I {{know you}} have--for five minutes. It {{was only an}} excuse. You might <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> come here straight.|$|E

6000|$|... "Confound the thing!" [...] he said roughly. [...] "Here, {{take hold}} of this bread, and let me feel for the lamp. I can't be bothered with going down to get another light. You can eat your supper in the dark <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> I <b>have</b> no doubt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{wonderful}} is the Great Medicine of the Opener-of-Roads, that {{it should}} have been able thus to instruct the Baas," [...] he said.

60|$|And {{then look}} at Ambassador Bryce, who {{referred}} to his alma mater, Oxford. He might <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> included me. Well, I am a later production.|$|E
60|$|ANTHONY. Very bad, {{and more}} frightened. I handed {{him over to}} Few-ton. Mingle might <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> called {{him in the first}} place, instead of bothering me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{care for}} her,' said Edgar; 'but it is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> to <b>have</b> some notion of things, and Felix hasn't a grain. Why, all the fellows will be asking which {{of us is}} pepper, and which Souchong! I wouldn't have Froggatt or Bruce see me in it at no price.' ...|$|R
6000|$|And he said, [...] "Very well, Una, I {{am sorry}} you think so. You would {{not think so}} if you really cared {{anything}} for me. It is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> I <b>have</b> found out you don't. I am going away in two days' time and I shall not return in a hurry, Una." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He died {{a quarter}} of an hour later, and here is the letter. I am going to take it over to Colonel Chambers, but I thought you would like to go with me. Of course, your brother was really cleared of all suspicion, but it is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> to <b>have</b> got it under the real man's own hand." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{her fears}} were groundless, for Sam sailed over the cornfield <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>had</b> Dick. He did not fly very high, {{but he kept}} in the air nearly ten minutes, which was longer than had either of the others. When he came down he did so with a little bump, {{but this was not}} enough to hurt anything.|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{mean that}} you had made up your mind that we should spend Easter there,” said her husband; “we spent last Easter there, and Whitsuntide <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> and the year before that we were at Worthing, and Brighton again before that.

60|$|The Fives {{carried on}} the story. Menzies was swamped by a Day's man. He might <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> stayed away altogether. The star of Seymour's was very low on the horizon.|$|E
6000|$|... "So foolish!" [...] she declared. [...] "He hasn't a {{shilling}} in the world, and {{he never}} wins anything. He might <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> {{come down here and}} made himself agreeable to Lois." ...|$|E

60|$|The captain went inside, {{procured}} his gun, {{and seated}} himself outside, {{with his back}} against a rock. There he sat all night, without once closing his eyes.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to do," [...] she said, [...] "And I feel as if I might <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> never <b>have</b> lived at all as waste days like this.
