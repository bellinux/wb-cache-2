40|$|<b>Indirect</b> <b>challenges</b> act by {{causing the}} release of {{endogenous}} mediators that cause the airway smooth muscle to contract. This {{is in contrast to}} the direct challenges where agonists such as methacholine or histamine cause airflow limitation predominantly via a direct effect on airway smooth muscle. Direct airway challenges have been used widely and are well standardised. They are highly sensitive, but not specific to asthma and can be used to exclude current asthma in a clinic population. Indirect bronchial stimuli, in particular exercise, hyperventilation, hypertonic aerosols, as well as adenosine, may reflect more directly the ongoing airway inflammation and are therefore more specific to identify active asthma. They are increasingly used to evaluate the prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and to assess specific problems in patients with known asthma, e. g. exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, evaluation before scuba diving. Direct bronchial responsiveness is only slowly and to a modest extent, influenced by repeated administration of inhaled steroids. <b>Indirect</b> <b>challenges</b> may reflect more closely acute changes in airway inflammation and a change in responsiveness to an indirect stimulus may be a clinically relevant marker to assess the clinical course of asthma. Moreover, some of the <b>indirect</b> <b>challenges,</b> e. g. hypertonic saline and mannitol, can be combined with the assessment of inflammatory cells by induction of sputum...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Asthma is {{a disease}} {{associated}} with inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and airflow limitation. Clinical diagnosis and management of asthma often relies on assessment of lung function and symptom control, but these factors do not always correlate well with underlying inflammation. Bronchial challenge tests (BCTs) assess AHR, {{and can be used}} to assist in the diagnosis and management of asthma. Data Source: Data presented at the symposium 'Use of inhaled mannitol for assessing airways disease' organised by the Allied Respiratory Professionals Assembly (9) of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) at the ERS Congress, Berlin 2008. Results: <b>Indirect</b> <b>challenge</b> tests such as exercise testing, hypertonic saline or adenosine 5 '-monophosphate (AMP) are more specific though less sensitive than direct challenge tests (such as methacholine) for identifying patients with active asthma. Indirect BCTs may be used to diagnose exercise-induced bronchoconstriction or AHR consistent with active asthma, to evaluate AHR that will respond to treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs and to determine the effectiveness and optimal dosing of such therapy. An ideal <b>indirect</b> <b>challenge</b> test should be standardised and reproducible, and the test result should correlate with the degree of airway inflammation. The mannitol BCT provides a standardised and rapid point-of-need test to identify currently active asthma, and is clinically useful in the identification of patients with asthma who are likely to benefit from inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Conclusion: In the future, mannitol BCT may be added to lung function and symptom assessment to aid in the everyday management of asthma.

40|$|The {{nature of}} crime and {{conflict}} has changed and continues to evolve. The now and future war is and will be influenced by irregular combatants – non-state soldiers – that utilize technology and networked doctrine to spread their influence across traditional geographic boundaries. This era shift in political and social organization, fueled by rapid developments of technology and exploitation of network organizational forms, blurs the distinctions between crime, terrorism and warfare. The resulting transitional period – a Dark Renaissance – benefits a range of non-state actors: drugs cartels, street gangs, terrorists, and warlords. Criminal organizations appear {{among the first to}} adapt to the new operational context resulting from this shift. This paper examines the journey of street gangs, one type of transnational criminal organization – the drug cartel – and warlords through this evolution.

40|$|Frusemide, a loop diuretic, {{has been}} shown to {{potently}} inhibit several <b>indirect</b> bronchoconstrictor <b>challenges</b> in asthma. The mechanism by which nebulized frusemide protects against indirect bronchoconstrictor stimuli in asthma is not known. One mechanism could be related to inhibition of sodium transport. If this is the case, then amiloride, another inhibitor of sodium transport, should also protect against <b>indirect</b> bronchoconstrictor <b>challenges.</b> Ten subjects with mild asthma were administered either 10 (- 2) M amiloride or placebo, by nebulizer, in a double-blind crossover fashion.

No significant difference in the response to metabisulphite was seen between placebo and amiloride treatment. The mean difference in provocative dose of metabisulphite producing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PD 20) between placebo and amiloride was 1. 015 doubling doses, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) - 0. 201 to 2. 231, (p = 0. 09).

40|$|There {{is a high}} {{prevalence}} of exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in elite athletes. It {{has been suggested that}} damage to the airway epithelium is the key effector process and that EIB in athletes is due to different mechanisms than exercise induced asthma. Whether testing strategies are as valid in athletes is controversial, but regulatory bodies continue to advocate the use of objective tests for diagnosis. How responses to these relate to sport, airways inflammation and to symptoms is unclear. We investigated responses to direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>challenge</b> tests and patterns of airways inflammation in symptomatic, international, endurance athletes. We focused on differences between pool-based and non-pool based endurance athletes to see if environmental factors played a significant role. We also investigated the interaction between airways epithelial and human lung mast cells in vitro and compared these between healthy and asthmatic donors. Of the challenges assessed, EVH related most closely to eosinophilic airways inflammation. The other tests examined did not relate particularly closely to each other, to eosinophilic airways inflammation or to markers of mast cell activation. There were no differences between pool and non-pool based athletes in terms of patterns of airways inflammation or airway mediator release in response to challenge testing. Pool-based athletes had significantly more airways hypereactivity when compared to non-pool based athletes. Those who test positive to EVH have more eosinophilic airways inflammation and more epithelial cells in their sputum than those who have a negative test. All <b>indirect</b> <b>challenge</b> tests increased the level of PGE 2 in the airways compared to direct testing, even when corrected for degree of bronchoconstriction, suggesting epithelial stress. In vitro, an intact, healthy epithelium significantly suppresses constituitive and IgE mediated human lung mast cell histamine secretion. This suppression is attenuated in asthmatic or injured epithelium and is mediated by a small, labile, lipid soluble mediator. There is a significant heterogeneity in airways inflammation and airways hyperreactivity in elite performance athletes. The role of the epithelial cell in the development of EIB requires further exploration. The interaction between the epithelium and human lung mast cells needs to be fully elucidated and its potential for therapeutic manipulation further explored...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} {{the changes in}} airway responsiveness to methacholine inhalation test (MIT) when performed after an eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea challenge (EVH) in athletes. Methods Two MIT preceded (visit 1) or not (visit 2) by an EVH, were performed in 28 athletes and 24 non-athletes. Twelve athletes and 13 non-athletes had airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to methacholine, and 11 athletes and 11 non-athletes had AHR to EVH (EVH+). Results The MIT PC 20 post-EVH was significantly lower compared to baseline MIT PC 20 by 1. 3 ± 0. 7 doubling-concentrations in EVH+ athletes only (p< 0. 0001). No significant change was ob-served in EVH- athletes and EVH+/EVH- non-athletes. A significant correlation between the change in MIT PC 20 post-EVH and EVH+/EVH- status and athlete/nonathlete status was found (Adjusted R 2 = 0. 26 and p< 0. 001). Three (11 %) athletes and one (4 %) non-athlete had {{a change in the}} diagnosis of AHR when MIT was performed consecutively to EVH. Conclusion The responsiveness to methacholine was increased by a previous <b>indirect</b> <b>challenge</b> in EVH+ athletes only. The mechanisms for such increase remain to be determined. MIT and EVH should ideally be performed on separate occasions as there is a small but possible risk to obtain a false-positive response to methacholine when performed immediately after the EVH...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} loss or large-scale {{degradation of the}} tropical rainforests {{has become one of}} the iconic images of the impacts of twenty-first century environmental change and may be one of our century’s most profound legacies. In the Amazon region, the direct threat of deforestation and degradation is now strongly intertwined with an <b>indirect</b> <b>challenge</b> we are just beginning to understand: the possibility of substantial regional drought driven by global climate change. The Amazon region hosts more than half of the world’s remaining tropical forests, and some parts have among the greatest concentrations of biodiversity found anywhere on Earth. Overall, the region is estimated to host about a quarter of all global biodiversity. It acts as one of the major ‘flywheels ’ of global climate, transpiring water and generating clouds, affecting atmospheric circulation across continents and hemispheres, and storing substantial reserves of biomass and soil carbon. Hence, the ongoing degradation of Amazonia is a threat to local climate stability and a contributor to the global atmospheric climate change crisis. Conversely, the stabilization of Amazonian deforestation and degradation would be an opportunity for local adaptation to climate change, as well as a potential global contributor towards mitigation of climate change. However, addressing deforestation in the Amazon raises substantial challenges in policy, governance, sustainability and economic science. This paper introduces a theme issue dedicated to a multidisciplinary analysis of these challenges...|$|E

40|$|Furosemide has {{recently}} {{been shown to be}} effective in inhibiting various <b>indirect</b> <b>challenges</b> in asthmatic patients, but its mode of action is not yet clear. There is some evidence that furosemide has an inhibitory effect on sensory and cholinergic nerves in the airways. We have investigated the effects of furosemide, bumetanide, and nedocromil sodium on inhibitory nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (iNANC) responses in guinea pig trachea in vitro using electrical field stimulation (50 V, 0. 5 ms, 2 to 32 Hz for 30 s) and exogenously applied vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or nitroprusside. In the presence of atropine (1 microM), indomethacin (10 microM), and propranolol (1 microM), both furosemide and bumetanide but not nedocromil sodium produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the iNANC response (maximum inhibition, 31. 2 +/- 5. 6 % with 100 microM furosemide at 16 Hz and 44. 2 +/- 4. 1 % with 10 microM bumetanide at 4 Hz). Furthermore, after pretreatment of the tissues with L-NG-monomethyl arginine (90 microM), alpha-chymotrypsin (2 U/ml), or both, furosemide and bumetanide produced a further inhibition of the iNANC relaxation. Neither loop diuretic had any effect on the concentration-response curves to exogenous VIP (10 (- 9) to 10 (- 7) M) or nitroprusside (10 (- 8) to 10 (- 6) M). These results indicate that loop diuretics may inhibit nonadrenergic relaxation in guinea pig trachea in vitro by a prejunctional mechanism, probably through inhibition of nerve activation, the exact mechanism of which is still undefined. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the multiple ways {{by which the}} human immune system can react upon direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>challenges,</b> such as infection and wounds on the one hand, and chronic stress factors, such as smoking, on the other. The human defense system exhibits a type of selfish behaviour during both acute- and chronic activity states. Acute activation {{of the immune system}} is normally finalized in a short time through multiple mechanisms exerting immune inhibiting effects. This means that an inflammation is normally self-limiting, which protects the body against secondary damaging effects of the immune system itself. Chronic activity of the immune system is caused by all those risk factors related with modern life, including sedentary time, lack of exercise, sleep deprivation, smoking, overeating and also non-solved psycho-emotional problems. The sum of risk factors produces chronic activation of stress axes and entrance of bacterial debris in the blood stream, causing a chronic infectious state that is referred to as chronic low-grade inflammation. This low-grade inflammation should be considered as the cause of most, if not all, chronic non-communicable diseases (CNCD). Our interventions show that a short bout of "ancient" stress factors could finalize the chronic activity of the immune system and in this way protect people against the toxic effects of modern life. Evidence is given through changes in metabolic parameters such as weigh loss and decrease of glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol. Changes which were achieved after an intervention period of only ten days...|$|R

Naturally acquired antibodies to PfEMP 1 expressed by parasites causing severe malaria are suggested to be protective and of major interest {{for the development of a}} vaccine against severe disease. In this study, the PfEMP 1 expressed by a parasite clone displaying a multiadhesive phenotype associated with severe malaria was well recognized by sera of malaria semi-immune children. The efficiency of the Duffy binding-like 1 α (DBL 1 α) domain of this PfEMP 1 was therefore, alone or in combination with two additional DBL 1 α domains, evaluated as a potential vaccine candidate using both a rodent model and a primate model. Antibodies against the DBL 1 α domain were generated by immunization with recombinant DBL 1 α-Semliki Forest virus particles and recombinant protein and analyzed in vitro. The immunized animals were challenged in vivo with various parasite strains or clones. Immunization with the PfEMP 1 -DBL 1 α domain abolished the PfEMP 1 -dependent sequestration of the homologous strain in immunized rats and substantially inhibited parasite adhesion in immunized monkeys. Protection against sequestration of heterologous parasite strains was also confirmed by direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>challenge</b> in the rat model. These results strongly support the use of the DBL 1 α domain in the development of a vaccine targeting severe malaria...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigated}} the relationship between antagonistic behavior, dominance, attitudinal hostility, and coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods: One hundred one men and 95 women referred for thallium stress testing were administered the Structured Interview and the Cook-Medley Hostility Scale. The Hostile Behavior Index, derived from the Structured Interview and developed by Haney et al., served as an index of antagonism, and {{the frequency with which}} interviewees interrupted their interviewer served as a measure of dominance. On the basis of their medical history and thallium stress test results, patients were classified as having (N 5 44) or not having (N 5 99) CHD. Results and Conclusions: Multivariate logistic regressions (with age, gender, disease, and lifestyle risk factors in the model) revealed that both the Hostile Behavior Index and dominance were significant independent risk factors for CHD (relative risk [RR] 5 1. 22 and 1. 47, p,. 03). Of the two Hostile Behavior Index component scores, <b>indirect</b> <b>challenge</b> and irritability, only the latter correlated significantly with CHD (RR 5 1. 27, p,. 03). Separate logistic regressions for men and women suggest that subtle, indirect manifestations of antagonism confer CHD risk in women and that more overt expressions of anger confer risk in men. A significant univariate correlation between hostility scale scores and CHD became not significant when we adjusted for socioeconomic status.

A {{small proportion of}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) patients present with positive CACh. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the presence of factors related to cold air challenge (CACh) in COPD patients,. Factors examined were FEV(1), FEV(1) /FVC, reversibility after bronchodilation, eosinophils in induced sputum, bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine and the spirometric response to tiotropium compared to placebo. We studied 92 consecutive COPD patients in order to retrieve 15 CACh positive (+) patients. Fifteen COPD patients with negative CACh [CACh(-) ], randomly selected from the initial group, were added in order to retrieve a group of 30 patients. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used in order to evaluate possible significant correlations; between CACh values and study parameters. Sixteen percent of our subjects presented CACh(+). CACh values were repeatable with an intraclass correlation coefficient between the two measurements 0. 980 (95 % CI 0. 940 - 0. 993). The only significant correlation observed was between Delta FEV(1) after CACh [Delta(c) FEV(1) ] and trough FEV(1) values post tiotropium inhalation (r(2) = 0. 62, p < 0. 0001). When we analyzed the response to tiotropium in the 2 separate groups we found that patients with CACh(+) presented significantly lower values of trough FEV(1) compared to those with CACh(-).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{cultural}} and social integration process among Syrian refugees in the United States, and to what extent the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>challenges</b> have played a role in the process of their social and cultural integration. The challenges include, but are not limited to, cultural conflicts, religious values, stereotypes, and English language proficiency. In order to investigate my research questions, interviews as a research methodology were used as a theoretical framework for this project to collect and analyze data. I conducted semi-structured interviews with ten Syrian refugees who currently live in the United States. These interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed in full in both Arabic and English by me. My data analysis investigated what the interviewees indicated about their processes of social and cultural integration in the United States’ society as refugees. Specific extracts were chosen because they served as rich materials to analyze and provide answers to questions in this paper. Findings indicated that Syrian refugees needed to overcome significant personal, social, linguistic, and psychological barriers and challenges in order to integrate socially and culturally in the United States’ society. Results showed that participants in this study adopted various “acculturation strategies”. Only three out of ten were socially and culturally integrated.

40|$|Background: Adenosine- 5 ′-monophosphate (AMP) is an <b>indirect</b> <b>challenge</b> agent {{thought to}} reflect {{allergic}} airway inflammation. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) {{is ideal for}} use in young children and is suitable for inhaled challenge studies in patients who are in this age group. We assessed the agreement between a shortened and a standard AMP challenge and the repeatability of the shortened AMP challenge using FOT as a primary outcome variable. Methods: Eighteen children completed a shortened and a standard AMP challenge, and 20 children completed repeated shortened AMP challenges. The children inhaled nebulized AMP tidally for 2 min, following which the presence of wheeze and pulse oximetric saturation (Spo 2) was recorded prior to FOT measurement. Testing continued until the maximum dose was reached or until wheeze, a decrease in Spo 2 to < 90 %, or an increase in respiratory resistance at 8 Hz of 2. 0 hPa/s/L or 30 % was noted. Concordance was assessed as a binary response, and agreement in provocation concentrations (PCs) causing a response was assessed with intraclass correlations. Results: There was {{a high degree of}} concordance between the shortened and standard AMP protocols (94 %) and repeated shortened AMP protocols (100 %). The mean log 10 PCs displayed a high degree of agreement for both AMP protocols, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0. 94 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 85 to 0. 98) and 0. 94 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 82 to 0. 98), respectively. Conclusions: We demonstrated that a shortened AMP challenge that can be applied to young children is comparable to the standard AMP challenge and is highly repeatable.

40|$|Sputum {{induction}} with inhaled mannitol {{in children}} To the Editor: Mannitol {{is used as}} an <b>indirect</b> <b>challenge</b> test to assess airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic adults and {{children as young as}} 4 years old [1 – 4]. Recently, it has been tested with success in adults as a sputum inducer [5, 6]. In children, induced sputum is usually obtained by hypertonic saline solution (HSS) and has several indications, such as sample obtaining in infectious diseases [7], monitoring severe asthma [8] and defining asthma phenotypes [9]. To our knowledge there have been no studies about the use of mannitol to obtain induced sputum in children. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the feasibility and safety of the mannitol challenge test to obtain induced sputum in young children. This pilot study is part of a project to study bronchial responsiveness and inflammation in asthmatic and nonasthmatic skier children. This is a cross-sectional, observational and descriptive study. Healthy and asthmatic children (7 – 13 years old) were randomly selected from a ski club (Ordino Arcalís Ski Club, Ordino Arcalís, Andorra). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nostra Senyora de Meritxell Hospital (Escaldes-Engordany, Andorra), and written informed consent from parents as well as authorisations from the ski club were obtained for participation in the study. Inclusion criteria for asthmatic children were diagnosis of bronchial asthma, regardless of the severity, and absence of asthma symptoms with no need for short-acting β 2 -agonists or oral corticosteroids during the previous month. The protocol study included: determination of the exhaled nitric oxide fraction with a NIOX MINO device (Aerocrine, Solna, Sweden); skin-prick testing (ALK-Abelló allergen extracts; ALK, Round Rock, TX, USA) for the common respiratory allergens; and a bronchoprovocation test and sputum induction with inhaled mannitol. The mannitol challenge test was performed by a progressive protocol [2]. Dry powder mannito...|$|E
40|$|In the {{joined cases}} C- 92 / 09 and C- 93 / 09 Volker und Markus Schecke GbR (C- 92 / 09) and Hartmut Eifert (C- 93 / 09) v. Land Hessen Judgment of 9 November 2010, not yet published, the Court of Justice of the European Union (Court of Justice) was {{called upon to}} balance the right to respect of private life in general, and to the {{protection}} of personal data in particular, protected by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter), against the principle of transparency stated in Articles 1 and 10 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and in Article 15 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Court of Justice approached this problem {{within the context of a}} reference for a preliminary ruling under Article 267 TFEU. This reference, however, took the form of an <b>indirect</b> <b>challenge</b> to certain EU law provisions that, in the view of the applicants, violated the right to respect of private life and of the protection of personal data. In this analysis the method of the Court of Justice when balancing diverging or even opposing interests protected by EU law will be scrutinised. The authors are critical of the Court’s reasoning, which they consider put too little weight on the fundamental interest of transparency in the case at hand. The analysis is structured as follows. First, in section 1, the arguments of the Applicants and the respondent State respectively will be summarised, followed by the main reasoning of the Court. In section 2, the question of how to balance fundamental rights and general interests will be analysed, taking as the point of departure the question of proportionality as described by the Court. The conclusions are presented in the final section 3. This analysis was written for the Swedish Institute for European Policy Studies and is also available at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Background: Eosinophilic airway {{inflammation}} {{has successfully}} {{been used to}} tailor anti-inflammatory therapy in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) by <b>indirect</b> <b>challenges</b> is associated with airway inflammation. We hypothesized that AHR to inhaled mannitol captures eosinophilia in induced sputum in COPD. Methods: Twenty-eight patients (age 58 ± 7. 8 yr, packyears 40 ± 15. 5, post-bronchodilator FEV 1 77 ± 14. 0 % predicted, no inhaled steroids ≥ 4 wks) with mild-moderate COPD (GOLD I-II) completed two randomized visits with hypertonic saline-induced sputum and mannitol challenge (including sputum collection). AHR to mannitol was expressed as response-dose-ratio (RDR) and related to cell counts, ECP, MPO and IL- 8 levels in sputum. Results: There was a positive correlation between RDR to mannitol and eosinophil numbers (r = 0. 47, p = 0. 03) and level of IL- 8 (r = 0. 46, p = 0. 04) in hypertonic saline-induced sputum. Furthermore, significant correlations were found between RDR and eosinophil numbers (r = 0. 71, p = 0. 001), level of ECP (r = 0. 72, p = 0. 001), IL- 8 (r = 0. 57, p = 0. 015) and MPO (r = 0. 64, p = 0. 007) in sputum collected after mannitol challenge. ROC-curves showed 60 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity of RDR for> 2. 5 % eosinophils in mannitol-induced sputum. Conclusions: In mild-moderate COPD mannitol hyperresponsiveness is associated with biomarkers of airway inflammation. The high specificity of mannitol challenge suggests that the test is particularly suitable to exclude eosinophilic airways inflammation, which may facilitate individualized treatment in COPD...|$|R
30|$|A single {{successful}} {{penetration of}} one or more end devices can threaten the security of an entire IoT system and cause harm to its applications and services, especially from an industrial point of view [39]. Thus, the implementation of a strong security mechanism in an IoT system depends on the strength of the security for individual IoT devices, which in turn depends on power and memory factors. Consequently, power and memory limitations are considered to pose <b>indirect</b> security <b>challenges</b> in IoT systems. To address these challenges, lightweight security solutions and lightweight encryption and decryption methods are required. These solutions and methods must be applicable in different IoT domains and must satisfy the security requirements without affecting the QoS.|$|R
40|$|This article {{affirms the}} {{usefulness}} of thinking of Europeanization and European policy change in terms of national, party and European contexts and their interrelationships. Through {{a case study of}} the French Socialists in office, the article seeks to establish that national, party and European policy contexts matter in different ways and in varying degrees. National context provides a set of institutions, interests and referential paradigms which help to make sense of a complex external environment. Party provides a distinctive partisan lens and an enduring political community. Europeanization poses a series of direct and <b>indirect</b> policy <b>challenges</b> and opportunities for nation-states and party governments. The article considers national and Europeanized pressures to be more significant than partisan processes...|$|R
