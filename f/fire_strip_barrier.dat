25|$|Between 1994 and 1996, Israel {{built the}} Israeli Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>barrier</b> to improve {{security}} in Israel. The barrier was largely torn down by Palestinians {{at the beginning}} of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in September 2000.|$|R
50|$|Two similar barriers, the Israeli Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>barrier</b> and the Israeli-built 7-9 meter (23-30 ft) wall {{separating}} Gaza from Egypt (temporarily breached on January 23, 2008), {{which is}} currently under Egyptian control, are also controversial.|$|R
25|$|From the Israeli perspective, the Israel–Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>barrier</b> is a {{security}} barrier intended by Israel {{to control the}} movement of people between the Gaza Strip and Israel, to stop the entry of arms into the territory. It has significantly improved security in Israel.|$|R
50|$|The Erez Crossing {{bombing was}} a suicide bombing which {{occurred}} on January 14, 2004 at the pedestrian/cargo terminal Erez Crossing located on the Israeli Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>barrier.</b> Four Israelis {{were killed in the}} attack. 10 people, including four Palestinians, were injured in the attack.|$|R
50|$|The Karni border {{crossing}} attack {{was a suicide}} bombing which occurred on January 13, 2005, at the pedestrian/cargo terminal Karni Crossing located on the Israeli Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>barrier.</b> Six Israeli civilians {{were killed in the}} attack and five Israelis were injured in the attack.|$|R

50|$|Nirim {{produces}} organically grown peanuts, sweet potatoes, turnips, {{carrots and}} other vegetables and exports them to Europe. The farmers work the land {{right up to}} the Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>barrier.</b> After Israel's disengagement from Gaza in 2005, the Defense Ministry decided to construct a security strip in the area surrounding Gaza, which was to run through Nirim agricultural territory. Nirim was asked to concede NIS 1 million of its compensation funds.|$|R
25|$|Egypt had {{pledged to}} help control their border with Gaza along the Israeli Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>barrier</b> {{subsequent}} to the Israel's unilateral disengagement plan which ended their 38-year occupation of Gaza in 2005 (q.v. Philadelphi Route). U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice brokered a deal with Israel giving the Palestinian National Authority control over the Rafah Border crossing under the remote video observation of European Union and Israeli monitors (q.v. European Union Border Assistance Mission Rafah).|$|R
50|$|Palestinian tactics {{have ranged}} from {{carrying}} out mass protests and general strikes, as in the First Intifada, to mounting suicide bombing attacks and firing Qassam rockets into east southern Israeli residential areas. Israeli tactics range from conducting mass arrests and locking up Palestinians in administrative detention through setting up checkpoints and building the Israeli Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>barrier</b> and West Bank barrier to carrying out assassinations targeting militants and leaders of Palestinian organizations.|$|R
50|$|The Israel and Egypt-Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>barrier,</b> {{built by}} Israel between 1994 and 2005 {{when it had}} full control of the Gaza Strip, {{separates}} the Gaza Strip from both Egypt and Israel; the Israeli Defense Forces maintain a presence at all border crossings and regularly patrol along the fence. All humanitarian aid bound for Gaza via Israel is transferred through four border crossings: The Kerem Shalom, Karni, Erez, and Sufa crossings. All aid first undergoes security inspection before being transferred by truck into Gaza.|$|R

50|$|Standard {{method is}} {{a process in which}} panels are toe nailed in with a {{finishing}} nailer. Most often this method is done by professionals. If the surface the pads are being installed on is capable of being nailed into, pads will often be mounted directly to that surface. However, if the surface is unable to be nailed into, like cinder block, then <b>firing</b> <b>strip</b> will be mounted first, and the pads mounted to them.|$|R
25|$|Overnight on 23 January, gunmen set off {{a number}} of explosions along the wall near the crossing. Palestinians packed into cars and donkey carts, crossed the border into Egypt from Gaza on foot, to buy {{essential}} goods. Between 200,000 and 700,000 Palestinians crossed over to Egypt and bought items at shops at the Egyptian half of Rafah and the North Sinai Governorate's capital, Arish. A Palestinian security guard later told The Times of London that militants had been steadily cutting through {{the base of the}} Israeli Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>barrier</b> with oxyacetylene torches for months.|$|R
50|$|By January 2008, {{according}} to a United Nations study, the economic effects of Israel's blockade on Gaza reached a critical threshold. Finally, on 17 January 2008, Israel sealed the border completely following a rise in rocket attacks. The breach of the Gaza-Egypt border began on 23 January 2008, after gunmen in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah Border Crossing, destroying part of the former Israeli Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>barrier.</b> The United Nations estimates {{that as many as}} half the 1.5 million population of the Gaza Strip crossed the border into Egypt seeking food and supplies.|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} {{is presented to}} diffraction problems involving plane <b>strip</b> <b>barriers</b> or slit apertures. These are problems that display the effects of multiple interacting edges. The approach taken here provides exact, compact solutions. The theory is introduced {{through a series of}} examples that are, in fact, the 'standard' problems of the subject, diffraction of a plane oblique wave by a slit, for example. In each case, the solutions are found to depend explicitly on a single 'special' function and its Fourier transform. These fundamental functions are described, with the emphasis placed on practical computational methods. The example problems are all couched in the language of acoustics...|$|R
50|$|Nailing margin is {{a process}} in which the {{manufacturer}} will intentionally leave 1” of foam off {{the top and bottom of}} the panel. This 1” area is meant to allow the installer to drill directly through the panel, without damaging, or compromising the pad. If the surface the pads are being installed on is capable of being screwed into, pads will often be mounted directly to that surface. However, if the surface is unable to be drilled into, like cinder block, then <b>firing</b> <b>strip</b> will be mounted first, and the pads mounted to them.|$|R
5000|$|Yitzhak Rabin was {{the first}} to propose the {{creation}} of a physical barrier between the Israeli and Palestinian populations in 1992, and by 1994, construction on the first barrier - the Israeli Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>barrier</b> - had begun. Following an attack on Bet Lid, near the city of Netanya, Rabin specified the objectives behind the undertaking, stating that, [...] "This path must lead to a separation, though not according to the borders prior to 1967. We want to reach a separation between us and them. We do not want a majority of the Jewish residents of the state of Israel, 98% of whom live within the borders of sovereign Israel, including a united Jerusalem, to be subject to terrorism." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{field study}} was {{conducted}} along a curve where the barrier line was worn out due to encroachments by cars. Vehicles were unobtrusively video recorded with the worn barrier line, after repainting the barrier line, and after milling the rumble <b>strip</b> <b>barrier</b> line. Lateral positions and speeds of vehicles were measured. Vehicle type and traffic situation were also classified (n = 6 599). It was assumed that if encroachments of barrier line and the standard deviation of lateral positions were reduced, safety would improve. The standard deviation of the lateral position of passenger cars travelling in free-flow traffic decreased from 35 cm with the worn barrier line to 28 cm after repainting the barrier line and to 24 cm after milling the rumble <b>strip</b> <b>barrier</b> line. Oncoming traffic moved the driving paths of vehicles 15 – 20 cm closer to the edge line. The mean speeds of cars in free-flow traffic did not change. The proportion of vehicles crossing the line {{was used as a}} compliance measure with the barrier line. No vehicle with oncoming traffic crossed the barrier line after rumble strip. Encroachments of passenger cars in free-flow traffic with no oncoming traffic fell from 9. 2 % to 2. 5 % after repainting, with no further change after implementing the rumble strip. The improvement in visual guidance alone reduced the number of crossings. Although the differences between repainting the barrier line and milling the rumble strip were not great, the rumble strip is more likely induce permanent changes in driver behaviour. A repeated measurement conducted during the following summer, supported this notion. 3 Keywords: driver behaviour, road marking, traffic safety...|$|R
50|$|Several {{second-hand}} Pierce-Arrow {{cars were}} bought by <b>fire</b> departments, <b>stripped</b> {{down to the}} chassis and engine, the wheelbase lengthened, and built back into fire engines. Some of these fire engines were in service for up to 20 years.|$|R

40|$|The Idaho National Engineering Laboratory has {{designed}} an laboratory tested a prototype retractable spiked <b>barrier</b> <b>strip</b> for law enforcement. The proposed system, which {{is ready for}} controlled field testing, expands the functionality of existing spiked <b>barrier</b> <b>strips.</b> A retractable <b>barrier</b> <b>strip,</b> one that can place the spikes in either the active (vertical) or passive (horizontal) position, would allow law enforcement personnel to lay the unobtrusive strip across a road far in advance of a fleeing vehicle. No damage occurs to passing vehicles until the spikes are activated, {{and that can be}} done from a safe distance and at a strategic location when the offending vehicle is close to the strip. The concept also allows the strips to be place safely across several roadways that are potential paths of a fleeing vehicle. Since they are not activated until needed, they are harmless to nonoffending vehicles. The laboratory tests conducted on the system indicate that it will puncture tires only when the spikes are rotated to the active position and is safe to travel over when the spikes are in the down position. The strip itself will not cause instability to a vehicle driving over it, nor is the strip disturbed or adversely affected by vehicles driving over it. The spikes can be quickly rotated between the active (vertical) and passive (horizontal) position. However, the laboratory tests have only demonstrated that the retractable spiked <b>barrier</b> <b>strip</b> can perform its intended function in a laboratory environment. Field tests are needed to finalize the design and develop the system into a functional law enforcement tool...|$|R
40|$|Charge, <b>fired</b> <b>strip</b> {{multiplicity}} and {{arrival time}} distributions for the induced signal were investigated for the $ 2 ~mm$ gap RPC operating with several tetrafluoroethane ($C_{ 2 }H_{ 2 }F_{ 4 }$) based mixtures with variation of isobutane ($iC_{ 4 }H_{ 10 }$) and sulphur hexafluoride ($SF_{ 6 }$) concentrations. Suppression {{of the large}} fast charges for the mixtures containing $SF_{ 6 }$ {{in comparison with the}} binary $C_{ 2 }H_{ 2 }F_{ 4 }$/$iC_{ 4 }H_{ 10 }$ mixture was confirmed. This suppression allows to have a wide plateau region ($ge 1 ~kV$) with small average charge and reduced tail of high charges. Exclusion of isobutane from the mixture with $ 2 %$ of $SF_{ 6 }$ does not change charge distributions...|$|R

2500|$|In 2004 {{psychiatrist}} Derek Summerfield {{wrote in}} an opinion piece in the British Medical Journal that the then-recent Israeli military reoccupation of the West Bank and Gaza divided communities by [...] "checkpoints", put up massive walls like the Israeli West Bank barrier and the Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>barrier</b> and demolished 60,000 homes. The World Bank estimated that due to these actions Palestinian poverty had tripled in three years with 60% of the population subsisting at poverty level and over half of households eating just one meal daily. The barrier was isolating 97 primary health clinics and 11 hospitals from Palestinian patients. During that time there were 87 cases in which denial of access to medical treatment caused death, including to 30 children, some babies born while women in labor were kept at checkpoints. Summerfield said that Physicians for Human Rights-Israel has criticized the Israel Medical Association for its silence on these issues.|$|R
