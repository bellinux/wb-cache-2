500|$|The songwriting session—held at Absolute's studio {{located on}} Tagg's Island near Chertsey—did {{not seem to}} go well at the beginning, as the duo was heavily into R music at the time, while the group {{according}} to Wilson was [...] "always very poptastic". After two sessions the duo phoned their managers {{and told them that}} the musical association between them and the group was not working. At this point, the duo heard [...] "Wannabe" [...] for the first time, Wilson remembers: [...] "We listen to it, and we didn't <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> all. It was so different to what we were doing. We thought, 'How's this gonna work? We're not the right people to be doing this band.'" [...] For the next session the group wanted to write something uptempo and a bit more fun. A full-on disco backing track came up, and [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] evolved from there. Wilson commented about that session: ...|$|E
500|$|Santer {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a [...] "parallel universe show" [...] with new characters, where the regular characters are in the background. Yorke sought to improve the portrayal of teenagers in EastEnders and to get younger people writing for it. The ideas came together and EastEnders: E20 was created in what Yorke described as [...] "one of the quickest periods from idea to screen I've ever known." [...] Regarding the decision to create an online drama, Yorke said, [...] "People don't watch television at fixed times anymore, they use iPlayer [...] <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> their convenience and so it made sense to make a programme that [...] can specifically get at their convenience." [...] The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, added, [...] "Technology is changing and it's changing really quickly and I think it's really appropriate that the BBC is leading the way in offering online content." [...] The first series was commissioned by multi-platform commissioning executive Rosie Allimonos.|$|E

Stieglitz found he had only one glass plate prepared at the time, and he quickly returned to the viewpoint and captured {{the one and only}} picture of the scene.|$|E
2500|$|Jerry Pournelle, also of BYTE, {{added that}} [...] "The Macintosh is a bargain {{only if you}} can <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the heavily {{discounted}} price offered to faculty and students of the favored 24 universities in the Macintosh consortium." [...] He noted, however, that the Macintosh attracted people [...] "who previously hated computers ... There is, apparently, something about mice and pull-down menus and icons that appeal to people previously intimidated by A> and the like".|$|E

2500|$|Although {{estimates}} of the number of new cases a year vary, HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active people will <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> some point in their lives. A condyloma acuminatum is a single genital wart, and condylomata acuminata are multiple genital warts. The word roots mean [...] "pointed wart" [...] (from Greek κόνδυλος, [...] "knuckle", Greek -ωμα , [...] "disease," [...] and Latin [...] "pointed"). Although similarly named, it is not the same as condyloma latum, which is a complication of secondary syphilis.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} session with Stannard and Rowe, they wrote [...] "Feed Your Love", a slow, soulful song which was {{eventually}} recorded and mastered for the album but not released because it was considered too rude and racy for their target audience. Similarly, [...] "C U Next Tuesday", a song initially meant for the album, was never released supposedly due to the initials of the song's title spelling the word [...] "cunt" [...] which {{is considered by many}} to be vulgar. Having completed that session, the girls wanted to write something more uptempo, so they started to write the song that would be the lead of the album, [...] "Wannabe", which was recorded in under an hour—mainly because they had already written parts of the songs beforehand. The next song they recorded was a slow ballad and the third track on and single from the album, [...] "2 Become 1". The song was inspired by the special relationship which had developed between Halliwell and Rowe during the session. [...] "Mama" [...] was written by the Spice Girls with songwriting partners Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard. In an interview about the writing process between the group and the duo, Rowe credits Mel B as the one who came up with the song's concept. During the writing process, each member wrote a small verse in a different corner of the recording studio, while the chorus was finished around the piano with a guitar. Then, the producers added a gospel choir filled with the group's harmonies at the end of the song. In May 1995, the group was introduced to Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins, the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute. Watkins commented about their first meeting, [...] "They played us a few tracks, which we didn't particularly like. So we thought, this is OK. We can work with this." [...] A songwriting session was booked within the next few days at Absolute's studio located on Tagg's Island near Chertsey, but the musical association between them did not seem to go well at the beginning. Wilson remembered, [...] "When they started to sing it was never quite right: from our point of view. It was very poptastic." [...] Watkins recalled, [...] "After two sessions we phoned our managers and said 'This just ain't happening'." [...] It was at this point that Watkins and Wilson heard [...] "Wannabe" [...] for the first time. When speaking about the song, Wilson said, [...] "We listened to it and we didn't <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> all. It was so different to what we were doing. We thought is this going to work?".|$|E
