40|$|Abstract. mAbs {{were raised}} in mice against cultured human endothelial cells (EC) and {{screened}} by indirect immunofluorescence {{for their ability to}} stain intercellular contacts. One mAb denoted 7 B 4 was identified which, out of many cultured cell types, specifically decorated cultured human EC. The antigen recognized by mAb 7 B 4 is bound at the appositional surfaces of cultured EC only as they become confluent and is stably expressed at intercellular boundaries of confluent monolayers. <b>EC</b> <b>recognition</b> specificity was maintained when the antibody was assayed by immunohistochemistry in tissue sections of many normal and malignant tissues and in blood vessels of different size and type. The antigen recognized by 7 B 4 was enriched at EC intercellular boundaries similarly in vitro and i...|$|E
40|$|Murnane and Phelps (1993) {{recommend}} word pair presentations {{in local}} environmental context (EC) studies to prevent associations being formed between successively presented items and their ECs and a consequent {{reduction in the}} EC effect. Two experiments were conducted to assess the veracity of this assumption. In Experiment 1, participants memorised single words or word pairs, or categorised them as natural or man made. Their free recall protocols were examined to assess any associations established between successively presented items. Fewest associations were observed when the item-specific encoding task (i. e., natural or man made categorisation of word referents) was applied to single words. These findings were examined further in Experiment 2, where the influence of encoding instructions and stimulus presentation on local <b>EC</b> dependent <b>recognition</b> memory was examined. Consistent with recognition dual-process signal detection model predictions and findings (e. g., Macken, 2002; Parks & Yonelinas, 2008), recollection sensitivity, but not familiarity sensitivity, {{was found to be}} local EC dependent. However, local <b>EC</b> dependent <b>recognition</b> was observed only after item-specific encoding instructions, irrespective of stimulus presentation. These findings and the existing literature suggest that the use of single word presentations and item-specific encoding enhances local <b>EC</b> dependent <b>recognition...</b>|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction]. This {{paper will}} explore the {{relative}} weights of EC influence, {{on the one}} hand, and domestic pressure on {{the other on the}} events leading to Germany's recognition of Croatia and Slovenia in December 1991 [...] and the <b>EC's</b> <b>recognition</b> of these countries in January 1992. Did the push for recognition, against the preferences of Britain, France, and the United States, signal Germany's intention to pursue unilateral policies, as was popularly asserted at the time? Was that push driven by domestic pressures and perceptions of national security requirements separate from those hammered out in the European Community? Or, did Germany's position and the strategy Genscher pursued simply signal Germany's first awkward steps toward asserting a leadership role in the Community on foreign policy issues...|$|R
40|$|Background: Advance {{provision}} of emergency contraception (EC) has increased use but not impacted on pregnancy or abortion rates. Here we describe young women's EC use {{and experiences of}} unprotected sex to explore why this difference occurs. Methods: In-depth interviews with twenty 20 -year-old women from eastern Scotland. Results: The majority (16) had used EC; 10 reported some experience of unprotected sex. EC use followed contraceptive failure and unexpected or unplanned, but not frequent, unprotected sex. Acknowledging the need for <b>EC</b> requires <b>recognition</b> of pregnancy risk. Those reporting frequent unprotected sex misperceived their pregnancy risk and did not use EC. This group was from socially disadvantaged backgrounds, and all became pregnant. Conclusions: EC remains an important “backup” contraceptive and {{should continue to be}} widely available. With high levels of unprotected sex, nonuse of EC and unintended pregnancies, further efforts are required to improve the sexual and reproductive health outcomes of disadvantaged young women...|$|R
2500|$|Strong Greek {{opposition}} {{delayed the}} newly independent republic's accession to the United Nations and its recognition by the European Community (EC). [...] Although the Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on the former Yugoslavia declared that the Republic of Macedonia met the conditions set by the <b>EC</b> for international <b>recognition,</b> Greece opposed the international community recognizing the Republic due {{to a number of}} objections concerning the country's name, flag and constitution. In an effort to block the European Community from recognizing the Republic, the Greek government persuaded the EC to adopt a common declaration establishing conditions for recognition which included a ban on [...] "territorial claims towards a neighboring Community state, hostile propaganda and the use of a denomination that implies territorial claims".|$|R
40|$|Enterprise {{computing}} (<b>EC)</b> is the <b>recognition</b> that {{to effectively}} utilize and disseminate information within an entity (university, corporation, government agency, etc.) {{it will be}} necessary to design and develop integrated distributed computing environments that allow all types of existing and future systems to interoperate. In EC, there are legacy, COTS, database, and new client/server applications that all must interact to facilitate both peace and war time communications among personnel at varying locations (e. g., divisions, battalions, brigades, companies, platoons, Pentagon, etc.). When all of the diverse components that comprise EC applications (ECA) are linked, then security becomes an important issue, to insure that individuals only have access to the right information at the appropriate time. This paper details security, authorization, and authentication for enterprise computing. The paper’s intent is to begin to answer the important questions: What are major and underlying security concepts for enterprise computing? What are the security requirements for ECA? What are available approaches to security for enterprise computing and its applications? 1...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{and compare}} the prevalence of MSH 6 (a mismatch repair gene) mutations in a cohort of families with Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), and in an unselected cohort of endometrial cancer patients (EC). Design: Two patient cohorts participated in the study. A cohort of HNPCC families who were known to the Regional Medical Genetics department, and an unselected cohort of patients {{with a history of}} EC. All participants received genetic counselling on the implications of molecular testing, and blood was taken for DNA extraction with consent. All samples underwent sequencing and Multiple Ligation probe analysis (MLPA) for mutations in MSH 6. Populations: DNA from one hundred and forty-three probands from HNPCC families and 125 patients with EC were included in the study. Methods: Molecular analysis of DNA in all participants from both cohorts for mutations in MSH 6. Outcome measures: Prevalence of pathogenic mutations in MSH 6. Results: A truncating mutation in MSH 6 was identified in 3. 8 % (95 % CI 1. 0 - 9. 5 %) of patients in the endometrial cancer cohort, and 2. 6 % (95 % CI 0. 5 - 7. 4 %) of patients in the HNPCC cohort. A missense mutation was identified in 2. 9 % and 4. 4 % of the same cohorts respectively. No genomic rearrangements in MSH 6 were identified. Conclusion: MSH 6 mutations are more common in EC patients than HNPCC families. Genomic rearrangements do not contribute to a significant proportion of mutations in MSH 6, but missense variants are relatively common and their pathogenicity can be uncertain. HNPCC families may be ascertained through an individual presenting with <b>EC,</b> and <b>recognition</b> of these families is important so that appropriate cancer surveillance can be put in place...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{growth hormone}} (GH) treatment and treatment cessation {{with respect to}} efficacy and efficiency. To identify factors that best classify or predict cessation type: completed treatment (CT), early cessation (EC), or non-response (NR). Design: Observational study (1990 - 2013) of the Australian GH Program comparing CT, EC, and NR groups with respect to demographic, clinical, and response criteria. All patients treated for GH deficiency (GHD; 909), short stature and slow growth (SSSG; 2144), and Turner Syndrome (TS; 626) were included. Information was retrieved from the OZGROW database. Results: 51. 9 % of patients were EC, 40. 7 % CT and 7. 4 % NR. Median treatment durations for NR patients were often longer than patients who completed treatment. EC and NR groups were both associated with poor growth response with males overrepresented. Socioeconomic status differentiated NR (higher) and EC (lower) groups. Conclusions: EC was observed at very high rates and appears, generally, to be a little-recognised but frequent problem in GH therapy. <b>EC</b> and delayed <b>recognition</b> of NR may be interrelated being differentiated by the decision to cease or continue treatment following poor response. Poor treatment compliance is likely a major causal factor in EC. Strategies to address poor response and compliance have been developed, however, given the scale of these problems, {{it may be that}} long acting GH formulations or individualized treatment need consideration...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} influences of minimum quality standards and {{of the threat of}} entry in a vertical product differentiation model. ^ In the first chapter, I study the influence of minimum quality standards in a partial-equilibrium model of vertical product differentiation and trade in which duopolistic firms face quality-dependent costs and compete in quality and price in two segmented markets. In an unregulated equilibrium, one firm sells high quality whereas the other sells low quality. Under Full Harmonization of standards, there always exists some minimum quality standard that will increase welfare in both regions. Two other alternatives to Full Harmonization are National Treatment and Mutual Recognition. Under either alternative, standards can always be found that increase welfare in both regions. The analysis above is therefore extended to integrate the choice of a particular standard setting alternative by governments and the subsequent setting of standards into the model. This model includes restricting assumptions to capture stylized facts about the <b>EC.</b> Mutual <b>Recognition</b> emerges as one regulatory alternative that always improves welfare in both regions when compared to the case without regulation. It is also the only possible equilibrium outcome of the game. ^ Results obtained in the first chapter imply that there may be particular choices of quality by one firm that could prevent a competitor from attaining positive profits regardless of its quality choice. In the second chapter, I study how the existence of a potential entrant influences a monopolistic incumbent 2 ̆ 7 s choice of quality in a model of vertical product differentiation and entry. An incumbent and a potential entrant face fixed setup costs and quality-dependent costs of production and compete in quality and price. With identical quality-dependent costs, the incumbent will always deter entry if possible, i. e. if fixed setup costs are high enough. Quality will be set at a level lower than the optimal quality set if entry was accommodated and lower than or equal to the optimal quality set under monopoly. If entry is not blockaded, quality will be set at a level strictly lower than the optimal quality set under monopoly. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Endometrial {{carcinoma}} ranks 3 rd in India among gynecological malignancies. Endometrial cancer (EC) can {{be classified}} into two distinct groups – type I and type II, based on histology, which differs in molecular, clinical and histopathological profiles. Type II is nonestrogen dependent, nonendometrioid, more aggressive and carries poor prognosis. Although type II cancers contribute only about 10 % of EC incidence, they present at advanced age and cause approximately 50 % recurrence and deaths with a low 5 -year, overall survival rate. Type II EC are also characterized by genetic alterations in p 53, human epidermal growth factor- 2 /neu, p 16 and E-cadherin. Materials and Methods: Endometrial carcinomas diagnosed from endometrial biopsies and hysterectomy specimens received in the Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, from January 2007 to June 2012 {{were included in the}} study. Clinicopathological analysis of the 84 cases of EC was done with emphasis on morphology. p 53 immunostaining was performed in two cases of serous carcinoma. Results: Out of a total of 84 cases of EC, ten cases were of type II (11. 9 %). Out of which, eight were serous carcinoma (9. 5 %) and two clear cell (2. 4 %). p 53 immunostain was strongly positive in the serous papillary carcinomas. The age of the patients ranged from 45 to 75 years. Myometrial invasion was more than half. Treatment was hysterectomy followed by aggressive chemotherapy. Conclusion: Of the type II EC, serous carcinoma is the most common type. Clinical presentation and prognosis differs in comparison to type I <b>EC,</b> thus the <b>recognition</b> of this type of EC is pivotal...|$|R
