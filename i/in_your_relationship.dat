500|$|So far, {{there have}} been two {{occasions}} in which no award has been presented. Bent did not offer a prize in 1987 and 1991, as he felt there was no title that was odd enough to deserve the prize. The prize has become noteworthy enough that, in 2004, The Bookseller castigated publishers for choosing titles with a view to winning it, saying, [...] "There were too many self-consciously titled entries – presumably in a bid to emulate the 2003 champion, Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories". Bent has also expressed his dislike of people voting for ruder titles, stating that he himself would not have voted for the 2007 winner If You Want Closure <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Relationship,</b> Start with Your Legs.|$|E
500|$|Michael G. Wilson {{decided on}} the film's title Quantum of Solace only [...] "a few days" [...] before its {{announcement}} on 24 January 2008. It {{was the name of}} a short story in Ian Fleming's anthology For Your Eyes Only (1960). The film is related to the title in one of its thematic elements: [...] "when the 'Quantum of Solace' drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone." [...] Daniel Craig admitted, [...] "I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>relationship</b> then the relationship is over. It's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up." [...] He said that [...] "Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [...] has been killed," [...] and therefore, [...] " [...] looking for revenge... to make himself happy with the world again." [...] Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in Casino Royale. Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd. Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond have a discussion about their individual quests to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Montes asks Bond to [...] "let me know what it feels like" [...] when he succeeds, the implication of the title being {{that it will be a}} small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.|$|E

5000|$|Explaining {{the album}} title, {{which is also}} the title of the album's third track, Ian said: [...] "The meaning, to me, for this title is that {{everybody}} can be a king.

I'm not necessarily saying that being a [...] "king" [...] is being the boss <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>relationship,</b> or any relationship for that matter. A king of yourself is what I mean.

[...] He says, [...] "Why did {{you wish to}} be in the wrong in relation to a person? Because you loved. Why did you find it upbuilding? Because you loved. The more you loved, the less time you had to deliberate upon whether or not you were in the right; your love had only one desire, that you might continually be in the wrong. So also <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>relationship</b> with God. You loved God, and therefore your soul could find rest and joy only in this, that you might always be in the wrong. You did not arrive at this acknowledgment out of mental toil; you were not forced, for when you are in love you are in freedom." [...] Kierkegaard uses the Two Upbuilding Discourses to explain that the single individual has a relationship with God that is based on faith, not on knowledge. When faith announces itself within the individual, the job is to protect faith against its greatest enemy, doubt.|$|E
