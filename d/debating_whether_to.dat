5|$|That afternoon, Reagan {{consulted}} with White House counsel Fred Fielding by telephone, <b>debating</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> invoke the amendment and, if so, whether such a transfer would set an undesirable precedent. Fielding and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan recommended that Reagan transfer power and two letters doing so were drafted: {{the first letter}} specifically invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment; the second only mentioned that Reagan was mindful of this provision. At 10:32a.m. on July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and ordered its delivery to the appropriate officers as required under the amendment. Vice President George H. W. Bush was Acting President from 11:28 a.m. until 7:22 p.m., when Reagan transmitted a second letter to resume the powers and duties of the office.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} the music video {{is based on the}} lyrics and {{presented}} as a typical Friday for Black. She wakes up and goes to school, meeting her friends on the way. In the evening, after <b>debating</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> sit in the front or back of a convertible, Black and her friends ride the car to a party at 7:45 pm. Patrice Wilson appears {{near the end of the}} song to deliver a short rap. The video was shot on January 6, 2011 at Black's father's house with friends and family as extras, and requiring multiple takes over 12 hours. Some of those extras became stars in their own right; her friends Benni Cinkle, Amanda Cooper and Hayley Grodt. Ark Music, according to Black's parents, cautioned them and her that they should not expect her to become famous. Black hoped that her friends and family would enjoy watching the video on YouTube and that it would perhaps help her to later begin a singing career.|$|E

25|$|A fight {{broke out}} {{over whether to}} make the report public. Thompson made the report {{available}} to Ullico's board of directors, and required board members to sign statements promising to keep the findings confidential. Without a board vote to release the report, it would have remained secret. A number of board members did not want {{their role in the}} stock scandal made public. Board member John J. Sweeney, then president of the AFL-CIO and one of the board members who did not participate in the stock trading scheme, demanded the release of the report. Georgine and Sweeney engaged in numerous heated arguments for several weeks, <b>debating</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> release the Thompson report. Finally, on December 1, 2002, Sweeney resigned from the Ullico board in protest. Four other members of the board followed suit over the next month.|$|E
500|$|The 2000 {{season was}} {{considered}} a make-or-break season for Fassel. Like his predecessor, Dan Reeves, Fassel had enjoyed great success in his first year, but disappointment in the following two seasons. The conventional wisdom was that the Giants needed {{to have a strong}} year for Fassel to retain his job. The Giants' big draft acquisition was running back Ron Dayne, Heisman Trophy winner from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Before the draft the team was <b>debating</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> select Dayne or Shaun Alexander. The plan for Dayne was that the power running style he had at Wisconsin would complement Barber's speed and pass-catching ability. The two were dubbed [...] "Thunder and Lightning".|$|E

[...] He also finds that the Valakians have been stifling and underestimating the Menk. He has found a cure, but does not believe it would be ethical to administer. Archer considers how a [...] "primary directive" [...] would be helpful, and provides the Valakians with medicine that will diminish the symptoms for a decade, anticipating the Menks' natural evolution and new levels of understanding between them.|$|E

Interested in computer programming, Seropian was pursuing a mathematics degree with a concentration in computer science as the Department of Computer Science did not offer undergraduate degrees at the time.

Before graduating, Seropian was living with his father, sleeping on his couch, and <b>debating</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> get a job or create his own video game company.

500|$|Immediately after Ben Silverman {{was named}} {{co-chairman}} of NBC's entertainment division in 2007, he asked Greg Daniels {{to create a}} spin-off of The Office, the half-hour comedy Daniels adapted from the British comedy of the same name, created by Ricky Gervais. Daniels co-created Parks and Recreation with Michael Schur, {{who had been a}} writer on The Office. Like Daniels, Schur had previously worked on the NBC sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. The two spent months considering ideas for the new series and <b>debating</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> make it a stand-alone show rather than a spin-off. According to Daniels, they eventually abandoned the original spin-off plan because they [...] "couldn't find the right fit". They considered a series about a local government official trying to rebuild a political career following a humiliating public spectacle, but ultimately abandoned the idea. However, it was ultimately incorporated into the backstory for Ben Wyatt, the character played by Adam Scott who was added late in the second season.|$|E

His family stated: [...] "It is our hope through airing this show that people will get to see the side of Adam that we knew and loved. The decision to air the show has been difficult, but we do this with the profound belief that it will inspire others to seek help". Favreau also consulted people close to Goldstein about whether the footage of him in Iron Man 2 should still be used; they agreed unanimously it should remain.

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, proponents of abstinence-only sex {{education}} object to curricula {{that fail to}} teach their standard of moral behavior; they maintain that a morality {{which is based on}} sex only within the bounds of marriage is [...] "healthy and constructive" [...] and that value-free knowledge of the body may lead to immoral, unhealthy, and harmful practices. Within the last decade, the federal government has encouraged abstinence-only education by steering over a billion dollars to such programs. Some 25 states now decline the funding so that they can continue to teach comprehensive sex education.
