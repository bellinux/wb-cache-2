One must be careful in this quest, however, to avoid the problems of the 'hammer syndrome'—to the person holding a hammer, <b>everything</b> <b>looks</b> like a nail.

500|$|As {{the live}} {{broadcast}} of [...] "Live Show" [...] was recorded with TV cameras edited live to video rather than film stock, the video quality for this episode was noticeably different from standard episodes of 30 Rock. Jack acknowledges {{this at the}} start of the episode by asking why <b>everything</b> <b>looks</b> like a [...] "Mexican soap opera." [...] Throughout the episode, the characters broke the fourth wall: Tracy Jordan's unprofessional acting within the TGS episode, Jack's references to the video quality, Julia Louis-Dreyfus' portrayal of Liz in cut-away sequences, and the re-hashing of standard sitcom plot elements.|$|E
500|$|GameSpot's Walton {{thought the}} {{graphics}} improvements made the open world [...] "even more spectacular", especially because of improved spatial anti-aliasing. Of the first-person view, {{he said that}} [...] "at ground level <b>everything</b> <b>looks</b> bigger and more imposing" [...] because of the improved graphics. IGN's Stapleton favoured the PlayStation 4 version's graphics over the Xbox One, but thought both consoles rendered the game well and maintained mostly consistent frame rates. He praised the increased frame rate and graphics options offered in the PC version. VideoGamer.com called the console version's frame rate so consistent it was [...] "scarcely believable", although GameSpot's Walton cited occasional frame rate dips. GameSpot's Peter Brown opined that the PC version let players [...] "witness {{the full extent of}} Rockstar's admirable handiwork", but noted that it [...] "retains evidence of its last-gen roots ... with simple geometry". VideoGamer.com praised the Rockstar Editor's accessibility on PC but criticised some of its limitations, such as camera angle restrictions. IGN's Stapleton appreciated the PC version's customisable controls, and GameSpot's Brown felt that constant switching between the mouse and keyboard and a gamepad was necessary for [...] "the best experience". PC Gamers Chris Thursten called the game [...] "the most beautiful, expansive and generous" [...] of the series.|$|E

500|$|The Dark Blues {{had turned}} to Ferguson to play for and manage the team because of his {{reputation}} as the most authoritarian captain in the game. He was an honest and upstanding citizen {{in a time when}} not many ballplayers could say the same. However, he was also a domineering, dictatorial captain with a violent streak. [...] Team discipline did improve in his first season, but his overbearing ways proved divisive, causing the team to bicker amongst themselves. Ferguson's temper would flare up often, even when the team was winning. The Chicago Tribune reported that if anyone on the Hartford nine committed an error, [...] "Ferguson [...] swear until <b>everything</b> <b>looks</b> blue." [...] He was particularly rough on second baseman Jack Burdock, who {{on more than one occasion}} heard his captain publicly threaten [...] "to ram his fist down Burdock's throat." [...] Some players tolerated his behavior; others, however, refused to comply. Shortstop Tom Carey and center fielder Jack Remsen did not hesitate to yell back, while Burdock and pitcher Candy Cummings, on the other hand, often sulked. The situation in Hartford came to a head after a tough loss to the Red Stockings, a game in which Ferguson had committed several errors. Hartford's main pitcher, Tommy Bond, suggested that Ferguson was [...] "crooked". Ferguson denied the charge, and Bond quickly retracted his statement, claiming that he said it in anger. Bond then requested that he be able to leave the team because he could not play for Ferguson, a request that was granted by league president Morgan Bulkeley, a former owner of the Dark Blues.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} 50th anniversary issue of World Soccer magazine, {{the captain of the}} Brazilian team that won the 1970 World Cup, Carlos Alberto, went on to say, [...] "The only team I've seen that did things differently was Holland at the 1974 World Cup in Germany. Since then <b>everything</b> <b>looks</b> {{more or less the same}} to me.... Their 'carousel' style of play was amazing to watch and marvellous for the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Josh Smith {{scored the}} PlayStation version 7 out of 10, writing [...] "With {{innovative}} graphics, great level design, and awesome special weapons, <b>everything</b> <b>looks</b> great on paper. A number of flaws limit the game's life span, though, and {{raise questions about}} what's really important in games - style, mood, and vibe or solid gameplay, consistent graphics, and a continual challenge." [...] He was critical of the graphics, saying [...] "you may wish they'd traded {{a little of the}} game's visual inventiveness for some consistent graphical clarity. There's a ton of polygon dropout. And when things get busy, with dozens of onscreen enemies, projectiles, and explosions (which is in almost every scene), things slow way, way down, or animation frames disappear." [...] He also felt the game was too short, concluding [...] "MDK is something of a mixed bag. Amazing graphics style, but little graphical consistency. Awesome combat action, but little combat challenge. Great puzzles, but they're really pretty simple, and the whole game can be solved without using too many brain cells." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{challenge}} facing Irrational was identified from BioShock, in which players, once equipped with specific plasmids and weapons, could complete the game {{without having to}} alter their weapons; Levine quotes the saying [...] "When all {{you have is a}} hammer, <b>everything</b> <b>looks</b> like a nail" [...] to describe how they found players were able to complete most of BioShock using the 'Electro Bolt' plasmid and a shotgun. Irrational wanted instead to create situations through Infinites weapons and powers that allowed the player to progress to some point with certain combinations but then would be forced to learn new possibilities that Irrational had designed within the game. The vertical and open-air spaces of Columbia provide more opportunity to include various types of combat compared to the close-ranged limits of Rapture within the first BioShock. The team developed a variety of enemies that would have certain strengths and weakness that would force the player to experiment and work with all their available tools given to them. This was further enhanced by the inclusion of Elizabeth, who has powers {{that can be used in}} conjunction with Booker's to achieve more impressive results but that strain her powers and giving choice to the player as to how and when to use her abilities. Another aspect that Irrational had considered from BioShock was the way players opted in choosing whether to save or harvest the Little Sisters; according to writer Drew Holmes, because this choice simply affected the reward that players would receive, they would not consider the moral consequences of their actions, particularly with subsequent playthroughs of the game. While Infinite will offer such choices to the player, these will be less obvious and with initially ambiguous results, an example being the choice of throwing a baseball at an interracial couple or the barker at the start of the game.|$|E
