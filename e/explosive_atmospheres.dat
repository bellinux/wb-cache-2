In the metropolitan areas, this was the fire authority. In the county authorities, it was the local authority, but usually this was devolved down to the fire service. The Petroleum (Consolidation) Act 1928, as amended by Dangerous Substances and <b>Explosive</b> <b>Atmospheres</b> Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No. 2776), changed the licensing regime and now requires only that anyone operating a petrol filling station have a licence.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} OSH benefits {{stemming from}} the wider use of robotics should be substitution for people working in unhealthy or dangerous environments. In space, defence, security, or the nuclear industry, but also in logistics, maintenance, and inspection, autonomous robots are particularly useful in replacing human workers performing dirty, dull or unsafe tasks, thus avoiding workers' exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical, ergonomic and psychosocial risks. For example, robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks, to handle radioactive material or to work in <b>explosive</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> In the future, many other highly repetitive, risky or unpleasant tasks will be performed by robots {{in a variety of}} sectors like agriculture, construction, transport, healthcare, firefighting or cleaning services.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Equipment {{for use in}} {{potentially}} <b>explosive</b> <b>atmosphere</b> {{is subject}} to particular requirements on safety and quality as determined {{by a number of}} Standards. For use in Europe, such equipment needs to conform to the EC directive 94 / 9 /EC, also called “ATEX Directive”. The conformity must be certified by a socalled ATEX Certificate. In the frame of the EC-funded research project „Corrosion testing of tank ships“, AE-field tests on board large tank ships were executed. Intrinsically safe certified AE sensors were temporarily immersed through a potentially <b>explosive</b> <b>atmosphere</b> from the tank top through manholes into the liquid contents. Ship owners and involved classification societies insisted on the availability of a system certificate confirming intrinsic safety for the used sensors and isolation barriers. This paper summarizes basics of explosion protection and the ATEX directive, the safety requirements on Acoustic Emission field test equipment for use in potentially <b>explosive</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> and shows a realization of certified equipment and data acquired from immersed sensors on board of a tank ship and used for the location of a natural artificial AE corrosion source...|$|R

The situation is the opposite when a propagating explosion enters the same micro-designed reactor from one of the outside openings. The external explosion may enter the micro-designed equipment and destroy it when the same starting conditions are present...|$|R
