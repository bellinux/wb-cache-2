5000|$|The <b>footplate</b> <b>of</b> a steam {{locomotive}} {{is a large}} metal plate that rests {{on top of the}} frames and is normally covered with wooden floorboards. It is usually the full width of the locomotive and extends {{from the front of the}} cab to the rear of cab or coal bunker just above the buffer beam. The boiler, the cab, and other superstructure elements are in turn mounted on the footplate. The footplate does extend beyond the front of the cab on some locomotives, but is then usually referred to as the [...] "running board/plate." [...] The footplate is where the Driver and Fireman stand in the cab to operate the locomotive, giving rise to the expression of working on the footplate for being in the cab of a {{steam locomotive}}. The part <b>of</b> the <b>footplate</b> ahead <b>of</b> the cab is referred to by a variety of different names.|$|R
40|$|Uncertainty {{about the}} cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> has led to {{research}} being conducted to understand the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> within the Australian construction industry. This has involved reviewing work done in Australia and overseas as well as exploring the efforts within the construction industry to collect cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> information. While there is currently awareness of the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> and that efforts {{should be taken to}} minimise this cost, there is little precise understanding of it in terms of value or how it happens. This paper explores the barriers to understanding the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering.</b> Throughout the worldwide construction industry tendering is acknowledged to be complicated, adding considerable cost to construction. Efforts to understand the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> are confounded by issues that are both visible and invisible to formal accounting of the construction process. This paper intends to demonstrate the problems and their causes. Anecdotes are derived from the literature, observations of construction purchases, and interview data to demonstrate the barriers to understanding the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering.</b> This is augmented by corresponding observations of other major purchases. Problems and causes are described in terms of these anecdotes. Because of the diverse activities undertaken by constructors and limitations of accounting categories, expenses associated with tendering are difficult to capture and quantify. These problems are explained through examples. Even in those cases where there are genuine intentions to capture costs <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> there is a failure to do so. It appears that implementation difficulties are so insurmountable that either people do not bother or management redirects effort from collecting cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> data. It is also shown that the expense <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> and uncertainty <b>of</b> outcomes leads tenderers to engage in concealed behaviour to reduce the uncertainty and cost associated with tendering. That is, collusion. For this reason especially, it is concluded that tendering and associated costs need to be understood in greater detail...|$|R

The next step was to conduct a questionnaire survey to ascertain the extent to which ethical behaviour in tendering is supported and practised in Australia. This showed that most companies support the use codes <b>of</b> <b>tendering,</b> defend the right <b>of</b> withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>tenders,</b> disapprove <b>of</b> bid shopping, cover pricing and union involvement in the tendering process, support the principals' right to know what is included in a tender and the self-regulation <b>of</b> the <b>tendering</b> codes. In addition, most companies have developed, and follow, idiosyncratic ethical guidelines that are independent of, and often contrary to, the nationally prescribed codes. The major conclusion is that a more empirical approach to the development of future ethical prescriptions in the field is needed...|$|R

2500|$|At {{the base}} of the cochlea, each duct ends in a {{membranous}} portal that faces the middle ear cavity: The vestibular duct ends at the oval window, where the <b>footplate</b> <b>of</b> the stapes sits. The footplate vibrates when the pressure is transmitted via the ossicular chain. [...] The wave in the perilymph moves away from the footplate and towards the helicotrema. Since those fluid waves move the cochlear partition that separates the ducts up and down, the waves have a corresponding symmetric part in perilymph of the tympanic duct, which ends at the round window, bulging out when the oval window bulges in.|$|R
50|$|As in all lepidosaurs and archosaurs, the single-ossicle (columellar) {{middle ear}} transmits sound to the <b>footplate</b> <b>of</b> the columella, which sends a {{pressure}} wave through the inner ear. In snakes, the basilar papilla is roughly 1mm long and only responds to frequencies below about 1 kHz. In contrast, lizards {{tend to have}} two areas of hair cells, one responding below and the other above 1 kHz. The upper frequency limit in most lizards is roughly 5-8 kHz. The longest lizard papillae are about 2mm long and contain 2000 hair cells and their afferent innervating fibers can be very sharply tuned to frequency.|$|R
50|$|The first {{locomotive}} gab {{gears used}} two 'open' gabs, side by side, each potentially (when engaged) hooking {{over the same}} pin. If both gabs were ever engaged simultaneously these would jam, probably damaging the valve rod. On the <b>footplate</b> <b>of</b> a rattling locomotive with no suspension and a poor trackbed, this {{is known to have}} been the cause of breakdowns, whether by driver error or by a loose gab slipping into accidental engagement. As the gabs, unlike in the stationary engine, were remote from the driver they were provided with wide V-shaped jaws to help them engage with the pins.|$|R
50|$|The {{impedance}} matching ear {{had to meet}} certain conditions to work. The stapes had to be perpendicular to the tympanum, small and light enough to reduce its inertia, and suspended in an air-filled cavity. In modern species that are sensitive to over 1 kHz frequencies, the <b>footplate</b> <b>of</b> the stapes is 1/20th {{the area of the}} tympanum. However, in early amphibians the stapes was too large, making the footplate area oversized, preventing the hearing of high frequencies. So it appears they could only hear high intensity, low frequency soundsâ€”and the stapes more probably just supported the brain case against the cheek.|$|R
