25|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} {{of what happened}} subsequently, including the story that Clarence hid her in a London cookshop, disguised as a servant, so that his brother would not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> Gloucester {{is said to have}} tracked her down and escorted her to sanctuary at the Church of St Martin le Grand. In order to win the final consent of his brother George to the marriage, Richard of Gloucester renounced most of Warwick’s land and property, including the earldoms of Warwick (which the earl had held in his wife’s right) and Salisbury and surrendered to Clarence the office of Great Chamberlain of England.|$|E
25|$|Derace Kingsley, {{a wealthy}} businessman, hires Marlowe {{to find his}} estranged wife, Crystal. Although {{separated}} from his wife, Kingsley fears that Crystal— rich, pretty, spoiled and reckless—may have become involved in a scandal that could jeopardise his position with the shareholders of the company {{of which he is}} an executive. The last definite place Crystal was known to have been was their vacation cabin on Little Fawn Lake. Kingsley had received a telegram from Crystal about two weeks before (dateline El Paso, Texas) stating that she was divorcing him and marrying her gigolo boyfriend, Chris Lavery. But when Kingsley ran into Lavery in L.A. and asked him where Crystal was, Lavery told him that he hadn't seen her, wasn't with her in El Paso, didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> and never agreed, or wanted, to marry her.|$|E

Jandali states that after {{finishing}} his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him (they divorced in 1962). He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Mona for a period of time: I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida. A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name thus became Mona Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.|$|E
