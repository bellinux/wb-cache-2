25|$|The {{flagship}} {{event of}} the foundation is the invitation-only annual meeting held during the winter {{at the end of}} January in Davos, Switzerland, bringing together chief executive officers from its 1,000 member companies, as well as selected politicians, representatives from academia, NGOs, religious leaders, and the media in an alpine winter environment. The town is small enough to allow participants to meet anywhere outside the sessions and allows them the greatest opportunities to attend receptions organized by companies and countries. The participants are also taking part in role playing events, such as the Investment <b>Heat</b> <b>Map.</b> Informal winter meetings may have led to as many ideas and solutions as the official sessions. Approximately 2,200 participants gather for the five-day event and attend some of the 220 sessions in the official programme. The winter discussions focus around key issues of global concern (such as the globalization, capital markets, wealth management, international conflicts, environmental problems and their possible solutions).|$|E

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>maps</b> and {{clustering}} {{are used}} frequently in expression analysis studies for data visualization and quality control. Simple clustering and <b>heat</b> <b>maps</b> {{can be produced}} from the “heatmap” function in R. However, the “heatmap” function lacks certain functionalities and customizability, preventing it from generating advanced <b>heat</b> <b>maps</b> and dendrograms. To tackle {{the limitations of the}} “heatmap” function, we have developed an R package “heatmap 3 ” which significantly improves the original “heatmap” function by adding several more powerful and convenient features. The “heatmap 3 ” package allows users to produce highly customizable state of the art <b>heat</b> <b>maps</b> and dendrograms. The “heatmap 3 ” package is developed based on the “heatmap” function in R, and it is completely compatible with it. The new features of “heatmap 3 ” include highly customizable legends and side annotation, a wider range of color selections, new labeling features which allow users to define multiple layers of phenotype variables, and automatically conducted association tests based on the phenotypes provided. Additional features such as different agglomeration methods for estimating distance between two samples are also added for clustering...|$|R

Scorecarding and <b>heat</b> <b>mapping</b> assessment tools operationalize the mental model. Participants in an executive agribusiness educational workshop applied this mental model and the assessment tools to one of three hypothetical seed companies.

40|$|To {{determine}} if specific coronoid fractures relate to specific overall traumatic elbow instability injury patterns and to depict any relationship on fracture <b>maps</b> and <b>heat</b> <b>maps.</b> We collected 110 computed tomography (CT) studies from patients with coronoid fractures. Fracture types and pattern of injury were characterized based on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs, 2 - and 3 -dimensional CT scans, and intraoperative findings {{as described in}} operative reports. Using quantitative 3 -dimensional CT techniques {{we were able to}} reconstruct the coronoid and reduce fracture fragments. Based on these reconstructions, fracture lines were identified and graphically superimposed onto a standard template in order to create 2 -dimensional fracture maps. To further emphasize the fracture maps, the initial diagrams were converted into fracture <b>heat</b> <b>maps</b> following arbitrary units of measure. The Fisher exact test was used to evaluate the association between coronoid fracture types and elbow fracture-dislocation patterns. Forty-seven coronoid fractures were associated with a terrible triad fracture dislocation, 30 with a varus posteromedial rotational injury, 1 with a anterior olecranon fracture dislocation, 22 with a posterior olecranon fracture dislocation, and 7 with a posterior Monteggia injury associated with terrible triad fracture dislocation of the elbow. The association between coronoid fracture types and elbow fracture-dislocation patterns, as shown on 2 -dimensional fracture and <b>heat</b> <b>maps,</b> was strongly significant. Our fracture <b>maps</b> and <b>heat</b> <b>maps</b> support the observation that specific patterns of traumatic elbow instability have correspondingly specific coronoid fracture patterns. Knowledge of these patterns is useful for planning management because it directs exposure and fixation and helps identify associated ligament injuries and fractures that might benefit from treatment. Two-dimensional fracture and <b>heat</b> <b>mapping</b> techniques may help surgeons to predict the distribution of coronoid fracture lines associated with specific injury pattern...|$|R
