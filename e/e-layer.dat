Sporadic E propagation makes VHF-operating radio amateurs very excited, as propagation paths that are generally unreachable can open up.

Sporadic-E at mid-latitudes occurs mostly during summer season, from May to August in the northern hemisphere and from November to February in the southern hemisphere. There is no single cause for this mysterious propagation mode. The reflection takes place in a thin sheet of ionisation around 90km height. The ionisation patches drift westwards at speeds of few hundred km per hour. There is a weak periodicity noted during the season and typically Es is observed on 1 to 3 successive days and remains absent for a few days to reoccur again. Es do not occur during small hours; the events usually begin at dawn, and there is a peak in the afternoon and a second peak in the evening. Es propagation is usually gone by local midnight.|$|E

2500|$|Skywave propagation, also {{referred}} to as skip, is any of the modes that rely on reflection (actually refraction) of radio waves from the ionosphere. [...] The ionosphere is [...] a region of the atmosphere from about 60km (37mi) to 500km (310mi) that contains layers of charged particles (ions) which can refract a radio wave back toward the Earth. [...] A radio wave directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth beyond the horizon by these layers, allowing long distance radio transmission. The F2 layer is the most important ionospheric layer for long-distance, multiple-hop HF propagation, though F1, E, and D-layers also play significant roles. The D-layer, when present during sunlight periods, causes significant amount of signal loss, as does the <b>E-layer</b> whose maximum usable frequency can rise to 4MHz and above and thus block higher frequency signals from reaching the F2-layer. The layers, or more appropriately [...] "regions", are directly affected by the sun on a daily diurnal cycle, a seasonal cycle and the 11-year sunspot cycle and determine the utility of these modes. During solar maxima, or sunspot highs and peaks, the whole HF range up to 30MHz can be used usually around the clock and F2 propagation up to 50MHz is observed frequently depending upon daily solar flux 10.7cm radiation values. During solar minima, or minimum sunspot counts down to zero, propagation of frequencies above 15MHz is generally unavailable.|$|E

40|$|The {{physics of}} the {{unstable}} E-region plasma {{is based on the}} modified two stream, or Farley-Buneman, and the gradient drift instabilities. The theory combines both mechanisms into a single dispersion relation which applies for the directly generated short-scale plasma waves, known as type&nbsp; 1 irregularities. In the absence of a plasma gradient it is only the two stream mechanism acting which favors wave excitation if E&times;B electron drifts relative to the ions exceed a threshold slightly above the ion acoustic speed. On the other hand, the theory also predicts that a destabilizing (stabilizing) electron density gradient acts to decrease (increase) the ion acoustic threshold, and hence the wave phase velocities at threshold, depending on the gradient strength and the wavelength. Given a destabilizing plasma gradient, the threshold reduction is larger at longer than shorter wavelengths and thus the best way to test the gradient role is by simultaneous observations of type&nbsp; 1 waves at two or more radio backscatter frequencies. The present paper relies on dual frequency backscatter observations of 1. 1 m and 3. 1 m type&nbsp; 1 irregularities made simultaneously at 144 MHz and 50 MHz, respectively, in mid-latitude sporadic <b>E-layers.</b> Using as typical plasma gradient scale lengths for destabilized sporadic <b>E-layers</b> those that are obtained from rocket electron density profiles, the radar observations are compared with the predictions of kinetic theory. The results suggest that the plasma density gradient effect on meter scale Farley-Buneman waves is not important. This is reinforced further by the analysis of backscatter from destabilized meteor trail plasma when very steep gradients are expected in electron density. The present findings, and more from past studies, question the electron density gradient role in the generation of short-scale plasma waves as predicted by the linear instability theory.

40|$|Recently, Shalimov et al. (1999) {{proposed}} a new mechanism for large-scale accumulation of long-lived metallic ions in the mid-latitude ionosphere driven by planetary {{waves in the}} lower thermosphere. In this mechanism, the combined action of frictional and horizontal magnetic field forces at E-region altitudes causes the plasma to converge and accumulate in large areas of positive neutral wind vorticity within a propagating planetary wave. The present paper provides a theoretical formulation for this mechanism by modelling both horizontal and vertical plasma transport effects within a planetary wave vortex, of cyclonic neutral wind. Non-steady-state numerical solutions of the ion continuity equation show that the {{proposed a}}ccumulation process can enhance the ionization significantly inside the planetary wave vortex but its efficiency depends strongly on altitude, whereas on the other hand, it can be complicated by vertical plasma motions. The latter, which are driven by the same planetary wave wind field under {{the action of the}} vertical Lorentz force and meridional wind forcing along the magnetic field lines, can lead to either plasma compressions or depletions, depending on the prevailing wind direction. We conclude that, for shorter times, vertical plasma transport may act constructively to the horizontal gathering process to produce considerable E-region plasma accumulation over large sectors of a planetary wave vortex of cyclonic winds.

40|$|High-frequency {{variability}} of the ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) can strongly affect precise positioning with GNSS. The occurrence rate {{as well as}} the amplitude of such disturbances has been extensively studied over the last decade. Mainly, one can distinguish disturbances due to space-weather events and the others, qualified as “quiet-time” as they are observed during quiet geomagnetic conditions. The latter, which represent more than 75 % {{of the total number of}} disturbances over mid-latitudes, are then divided into two categories: the Winter Daytime (WD) and the Summer Nighttime (SN). The first category, representing the bulk of quiet-time disturbances, corresponds to classical Medium-Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs), that are the result of the interaction of gravity waves and the ionospheric plasma. On the other hand, SN disturbances are generally understood as non-classical MSTIDs of electrical origin. The paper investigates the origin of these two types of disturbance based on GPS measurements, ionospheric soundings and wind speed data at a tropospheric level. If one cannot exclude the solar terminator as a potential source of gravity waves responsible for WD events, it is thought that the major contribution comes from the lower atmosphere. More precisely, tropospheric jetstream is considered as the favorite candidate for daytime MSTIDs. Turning to SN disturbances, our analysis reveals that they are related to spread-F phenomenon, linked to the appearance of sporadic <b>E-layers.</b> The related instabilities are responsible for field-aligned irregularities in the F-region, which are thought to be responsible for noise-like fluctuations of the GPS TEC observed during SN events.
