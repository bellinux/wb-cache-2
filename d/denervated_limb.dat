The limb regeneration {{could only have been}} initiated by nerve fibers of contralateral origin. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to describe histologically the manner in which nerve fibers of contralateral origin regenerate through the junction of fused limbs into the opposite limb. The first sign of nerve regeneration into the opposite limb was observed at eight days post fusion. The nerves crossed over into the opposite, originally <b>denervated</b> <b>limb</b> in a highly dispersed manner. These nerve fibers eventually aggregated, however, either under the skin or within persisting nerve trunks. By 19 days post fusion the nerve fibers had reached the elbow region of the originally <b>denervated</b> <b>limb</b> and by 25 days they were seen at the most proximal extent of the limb. The diameters of the axons seemed smaller than the diameters of regenerating axons observed in non-fused newt forelimbs...|$|E

Histo-chemically, innervated regenerates developed a heterogeneous pattern of muscle fiber type staining during the second month, whereas different histo-chemical types of muscle fibers did not appear in noninnervated regenerates.

Carraro U, Dalla Libera L, Catani C. Abstract We examined myosin of fast and slow skeletal rat muscles regenerating after ischemia and bupivacaine injection in <b>denervated</b> <b>limbs.</b> Four days after injury two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed {{the presence of the}} embryonic light chain in the myosin isolated from the portion of muscle showing a homogeneous population of new small fibers by histological examination.

40|$|Peripheral nerve {{interactions}} and regenerative phenomena were studied in newt forelimbs fused end to end. After simple fusion, {{one or two}} spikelike structures regenerated at the plane of fusion in 88 % of the cases. When one of the limbs was denervated {{at the time of}} fusion, no regeneration occurred from the plane of fusion. If the limbs were fused and one was amputated at the shoulder more than 10 days after fusion, regeneration from the amputation surface did not occur. When the limbs were reamputated 30 days later, regeneration of left limbs from the proximodistally reversed right limb stumps followed. If one of the limbs was denervated at the time of fusion, and amputation was subsequently carried out through the formerly <b>denervated</b> <b>limb,</b> regeneration always took place after the first amputation. On the basis of these results it is postulated that when regenerating nerves of opposite proximodistal polarity meet head-on, the majority of fibers, at least, do not grow into territories occupied by the other nerve. These results have also demonstrated that full limb regeneration can occur at a greater distance from the midline than the end of a normal limb. These experiments also provide a technique for artificially elongating peripheral nerves...|$|E

It is unclear, however, whether insulin stimulates muscle blood flow (and NO release) by a direct {{action at the}} vasculature and/or by stimulating neural vasodilator mechanisms. In these studies we used patients with regional sympathectomy to examine the vascular actions of insulin in the presence and absence of sympathetic vasoconstrictor and vasodilator innervation. A 2 -hour insulin (6 pmol/kg per minute) /glucose clamp increased muscle blood flow in both innervated and denervated limbs by roughly 40 % (P< 0. 01 versus baseline for both limbs). The vasodilation reached its maximum within the first 30 to 45 minutes of insulin/glucose infusion in sympathetically denervated limbs, but {{only at the end}} of the infusion in innervated limbs (P< 0. 01, denervated versus innervated limb). Infusion of a NO synthase inhibitor (N(G) -monomethyl-L-arginine [L-NMMA]) increased baseline arterial pressure, abolished the vasodilation in the <b>denervated</b> <b>limb,</b> and led to a significant additional increase in arterial pressure during the clamp, but did not alter whole body glucose uptake. Our data indicate that insulin stimulates blood flow in sympathectomized limbs by a direct action at the vasculature. This effect is mediated by stimulation of NO release and appears to be masked by the sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone in innervated limbs...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Nitric oxide exerts its {{cardiovascular}} actions {{at least}} in part by modulation of the sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. There is increasing evidence that nitric oxide inhibits central neural sympathetic outflow, and preliminary evidence suggests that it may also modulate peripheral sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. Methods: To test this latter concept, in six subjects having undergone thoracic sympathectomy for hyperhydrosis, we compared the vascular responses to systemic l-NMMA infusion (1 mg/kg/min over 10 min) in the innervated and the <b>denervated</b> <b>limb.</b> We also studied vascular responses to the infusion of the non-nitric-oxide-dependent vasoconstrictor phenylephrine. Results: l-NMMA infusion evoked a roughly 3 -fold larger increase in vascular resistance in the denervated forearm than in the innervated calf. In the denervated forearm, vascular resistance increased by 58 ± 10 percent (X±SE), whereas in the innervated calf it increased only by 21 ± 6 percent (P< 0. 01, forearm vs. calf). This augmented vasoconstrictor response was specific for l-NMMA, and not related to augmented non-specific vasoconstrictor responsiveness secondary to sympathectomy, because phenylephrine infusion increased vascular resistance similarly in the denervated forearm and the innervated calf (by 24 ± 7, and 29 ± 8 percent, respectively). The augmented vasoconstrictor response was related specifically to denervation, because in control subjects, the vasoconstrictor responses to l-NMMA were comparable in the forearm and the calf. Conclusions: These findings indicate that in the absence of sympathetic innervation, the vasoconstrictor responses to nitric oxide synthase inhibition are augmente...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} the neural tube in {{salamander}} embryos allows the development of nerve-free aneurogenic limbs. Limb regeneration is normally nerve-dependent, but the aneurogenic limb regenerates without nerves and becomes nerve-dependent after innervation. The molecular basis for these tissue interactions is unclear. Anterior Gradient (AG) protein, previously shown to rescue regeneration of <b>denervated</b> <b>limbs</b> and {{to act as a}} growth factor for cultured limb blastemal cells, is expressed throughout the larval limb epidermis and is down-regulated by innervation. In an aneurogenic limb, the level of AG protein remains high in the epidermis throughout development and regeneration, but decreases after innervation following transplantation to a normal host. Aneurogenic epidermis also shows a fivefold difference in secretory gland cells, which express AG protein. The persistently high expression of AG in the epithelial cells of an aneurogenic limb ensures that regeneration is independent of the nerve. These findings provide an explanation for this classical problem, and identify regulation of the epidermal niche by innervation as a distinctive developmental mechanism that initiates the nerve dependence of limb regeneration. The absence of this regulation during anuran limb development might suggest that it evolved in relation to limb regeneration...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{described here}} examine further {{the conditions under}} which paradoxical regeneration occurs and provide support for the hypothesis that a proximal migration of Schwann cells is responsible for the phenomenon. When only the hand is shielded from irradi-tion and the <b>limb</b> is <b>denervated,</b> amputation through the forearm or upper arm sometimes results in regeneration. The effects of variation in the time interval between denervation and amputation, the level of amputation and the method and number of denervations on the incidence of regeneration were investigated. The presence or absence of viable Schwann cells at the amputation plane was deduced from the remyelination of nerves under conditions which do or do not permit paradoxical regeneration. The nerves of totally irradiated and <b>denervated</b> <b>limbs</b> remain unmyelinated following regrowth of axons and such limbs do not regenerate after amputation. When only the hand was shielded from irradiation before the <b>limbs</b> were <b>denervated,</b> the new axons became completely remyelinated and some of these limbs regenerated when amputated.

Abstract To evaluate the effects of electrical stimulation on denervated muscles in spinal cord injured humans, the EU Project RISE was started in 2001. The aims of this project are: to design and build sufficient stimulators; to develop stimulation protocols by means of mathematical models, animal experiments, and practice in humans with denervated lower limbs; to develop examination methods and devices for evaluation of electrical stimulation training effects; and to acquire basic scientific knowledge on denervated and stimulated denervated muscle.

40|$|AbstractIn both larval {{and adult}} urodele amphibians, limb {{blastema}} formation requires {{the presence of}} an adequate nerve supply. In previous research, we demonstrated that the hindlimb of early Xenopus laevis larvae formed a regeneration blastema even when denervated, while the <b>denervated</b> <b>limb</b> of late larvae did not.

In this paper, we demonstrate that fgf- 2 mRNA is present in larval limb tissues and that its level is correlated to the extent of mesenchymal cells populating the limb: in early limbs, fgf- 2 mRNA is present at high levels all over the limb, while, in late limbs, the fgf- 2 expression is low and detectable only in the distal autopodium. After denervation, fgf- 2 mRNA synthesis increases in amputated early limbs but not in amputated late limbs. The implantation of anti-FGF- 2 beads into amputated early limbs hardly lowers the mitotic activity of blastema cells. However, FGF- 2 beads implanted into the blastema of late limbs prevent the denervation-induced inhibition of mitosis and oppose blastema regression. Our data indicate that FGF- 2 is a good candidate for the endogenous mitogenic factor responsible for blastema formation and growth in amputated and denervated early limbs.

40|$|Summary Salamander limb {{regeneration}} {{is dependent}} upon tissue interactions that are local to the amputation site. Communication among limb epidermis, peripheral nerves, and mesenchyme coordinate cell migration, cell proliferation, and tissue patterning to generate a blastema, which will form missing limb structures. An outstanding question is how cross-talk between these tissues {{gives rise to the}} regeneration blastema. To identify genes associated with epidermis-nerve-mesenchymal interactions during limb regeneration, we examined histological and transcriptional changes during the first week following injury in the wound epidermis and subjacent cells between three injury types; 1) a flank wound {{on the side of the}} animal that will not regenerate a limb, 2) a <b>denervated</b> <b>limb</b> that will not regenerate a limb, and 3) an innervated limb that will regenerate a limb. Early, histological and transcriptional changes were similar between the injury types, presumably because a common wound-healing program is employed across anatomical locations. However, some transcripts were enriched in limbs compared to the flank and are associated with vertebrate limb development. Many of these genes were activated before blastema outgrowth and expressed in specific tissue types including the epidermis, peripheral nerve, and mesenchyme. We also identified a relatively small group of transcripts that were more highly expressed in innervated limbs versus denervated limbs. These transcripts encode for proteins involved in myelination of peripheral nerves, epidermal cell function, and proliferation of mesenchymal cells. Overall, our study identifies limb-specific and nerve-dependent genes that are upstream of regenerative growth, and thus promising candidates for the regulation of blastema formation...|$|E

The original axons and muscle fibers, including soleplates, degenerated during the first few days, but Schwann cells and basal laminae persisted. Myofibers regenerated within the original basal laminae. Indentations of the sarcolemma, termed “presumptive synaptic clefts” (PSC), wer found on myotubes from 7 -day grafts. Schwann cells and residual acetylcholinesterase were invariably associated with the PSC, suggesting that the PSC developed {{at the site of the}} original soleplate. Nerves entered the grafts 10 days postoperatively and contacted the PSC of the regenerating muscle fibers on the 18 – 20 th day. The secondary synaptic clefts of these “reconstructed” soleplates extended far beyond the subaxonal region. A second type of soleplate appeared on the 18 – 20 th day. These soleplates were similar to those found in embryonic muscle and were considered to have been induced to form “de novo” by the presence of the nerves. When grafts were placed in permanently <b>denervated</b> <b>limbs</b> the “reconstructed” soleplates appeared, but the “de novo” type did not.

40|$|It {{is known}} that nerves are {{particularly}} critical during the early or dedifferentiative phase of limb regeneration. During this period in the innervated limb, cells just proximal to the amputation surface dedifferentiate, migrate to the limb tip, and undergo mitosis. These processes {{give rise to a}} population of undifferentiated mesenchymatous cells capable of redifferentiating into the missing components of the newly forming regenerate. The consequences of denervation stand {{in stark contrast to the}} normal events occurring in the innervated limb, because neither a blastema nor a regenerate forms. Results from this study indicate that during the early portion of the dedifferentiative phase in regenerates less than 2 3 / 4, days old the nerve apparently has little or no effect on the internal stump tissues. Of considerable interest in this regard is this study 2 ̆ 7 s documentation of a lack of neural influence on DNA synthesis and thus the cell cycle during the early dedifferentiative phase. Subsequently, during a transition period represented by 2 3 / 4 to 5 1 / 2 days regenerates there is some evidence for a neural influence on DNA synthesis in cells of the limb stump. Finally, on days 6 through 8, DNA synthesis is clearly nerve dependent. Since DNA synthesis is a prerequisite for mitosis, the depressed synthesis in a <b>denervated</b> <b>limb</b> precludes mitotic activity during the nerve-dependent, later portion of the dedifferentiative phase. Therefore, this research supports the idea that during the late dedifferentiative phase, including mound and early cone blastemal stages, there is a neural influence on the G 1 or S phases of the cell cycle. This conclusion thereby makes progress toward explaining earlier observations of depressed mitotic activity during this period...|$|E

Cachexia, experienced by most cancer patients, is a negative prognostic factor, interfering with therapy and worsening quality of life. With the aim to delineate the pathways involved in exercise-mediated rescue of cachexia, we investigated the effects of spontaneous physical activity (wheel running) in colon carcinoma (C 26) -bearing mice. All major diagnostic criteria for cachexia are reversed by exercise, including rescue of body weight, muscle atrophy and fatigue, ultimately leading to increased survival. In order to assess whether muscle contraction {{plays a role in}} the exercise-mediated rescue of cachexia, we <b>denervated</b> one <b>limb</b> of (C 26) -bearing mice and assessed muscle mass following spontaneous wheel running. Interestingly, exercise exerts positive effects on (C 26) -bearing mice muscle mass independently from denervation, suggesting cross-education induced by exercise on the denervated muscle. At the molecular level, exercise promotes protein synthesis, by mTOR activation, and attenuates protein degradation, by downregulating Atrogin 1, in muscle from C 26 -bearing mice. Despite muscle damage in cachexia, satellite cells fail to fuse into muscle fibers, due to defective down-regulation of Pax 7 expression. We showed that exercise rescues proper Pax 7 expression levels in cachexia, which in turn may release the block of satellite celi differentiation. We propose that exercise counteracts muscle wasting through a systemic effect, by both inhibiting catabolic pathways and favouring satellite celi recruitment into muscle fibers, unveiling a novel mechanism of exercise-mediated beneficiai effects on cachexia...|$|R
