5|$|In the 18th century, the Holy Roman Empire {{consisted}} of approximately 1,800 territories. The elaborate legal system initiated {{by a series}} of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1450–1555) created the Imperial Estates and provided for considerable local autonomy among ecclesiastical, secular, and hereditary states, reflected in Imperial Diet. The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Having no male heirs, he had convinced the Electors to retain Habsburg hegemony {{in the office of the}} emperor by agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction.

From 1740, the dualism between the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated the German history.|$|E
