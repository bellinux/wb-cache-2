25|$|The Monospar ST-25 was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a fabric-covered metal structure. The monospar {{name came}} {{from the use of}} a single spar in the wing structure, that had been developed by H J Stieger. The cabin was enclosed with five seats. It was based on the GAL Monospar ST-10, {{with the addition of a}} <b>folding</b> <b>seat</b> for a fifth passenger, extra side windows, and the addition of a radio receiver. On 19 June 1935, the prototype (G-ADIV) made its first flight at Hanworth Air Park. It was designated Monospar ST-25 Jubilee, to honour the 25th anniversary of the reign of King George V.|$|E
25|$|The Scion was {{developed}} as a light transport for 5–6 passengers. The first flight of the prototype aircraft (G-ACJI) took place on 18 August 1933, piloted by Shorts' Chief Test Pilot John Lankester Parker. The first production aircraft (G-ACUV) was flown at the SBAC's airshow at Hendon in 1934. In 1935 the fifth production model was built as the revised model Scion II; the major improvement was the repositioning of the two engines as noted above; other changes included the provision of 6 passenger seats as standard (on the original Scion there was a <b>folding</b> <b>seat</b> for a sixth passenger if needed), an improved windscreen and better cabin windows. During {{the production of the}} Scions the company had opened a new factory at Rochester Airport and all Scion IIs were manufactured there, initially by Shorts, later by Pobjoy, first under licence and later under Shorts' ownership.|$|E
2500|$|The 1960 Corvair 569 [...] and 769 series four-door sedans were {{conceived}} as economy cars offering few amenities {{to keep the}} price competitive, with the 500 (standard model) selling for under $2,000. Powered by the Turbo Air 6 engine [...] and three-speed manual or optional extra cost two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, the Corvair was designed to have comparable acceleration to the six-cylinder full-size Chevrolet Biscayne. The Corvair's unique design included the [...] "Quadri-Flex" [...] independent suspension and [...] "Unipack Power Team" [...] of engine, transmission and rear axle combined into a single unit. Similar to designs of European cars such as Porsche, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and others, [...] "Quadri-Flex" [...] used coil springs at all four wheels with independent rear suspension arms incorporated at the rear. [...] Specially designed 6.5 in by 13 in. 4-ply tires mounted on 13inch wheels with 5.5 in. width were standard equipment. [...] Available options included RPO 360, the Powerglide two-speed automatic transmission ($146), RPO 118, a Gasoline Heater ($74), RPO 119, an AM tube radio ($54), and by February 1960 the rear <b>folding</b> <b>seat</b> (formerly $32) was standard. Chevrolet produced 47,683 of the 569 model and 139,208 769 model deluxe sedans in 1960.|$|E
25|$|Standard seating in a Class 86 unit is for 70 {{people in}} five-abreast seating plus six people in <b>folding</b> <b>seats.</b> As {{the class was}} {{gradually}} renovated and rebuilt, a new lettering scheme was introduced, where the letter indicated the unit's seating configuration. 86F had reversible backs, 86G had adjustable seating, while 86 K, L and M had fixed seats with high backs. The G-series had only 49 regular plus six <b>folding</b> <b>seats.</b> In the 1980s, the trains remaining in service were renovated and became the M-series. These had 60 regular and six <b>folding</b> <b>seats</b> with fixed backs. Class 91 had only four-abreast seating with a capacity for 64 regular and 6 <b>folding</b> <b>seats,</b> and was made for longer journeys.|$|R
50|$|The J40 Series also {{featured}} <b>folding</b> jump <b>seats</b> behind the passenger and drivers <b>seats.</b> These <b>folding</b> <b>seats</b> {{not only made}} carrying another 2 passengers possible, but also allowed for maximum cargo space, {{as opposed to the}} <b>folding</b> rear <b>seat</b> in the Jeep CJ series.|$|R

50|$|The M10 and M10A1 had {{a crew of}} five; commander, gunner, loader, driver, and {{assistant}} driver. The driver {{and assistant}} driver (who also operated the vehicle's radio) were seated in the front hull and provided with periscopes. The unique design of the hull hatches to clear the gun mantlet meant that the driver's view directly {{to the left side}} was obstructed. He was provided with a second periscope {{at the edge of the}} hull for this purpose. The commander, gunner, and loader were all located in the turret. The commander sat on a <b>folding</b> <b>seat</b> at the right rear. The gunner, on the left side of the gun, normally stood to operate it, but he was also provided with a <b>folding</b> <b>seat.</b> The loader normally stood in the area behind the gun. A third <b>folding</b> <b>seat</b> was provided in the turret for the assistant driver in case he needed to assist the loader for any reason.|$|E

The seats use a cantilever structure, i.e. attached to the walls, and in each car there is one <b>folding</b> <b>seat.</b> The straps are 1,630 mm from the floor.|$|E
50|$|The {{model is}} unusual in that the driving cab could double as {{passenger}} accommodation. A door existed which, when opened, allowed access to the control panel. A <b>folding</b> <b>seat</b> {{was attached to the}} side of the door, allowing for the conductor to be seated. When the door was closed, it hid the control panel allowing for additional space for passengers.|$|E

50|$|The pilot sat {{in an open}} {{cockpit forward}} of the wing for optimum {{visibility}} during deck landings and behind him in an enclosed, windowed cabin were the navigator and wireless operator, who could access an open gunner's position further aft.
