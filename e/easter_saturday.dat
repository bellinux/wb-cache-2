This is celebrated by eating a special pastry called semla. Lent is honoured by a minority of Swedes. The annual première of semla-eating has crept {{all the way to}} early January.|$|E
25|$|Mauros {{intended}} to organize an uprising in Thessaloniki on <b>Easter</b> <b>Saturday,</b> {{the night before}} Easter, relying {{on the lack of}} preparedness among the city's defenders. However, his plan had perhaps been revealed to the Byzantines: the Byzantine navy and its chief admiral Sisinnios arrived in the city, preventing Mauros from undertaking any military activity. When the navy anchored in Thessaloniki, Mauros appeared to fall ill and spent a long time in bed under the surveillance of Sisinnios. While the allegations against Mauros were never proven, he was nonetheless dispatched outside the city along with Sisinnios' men, hoping to attract new refugees from Kuber and the local Slavs.|$|E
25|$|At the RAS Showground at Moore Park, {{the largest}} single event of the Show was the Grand Parade on <b>Easter</b> <b>Saturday</b> when {{hundreds}} of beasts representing the various classes of livestock were paraded {{in a series of}} concentric circles. To the public eye, this spectacular sight, which involved creatures ranging from newborn lambs and Shetland ponies to Brahman bulls and Clydesdale stallions, was staged with such skill that it invariably took place without a hitch. However, on one memorable occasion a steer broke loose and plunged into the quarters of the Royal Agricultural Society. The Grand Parade continues to take place, though on a somewhat smaller scale, at the Sydney Showground Stadium.|$|E

25|$|For Silverstone's first Grand Prix of the 21st Century, the FIA {{decreed that}} the race should be moved to April, and the event took place over Easter, with the GP itself run on Easter Sunday. In {{hindsight}} this was a poor decision by the FIA, who failed {{to take into account}} the unpredictable weather in Britain at this time of year. It rained almost continually for the best part of three weeks before the event and most of Good Friday; by <b>Easter</b> <b>Saturday</b> the car parks had virtually collapsed and were completely closed. Although most of the race day itself was fine, the damage was done and many thousands of spectators were unable to get to Silverstone to witness David Coulthard win his second straight victory in the event, from his McLaren teammate Mika Häkkinen, with Michael Schumacher third for Ferrari.|$|E

2500|$|The Easter Rising {{lasted from}} Easter Monday 24 April 1916 to <b>Easter</b> <b>Saturday</b> 29 April 1916. Annual commemorations, {{rather than taking}} place on 24–29 April, are {{typically}} based on the date of Easter, which is a moveable feast. For example, the annual military parade is on Easter Sunday; the date of coming into force of [...] the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 was symbolically chosen as Easter Monday (18 April) 1949. The official programme of centenary events in 2016 climaxed from 25 March (Good Friday) to 2 April (<b>Easter</b> <b>Saturday)</b> with other events earlier {{and later in the}} year taking place on the calendrical anniversaries.|$|E

[...] Made good time on the first 14 ‘portage free’ miles and were on schedule {{when they arrived at}} Froxfield Lock 3hrs into the race. [...] At this point they were told by their support crew that the race organisers had decided to abandon the event following a safety incident at Old Windsor weir the previous night. [...] The support crew explained that while they could not keep racing officially, but they were happy to carry on if the crew were, the watches were still running and they felt that we could still get the challenge record. [...] Having prepared solely for this race for 4 months Capps/Baker made the decision to go for it, removing the number from the boat and informed the DW organisation we were no longer in any way their responsibility and got back on the water.|$|E

6000|$|On <b>Easter</b> <b>Saturday</b> Harvey Bope {{unpacked}} a large, promising-looking red {{cardboard box}} under the expectant {{eyes of his}} nephews. “Your uncle has brought you the newest thing in toys,” Eleanor had said impressively, and youthful anticipation had been anxiously divided between Albanian soldiery and a Somali camel-corps. Eric was hotly in favour of the latter contingency. “There would be Arabs on horseback,” he whispered; “the Albanians have got jolly uniforms, and they fight all day long, and all night, too, when there’s a moon, but the country’s rocky, so they’ve got no cavalry.” ...|$|E
60|$|On <b>Easter</b> <b>Saturday</b> the roadsides and copses by {{the little}} river Nadder {{were full of}} {{children}} gathering primroses; they might have filled a thousand baskets without the flowers being missed, so abundant were they in that place. Cold though it was the whole air was laden with the delicious fragrance. It was pleasant to see and talk with the little people occupied with the task they loved so well, and I {{made up my mind}} to see the result of all this flower-gathering next day in some of the village churches in the neighbourhood--Fovant, Teffant Evias, Chilmark, Swallowcliffe, Tisbury, and Fonthill Bishop. I had counted on some improvement in the weather--some bright sunshine to light up the flower-decorated interiors; but Easter Sunday proved colder than ever, with the bitter north-east still blowing, the grey travelling cloud still covering the sky; and so to get the full benefit of the bitterness I went instead to spend my day {{on the top of the}} biggest down above the valley. That was Whitesheet Hill, and forms the highest part of the long ridge dividing the valleys of the Ebble and Nadder.|$|E
60|$|Five or {{six times}} Bertram had {{attempted}} {{to get into the}} Tabernacle of the Holy Sepulchre; but so great had been the rush of pilgrims, that he had hitherto failed. At last his dragoman espied a lull, and went again to the battle. To get into the little outside chapel, which forms, as it were, a vestibule to the cell of the sepulchre, and from which on <b>Easter</b> <b>Saturday</b> issue the miraculous flames, was a thing to be achieved by moderate patience. His close contiguity to Candiotes and Copts, to Armenians and Abyssinians was not agreeable to our hero, for the contiguity was very close, and Christians of these nations are not very cleanly. But this was nothing to the task of entering the sanctum sanctorum. To this there is but one aperture, and that is but four feet high; men entering it go in head foremost, and those retreating come out in the other direction; and as it is impossible that two should pass, and as two or three are always trying to come out, and ten or twelve equally anxious to get in, the struggle to an Englishman is disagreeably warm, though to an Oriental it is probably matter of interesting excitement.|$|E

2500|$|In the Tridentine Calendar, {{there were}} {{initially}} seventeen vigils (excluding The Vigil of <b>Easter</b> on Holy <b>Saturday</b> morning), divided into [...] "major vigils" [...] and [...] "minor" [...] or [...] "common vigils". Christmas, the Epiphany and Pentecost comprised the major vigils. The common vigils included the Ascension of Our Lord, Saint John the Baptist, the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and All Saints. Most feasts of the Apostles also had vigils, namely Saints Andrew, Thomas, James, Simon and Jude. Whilst the vigils of the Immaculate Conception, Saints Peter and Paul, Saint Lawrence, Saint Bartholomew and Saint Matthew remained, they soon {{came to be}} impeded by higher-ranking feasts added to the calendar, and they were instead commemorated as part of other masses rather than observed in their own right. The Vigil of St. Matthias was unique, {{in that it was}} normally commemorated on 23 February, the feast of St. Peter Damian, but in leap years was kept on 24 February, the leap day of the Roman calendar.|$|R
40|$|View of a {{military}} ceremony in a large courtyard surrounded by barracks. Soldiers are lined up in the right half of the yard in approximately ten rows, headed by officers, all standing to attention. Three religious leaders are positioned in front of them, each standing behind a table covered with a white cloth, and two with other utensils. The one nearest to the camera is an Islamic imam. He is holding a book in both hands {{and seems to be}} reading aloud. To his left, a Roman Catholic priest is waiting solemnly, his hands folded in front of him. The table before him features, among a few smaller items, two candles on tall candlesticks. At some distance {{on the opposite side of}} the yard, two bearded Orthodox priests stand very close to their table, which bears a richly decorated slava candle, a large item (probably the 'slava' cake) and a head covering. A second head covering is deposited on the ground under the table. The scene is being watched by various spectators, mostly officers, while a small group of women and children can also be discerned in the background. The yard is richly decorated for the occasion with garlands and colourful kelim rugs. The 'Knez Mihailo' Second Infantry Division of the Royal Serbian Army lost half of its fighters during the wars of 1912 to 1918. After its reformation as part of the Royal Yugoslav Army, it was given the honorary name 'Gvozdeni puk' (steel division) for its bravery and sacrifice during the Great War. The division’s commemoration day slava continued to be held on 19 April, the anniversary of the withdrawal of Ottoman forces in 1868, celebrated as 'Predaja gradova' (surrender of the fortresses). On this day, the Ottoman garrisons left the then Princedom of Serbia for good, symbolically handing over the keys of all fortresses on its territory to Serbian Prince Mihailo Obrenović, after whom the division was named. Serbia remained under formal Ottoman suzerainty until 1878 and was elevated to a kingdom in 1882. — The photograph was published in the newspaper Vreme on 26 April 1930, a day after the ceremony took place that year. It had been postponed for a few days due to <b>Easter,</b> with Holy <b>Saturday</b> falling on 19 April 1930. – The original glass plate is partially damaged...|$|R
