30|$|In {{the last}} two decades, the {{detection}} of Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in cervical samples {{has proven to be}} a good diagnostic and risk predictor tool for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer (Castle et al. 2011). Some studies suggest that HPV oncogenes E 6 and E 7 mRNA levels in the uterine cervix may be more <b>specific</b> <b>early</b> <b>indicators</b> of predisposition to carcinogenesis than DNA levels (Benevolo et al. 2011; Ratnam et al. 2011; Winer et al. 2009). This may be due to the fact that the oncogenic potential of the high-risk HPV types (hr-HPV) relies on the actions of oncoproteins coded by E 6 /E 7, which bind to and modulate different gene products, in particular tumor suppressors p 53 and pRb (Halfon et al. 2010; Kraus et al. 2006). These interactions can lead to cell cycle control disturbances, and defective DNA repair, causing genomic instability and increased risk of malignant transformation (Cattani et al. 2009; Münger & Howley 2002).|$|R
40|$|Objetivo. Determinar el valor pronóstico de la proteína C reactiva (PCR) en pacientes ingresados en una unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI). Diseño. Cohorte retrospectiva. Pacientes. Se estudió a 879 pacientes ingresados en la UCI por cualquier causa durante 2 años y que permanecieron {{al menos}} 24 horas. Método. Se determinó la concentración de PCR al ingreso y se calculó {{a su vez}} la puntuación APACHE II a las 24 horas. Los valores de PCR fueron correlacionados con la puntuación APACHE II junto con otras {{variables}} (sexo, edad, enfermedad de ingreso, días de ingreso). Resultados. Las concentraciones de PCR más altas se obtuvieron de los sujetos que ingresaron por enfermedad infecciosa o shock séptico-fallo multiorgánico. Los pacientes con valores de PCR 10 mg/dl tenían un promedio de edad y puntuación APACHE II mayores, permanecieron internados por más tiempo y la mortalidad fue más elevada (p Objective. To determine C-reactive protein (CRP) prognostic value and in patients admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU). Design. Retrospective cohort study. Patients. A total of 879 patients admitted to the ICU for any cause over a 2 -year period and who were hospitalized at least for 24 hours were studied. Method. CRP levels were determined on admission and the value of the APACHE II score at 24 hours. The CRP values were correlated with APACHE II score along with other variables (gender, age, disease at onset, length of stay). Results. The highest CRP levels were those from subjects admitted for an infectious disease or shock-sepsis-multiple organ failure. Patients with CRP values greater than 10 mg/dl were older, had higher APACHE II score, remained hospitalized for more time and the mortality rate was higher in this group (p < 0. 0001). CRP predictive value for mortality was higher as it increased in level with a specificity of 72. 3 % when these were over 10 mg/dl. Conclusions. CRP is an <b>early</b> and <b>specific</b> <b>indicator</b> of outcome, qualities that make it useful as a routine test of patients at admission to the ICU...|$|R

40|$|Total {{trade and}} foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) are important incentives to enhance the economic development. of emerging countries. This paper aims to investigate the effects of macroeconomic and country <b>specific</b> <b>indicators</b> on total trade and FDI inflows in 16 countries, in three groups of BRICS, ASEAN 5 and developed countries for the period from 1981 to 2012. The ordinary least square and cross-sectional econometric model of fixed effect panel data are applied to explore {{the extent to which}} these variables are related in individual countries and sets of countries as a panel, respectively. In addition, the outcomes of this study help policy makers in developed and developing countries to identify influential determinants of total trade and FDI in order to optimize policies to increase international trade as well as foreign investments, and benefit from higher employment rate and economic growth. The findings from ordinary least square analysis indicate that both sets of factors are significant in influencing total trade of all countries except China where macroeconomic factors are more significant in affecting total trade. Moreover, the results from the fixed effect panel analysis also denote that both macroeconomic and country <b>specific</b> <b>indicators</b> significantly influence total trade in the three groups of countries. The findings indicate that both macroeconomic factors and country <b>specific</b> <b>indicators</b> are significant in determining FDI inflows of South Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Germany, Hong Kong, and Japan. However, it is also concluded that macroeconomic factors are more significant in affecting FDI inflows in Russia, China, Korea and the United States. Alternatively, country <b>specific</b> <b>indicators</b> are more significant in determining FDI inflows in Brazil. The findings from the fixed effect panel model indicate that FDI inflows in developed countries are significantly influenced by both sets of macroeconomic and country <b>specific</b> <b>indicators.</b> For the group of ASEAN 5 and BRICS countries, the set of macroeconomic factors are more significant in determining FDI inflow...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{improve the}} quality of {{integrated}} care, we developed indicators for assessing current practice in a large reference center for head and neck oncology. METHODS: We defined a set of indicators based on integrated care literature, national evidence-based guidelines for patients with head and neck cancer, and the opinions of professionals and patients. We tested this set regarding assessment of current practice and clinimetric characteristics. RESULTS: The final set consisted of 8 integrated care <b>indicators</b> and 23 <b>specific</b> <b>indicators</b> for patients with head and neck cancer. Current practice assessment produced high scores for the integrated care <b>indicators,</b> but the <b>specific</b> <b>indicators</b> showed room for improvement. The practice test showed that 9 indicators had good applicability. CONCLUSIONS: The indicators, while based on evidence-based guidelines and the principles of integrated care, should incorporate patients' opinions and include a practice test. Our results show that the quality of integrated care for patients with head and neck cancer could be improved...|$|R
