5|$|The {{effect of}} these acts on {{aboriginal}} title in California has been a subject of litigation for 150 years. Regardless, the United States never again pursued treaty negotiations with California Indians, instead favoring legislation and executive orders. By statute, Congress created several Indian reservations. Congress gave the executive the <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> create further reservations. By 1986, Presidents had used this <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> create 117 reservations totalling 632,000 acres.|$|E

5|$|Chief Justice Yong, {{referring}} to the affidavit of the Minister for Culture, held that Order 123 was made after the Government had been satisfied that the teachings and beliefs contained in publications of the WTBTS were contrary to the public interest. The Minister had viewed the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses as being prejudicial to the Government's nation-building efforts, and hence he had rightly exercised his <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> prohibit such publications.|$|E

5|$|In July 2014, Baker {{was criticized}} by Democrats {{for refusing to}} say whether he {{supported}} {{a provision in the}} new gun control law that gave police chiefs <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> deny firearms identification cards, which are required to purchase shotguns and rifles. He later stated in a debate that he would have signed the gun control bill as it was signed by Governor Patrick.|$|E

5|$|The amended Constitution of Singapore also {{provided}} for a Council of Ministers {{appointed by the}} Governor upon {{the recommendation of the}} Chief Minister, consisting of three unelected Official Members and six Elected Members. As the Constitution was unclear on the powers of the ministers, the <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> make crucial decisions and formulate policies was understood to reside in the Governor and the Official Members.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{order of}} the Minister for Home Affairs may direct that an {{individual}} be detained {{for up to two}} years. This may be further extended by directions issued by the President for further periods of up to two years at a time. The Minister is empowered with <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> suspend a detention order, but also has the authority to revoke the suspension at any time, which reactivates the detention order. Detention orders must be reviewed at least once every 12 months by an advisory board which thereafter makes its recommendation to the Minister. If an advisory board recommends the release of a detainee and the Minister disagrees, the President may exercise personal <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> order the release. The requirement for regular reviews of detention orders does not apply to detainees who are not citizens. When a detention order is extended, the Minister is not required to provide the detainee with the grounds justifying the extension order or give the detainee an opportunity to appeal against the extension.|$|E
5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the executive to elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E
50|$|A {{married couple}} both face temptations while {{separated}} {{for a few}} days. The husband meets an attractive female fellow traveler in Paris while the wife accidentally spends a night aboard a Royal Navy ship with a male friend after she is stranded following a party. Despite knowing the essential innocence of both husband and wife, their sinister new butler uses information about their <b>discretions</b> <b>to</b> demand blackmail payments.|$|R
50|$|Illusory Consideration: An {{agreement}} may be held as void if a vital {{provision is}} {{deemed to be}} illusory. That is, that one part has a <b>discretion</b> either <b>to</b> the performance or {{to the content of}} that provision. Note, if one party has some latitude or <b>discretion</b> as <b>to</b> the manner in which certain agreed provisions will be effected, but that discretion is limited, then the provisions are not illusory.|$|R

5|$|In United States v. Marchant (1827), the Court held thateven {{though a}} trial court has the <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> sever {{the trials of}} co-{{defendant}}sa defendant {{has no right to}} insist upon being tried alone. The Court recounted the history of criminal severance in English law, and concluded that the practice merely arose to prevent co-defendants from each using their peremptory challenges to deplete the venire such that too few jurors remained for trial. Justice Story was the author of the opinion of the Court, as well as a substantially similar opinion in the Massachusetts circuit court below.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislature}} heeded some of Clark's message. They added {{a second}} auditor {{in the office}} of the state auditor, and gave greater <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> the state's sinking fund commission. They created a state board of education and the office of state superintendent. They also created county school commissioners in every county. In response to his remarks on slave property, the legislature enacted laws that raised the reward for apprehending a fugitive slave and made it illegal for stagecoach owners to allow fugitive slaves to use their coaches to escape.|$|E
5|$|Also on the 13th, Beresford {{moved the}} British 2nd Division, Major General John Hamilton's Portuguese {{division}} and three artillery batteries from Badajoz to Valverde—an ideal position {{to observe the}} three routes open for Soult's approach. Wellington's orders left Beresford full <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> fight Soult or to retreat and he was personally inclined to the latter course of action. However, when Beresford met with Blake and Castaños, the two most senior Spanish generals, at Valverde on 14 May, he {{allowed himself to be}} persuaded that the numerical superiority the Allied army had over Soult justified risking a battle. The Allied leaders consequently agreed to concentrate at Albuera, which was the location chosen by Wellington as best suited for an attempt to resist any French advance to relieve Badajoz.|$|E

5|$|Automatic {{closure of}} public schools which racially {{integrate}} — The legislation required that any school which integrated (voluntarily or not) must be immediately and automatically closed. However, the governor was given the <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> take over integrated school(s) and reopen the school(s) on a segregated basis rather than close the entire district. Integrated schools {{did not have to}} stay closed, however. A school district could petition the governor to take over one or more schools (or the entire district) that had closed and reopen them as segregated schools. Whether exercising his discretion or acting on a petition from the school district, the governor was authorized to act only as an agent of the Assembly. The governor was also required to try to persuade the African American child to return to his or her racially segregated school, so that the schools could reopen on a segregated basis.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the {{official}} scorer is not given the <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> decide between awarding a hit to the batter or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder's choice. If a preceding runner is forced out or if an unforced preceding runner is put out while attempting {{to return to their}} original base, a hit is automatically not credited and the batter by rule is judged to have reached by a fielder's choice. In some situations this rule may appear unfair to the batter. For example, if the batter is a fast runner, the ball is slowly hit to the third baseman, and an unforced runner from second realizes (too late) that he can not safely advance, the batter-runner will lose the potential hit on a fielder's choice by the third baseman. This occurs regardless of whether the batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to put him out.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{order has}} been criticized because it left too much <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> Ewell. Numerous historians and proponents of the Lost Cause {{movement}} (most prominently Jubal Early, despite his own reluctance to support an attack at the time) have speculated how the more aggressive Stonewall Jackson would have acted on this order if he had lived to command this wing of Lee's army, and how differently {{the second day of}} battle would have proceeded with Confederate artillery on Cemetery Hill, commanding the length of Cemetery Ridge and the Federal lines of communications on the Baltimore Pike. Stephen W. Sears has suggested that Gen. Meade would have invoked his original plan for a defensive line on Pipe Creek and withdrawn the Army of the Potomac, although that movement would have been a dangerous operation under pressure from Lee.|$|E

5|$|Space Invaders {{was created}} by Tomohiro Nishikado, who spent a year {{designing}} the game and developing the necessary hardware to produce it. The game's inspiration {{is reported to have}} come from varying sources, including an adaptation of the mechanical game Space Monsters released by Taito in 1972, and a dream about Japanese school children who are waiting for Santa Claus and are attacked by invading aliens. However, Nishikado has cited Atari's arcade game Breakout as his inspiration. He aimed to create a shooting game that featured the same sense of achievement from completing stages and destroying targets, but with more complex graphics. Nishikado used a similar layout to that of Breakout but altered the game mechanics. Rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects, players are given the ability to fire projectiles at their own <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> attack moving enemies.|$|E
5|$|The English {{judicial}} system had altered considerably {{over the previous}} century, with the royal judges playing {{a larger role in}} delivering justice across the country. John had used his royal <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> extort large sums of money from the barons, effectively taking payment to offer justice in particular cases, {{and the role of the}} Crown in delivering justice had become politically sensitive among the barons. Clauses 39 and 40 demanded due process be applied in the royal justice system, while clause 45 required that the King appoint knowledgeable royal officials to the relevant roles. Although these clauses did not have any special significance in the original charter, this part of Magna Carta became singled out as particularly important in later centuries. In the United States, for example, the Supreme Court of California interpreted clause 45 in 1974 as establishing a requirement in common law that a defendant faced with the potential of incarceration be entitled to a trial overseen by a legally trained judge.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} grounds relate to {{attempts}} by Parliament to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. Article 22H of the Constitution deals with attempts {{to alter the}} President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal <b>discretion</b> <b>to</b> withhold assent to the bill. The Cabinet may, if it wishes, advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact has the effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. If the Tribunal determines that the bill does not have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court.|$|E
