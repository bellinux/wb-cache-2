25|$|Davidovich routed Vaubois in the Battle of Calliano on 7 November, inflicting 4,400 {{casualties}} on the French for an Austrian loss of 3,500. Bonaparte {{focused on the}} threat from the north as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> his eastern force to Verona. Davidovich remained inactive because he was under the mistaken impression that Masséna's division had reinforced Vaubois.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for the Germans, {{during their}} retreat earlier that autumn they had {{destroyed}} the Losheim-Losheimergraben road {{bridge over the}} railway. German engineers were slow to repair the bridge {{on the morning of}} 16 December, preventing German vehicles from using this route. A railroad overpass they had selected as an alternative route could not bear the weight of the German armor. Peiper instead directed his lead tank to cross the railroad and climb the embankment, but as soon as it reached the top on the far side, Peiper received new orders directing him west along the road through Lanzerath to Bucholz Station. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> and headed for Lanzerath instead.|$|E
25|$|Minye Kyawswa {{brought a}} fresh {{thinking}} to Ava's battle plan. Instead of directly attacking the well-defended Pegu capital region, he would attack {{what he believed}} were less defended regions. In late 1410, the prince invaded the Irrawaddy delta by river and land with an army (7000 men, 600 horses, and 40 elephants) and a navy that transported 7000 men. Combined Ava forces proceeded to attack the key delta cities of Myaungmya and Bassein (Pathein). But the prince found that the key delta cities were well fortified and prepared for long sieges. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> his forces to Prome, and invaded Arakan in early 1411. There, he successfully drove out Pegu-installed vassals, and appointed Ava's commanders as governor-generals.|$|E

He has rebuilt her apartment to include secret passageways and a one-way mirror, which he can use to watch her.|$|R
25|$|After {{holding his}} {{position}} for five hours, Cleburne was ordered about noon to start falling {{back towards the}} main Confederate army. Leaving skirmishers along his front to hide his withdrawal, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> from the gap about 2 p.m. and burned the bridge {{on the eastern side}} of the gap. Cleburne had lost 20 killed and 201 wounded during the battle. Grant arrived near the gap at this time and, due to the scattered position of his army, decided to return to Chattanooga; no further Union pursuit was organized. Union casualties totaled 509 killed and wounded. Although Hooker was severely criticized for his conduct of the battle by Union Assistant Secretary of War Dana and several of Hooker's men, Grant choose to retain Hooker temporarily.|$|E
25|$|Later that afternoon, the company's 2nd Platoon was ambushed {{by a large}} NVA unit, {{suffering}} heavy casualties, while conducting reconnaissance near Nui Yon Hill. As airstrikes were attacking nearby NVA, McCloughan {{entered a}} trench and saw two unarmed American soldiers huddling near a bush. He handed his gun to another soldier, jumped over the trench's berm, and ran {{close to the ground}} towards the two soldiers, whom <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> into the trench despite being hit with shrapnel from the explosion of a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). Ignoring an order to remain in the trench, he rescued wounded soldiers from the kill zone four more times during a NVA assault. Bleeding heavily, McCloughan treated the wounded and prepared them for evacuation, refusing evacuation even though the NVA heavily outnumbered the American troops.|$|E
25|$|Jung did {{not plan}} to study {{psychiatry}} since it was not considered prestigious at the time. But, studying a psychiatric textbook, he became very excited when he discovered that psychoses are personality diseases. His interest was immediately captured—it combined the biological and the spiritual, {{exactly what he was}} searching for. In 1895 Jung began to study medicine at the University of Basel. Barely a year later in 1896, his father Paul died and left the family near destitute. They were helped out by relatives who also contributed to Jung's studies. During his student days, he entertained his contemporaries with the family legend, that his paternal grandfather was the illegitimate son of Wolfgang Goethe and his German great-grandmother, Sophie Ziegler. In later life, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> from this tale, saying only that Sophie was a friend of Goethe's niece.|$|E

25|$|The Roman {{conquest of}} Egypt {{put it on}} a {{collision}} course with the Sudanic powers of the southern regions. In 20 BC, Kushites under their ruler Teriteqas, invaded Egypt with some 30,000 troops. Kushite forces were mostly infantry and their armament consisted of bows about 4 cubits long, shields of rawhide, and clubs, hatchets, pikes and swords. The Kushites penetrated as far south as the Aswan area, defeating three Roman cohorts, conquering Syene, Elephantine and Philae, capturing thousands of Egyptians, and overthrowing bronze statutes of Augustus recently erected there. The head of one of these Augustian statutes was carried off to Meroe as a trophy, and buried under a temple threshold of the Candace Amanirenas, to commemorate the Kushite victory, and symbolically tread on her enemies. A year later, Rome dispatched troops under Publius Petronius to confront the Kushites, with the Romans repulsing a poorly armed Meroitic force at Pselchis. Strabo reports that Petronius continued to advance- taking Premnis and then the Kushite city of Napata. Petronius deemed the roadless country beyond unsuitable ir too difficult for further operations. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to Premnis, strengthening its fortifications, and leaving a garrison in place. These setbacks did not settle hostilities however for a Kushite resurgence occurred just three years later under the queen or Candace Amanirenas, with strong reinforcements of African troops from further south. Kushite pressure now once more advanced on Premnis. The Romans countered this initiative by sending more troops to reinforce the city.|$|E
500|$|Smith was {{involved}} in another incident that scared him to death. One day when he was flying his normal air mail route from Hadley Field to Cleveland, he caught {{something out of the}} corner of his eye that looked like a skyscraper. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> on the control stick to [...] quickly gain altitude and just missed hitting the U.S. Navy airship USS Los Angeles that was in his direct path. It was a close call of just over a hundred feet.|$|E
2500|$|Rayment {{moved the}} {{throttle}} forward slowly and released the brakes; the plane began to accelerate, and radio officer Bill Rodgers radioed the control tower {{with the message}} [...] "Zulu Uniform rolling". The plane threw up slush as it gathered speed, and Thain called out the plane's velocity in 10-knot increments. At 85 knots, the port engine began to surge again, and <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> marginally on the port throttle before pushing it forward again. Once the plane reached , he announced [...] "V1", at which {{it was no longer}} safe to abort take-off, and Rayment listened for the call of [...] "V2" [...] (...) , the minimum required to get off the ground. Thain expected the speed to rise, but it fluctuated around 117 knots before suddenly dropping to , and then [...] Rayment shouted [...] "Christ, we won't make it!", as Thain looked up to see what lay ahead.|$|E

2500|$|The Burmese army then marched {{north and}} {{was met by}} a Siamese force of 60,000 near west of the city. Outnumbered 3 to 1, the more {{experienced}} Burmese army nonetheless routed the much larger Siamese army, which according to the Burmese, was [...] "chopped to pieces", forcing the remaining Siamese troops to retreat to the capital. Maha Nawrahta had now arrived at Ayutthaya as planned, in record time. (It took Alaungpaya's 40,000 men about {{three and a half}} months to arrive at Ayutthaya in 1760 whereas it took Maha Nawrahta's 20,000 plus army just about two months.) But <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to the northwest of the city because he did not see Thihapate's northern army, and because {{he did not want to}} take on another major battle with his depleted army. He fixed his headquarters near the Pagoda built by Bayinnaung two centuries ago. He used the hiatus to refill the ranks with Siamese conscripts.|$|E
2500|$|People {{involved}} in survival stories reported in local newscasts have sometimes mentioned previous viewings of MythBusters as an influence to their actions. Twenty-three-year-old Theresa Booth of St. Martin, Minnesota credits a MythBusters episode {{for her and}} her infant child's survival. On April 3, 2007, she skidded off the road into a drainage ditch which had filled with flood water from the Sauk River. In a local newscast, she is described as opening the car door as soon as it entered the water, and credits her watching of the show (specifically, the episode of the Underwater Car myth) for her knowledge of how to survive the accident. On October 19, 2007, in Sydney, Australia, a teenager named Julian Shaw pulled a fainted middle-aged man off the railway tracks near a train station to safety below the platform. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> as the train passed, citing that the [...] "Train Suction" [...] episode affected his response.|$|E

Still, she had called him and <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
