40|$|Contribution to {{catalogue}} for related exhibition: Antonio Manuel, {{curated by}} Claudia Calirman. Notorious amongst Antonio Manuel's {{work of the}} 1960 s are the Flans (<b>Flongs,</b> or Stereotype Moldes). These were produced using high and low relief matrices for the printing process of newspaper pages, over which the artist applied paint. The actual process of production involved a semi-clandestine access to the newspaper’s printing workshop, leading eventually to interference in certain runs of the newspaper itself. The portrayal of ‘common people’ had been a widespread theme in Brazilian modern art and its re-emergence in the 1960 s could {{be considered as a}} project of demythication of prevailing associations with the ethnic composition of the nation. Antonio Manuel’s infatuation with the ordinariness of the human condition can be remarked in his early expressive drawing technique that recalls, in its repetitiveness, and its simple outlines, Dubuffet’s faux-naive paintings. These drawings developed into the Flan series where the work becomes inextricably associated with the newspaper’s content and process of production. As a result, visual interferences within the newspaper layout became increasingly economical as whole sections were allowed to become legible or visible, with particular emphasis being given to news items covering the violence perpetrated by the state on ordinary people. Shortly after Nova Objetividade Brasileira, Antonio Manuel participated in Apocalipopótese, an open air ‘happening’ at the Aterro do Flamengo landfill area that took place in 1968 on the eve of AI 5. The event, named as a consideration of the hypothesis of apocalypse, gathered a diverse group of artists including, Oiticica, Rogerio Duarte, Lygia Pape, dancers from the favela of Mangueira samba school, among others. Prior to the event, organisational meetings were held at Oiticica’s house where Antonio Manuel and Rogério Duarte discussed a possible collaboration. They proposed building a structure entitled Cabine do Amor (Love-hut) where the viewer would enter and through gaps in the wooden structure, see images of bodies projected within another compartment. A fascination with the relation between inside and outside and an engagement with the viewer as active participant within the work become at this moment key issues for Antonio Manuel. According to the artist, the actual structure had already been constructed by Oiticica but Duarte’s other commitments disrupted the project. Antonio Manuel developed an alternative project that involved around 20 wooden boxes of simple construction each containing images, newspaper cut-outs, poems and slogans. As the boxes were sealed, their content could only be revealed through a destructive act. The artist was interested in the revelation of their content by the public but admits being surprised by the violence demonstrated towards these boxes. They were named Urnas-Quentes, which translate literally into English as Hot-Ballot-Boxes...|$|R

50|$|A further {{improvement}} to {{the technique}} {{was made in}} 1893, when the dry <b>flong</b> replaced the wet <b>flong.</b> More recently, flongs have been made of phenolic resin boards (perhaps also plastic and rubber) and are still used in places to cast rubber stamp sheets instead of type metal stereos, the last commercial use is certain types of rubber relief printing mats (sheets) for flexo printing. They remained widely in use until the invention of offset lithography in the late 19th century led to rotary presses being mostly replaced by the new technology.|$|E
50|$|This was a {{paper mill}}. It was in {{use as a}} paper mill as early as 1776 and took {{its name from the}} ford which was near the mill. This was {{replaced}} by a bridge in 1836. George Langley ran the mill from the 1840s until 1876. The mill was owned by the Dering Estate at Pluckley. The overshot waterwheel was replaced by a turbine. In 1941, the mill was switched to the manufacture of <b>flong</b> for the Daily Express newspaper. Changing economic conditions meant that <b>flong</b> manufacture ceased in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|... "Dwile" [...] is a knitted floor cloth, {{from the}} Dutch dweil, meaning [...] "mop", and [...] "flonk" [...] is {{probably}} a corruption of <b>flong,</b> an old past tense of fling.|$|E
50|$|The Holbæk Motorway (M11, part of Danish {{national}} road 21) runs {{north of}} Hedehusene and has exits at Baldersbrønde and <b>Fløng.</b> Hedehusene's main street, Hovedgaden, {{is part of}} Secondary route 159 (Roskildevej").|$|E
50|$|Today {{the town}} has grown {{physically}} into neighboring Kallerup, <b>Fløng,</b> and Baldersbrønde. The most important commercial area is Roskilde Street (Roskildevej). Rockwool International, immediately west of the town, is the largest employer.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Flong</b> {{were the}} {{indigenous}} population in British newspaper The Guardian's 1977 April fool story on the fictional islands of San Serriffe. This {{was only one of}} many printing and typographical puns in the story.|$|E
5000|$|Invented in Lyon in 1829 by the French printer Claude Genoux, a <b>flong</b> was a papier-mâché mould {{made with}} the aid of heat and {{pressure}} of a set [...] of type. After placing it in a casting box, a thin replica of the original (metal) type (and illustrations) would be cast against it all in one piece. A limited number of duplicate casts could be made from one <b>flong.</b> The back shaved stereo plate would be attached to a press cylinder or honeycomb base and allow the original undamaged type to be distributed or recycled. The stereotypes could be stored for repeat editions in much less space than standing forms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flong</b> is a {{term used}} in relief {{printing}} (also called a stereo mould), which refers to an intermediate step in making of a stereo plate typically used in a rotary press though not exclusively. The process was called stereotyping.|$|E
50|$|In other motifs {{it is the}} {{ultimate}} threshold before death, as seen in Den syge mand and På kirkegården i <b>Fløng.</b> Another threshold motif is the meeting between old and new, e.g. in The Railroad guard and Runesten ved Roskilde Landevej.|$|E
5000|$|In printing, a stereotype, {{also known}} as a cliché, stereoplate or simply a stereo, was {{originally}} a [...] "solid plate of type metal, cast from a papier-mâché or plaster mould (called a <b>flong)</b> taken from the surface of a forme of type" [...] used for printing instead of the original.|$|E
50|$|It is {{very common}} for fans to form 'Fans Associations' for film stars. Ravishankar's {{popularity}} as a supporting actor in Kannada grew to an extent where {{he has a lot}} of fans associations across Karnataka. Fans <b>flong</b> to his house in Bengaluru on his birthdays like it happens for a big hero. One of his biggest fans associations in Bengaluru is called 'Akhila Karnataka Sakalakalavallabha Ravishankar Abhimanigala Sangha.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{strictly}} speaking not typesetting, stereotyping (electrotype or nickeltype) {{could be used}} to cast a reproduction of an entire typeset page (or pages imposed in a [...] ) using a mold made with an impression using <b>flong</b> (similar to papier-mâché). The ensuing casting could be made curved for use on a rotary press or flat for the slower flat bed presses. This technique was often used in newspaper production.|$|E
50|$|Mikael Pedersen (25 October 1855 <b>Fløng</b> - 22 October 1929, Bispebjerg) was a Danish {{inventor}} much {{associated with}} the English town of Dursley. He is chiefly known today for the highly distinctive Pedersen bicycle. His story is one of rags to riches and back again, and he was largely forgotten in his native country, but fans of the Pedersen bicycle arranged {{for him to be}} reburied and a memorial erected at Dursley.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flat and}} fertile moraine {{landscape}} between Roskilde, Køge and Copenhagen was since the Middle Ages known as Hedeboegnen or simply Heden ("The Heath"). The name {{was merely a}} reference to the flat and open character of the landscape at a time when much of Denmark was covered by forest while it was not covered by heath in the ecological sense of the word. Villages in the area included <b>Fløng,</b> Kallerrup, Baldersbrønde and Marbjerg.|$|E
50|$|The printer's {{primary purpose}} is to produce {{stereotype}} plates for use in printing presses, which it does by pressing type into soft plaster to create a <b>flong.</b> Babbage intended that the Engine's results be conveyed directly to mass printing, having recognized that many errors in previous tables were {{not the result of}} human calculating mistakes but from error in the manual typesetting process. The printer's paper output is mainly a means of checking the Engine's performance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{composition}} of individual cast metal types into lines with leading and furniture, tightly {{locked into a}} chase, was labor-intensive and costly. Cumulative, this full setup for printing a single page was called a forme. The printer would incur further expense through loss of the type for other uses while held in formes. However, once the <b>flong</b> and stereotype were created, the individual type, furniture, leading and chasing could be disassembled, and used for another project.|$|E
50|$|A feature {{often seen}} in Ring's art is to place one or more objects {{at the edge of}} picture, which can be seen in e.g. Runesten ved Roskilde Landevej, Når taget ventes. Jernbaneoverkørsel ved Roskilde Landevej, Summerday by Roskilde Fjord and Lundbyes bænk ved Arresø. Ring also often places the {{horizontal}} line high, as seen in Lundbyes bænk ved Arresø, Krager på pløjemarken, På kirkegården i <b>Fløng,</b> Skærsommer. Tre børn i en mark med kornblomster and in his portrayal of rural laborers.|$|E
50|$|Høje-Taastrup Kommune is a {{municipality}} (Danish, kommune) in Region Hovedstaden on {{the island}} of Zealand (Sjælland) in eastern Denmark. The municipality covers an area of 78 km² (30 mi²), and has a total population of 48,853 (1 April 2014). It was formed by the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform, and its 1974 adjustment, by merging the parish municipalities of Høje Taastrup, Sengeløse, the <b>Fløng</b> part of Hvedstrup-Fløng and the Reerslev part of Reerslev-Vindinge. The mayor of the municipality is Michael Ziegler, a member of the Conservative People's Party (Det Konservative Folkeparti) political party.|$|E
50|$|Hedehusene is a {{suburban}} town {{located on the}} rail line between Copenhagen and Roskilde in the Capital Region of Denmark. It has absorbed the villages of Baldersbrønde and <b>Fløng</b> and almost merged with Roskilde's eastern Trekroner neighbourhood {{to the west and}} Taastrup to the east. To the south is the large recreational area Hedeland. As of 1 January 2015, the town had a population of 11,720. A large development project, NærHeden, created as a collaboration between Høje-Taastrup Municipality and Realdania, will expand the town to the southeast with a new sustainable neighbourhood.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{churches in}} Hedehusene. <b>Fløng</b> Church {{dates from the}} middle of the 12th century and was built by members of the Snubbe family, a branch of the {{powerful}} Hvide dynasty residing at Bytteborg. The church originally consisted of chancel and nave under a flat roof. The tower was already added to its western end in approximately 1200. The height of the tower was increased with 19 metres in the 16th century. A porch was also constructed on the north side and a new roof with cross vailts was added. The original chancel was torn down in about 1500.|$|E
50|$|English sources often {{describe}} {{the process as}} having been invented in 1725 by William Ged, who apparently stereotyped plates for the Bible at Cambridge University before abandoning the business. However, Count Canstein had been publishing stereotyped Bibles in Germany since 1712 and an earlier form of stereotyping from <b>flong</b> was described in Germany in 1702. It is even possible that the process was used {{as early as the}} fifteenth century by Johannes Gutenberg or his heirs for the Mainz Catholicon. Wide application of the technique, with improvements, is attributed to Charles Stanhope in the early 1800s. Printing plates for the Bible were stereotyped in the US in 1814.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} extend the working life of type, and {{to account for the}} finite sorts in a case of type, copies of forms were cast when anticipating {{subsequent}} printings of a text, freeing the costly type for other work. This was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an impression cylinder rather than set in the bed of a press. In this process, called stereotyping, the entire form is pressed into a fine matrix such as plaster of Paris or papier mâché called a <b>flong</b> to create a positive, from which the stereotype form was electrotyped, cast of type metal.|$|E
50|$|Rotary presses {{were used}} for {{high-speed}} work. In the oscillating press, the form slid under a drum around which each sheet of paper got wrapped for the impression, sliding back under the inking rollers while the paper was removed and a new sheet inserted. In a newspaper press, a papier-mâché mixture called a <b>flong</b> {{used to make a}} mould of the entire form of type, then dried and bent, and a curved metal plate cast against it. The plates were clipped to a rotating drum and could print against a continuous reel of paper at the enormously high speeds required for overnight newspaper production.This invention helped aid the high demand for knowledge during this time period.|$|E
