40|$|The {{authorised}} Edition of the Statute Law of the Colony, {{covering the}} period 1652 - 1895, revised by Mr. Advocate Tennant and myself in 1895, having Been for some considerable {{time out of}} print and unobtainable, the opportunity has been deemed favourable for issuing a reprint revised {{to the end of}} the Session of 1905. The text of the Ordinances and Acts has been carefully read; all enactments repealed by legislation subsequent to 1895 have been omitted, explanatory footnotes having been added where necessary; and all Acts re-enacted have been re-printed. The arrangement, under which the paging of the Sessional Acts passed after 1895 was made continuous, has not been disturbed, so that the use of this Edition in the Courts will not create confusion as would be the case if the paging differed. To quote an example. The Charter of. Justice will be found printed on pages 93 - 108 in both Editions. The Act 21 of 1864 amending it occupies pages 948 - 955 of the 1895 Edition, but in view of its repeal is not printed in this Edition, a note to that effect appearing' on page 947, the number of the page (956) following, corresponding with the 1895 Edition.
