25|$|The 1994 Formula One {{cheating}} controversy was {{a series}} of allegations made throughout the 1994 Formula One season. Several Formula One teams were involved, with the main allegations surrounding Benetton Formula. Initially, Benetton were alleged to have been using illegal software—namely traction control—to their advantage in races; however, this could not be sufficiently proven by the FIA. A refuelling fire on Jos Verstappen's Benetton car at the German Grand Prix led to renewed allegations and an investigation by Intertechnique at Benetton's team factory. Following the investigation, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) revealed Benetton had been using an illegal fuel valve without a <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> that allowed fuel into the car 12.5% faster than a legal fuel valve.|$|E
25|$|AC Cars also {{produced}} a Le Mans coupé. The {{car was a}} one-off and was nearly destroyed after a high-speed tire blow-out at the 1964 Le Mans race. The car was qualified conservatively second in GT. The race started well with the AC, chassis number A98, maintaining {{its position in the}} top two in GT and even leading the class for a time. This was not to last as an act of sabotage (newspaper in the fuel tank) began to block the <b>fuel</b> <b>filter.</b> The car lost time until this was diagnosed and cleaned out. The car proceeded on at the predetermined conservative lap time and for the next stint remained trouble free. The car was able to match the Shelby Daytona's speed despite running a higher differential ratio (2.88 instead of 3.07) and a lower state of engine tune for reliability (355hp instead of the Daytona's 385hp).|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of 2003, Yoong was signed by the SAE Racing team to enter the Bathurst 24-hour {{production}} car event. He was team-mates with Luke Searle (the son of the owner David Searle), Alan Gurr and Geoff Full in a BMW 320i. A test session at Queensland Raceway in July showed the car was competitive. The drivers qualified 13th but problems arose. During the qualifying, the BMW's engine had been losing power along with {{a failure of the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> and the fuel injector jets were blocked. Come the race, the issues were still present until 75 minutes before the race end, but the team did complete 50 laps. For 2004, Yoong was embarking in a career in the media for ESPN Star Sports as a Formula One presenter. By the May of that year, support from Malaysian company Pan Global saw him drive in the V8 endurance events at Sandown and Bathurst.|$|E
50|$|The paper {{used for}} <b>fuel</b> <b>filters</b> is a crêped paper with {{controlled}} porosity, which is pleated and wound to cartridges. The {{raw material for}} filter paper used in <b>fuel</b> <b>filters</b> are made of a mixture of hardwood and softwood fibres. The basis weight of the paper is 50 - 80 g/m2.|$|R

2500|$|The {{sequence}} {{began with}} a loss of thrust in the No. 4 Engine. That engine had failed twice during previous flights (while cruising at FL 410 and 430). In each of those cases, the engine was restarted after descending to a lower altitude. The maintenance response to the logbook entries that noted the problems included engine inspection, <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> drainage and replacement, vane controller inspection and replacement, water drainage from Mach probes, and other filter replacements. [...] None of those acts fixed the recurrent problem of the No. 4 engine.|$|E
2500|$|Many cars {{powered by}} {{indirect}} injection engines supplied by in-line injection pumps, or mechanical Bosch injection pumps {{are capable of}} running on pure SVO/PPO in all but winter temperatures. [...] Indirect injection Mercedes-Benz vehicles with in-line injection pumps and cars featuring the PSA XUD engine tend to perform reasonably, especially as the latter is normally equipped with a coolant heated <b>fuel</b> <b>filter.</b> [...] Engine reliability {{would depend on the}} condition of the engine. Attention to maintenance of the engine, particularly of the fuel injectors, cooling system and glow plugs will help to provide longevity. [...] Ideally the engine would be converted.|$|E
2500|$|The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, {{directed}} DOE {{to assess}} the feasibility of using intermediate ethanol blends in the existing vehicle fleet. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) evaluated the potential impacts on legacy vehicles and other engines. In a preliminary report released in October 2008, NREL described the effects of E10, E15 and E20 on tailpipe and evaporative emissions, catalyst and engine durability, vehicle driveability, engine operability, and vehicle and engine materials. This preliminary report found {{that none of the}} vehicles displayed a malfunction indicator light; no <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> plugging symptoms were observed; no cold start problems were observed at [...] and [...] under laboratory conditions; and all test vehicles exhibited a loss in fuel economy proportional to ethanol's lower energy density. For example, E20 reduced average fuel economy by 7.7% when compared to gas-only (E0) test vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Diesel fuel {{is prone}} to waxing or gelling in cold weather; both are terms for the {{solidification}} of diesel oil into a partially crystalline state. Below the Cloud Point the fuel begins to develop solid wax particles giving it a cloudy appearance. The presence of solidified waxes thickens the oil and clogs <b>fuel</b> <b>filters</b> and injectors in engines. The crystals build up in the fuel line (especially in <b>fuel</b> <b>filters)</b> until the engine is starved of fuel, causing it to stop running.|$|R
5000|$|Actuators: Mechatronic components, such as {{electric}} wastegate actuators, {{which are}} used to control the boost pressure in turbocharged engines or heating elements for <b>fuel</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>filters</b> serve a vital {{function}} in today's modern, tight-tolerance engine fuel systems. Unfiltered fuel may contain {{several kinds of}} contamination, for example paint chips and dirt that has been knocked into the tank while filling, or rust caused by moisture in a steel tank. If these substances are not removed before the fuel enters the system, they will cause rapid wear and failure of the fuel pump and injectors, due to the abrasive action of the particles on the high-precision components used in modern injection systems. <b>Fuel</b> <b>filters</b> also improve performance, as the fewer contaminants present in the fuel, the more efficiently it can be burnt.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which {{mandates}} an increase in renewable fuels for the transport sector, the U.S. Department of Energy began assessments for the feasibility of using intermediate ethanol blends in the existing vehicle fleet as a way to allow higher consumption of ethanol fuel. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted tests to evaluate the potential impacts of intermediate ethanol blends on legacy vehicles and other engines. In a preliminary report released in October 2008, the NREL presented the results of the first evaluations of the effects of E10, E15 and E20 gasoline blends on tailpipe and evaporative emissions, catalyst and engine durability, vehicle driveability, engine operability, and vehicle and engine materials. This preliminary report found none of the vehicles displayed a malfunction indicator light as {{a result of}} the ethanol blend used; no <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> plugging symptoms were observed; no cold start problems were observed at [...] and [...] laboratory conditions; and as expected, computer technology available in newer model vehicles adapts to the higher octane causing lower emissions with greater horsepower and in some cases greater fuel economy.|$|E

50|$|Fuel {{contaminants}} such as {{dirt and}} water {{are often more}} problematic in diesel engines than in petrol engines. Water can cause serious damage, due to corrosion, to the injection pump and injectors; and dirt, even very fine particulate matter, can damage the injection pumps due to the close tolerances that the pumps are machined to. All diesel engines will have a <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> (usually much finer than a filter on a petrol engine), and a water trap. The water trap (which is sometimes part of the <b>fuel</b> <b>filter)</b> often has a float connected to a warning light, which warns when {{there is too much}} water in the trap, and must be drained before damage to the engine can result. The <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> must be replaced much more often on a diesel engine than on a petrol engine, changing the <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> every 2-4 oil changes is not uncommon for some vehicles.|$|E
50|$|These {{turbines}} eventually displaced units 51 to 75. There {{had been}} problems with <b>fuel</b> <b>filters</b> clogging on the earlier turbines, {{so it was}} decided to <b>filter</b> the <b>fuel</b> before filling the locomotive fuel tanks and the tender.|$|R
50|$|Tank {{manufacturers}} have introduced <b>fuel</b> <b>filtering</b> and cleansing packs which recirculate the tank contents {{through a series}} of filters and ultraviolet treatment to kill bacteria.

5000|$|The fuel inlet/fuel {{filter housing}} threads {{tend to be}} very fragile. When care is not taken to align the insert, it is {{possible}} for the fuel inlet to cross-thread and to strip when tightened in the main housing. There are several [...] "fixes" [...] available in the aftermarket: New, oversized, self-tapping <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> inserts; new <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> inserts that seal with O-rings; and Heli-Coil re-threading kits. In nearly all cases, the carburetor will require dis-assembly and internal cleaning of the aluminum thread residue, especially up to and including the needle and seat, (needle valve), to prevent flooding.|$|E
50|$|A primary <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> {{is usually}} {{installed}} upstream of the engine, {{so as to}} filter out the larger particles, and filter a larger quantity of water that might {{be present in the}} fuel.|$|E
25|$|These {{microbes}} form {{a colony}} that {{lives at the}} interface of fuel and water. They grow quite fast in warmer temperatures. They can even grow in cold weather when fuel tank heaters are installed. Parts of the colony can break off and clog the fuel lines and <b>fuel</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The R-H car was {{developed}} by the chief engineer, Edward Boughton, who joined the company in 1916 after helping to develop the tank. Later he would start the Automotive Products Group (APG) in Leamington Spa in 1920 which made Borg & Beck clutches, Lockheed hydraulic brakes, and Purolator <b>fuel</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... "FlexFuel" [...] {{vehicles}} have upgraded {{fuel system}} and engine components which {{are designed for}} long life using E85 or M85, and the ECU can adapt to any fuel blend between gasoline and E85 or M85. Typical upgrades include modifications to: fuel tanks, fuel tank electrical wiring, <b>fuel</b> pumps, <b>fuel</b> <b>filters,</b> <b>fuel</b> lines, filler tubes, fuel level sensors, fuel injectors, seals, fuel rails, fuel pressure regulators, valve seats and inlet valves. [...] "Total Flex" [...] Autos destined for the Brazilian market can use E100 (100% Ethanol).|$|R
50|$|A <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> is {{a filter}} in the fuel line that screens out dirt and rust {{particles}} from the fuel, normally made into cartridges containing a filter paper. They {{are found in}} most internal combustion engines.|$|E
50|$|After the {{selector}} valve there usually is a gascolator - a <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> {{that can be}} drained. Other drainage points are in each tank (often more than one contaminant collection sump per tank) and at the injection pump.|$|E

25|$|Biodiesel {{can be used}} in pure form (B100) or may be {{blended with}} {{petroleum}} diesel at any concentration in most injection pump diesel engines. New extreme high-pressure (29,000 psi) common rail engines have strict factory limits of B5 or B20, depending on manufacturer. Biodiesel has different solvent properties than petrodiesel, and will degrade natural rubber gaskets and hoses in vehicles (mostly vehicles manufactured before 1992), although these tend to wear out naturally and most likely will have already been replaced with FKM, which is nonreactive to biodiesel. Biodiesel has been known to break down deposits of residue in the fuel lines where petrodiesel has been used. As a result, <b>fuel</b> <b>filters</b> may become clogged with particulates if a quick transition to pure biodiesel is made. Therefore, it is recommended to change the <b>fuel</b> <b>filters</b> on engines and heaters shortly after first switching to a biodiesel blend.|$|R
5000|$|Around this time, {{the plant}} complex (known as [...] "Chevy in the Hole") began to disappear. Among the first plants to go were the truck garage, Plant 5 (formerly Engine Parts) and the {{administration}} building. This continued until 2004, when Plant Four (which had reopened some years after it initially closed in 1984) shut down and was demolished. Plant Four's last products were generators and <b>fuel</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R

30|$|The product network {{showed the}} {{existence}} of certain central products, such as <b>fuel</b> <b>filters,</b> which have high closeness centrality. Disruptions to the delivery of these products will affect the assembly of many products quickly, and these need to be carefully monitored. Products such as pumps have high betweenness and degree centrality. Although they have high redundancy in the network, disruptions to their delivery would cause issues for sub-systems to be brought together.|$|R
50|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, cloud point {{refers to the}} temperature below which wax in diesel or biowax in biodiesels forms a cloudy appearance. The presence of solidified waxes thickens the oil and clogs <b>fuel</b> <b>filters</b> and injectors in engines. The wax also accumulates on cold surfaces (producing, for example, pipeline or heat exchanger fouling) and forms an emulsion with water. Therefore, cloud point indicates the tendency of the oil to plug filters or small orifices at cold operating temperatures.|$|R
