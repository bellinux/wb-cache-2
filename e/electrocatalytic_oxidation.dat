For the CoPi–BiVO 4 photoanodes studied herein, ≤ 5 % of water oxidation proceeds from CoPi sites, making the BiVO 4 surface the predominant water oxidation site. This study highlights two key factors that limit the ability of CoPi to improve the catalytic performance of BiVO 4 : 1) the kinetics of hole transfer from the BiVO 4 to the CoPi layer are too slow to effectively compete with direct water oxidation from BiVO 4; 2) the slow water oxidation kinetics of CoPi result in a large accumulation of CoIII states, causing an increase in recombination.
