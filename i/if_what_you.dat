6000|$|... "I {{must know}} <b>if</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{have told me}} has any bearing on your request that I should {{recommend}} Captain Sedgwick's appointment?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mor. <b>If</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> ask would please, {{you should}} not know. But since that knowledge, more than death, will grieve, Know, Indamora gained you this reprieve.|$|E
60|$|BILL. Mother's {{particularly}} generous, <b>if</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean.|$|R
60|$|THE BURGLAR. Well, I don't fly in {{the face}} of Providence, <b>if</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want to know.|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS [impatiently] But {{she knew}} all about that. We didn't make speeches to her, <b>if</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>if</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say is true I've been swindled," [...] {{declared}} the storekeeper finally. [...] "I'd {{like to get}} my hands on that young man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you don't}} know that? I thought Billy Dill knew. <b>If</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{have told me}} is true, you are the son of my twin brother, David Breslow Porter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Besides, even <b>if</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{have said}} were true as to property,' Sir Gervas remarked, 'it would not hold you excused for that {{recklessness}} {{of human life}} which your trade begets.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{nothing at}} all has happened, and you have had your presentiment for your pains, <b>if</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> hurried home for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{shall never}} be jolie, like Wilmet, <b>if</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean,' said Robina, not quite {{understanding}} whether it were jest or earnest.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're very considerate. But <b>if</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{are going}} for, {{you might as}} well stay. I'm not going to do {{anything}} whatever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's another thing," [...] said John suddenly, and the {{unexpected}} {{sound of his}} voice made me start guiltily. [...] "Something which makes me doubt <b>if</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say can be true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't do that! I {{never had}} any trouble before and I don't want it now. I'll help you all I can-- <b>if</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say its true, and that man is your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|The doctor smiled. [...] "I did not {{suppose it}} would be as bad as that," [...] he said; [...] "but <b>if</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say is true, let us skip about instantly, and do something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see {{any great}} {{objection}} to that. We shall both be feeling very {{anxious about the}} play, <b>if</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{not going}} over Barry's pond, <b>if</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean by your Lake of Shining Waters. We're going by the shore road." ...|$|R

60|$|MRS. DRAKE. <b>If</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say be true, sailor (and I don't say it isn't, mind!), it's {{strange that}} Arethusa and that godly man her father have never {{so much as}} spoke your name.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. DRAKE. Why, what's to do {{with the}} man and his acts of parliament? I don't want to fly {{in the face of an}} act of parliament, not I. <b>If</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say is true---- ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Giles {{shook his}} head. [...] "I {{call that a}} far-fetched interpretation, Dennis. <b>If</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say is true, why didn't the writer of those {{anonymous}} letters address himself to Arthur, instead of to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{not going}} to break down, <b>if</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean,' she said. 'I don't care. And, anyhow, it shows {{that it can be}} done.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{withheld}} it a moment. [...] "I don't {{know what}} it is, Miss Northwick. But <b>if</b> isn't <b>what</b> <b>you</b> expected, will you let--will you allow me--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Didn't notice it. I guess so, <b>if</b> she's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say. It's <b>what</b> {{they pay}} her for, ain't it? Do {{you work in}} a store, too?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then I am not Vito Viti, but an impostor? What a rascally {{philosophy}} is this! Why, {{both of us}} are as bad as this Sir Smees, <b>if</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say be true, vice-governatore--or make-believe vice-governatore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But stop a minute," [...] I said. [...] "How is it that, <b>if</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say is true, I haven't seen {{or heard}} anybody in the bush, and I've been here {{since the middle of}} the morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am Wycherly, {{the only}} son of Wycherly, {{who was the}} eldest son of Gregory, the younger brother of the late baronet; and <b>if</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say be true, the next in {{succession}} to the baronetcy, at least." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't want to. I {{wanted to}} leave it to yourself. I wanted--oh yes, <b>if</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> wish to ask me--to see what you'd do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, an' I dunna. I drink a drop o' beer, <b>if</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> ca' touchin' alcohol. An' I'm none th' wuss for it, tha sees." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It does," [...] Cathro admitted, grimly, [...] "but <b>if</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{wanted was}} a written {{certificate}} of character I should like to add this, that never did any boy sit on my forms whom I had such a pleasure in thrashing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{shall be}} dealt with on my return, and <b>if</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say is proved true, the Captain of Justice shall suffer with {{yourself}} for this treason--for that is the offence. Take him away, and someone open me that gate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know as I think Charmian {{is acting}} all the time, <b>if</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean," [...] said Cornelia. [...] "Or {{any of the}} time, even." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not {{much to look}} at, <b>if</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean," [...] {{answered}} Madge. [...] "Began life as a miner, I believe. Looks like ending as Prime Minister." ...|$|R
