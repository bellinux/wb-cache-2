Ultrasonography revealed a solid tumor beneath her left areola that measured 17  mm in diameter with a dilated mammary duct. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed an early-enhanced cystic tumor and a dilated mammary duct. We performed a duct-lobular segmentectomy using near-infrared indocyanine green (ICG) -fluorescence imaging. Under general anesthesia, a silicone tube was inserted into an orifice of a fluid-discharging mammary duct, and 1  mL dye-fluorescence liquid containing ICG and indigo carmine was injected into the mammary duct. A periareolar incision was made, and the fluorescence image of the demarcated mammary <b>duct</b> <b>segment</b> was obtained. The mammary <b>duct</b> <b>segment</b> was dissected, along with the demarcation line. The cystic lesion and dilated mammary duct were fully resected, and the pathological diagnosis was intraductal papilloma of the breast. We report that near-infrared ICG fluorescence could be applied for imaging of the mammary <b>duct</b> <b>segment,</b> and the fluorescence image allowed for easier duct-lobular segmentectomy for nipple discharge...|$|E

40|$|The {{anatomical}} {{details of}} the biliary tree architecture of normal rats and rats in whom selective proliferation was induced by feeding α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) were reconstructed in three dimension using a microscopic-computed tomography scanner. The intrahepatic biliary tree {{was filled with a}} silicone polymer through the common bile duct and each liver lobe embedded in Bioplastic; specimens were then scanned by a microscopic-computed tomography scanner and modified Feldkamp cone beam backprojection algorithm applied to generate three-dimensional images. Quantitative analysis of bile duct geometry was performed using a customized software program. The diameter of the bile <b>duct</b> <b>segments</b> of normal and ANIT-fed rats progressively decreased with increasing length of the biliary tree. Diameter of bile ducts from ANIT-fed rats (range, 21 to 264 μm) was similar to that of normal rats (22 to 279 μm). In contrast, the number of bile <b>duct</b> <b>segments</b> along the major branch reproducibly doubled, the length of the bile <b>duct</b> <b>segments</b> decreased twofold, and the length of the biliary tree remained unchanged after ANIT feeding. Moreover, the total volume of the biliary tree of ANIT-fed rats was significantly greater (855 μl) than in normal rats (47 μl). Compared with normal rats, the total surface area of the biliary tree increased 26 times after ANIT-induced bile duct proliferation. Taken together, these observations quantitate the anatomical remodeling after selective cholangiocyte proliferation and strongly suggest that the proliferative process involves sprouting of new side branches. Our results may be relevant to the mechanisms by which ducts proliferate in response to hepatic injury and to the hypercholeresis that occurs after experimentally induced bile duct proliferation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{variations}} in the anatomy of the biliary tract need to be recognized in modern liver surgery. The purpose of this clinical and anatomical study is to describe several novel biliary tract variations and to outline their practical importance for liver resections and transplantations. Materials and Methods: Over the previous 10 years, the anatomic variations of the bile ducts were examined during 600 intraoperative cholangiographies, 104 segmentectomies and 54 hemihepatectomies in patients with liver diseases. The intraoperative anatomies of {{the right and left}} hepatic ducts and the common hepatic duct confluence were analyzed. Results: Twenty-two variations occurred in 59. 5 % of the patients. Six variations were described for the first time: an accessory right hepatic duct in which a cystic duct drained; a tetrafurcation from the right anterior hepatic duct, right posterior hepatic duct and bile <b>ducts</b> for <b>Segments</b> 2 and 3 with aberrant bile drainage from Segment 4 into the bile <b>duct</b> for <b>Segment</b> 8; an aberrant bile drainage from Segments 6 and 7 into the common hepatic duct; an accessory bile <b>duct</b> for <b>Segment</b> 6 that drained into the bile <b>duct</b> for <b>Segment</b> 3; a tetrafurcation from the right anterior hepatic duct and the bile <b>ducts</b> for <b>Segments</b> 6, 3 and 2 with bile from Segment 7 draining into the bile <b>duct</b> for <b>Segment</b> 2; and an accessory bile duct for the left hemiliver that drained bile from the Type 4 small accessory hepatic lobe (according to Caygill & Gatenby) into the common hepatic duct.

Animals were infused with isotonic solutions containing the same Cl and total CO 2 (tCO 2) concentrations as in postdialysis plasma at rates shown {{to be associated with}} slight but stable volume contraction. During the subsequent 6 h, serum Cl and tCO 2 concentrations remained stable and normal in CON and corrected towards normal in CDA; urinary chloride excretion was less and bicarbonate excretion greater than those in CON during this period. Micropuncture and microinjection studies were performed in the 3 rd h after dialysis. Plasma volumes determined by 125 I-albumin were not different. Inulin clearance and fractional chloride excretion were lower (P less than 0. 05) in CDA. Superficial nephron glomerular filtration rate determined from distal puncture sites was lower (P less than 0. 02) in CDA (27. 9 +/- 2. 3 nl/min) compared with that in CON (37. 9 +/- 2. 6). Fractional fluid and chloride reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule and within the loop segment did not differ. Fractional chloride delivery to the early distal convolution did not differ but that out of this segment was less (P less than 0. 01) in group CDA. Urinary recovery of 36 Cl injected into the collecting <b>duct</b> <b>segment</b> was lower (P less than 0. 01) in CDA (CON 74 +/- 3; CDA 34 +/- 4 %).

Enhanced chloride reabsorption in the collecting <b>duct</b> <b>segment,</b> and possibly in the distal convoluted tubule, contributes importantly to this correction...|$|E

Here, we report the case of a left hepatic trisectionectomy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma with a rare aberrant biliary <b>duct</b> of <b>segment</b> 5, which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been reported in previous literature. Case presentation A 56 -year-old Asian female initially presented with intrahepatic bile duct dilatation in the left lateral sector, left paramedian sector, and right paramedian sector. Simultaneous cholangiography from a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage tube in biliary <b>duct</b> of <b>segment</b> 8 and endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube in biliary <b>duct</b> of <b>segment</b> 3 revealed drainage of the right lateral sectoral branch into the common hepatic duct and the aberrant drainage of segment 5 into the right lateral sectoral branch. The left hepatic duct, right paramedian sectoral duct, and the confluence of the right lateral sectoral duct were narrowed. Left hepatic trisectionectomy was successfully performed with careful dissection and division of the aberrant biliary <b>duct</b> of <b>segment</b> 5.

40|$|The {{location}} of purinoceptors in the pancreatic duct {{and their role}} in regulating ductal secretion have been investigated by applying ATP and UTP to basolateral and luminal surfaces of pancreatic ducts isolated from the guinea-pig pancreas. Changes in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration were measured by microfluorometry in microperfused interlobular <b>duct</b> <b>segments.</b> Fluid and HCO 3 − secretion were estimated by monitoring luminal pH and luminal volume in sealed <b>duct</b> <b>segments</b> microinjected with BCECF-dextran. Both ATP and UTP (1 μm) caused biphasic increases in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration in pancreatic duct cells when applied to either the basolateral or luminal membrane. Luminal application of both ATP and UTP evoked fluid and HCO 3 − secretion. The maximum response to 1 μm ATP or UTP was about 75 % of that evoked by secretin. By contrast, basolateral application of ATP or UTP inhibited spontaneous secretion by 52 % and 73 %, respectively, and secretin-evoked secretion by 41 % and 38 %, respectively. The data suggest that luminal nucleotides may act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to enhance ductal secretion while basolateral nucleotides, perhaps released from nerve terminals, may have an inhibitory effect. The fact that both apical and basolateral purinoceptors elevate intracellular Ca 2 +, but that they have opposite effects on secretion, suggests that additional signalling pathways are involved...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{aldosterone}} on NEM-sensitive ATPase in rabbit nephron segments. Aldosterone (aldo) {{treatment of}} animals stimulates the rate of H+ secretion in the collecting duct, a process which may involve an H+-ATPase sensitive to inhibition by NEM (N-ethylmaleimide). Therefore, we determined NEM-sensitive ATPase activity in distal nephron segments from three groups of adrenaiectomized (adx) rabbits maintained on different doses of aldo (in an osmotic minipump) for seven days. Group 1 was given 1. 5 µg aldo/ 100 g body wt/day, whereas groups 2 and 3 were maintained on 5 µg and 50 µg of aldo/ 100 g body wt/day, respectively. Aldo concentrations in the plasma of groups 1, 2 and 3 were 10. 4 ± 0. 8, 70 ± 7 and 408 ± 133 ng/dl, respectively. There was {{a significant increase in}} NEM-sensitive ATPase activity in connecting tubule (CNT) and cortical, outer and inner medullary <b>duct</b> <b>segments</b> (CCD, OMCD and IMCD) but not in cortical thick ascending limb (CTAL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT) in group 2 as compared to group 1. A further increase in plasma concentration of aldo (group 3) did not produce any more increase in NEM-sensitive ATPase activity in the CNT, CCD, OMCD and IMCD, but did increase the enzyme activity in the DCT. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that aldo increases H+ secretion in the connecting tubule and collecting <b>duct</b> <b>segments</b> by increasing the activity of NEM-sensitive H+-ATPase activity in these segments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Automated process chains {{for optimal}} fluid {{dynamics}} design are gaining importance in automotive applications. So far, industrial implementations of optimal design processes in fluid dynamics are mostly restricted to shape optimization with bionic algorithms. However, {{on the basis}} of the recent progress in fluid dynamic topology optimization, as well as in industrial applications of adjoint-based shape design, we propose an adjoint-based design process chain comprising both topology and shape optimization. Starting from the available installation space, this approach delivers a tailored optimal geometry, making use of the whole potential of the available design space at each stage. The central element of this design process is the computation of sensitivity maps – for both topological and shape sensitivities. We present the theory underlying the computation of sensitivity maps via adjoint states, show sample maps for an air <b>duct</b> <b>segment</b> and a complete passenger car and point out the missing links of the proposed design process chain.

40|$|In this paper, a non-locally {{reacting}} liner is considered, {{consisting of}} helical wave-guides filled with porous material, {{and covered with}} a perforated plate. This “spiralling ” liner has more degrees of freedom than a conventional locally reacting liner. Apart from the cavity depth of the liner and the impedance of the perforated plate, also the properties of the porous material and the advance ratio of the helical wave-guides can be varied. The spiralling liner may be useful particularly for the reduction of rotor alone noise. The advance ratio of the wave-guides can then be tuned to the typical direction of noise propagation. The major part of this paper is about the mathematical modelling of the spiralling liner, with emphasis on the eigenvalue problem of a lined <b>duct</b> <b>segment</b> and the problem of matching with hard wall duct segments. Further, a validation experiment is described, by which good agreement was found with computed results. Finally, the results of a parametric study are summarised, showing the potential of this type of liner.

40|$|Low protein diets {{reverse the}} urea {{concentration}} gradient in the renal inner medulla. To investigate the mechanism(s) for this change, we studied urea transport and cell ultrastructure in initial and terminal inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCD) from rats fed 18 % protein or an isocaloric, 8 % protein diet for 4 wk. Serum urea, aldosterone, and albumin {{were significantly lower}} in rats fed 8 % protein, but total protein and potassium were unchanged. Vasopressin stimulated passive urea permeability (Purea) threefold (P < 0. 05) in initial IMCDs from rats fed 8 % protein, but not from rats fed 18 % protein. Luminal phloretin reversibly inhibited vasopressin-stimulated Purea. However, in terminal IMCDs from rats fed either diet, vasopressin stimulated Purea. Net transepithelial urea flux (measured with identical perfusate and bath solutions) was found only in initial IMCDs from rats fed 8 % protein. Reducing the temperature reversibly inhibited it, but phloretin did not. Electron microscopy of initial IMCD principal cells from rats fed 8 % protein showed expanded Golgi bodies and prominent autophagic vacuoles, and morphometric analysis demonstrated a marked increase in the surface density and boundary length of the basolateral plasma membrane. These ultrastructural changes were not observed in the terminal IMCD. Thus, 8 % dietary protein causes two new urea transport processes to appear in initial but not terminal IMCDs.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{cockroach}} {{salivary gland}} consists of secretory acini with peripheral ion-transporting cells and central protein-producing cells, an extensive duct system, {{and a pair}} of reservoirs. Salivation is controled by serotonergic and dopaminergic innervation. Serotonin stimulates the secretion of a protein-rich saliva, dopamine causes the production of a saliva without proteins. These findings suggest a model in which serotonin acts on the central cells and possibly other cell types, and dopamine acts selectively on the ion-transporting cells. To examine this model, we have analyzed the spatial relationship of dopaminergic and serotonergic nerve fibers to the various cell types. Results The acinar tissue is entangled in a meshwork of serotonergic and dopaminergic varicose fibers. Dopaminergic fibers reside only at the surface of the acini next to the peripheral cells. Serotonergic fibers invade the acini and form a dense network between central cells. Salivary <b>duct</b> <b>segments</b> close to the acini are locally associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic fibers, whereas <b>duct</b> <b>segments</b> further downstream have only dopaminergic fibers on their surface and within the epithelium. In addition, the reservoirs have both a dopaminergic and a serotonergic innervation. Conclusion Our results suggest that dopamine is released on the acinar surface, close to peripheral cells, and along the entire duct system. Serotonin is probably released close to peripheral and central cells, and at initial <b>segments</b> of the <b>duct</b> system. Moreover, the presence of serotonergic and dopaminergic fiber terminals on the reservoir indicates that the functions of this structure are also regulated by dopamine and serotonin. </p...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{recently}} reported that isolated <b>duct</b> <b>segments</b> from rabbit lacrimal gland (LG) {{were able to}} secrete fluid in response to secretagogues, which were blocked completely by bumetanide. This suggests the functional involvement of Na+-K+- 2 Cl- cotransporter (NKCC 1) in ductal fluid secretion. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the activity profile of NKCC 1 in isolated rabbit LG <b>duct</b> <b>segments.</b> METHODS: Interlobular <b>ducts</b> were isolated from fresh rabbit LG tissue. Microfluorometry with the ammonium (NH 4 +) -pulse technique was used to elicit pH changes in duct cells, and the rate of bumetanide-sensitive cytosolic acidification after addition of NH 4 + was used to quantify the activity of NKCC 1. RESULTS: While basal activity of NKCC 1 was undetectable, low cytosolic chloride (Cl-) level and hyperosmotic challenge (390 mOsm) were able to increase the activity of NKCC 1. Carbachol (100 muM) had no significant effect on NKCC 1 activity. Elevation of cytosolic calcium (Ca 2 +) level with Ca 2 +-ionophore (A 23187, 1 muM) did not cause any alteration in the activity of the cotransporter while direct activation of protein kinase C (phorbol myristate acetate, 100 nM) increased its activity slightly but in a significant manner. Addition of either forskolin (10 muM), cell-permeable cAMP analogue (8 -bromo cAMP, 100 muM) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (200 nM) resulted in a significant increase in the activity of NKCC 1. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the functional involvement of NKCC 1 in LG duct secretion. These findings may facilitate our understanding of LG function and may contribute to the development of targeted pharmacologic interventions in case of dry eye disease...|$|R

This lumen-positive potential difference was inhibited by ouabain and furosemide but not by acetazolamide. Replacement of chloride in bath and perfusion fluids caused a reversible decrease of the potential difference to near zero. We conclude from these studies: (a) the lumen-positive potential difference is dependent upon the presence of chloride ion suggesting {{the existence of an}} active electrogenic chloride reabsorptive process in the human collecting duct and (b) it is possible to examine human renal physiology directly using in vitro microperfusion of tubule segments...|$|R
40|$|The well orchestrated {{function}} of epididymal smooth muscle cells ensures transit of spermatozoa through the epididymal duct during which spermatozoa acquire motility and fertilizing capacity. Relaxation of smooth muscle cells is mediated by cGMP signaling and components of this pathway are {{found within the}} male reproductive tract. Whereas contractile {{function of}} caudal parts of the rat epididymal duct can be examined in organ bath studies, caput and corpus regions are fragile and {{make it difficult to}} mount them in an organ bath. We developed an ex vivo time-lapse imaging-based approach to investigate the contractile pattern in these parts of the epididymal duct. Collagen-embedding allowed immobilization without impeding contractility or diffusion of drugs towards the duct and therefore facilitated subsequent movie analyses. The contractile pattern was made visible by placing virtual sections through the acquired image stack to track wall movements over time. By this, simultaneous evaluation of contractile activity at different positions of the observed <b>duct</b> <b>segment</b> was possible. With each contraction translating into a spike, drug-induced alterations in contraction frequency could be assessed easily. Peristaltic contractions were also detectable and throughout all regions in the proximal epididymis we found regular spontaneous contractile activity that elicited movement of intraluminal contents. Stimulating cGMP production by natriuretic peptide ANP or inhibiting degradation of cGMP by the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil significantly reduced contractile frequency in isolated duct segments from caput and corpus.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} kidney, {{in particular}} the collecting <b>duct</b> <b>segment</b> of the nephron, is a major site of renal sodium and water reabsorption. One of the many agonists known to regulate collecting duct function is bradykinin (BK), a nonapeptide which exerts natriuretic and diuretic effects through its ability to increase arachidonic acid (AA) availability and prostaglandin production. Evidence presented herein indicates that 85 kDa cytosolic phospholipase A 2 (cPLA 2) is the enzyme accountable for BK-mediated AA. This {{is based on the}} following observations: RCCD cells express cPLA 2 protein, an arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone inhibitor of cPLA 2 completely blunted BK-stimulated AA release, both basal and BK-stimulated PLA 2 activities were significantly diminished following treatment with an antibody to this enzyme, and finally, PLA 2 in vitro activity could be stimulated by submillimolar calcium concentrations and was dithiothreitol (DTT) -insensitive. Strategies were also employed to reveal the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in BK-mediated AA release, cPLA 2 activation and cPLA 2 phosphorylation. Chemical inhibition of PKC reduced both BK-stimulated AA release and cPLA 2 activity; however, BK-stimulated AA release appeared limited by calcium mobilization rather than by PKC. Cytosolic PLA 2 activity could be stimulated by phorbol ester (PMA) and the magnitude of this activation was similar to that caused by BK. A direct correlation between the level of cPLA 2 phosphorylation and activation was confirmed by the phosphatase-mediated reversal of both BK- and PMA-stimulated responses. Furthermore, the increase in cPLA 2 phosphorylation was found to occur on serine residues. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} called dynamic multiscale averaging (DMA) for computing {{the effects of}} turbulent flow is described. The new method encompasses multiple applications of temporal and spatial averaging, that is, multiscale operations. Initially, a direct numerical simulation (DNS) is performed for a relatively short time; it is envisioned that this short time should be long enough to capture several fluctuating time periods of the smallest scales. The flow field variables are subject to running time averaging during the DNS. After the relatively short time, the time-averaged variables are volume averaged onto a coarser grid. Both time and volume averaging of the describing equations generate correlations in the averaged equations. These correlations are computed from the flow field and added as source terms to the computation on the next coarser mesh. They represent coupling between the two adjacent scales. Since they are computed directly from first principles, there is no modeling involved. However, there is approximation involved in the coupling correlations as the flow field has been computed for only a relatively short time. After the time and spatial averaging operations are applied at a given stage, new computations are performed on the next coarser mesh using a larger time step. The process continues until the coarsest scale needed is reached. New correlations are created for each averaging procedure. The number of averaging operations needed {{is expected to be}} problem dependent. The new DMA approach is applied to a relatively low Reynolds number flow in a square <b>duct</b> <b>segment.</b> Time-averaged stream-wise velocity and vorticity contours from the DMA approach appear to be very similar to a full DNS for a similar flow reported in the literature. Expected symmetry for the final results is produced for the DMA method.

The {{present study was}} designed to characterize the effects of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) glomerulonephritis (GN) on sodium handling by surface nephrons, deep nephrons and the terminal collecting <b>duct</b> <b>segment.</b> Studies were performed in rats during hydropenia and volume expansion. In hydropenia, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and sodium excretion tended to be lower in rats with GN than in controls. However, the major differences between the control and GN animals were seen in volume expansion. In the volume expanded groups fractional excretion of sodium was greater in controls (3. 20 ± 0. 51 %) than in GN (1. 20 ± 0. 36 %, P < 0. 01). Despite this, delivery to end proximal sites was similar in the two groups in absolute terms and higher in the expanded GN group compared to the expanded controls. Absolute sodium delivery to the bend of the loop of Henle in the expanded GN rats was decreased in absolute terms but increased in fractional terms compared to expanded controls. However, fractional delivery of sodium {{to the base of the}} terminal collecting duct was less in GN (3. 71 ± 1. 39 %) than in controls (7. 19 ± 0. 96 %, P < 0. 002).

In GN 62. 6 ± 5. 0 % of delivered sodium was reabsorbed between collecting duct sites, nearly twofold that of controls (28. 8 ± 9. 4 %, P < 0. 01).

40|$|Removal {{of toxic}} {{substances}} from the blood depends on patent connections between the kidneys, ureters and bladder that are established when the ureter is transposed from its original insertion site in the Wolffian duct, to the bladder, its final insertion site. The Ureteral Bud Theory of Mackie and Stephens suggests that repositioning of the ureter orifice occurs as the trigone forms from the common nephric duct (CND), the caudal-most Wolffian <b>duct</b> <b>segment.</b> According to this model, insertion of the CND into the bladder and its expansion into the trigone both repositions the ureter in the bladder and enables it to separate from the Wolffian duct. The availability of new mouse models has enabled to re-examine this hypothesis using morphological analysis and lineage studies to follow {{the fate of the}} ureter and CND during the maturation process. We find that in contrast to what has been previously thought, the CND does not differentiate into the trigone but instead, undergoes apoptosis, a step that enables the ureter to separate from the Wolffian duct. Apoptosis occurs as the CND and ureter merge with the urogenital sinus positioning the ureter orifice at a site close to the Wolffian duct. Finally, expansion of the bladder moves the ureter orifice which is now fused with epithelium to its final position which is at the bladder neck. Interestingly, CND apoptosis appears to depend on close proximity to the bladder, suggesting that the bladder may be a source of signals that induce cell death. Together, these studies provide new insights into the normal process of ureter maturation, and shed light on possible causes of obstruction and reflux, ureteral abnormalities that affect 1 – 2 % of the human population...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} experimental studies {{on a combination}} of active noise control and active vibration control for a ventilation duct. Ventilationsystems radiate noise at the duct outlets and from the duct walls. In many practical applications, ventilation ducts are installed without shielding, although, they may run through corridors and adjacent rooms or halls to be ventilated. Thus both air- and structure-borne disturbances can be a cause of acoustic discomfort for the occupants. In this study the combined active control of air- and structure-borne noise is examined. In the theoretical study a <b>duct</b> <b>segment</b> with circular cross-section has been modelled using an elemental approach with coupled acoustic impedance and structural mobility functions. This model is used to investigate the principle effects and limitations of feed forward control using acoustic sources acting on the duct interior and the effect of feedback control forces acting on the duct walls. The control performance is evaluated in terms of (a) the far field sound power radiated from the duct outlet and (b) the far field sound power radiated from the duct walls. For the experimental studies a laboratory duct set-up is used, which is equipped with loudspeaker, shaker and an axial ventilator as primary sources and a combined active noise and active vibration control system. Results for loudspeaker and shaker primary excitations are in reasonable agreement with the simulations for ideal air and structure borne sources. Experiments with the ventilator source are used to investigate the system limitations in the presence of air flow induced turbulences and structure borne disturbances. Both the theoretical and experimental results show that the air borne noise radiated from the duct outlet can be significantly attenuated using feed-forward active noise control. In presence of structure borne noise the performance of the activenoise control is impaired and sound radiation from the duct walls is increased. In this case, if the active noise control is combined with a vibration controlsystem, the control of the sound radiation by the duct outlet is improved and considerable reductions of the sound radiation from the duct wall are achieved...|$|E

40|$|Cholestasis is a {{cardinal}} complication of liver disease, but most treatments are merely supportive. Here {{we report that}} the sulfonylurea glybenclamide potently stimulates bile flow and bicarbonate excretion in the isolated perfused rat liver. Video-microscopic studies of isolated hepatocyte couplets and isolated bile <b>duct</b> <b>segments</b> show that this stimulatory effect occurs {{at the level of}} the bile duct epithelium, rather than through hepatocytes. Measurements of cAMP, cytosolic pH, and Ca 2 + in isolated bile duct cells suggest that glybenclamide directly activates Na+-K+- 2 Cl- cotransport, rather than other transporters or conventional second-messenger systems that link to secretory pathways in these cells. Finally, studies in livers from rats with endotoxin- or estrogen-induced cholestasis show that glybenclamide retains its stimulatory effects on bile flow and bicarbonate excretion even under these conditions. These findings suggest that bile duct epithelia may represent an important new therapeutic target for treatment of cholestatic disorders...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results were}} {{presented}} in abstract form {{at the annual meeting}} of the International Liver Cancer Association (ILCA), Milan, Italy (4 – 6 September 2009). Abstract: Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is non-resectable in the majority of patients often due to intrahepatic extension along bile duct branches/segments, and even after complete resection (R 0) recurrence can be as high as 70 %. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an established palliative local tumor ablative treatment for non-resectable hilar CC. We report the long-term outcome of curative resection (R 0) performed after neoadjuvant PDT for downsizing of tumor margins in seven patients (median age 59 years) with initially non-resectable hilar CC. Photofrinr was injected intravenously 24 – 48 h before laser light irradiation of the tumor stenoses and the adjacent bile <b>duct</b> <b>segments.</b> Major resective surgery was done with curative intention six weeks after PDT. All seven patients had been curatively (R 0) resected and there were no undue early or late complications for th...|$|R
40|$|The {{gall bladder}} and ducts exert {{opposite}} influences upon the bile. The ducts fail to concentrate and thicken it with mucus as the bladder does, but dilute it slightly {{with a thin}} secretion of their own that is colorless and devoid of cholates even when the organism is heavily jaundiced. The fluid may readily be collected into a rubber bag connected with an isolated <b>duct</b> <b>segment.</b> It continues to be formed against a considerable pressure, and, in the dog, is slightly alkaline to litmus, clear, almost watery, practically devoid of cholesterol, and of low specific gravity to judge from the one specimen tested. In obstructed ducts separated from the gall bladder, or connecting with one so changed pathologically that the concentrating faculty has been lost, such fluid gradually replaces {{the small amount of}} bile originally pent up. It is the so called "white bile" of surgeons. When obstructed ducts connect with an approximately normal gall bladder the stasis fluid is entirely different, owing to the bladder activity. At first there accumulates in quantity a true bile much inspissated by loss of fluid through the bladder wall, darkened by a change in the pigment, and progressively thickened with bladder mucus. As time passes duct secretion mingles with the tarry accumulation and very gradually replaces it. The inspissation of the bile, as indicated by the pigment content, is at its greatest after only a day or two of stasis. The differing influences of the ducts and bladder upon the bile must obviously {{have much to do with}} the site of origin of calculi and their clinical consequences. The concentrating activity of the bladder cannot but be a potent element in the formation of stones. We have discussed these matters at some length. Intermittent biliary stasis is admittedly the principal predisposing cause of cholelithiasis; and the stasis is to be thought of as effective, in many instances at least, through the excessive biliary inspissation for which it gives opportunity. In this way a normal gall bladder can become, merely through functional activity, a menace to the organism. In patients with the tendency to stones frequent feedings may lessen the danger of their formation...|$|E
40|$|The maxillary line is an {{important}} surgical landmark in the lateral nasal cavity. We investigated its location, variation, and relation to other landmarks in 47 formalin fixed cadaveric half-heads dissected in steps. Measurements and observations were made to describe the topography of the maxillary line, maxillary line midpoint (M-point), and their relationship with surgically important structures. The mean curved length of the maxillary line was 15 mm (SD 3. 5) and can be classified into three types. The Mpoint had a mean vertical distance of 0. 8 mm (SD 2. 9) below the nasolacrimal sac–duct junction. It was found below, above, or {{on the same level}} as the nasolacrimal sac–duct junction in 57. 4 %, 38. 3 %, and 4. 3 % of specimens, respectively. In 51. 1 % the M-point was anterior to the nasolacrimal duct axis and 48. 9 % overlapping the lacrimal apparatus.

40|$|Method for {{restoration}} of bile out fl ow in orthotopic transplantation of liver using cystic duct may fi nd application in anatomic version characterised by parallel location of cystic and common liver ducts in donor. After cholecystectomy, {{at the level}} of bile <b>ducts</b> donor <b>segment</b> intersection, common reservoir is formed with application of common liver and cystic ducts by dissection or wedge-shaped excision of partition segment between them. Level of bile <b>ducts</b> donor <b>segment</b> intersection is selected so that diameter of common reservoir coincides with diameter of recipient bile duct, with which biliobiliary anastomosis is formed. Biliobiliary anastomosis is formed as «end to end». If there are mucous and muscular layers in composition of partition between liver and cystic ducts, they are dissected. Edges of mucous layer are sutured. If only mucous layer is present in composition of partition, it is dissected without further suturing. Such approach supply possibility to overcome discrepancy of sutured ducts diameters and provision of bile out fl ow from liver in the most physiological version with «end to end» anastomosis.   </div...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Magnetic {{resonance}} cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is {{an established}} technique {{for the evaluation}} of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts in patients with known or suspected hepatobiliary disease. However, the ideal acquisition and reconstruction plane for optimal bile duct evaluation with 3 D technique has not been evaluated. The purpose of our study was to compare different acquisition and reconstruction planes of 3 D MRCP for bile duct assessment. Methods: 51 consecutive adult patients suspected to have pancreatico-biliary disease were examined with 3 Tesla (Philips 3 T Ingenia) system both a multi thin slice (3 D) and a breath-hold (Single Shot) MRCP technique were performed. In the multi thin slice technique both source images and maximum intensity projections were examined. Two radiologists blinded to clinical information viewed both MRCP techniques independantly. Measure of correlation between each of the techniques and the inter observer agreement were computed. Coronal and axial MIP were reconstructed based on each dataset (resulting in two coronal and two axial MIP, respectively) and assessed the MIP, regarding visualization of bile ducts and image quality. Results were compared (Wilcoxon test). Intra- and interobserver variability were calculated (kappa-statistic). Results: In case of coronal data acquisition, visualization of bile <b>duct</b> <b>segments</b> was significantly better on coronal reconstructed MIP images as compared to axial reconstructed MIP (p 0. 05). Image quality of coronal and axial datasets did not differ significantly. Obstruction due to tumor was shown in 30 % of patients, and calculi in the common bile duct were shown also in 30 % of patients employing the 3 D MRCP technique. Obstruction due to tumor and calculi were shown in 30 % and 21 % of patients, respectively, using the SS 2 D MRCP technique. Sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing calculi in the common bile duct by 3 D MRCP and SS MRCP were 100 %, 100 %, 70 % and 100 % respectively. Conclusions: Although the 3 D MRCP multislice technique is more time consuming than the SS MRCP breath-hold technique at a 3 Tesla (Philips 3 T Ingenia) system it is advisable to use thin slice 3 D MRCP in order not to misdiagnose calculi in the common bile duct. The results of our study suggest that for visualization and evaluation of intra- and extrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>segments</b> reconstructed images in coronal orientation are preferable...|$|R
