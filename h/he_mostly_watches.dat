50|$|Varela {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Södermalm {{on the south side of}} Stockholm. Both parents are from Spain and he did not learn proper Swedish until he started school. During middle school a new friend was Gustaf Skarsgård, son of internationally noted Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård. Varela did not then know of the famous Skarsgård family because <b>he</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>watched</b> Spanish {{satellite}} television. When his friend Skarsgård applied to a selective upper secondary school, Södra Latin’s drama program near where both boys lived, Varela wanted to do the same. The elder Skarsgård gave the young Varela a few hours of acting instructions and he was accepted by the school. Varela said he was surprised, becauses he had shown up in a track suit and looked more like a homeboy/chav than an aspiring actor.|$|R
5000|$|Bender {{was born}} on November 17, 1997, in Čapljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, a city on the Croatian border, and he later moved to Split, Croatia. At 12 years of age, he started playing at Nikola Vujčić's {{basketball}} academy as a point guard. Vujčić was a former Maccabi Tel Aviv star and became Bender's guardian. At the academy, Bender became a more versatile player and he [...] "learned how to play all the positions on the court." [...] Bender played there along with his older brother, Ivan, with Bender also playing against guys that were Ivan's age when he first started playing. Bender also played with the KK Split youth teams at this time, and he appeared for the Croatian under-16 national basketball team.

500|$|Rule and Aynesworth both {{noted that}} for Bundy, the fault always lay with someone or {{something}} else. While he eventually confessed to 30 murders, he never accepted responsibility for any of them, even when offered that opportunity prior to the Chi Omega trial—which would have averted the death penalty. He deflected blame onto {{a wide variety of}} scapegoats, including his abusive grandfather, the absence of his biological father, the concealment of his true parentage, alcohol, the media, the police (whom he accused of planting evidence), [...] "society" [...] in general, violence on television and, ultimately, true crime periodicals and pornography. He blamed television programming—which <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>mostly</b> on sets that he had stolen—for [...] "brainwashing" [...] him into stealing credit cards. On at least one occasion he even tried to blame his victims: [...] "I have known people who ... radiate vulnerability", he wrote in a 1977 letter to Kloepfer. [...] "Their facial expressions say 'I am afraid of you.' These people invite abuse ... By expecting to be hurt, do they subtly encourage it?" ...|$|R

40|$|IPTV {{service is}} a new service which is today offered from almost every Telecom operator. One of the {{advantages}} of IPTV service stemming from its architecture is certainly {{the fact that it is}} very easy to measure what TV channels are the ones <b>mostly</b> <b>watched.</b> This papers desribes this measurement and analysis results in one Telecom operator in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They describe what TV channels are <b>mostly</b> <b>watched</b> in different time periods. We developed a simple weighting algorithm to order the channels by watching rate.

This paper forms an industrial contribution with results important for marketing but also is scientific contribution because it introduces one new method of scoring TV channels based on previous measurements in their audience. We also developed IPTV Statistics model and described results from this research for a new statistics model. This paper is the continuous of previously published contributions from this area...|$|R

5000|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} imagined as {{an exploration of}} male consumption of pornography on college campuses. The filmmakers abandoned this idea when they discovered that the men were <b>mostly</b> <b>watching</b> pornographic videos starring young women.
