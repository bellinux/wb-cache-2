A series of experiments was performed to investigate {{the effect of a}} dual-diameter channel on the flow and heat transfer characteristics of single-turn pulsating heat pipes (PHPs). Various types of PHPs were made of glass capillary tubes with various inner diameters, and experiments to evaluate thermal performance of the PHPs were performed with varying input power and inclination angle. Quantitative data obtained by highspeed photography that asymmetric PHPs with a dual-diameter channel promote circulating flow over a wider range of experimental conditions compared to symmetric PHPs with a uniform diameter channel. Circulating flow promoted by a dualdiameter channel helps to enhance the thermal performance of the PHP and reduces thermal resistance by up to 45 %. A simplified model was developed to predict thermal characteristics of asymmetric PHPs with circulating flow, and the predicted data matched well with experimental data to within the error of 15 %. Experimental and calculated data show that there exists an optimum range of <b>diameter</b> <b>deviation</b> where the thermal performance enhancement is maximized. The optimal range of dimensionless <b>diameter</b> <b>deviation</b> is found to be between 0. 25 and 0. 4, and this study provides design guidelines to improve thermal performance of the PHP. cf 201...|$|E

Highly {{abrasive}} {{nature of}} carbon fibres and material-related problems like fibre or fibre bundle pullouts, matrix micro cracks and especially delamination of single or multiple laminate layers {{can be regarded}} as major problems when machining CFRP.

The cable working frequency spectrum spreading to 1000 MHz along with digital television and soundtrack signals transmission and high-definition television introduction causes more rigid requirements for wave impedance and, consequently, for the cable design. The established norms on user's cable impedance deviations fail to answer the state-of-the-art requirements for granting a complex of interactive services. On the basis of calculations performed, values of internal and external conductor <b>diameters</b> <b>deviations</b> as well as dielectric permeability of the insulation material are validated.

With the increasing amount and complexity of image data comes the need for automatic (or semi-automatic) analysis methods which aid the physician in the exploration of the data. One specific imaging technique is angiography, in which the blood vessels are imaged using an injected contrast agent which increases the contrast between blood and surrounding tissue. In these images, the blood vessels can be viewed as tubular structures with varying <b>diameters.</b> <b>Deviations</b> from this structure are signs of disease, such as stenoses introducing reduced blood flow, or aneurysms with a risk of rupture.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} optical {{properties}} of CdTe quantum dots, including the sizing curve, the absorption coefficient, and the oscillator {{strength of the}} band gap transition, by combining absorption spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and electron microscopy imaging. At short wavelengths, the absorption coefficient spectrum is still affected by quantum confinement, yet a largely constant value, close to that of bulk CdTe, is found at around 410 nm. At shorter wavelengths, remaining quantum confinement effects on the CdTe E- 1 transition are present even for the largest quantum dots studied (11 nm). For the band gap transition, we find an integrated absorption coefficient mu(gap) that scales almost proportionally to the inverse of the quantum dot volume. Especially for the smaller <b>diameters,</b> <b>deviations</b> up to a factor of 3 are found as compared to widely used literature values. The corresponding oscillator strength f(gap) is almost size-independent in the diameter range 3 - 7 nm.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} two-phase gas and liquid flow regimes {{is important in}} the proper design, operation and scale-up of pressure management and fluid handling systems {{in a wide range of}} industrial processes. This paper provides a comprehensive review of 3947 published experimental data points for gasliquid flow maps in vertical pipes and annuli, including a critical analysis of state of-the-art measurement techniques used to identify bubble, slug, churn and annular flow regimes. We examine the critical factors of pipe geometry (<b>diameters,</b> <b>deviation</b> from vertical), fluid properties and flow conditions that affect the transition from one flow regime to another. The review surveys the theoretical models available to predict flow regime transitions, and we validate the accuracy of these models using the published experimental data. The most reliable flow regime transition models for upward co-current flows are analytically shown to be: (i) Barnea 1987 for dispersed bubble to bubble flow, (ii) Taitel et al. 1980 for bubble to slug flow, (iii) Barnea 1987 for slug to churn flow, and (iv) Mishima and Ishii 1984 for churn to annular flow regime transition.

40|$|Follicle <b>diameter</b> <b>deviation</b> during {{follicular}} {{waves in}} cattle {{begins with a}} reduction in growth rates of developing subordi-nate follicles, {{in contrast to the}} maintenance of a constant growth rate by a developing dominant follicle. In experiment 1, the temporal changes encompassing deviation in concentrations of follicular fluid factors relative to one another in the three largest follicles (F 1, F 2, and F 3) were studied. Follicular fluid samples were collected when F 1 reached diameter ranges of 7. 0 â 7. 9, 8. 0 â 8. 9, 9. 0 â 9. 9, and 10. 0 â 10. 9 mm (n 5 12 per range). The first increase (P, 0. 05) in the difference between F 1 and F 2 for estradiol occurred at the 8. 0 - to 8. 9 -mm range, which was one range earlier than for diameter (P, 0. 05).

40|$|Intrafollicular {{changes in}} the largest {{follicle}} (F 1) and second-largest (F 2) follicle were examined in relation to follicle diam-eter deviation. Deviation is characterized by continued growth of the largest follicle and the cessation of growth of the smaller follicles. Granulosa cells and follicular fluid were obtained from slaughterhouse ovaries (n 5 95 pairs, experiment 1), and follic-ular fluid was collected in vivo (n 5 28 heifers, experiment 2). Several ranges in the diameter of F 1 were used to represent the progressive growth of the follicle. The diameter range with the first {{significant increase in the}} difference between F 1 and F 2 was determined for each end point and was used as an indicator of the sequence of events associated with <b>diameter</b> <b>deviation.</b> An increased difference for diameter and for estradiol concen-tration occurred (P, 0. 05) simultaneously at the 8. 5 - to 8. 9 -mm range in both experiments. In experiment 1, the increased difference between F 1 and F 2 in LH receptor (LHr) mRNA ex-pression occurred (P, 0. 05) at the 8. 0 - and 8. 4 -mm range. In F 2 of experiment 2, there was a progressive decrease (P, 0. 05) in free insulin-like growth factor (IGF) - 1 and a progressive in-crease (P, 0. 05) in IGF binding protein (BP) - 2 across the fol-licle-diameter ranges (7. 5 - 11. 2 mm). No differences were de-tected between F 1 and F 2 for 3 b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase mRNA expression in experiment 1 and testosterone, total inhib-in, and dimeric inhibin-A concentrations in experiment 2. The results indicated that the acquisition of granulosa cell LHrs by F 1, as indicated by increased LHr mRNA expression, occurred one diameter range before an increased difference between F 1 and F 2 for diameter or estradiol concentrations. On a temporal basis, it is concluded that LHr acquisition plays a role in the establishment of <b>diameter</b> <b>deviation.</b> In addition, the reduced growth of F 2 may have involved the reduced bioavailability of IGF- 1 in association with elevated IGFBPs. estradiol, follicular development, granulosa cells, growth factors, luteinizing hormone, ovar...|$|E

The friction of the system and the buoyancy of the immersed metallic spheres were predetermined. The drag on the sphere was then the only unknown.

40|$|Maintenance of {{functional}} vascular networks requires structural adaptation of vessel diameters {{in response to}} hemodynamic and metabolic conditions. The mechanisms by which diameters respond to the metabolic state are not known, but may involve the release of vasoactive substances in response to low oxygen by tissue (âtissue signalingâ, e. g., CO 2, adenosine), by vessel walls (âwall signalingâ, e. g., prostaglandins, adenosine), and/or by red blood cells (RBCs) (âRBC signalingâ, e. g., ATP and nitric oxide). Here, {{the goal was to}} test the potential of each of these locations of oxygen-dependent signaling to control steady-state vascular diameters and tissue oxygenation. A previously developed theoretical model of structural diameter adaptation based on experimental data on microvascular network morphology and hemodynamics was used. Resulting network characteristics were analyzed with regard to tissue oxygenation (Oxdef; percentage of tissue volume with Po 2 < 1 Torr) and the difference between estimated blood flow velocities and corresponding experimental data [velocity error (Verr); root mean square deviation of estimated vs. measured velocity]. Wall signaling led to Oxdef < 1 % and to the closest hemodynamic similarity (Verr: 0. 60). Tissue signaling also resulted in a low oxygen deficit, but a higher Verr (0. 73) and systematic <b>diameter</b> <b>deviations.</b> RBC signaling led to widespread hypoxia (Oxdef: 4. 7 %), unrealistic velocity distributions (Verr: 0. 81), and shrinkage of small vessels. The results suggest that wall signaling plays a central role in structural control of vessel diameters in microvascular networks of given angioarchitecture.

The {{aim of this study}} is to develop and validate a workflow to simulate the implantation prior to the intervention. Based on the simulation outcome, the amount of leakage is estimated in order to evaluate the risk of a severe complication. A finite element model of the stent implantation in 10 patients was created based on a pre-operative computed tomography scan. All 10 patients also received a follow-up computed tomography scan, after the implantation. This scan was used to extract the deformed geometry of the stent and the position of the calcifications for validation of the simulation results. The maximal average perimeter difference between the simulated stent and the post-operative stent is 2. 9 Â± 2. 1 mm, and occurs at the bottom of the device. The sensitivity of the simulation to the soft tissue material parameters and aortic root wall thickness was tested. The maximal <b>diameter</b> <b>deviation</b> of 6 % occurred when the thickness of the aortic root was doubled. The result of the leakage analysis based on the distance between the simulated stent and the surrounding aortic root corresponded well when no regurgitation was observed. The developed tools have the potential to reduce the occurrence and severity of leakage by providing the clinician with additional information prior to the intervention.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, to {{construct}} an airframe 2 -layer composite materials consisting of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates and TiAl 6 V 4 {{still need to be}} machined, whereby drill holes are frequently machined. Special attention has to be paid to the machining quality, which implies hole dimensional accuracy, defect free peripheral zone, edge quality at inlet and outlet of hole and so on. Machining defects often occur as a consequence of excessive mechanical and thermal loads, which are often caused by wrong process conditions or by the wrong choice of machining process itself. With respect to widely used state-of-the-art machine tools providing high performance and equipped with potent control unit, for the comparatively large drill hole, circular milling gains interest {{as an alternative to the}} drilling operation [1, 2]. In this research, in order to select suitable machining conditions for 2 -layer composite materials consisting of CFRP laminates and TiAl 6 V 4 a large number of circular milling tests of 6 mm diameter are executed by using a high performance vertical milling machine. Hole <b>diameter</b> <b>deviation</b> from 6 mm and inner surface roughness in relation to number of hole machined are measured and evaluated for CFRP laminates and TiAl 6 V 4.

To further elucidate potential mechanisms controlling dominant follicle selection, granulosa cell RNA harvested from F 1 (largest) and F 2 (second largest) follicles isolated at predeviation (PD) and onset of <b>diameter</b> <b>deviation</b> (OD) stages of the first follicular wave was subjected to preliminary RNA transcriptome analysis. Expression of numerous WNT system components was observed. Hence experiments were performed {{to test the hypothesis}} that WNT signaling modulates FSH action on granulosa cells during follicular waves. Abundance of mRNA for WNT pathway members was evaluated in granulosa cells harvested from follicles at emergence (EM), PD, OD and early dominance (ED) stages of the first follicular wave. In F 1 follicles, abundance of CTNNB 1 and DVL 1 mRNAs was higher and AXIN 2 mRNA was lower at ED versus EM stages and DVL 1 and FZD 6 mRNAs were higher and AXIN 2 mRNA was lower in F 1 versus F 2 follicle at the ED stage. Bovine granulosa cells were treated in vitro with increasing doses of the WNT inhibitor IWR- 1 +/ 2 maximal stimulatory dose of FSH.

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the effect of turbulence intensity on frazil formation and evolution a series of experiments were undertaken at the Hydraulics Research & Testing Facility in the University of Manitoba using a counter-rotating flume. Five sets of bed plates ranging in roughness from roughened PVC to 20 mm gravel were used to generate turbulence in the flume. Velocity measurements were made using a constant temperature anemometer with a conical hot-film probe. The ability to rotate the flume walls at any given rate enabled the researchers to perform experiments where the average velocity was kept virtually constant, while the turbulence intensity increased with increasing bed roughness. Measurements of water and air temperature as well as digital images taken during ice formation were analyzed. It was found that although turbulence intensity seemed to have an effect on several of the key features of a supercooling curve, the relationships were not particularly strong. The most significant finding is the mean <b>diameter</b> and standard <b>deviation</b> of the frazil disks seem to reach nearly constant values after several minutes of supercooling, and that these values were strongly affected by turbulence intensity.

First, we model the vessels as a collection of linear structures which are detected using multi-scale filtering techniques. Second, we develop machine-learning based level set segmentation methods to separate the vessels from the background, based on the output of the filtering. In many applications the three-dimensional structure of the vascular tree has to be presented to a radiologist or a member of the medical staff. For this, a visualization technique such as direct volume rendering is often used. In the case of computed tomography angiography one has to take into account that the image depends on both the geometrical structure of the vascular tree and the varying concentration of the injected contrast agent. The visualization should have an easy to understand interpretation for the user, to make diagnostical interpretations reliable. The mapping from the image data to the visualization should therefore closely follow routines that are commonly used by the radiologist. We developed an automatic method which adapts the visualization locally to the contrast agent, revealing a larger portion of the vascular tree while minimizing the manual intervention required from the radiologist. The effectiveness of this method is evaluated in a user study involving radiologists as domain experts...|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} work {{was carried out}} on a CNC lathe (5.5 Â kW spindle power and 3500 Â rpm maximum rotational speed). Due {{to the importance of}} the dry machining in the modern industry, the tests were performed under the dry condition without any fluid, gas, and/or solid coolant. Standard CBN inserts (ISO code CNGA 120404 S 010 - 30 A, CNGA 120408 S 010 - 30 A, CNGA 120412 S 010 - 30 A) made by Sandvikâ¢ Coromant were used as the cutting tools with the following geometry: clearance angle = 0 Â°, chamfer angle = 30 Â°, chamfer width = 0.10 Â mm, edge thickness = 4.76 Â mm, edge length = 12 Â mm, and rhombic tip angle = 80 Â°. The same inserts with different nose radius of 0.4 Â mm, 0.8 Â mm, and 1.2 Â mm were used for analysis of the nose radius effect. In order to have a stable cutting condition, each experiment was performed with a new sharp insert. The inserts grade was CB 7025, which is completely suitable for hard turning operation. The tool holder used in the experiments was standard DCBNR/L- 2525 [*]M. According to the cutting tool manufacturerâs recommendation, the inserts were clamped on the holder with the tightening torque of 3.9 Â Nm. Round bars of MDN 250 steel with 35 Â mm diameter and 85 Â mm length were used for the experiments. In order to increase the hardness of the steel, according to the ASM International standard, the round bars have been heated at about 850 Â Â°C for 75 Â min, and then quickly quenched in the water (Dossett and Boyer 2006). Subsequent aging was performed for approximately 3 Â h at a temperature of 500 Â Â°C to produce a fine dispersion of Ni 3 (X,Y) intermetallic phases along the dislocations left by martensitic transformation, where X and Y are solute elements added for such precipitation. A pre-cut with 0.5 Â mm cutting depth was performed before hardening the steel to remove the rusts and oxide layers {{from the surface of the}} workpiece. Finally, the hardness level of 55 HRC was obtained by performing the heat treatment method for the round bars of MDN 250 steel. Average surface roughness (Ra) values were recorded with a Surftest 301 MitutoyoÂ® roughness meter set to a cut-off of 0.8 Â mm. The surface roughness values were measured at five equally spaced locations along the cutting length. The average of this five roughness values was taken as the arithmetic surface roughness value (Ra). This measuring process was repeated three times for each test and their average was considered as the final surface roughness. A piezoelectric type vibration meter was used to measure and recorded the acceleration of the radial holder vibration. Three forces component, i.e., feed force, cutting force, and radial force, was measured precisely by using a Kistler piezoelectric turning dynamometer and a signal amplifier connected to a control unit, data acquisition board and microcomputer. The maximum flank wear (VBmax) was measured using a TM 505 MitutoyoÂ® toolmakerâs microscope with 1 Â Î¼m resolution. The dimensional accuracy, which is defined as the difference between the desired cutting depth and the obtained depth of cut, was determined by measuring the final dimensional deviation. The <b>diameter</b> <b>deviation</b> was measured using a precision dial gauge with an accuracy of Â±[*] 0.01 Â mm. <b>Diameter</b> <b>deviation</b> was measured at five equally spaced points along the cutting length and the average of these five values considered as the final dimensional deviation value. In this paper, insert nose radius, feed rate, cutting depth, and speed were considered as the processing parameters. The values of the variables were chosen according to the recommendation of the cutting tool catalogs. In order to conduct a comprehensive study, the cutting depth and feed speed with a wider range were selected compared with the ranges chosen by the previous researchers in the hard turning operation. Furthermore, to increase the confidence level of the results, all the measurements were repeated three times for each test.|$|E
40|$|This text {{presents}} a {{design of a}} device {{to be used for}} scanning gas pipeline external surface damaged by water corrosion. The corrosion defects appears when a protection on pipeline is damaged. Water than can infiltrate on a metal surface and cause corrosion. An area of these defects is from square centimetres to square decimetres. These defects have shape as different deep pits. The pits depth can achieve fifty percent of pipeline wall thickness. The defects are searched by ultrasonic sensing head on mobile devices, which goes through pipeline. It can only find the defects, but it cannot define accurate extent and shape of the defects. Then the pipeline must be uncovered on places with defects and cleaned. Our device provides a 3 D-map of the scanned surface {{in the form of the}} defect surface deviation from an ideal cylindrical shape. These 3 D-map data obtained serve as input data for the remaining carrying capacity assessment of the pipeline by means of the finite element method (FEM). The device applies a polar co-ordinate system that seems to be the most suitable one for this task. A relatively small mass of the device, together with its battery feeding, enables an easy manipulation in field conditions. The device is able to operate when being attached in any position on the pipe surface. The area scanned by the apparatus can in maximum reach 550 x 300 mm in the longitudinal and circumferential pipe directions, respectively. If a larger area of a pipe defect is to be scanned it is possible to connect more sections alongside. In order to achieve a sufficient measuring speed, e. g., 70 points per minute, the device operation is based on contact-less optical measuring methods. When using a short measuring step of 1 mm, as many as 165 000 scanned points are attained in 40 minutes. The device can scan tubes with diameter from 500 mm to 1400 mm. The measuring method is optical triangulation. A narrow light beam from semiconductor laser with collimating lens is projected perpendicularly to the surface. A small light spot is made on measuring tube. A disperse light from this spot is projected by lens to the light detector. it is possible to transfer a position of the spot image on the detector to the surface distance from the sensing head. As light detector we used position sensitive diode (PSD). The optical sensing head is moved above pipeline surface in two directions. One direction is longitudinal in line and second direction is along arc to keep the sensing head in suitable distance from cylindrical surface. A computer provides control and setting of the device. Software collects data from the device and converts it to the applicable form for the following analysis. Because the device measure surface deviation from a base cylindrical surface, that is fixed, all deviation must be convert to the shape deviation in relation of actual tube <b>diameter.</b> <b>Deviation</b> can be displayed as 3 D shape graph.

Measurement of a <b>diameter</b> or roundness <b>deviation</b> for the full profile are well known and commonly used process. However, in many cases {{it is necessary to}} measure an element with a incomplete contour. This paper presents results of research on the impact of the incomplete contour length on a <b>diameter</b> and form <b>deviations.</b> We studied the roundness of standard ring with deviation around 0. 9 Î¼m and an element of three-lobbing deviation of 37 Î¼m. In both cases, the nominal diameter of the ring was 100 mm. The study was conducted in two stages. The first one was connected with measurement of the roundness deviation for sections 180 Â°, 90 Â°, 45 Â° while the reference was 36 Â°. Measurements were carried out on a CMM and a formtester (FMM). Results show that for the standard ring with decreasing length of the incomplete contour followed by a decrease of roundness. In the case of the three - lobbing ring the section 180 Â° has a form difference value coincides with the value for full profile, while for shorter angular sections those values are greatly diminished. In the second stage, detailed studies that apply measuring sections from 360 Â° to 10 Â° grading in 1 Â° were conducted. Measurements were made for different positions of measuring sections according to the extremes of the outline. The values obtained for the ring with three - lobbing character of form deviation allow to conclude that the diameter remains practically constant for sections up to 210 Â°. Then there is a change in their value which depends on the position of the outline section in relation to extremes. Also the roundness deviation value is constant up to about 210 Â° and then falls and the around 36 Â° reaches value below 1 Î¼m. The studies lead to the conclusion that there is a strong influence of angular measurement section and its position relative to the outlines extremes on achieved the <b>diameter</b> and form <b>deviations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Polymerase chain reaction-single {{stranded}} conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) {{analysis was}} used to investigate variation in the ovine KAP 6 - 3 gene (KRTAP 6 - 3) in 383 Merino Ã Southdown-cross lambs from four sire-lines, and to determine whether this variation affects wool traits. Five PCR-SSCP banding patterns, representing five different nucleotide sequences, were detected, including four previously identified (named A, B, C, and F) variants and one newly identified (named G) variant. A new non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and a 45 -bp deletion were detected in variant G. Of the three common genotypes (AA, AB, and AG) identified in these sheep, wool from sheep that were AG, on average, had a lower mean fibre diameter (MFD), fibre <b>diameter</b> standard <b>deviation</b> (FDSD), and prickle factor (PF) than wool from AA sheep, whereas wool from AB sheep, on average, had a higher MFD, FDSD, and PF than wool from AA sheep. This suggests that variation in ovine KRTAP 6 - 3 affect MFD, FDSD, and PF, and that this gene may have potential for use as a gene-maker for improving fibre diameter-associated wool traits...|$|R

Methods: Thirty-nine eyes (8 healthy, 19 glaucoma suspects and 12 glaucoma) from 49 subjects were scanned twice using swept-source (SS 2) OCT in a 3. 563. 563. 64 mm (40064006896 pixels) volume centered on the optic nerve head, with the focus readjusted after each scan. The LC was automatically segmented and analyzed for microarchitectural parameters, including pore diameter, pore <b>diameter</b> standard <b>deviation</b> (SD), pore aspect ratio, pore area, beam thickness, beam thickness SD, and beam thickness to pore diameter ratio. Reproducibility of the parameters was assessed by computing the imprecision of the parameters between the scans. Results: The automated segmentation demonstrated excellent reproducibility. All LC microarchitecture parameters had an imprecision of less or equal to 4. 2 %. There was little variability in imprecision with respect to diagnostic category, although the method tends to show higher imprecision amongst healthy subjects.

A 5 -Î¼L aliquot of particles was applied to a 7.0 -nm-thick carbon-coated copper grid purchased from Dr. Stephen Jett (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA) and allowed to dry. The samples were then imaged on a Hitachi 7500 TEM with an acceleration voltage of 80 Â kV. The resultant TEM images were analyzed using ImageJ Software [12]. At least 200 particles were counted, per sample. A region of interest (ROI) was drawn around each particle, and the mean Feret <b>diameters</b> and standard <b>deviations</b> were calculated.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe have {{developed}} a versatile catalyst-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique for the synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) from discrete nickel nanoparticles (average diameter of 4. 7 Â± 1. 5 nm). Atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron diffraction are used to characterize these as-grown nanotubes. On a particular sample {{we found that the}} SWNTs have an average chiral angle of 25. 3 Â°.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedMethods of measuring soot particle densities {{have been of}} interest for several decades. Plume signature determination of both rocket and air-breathing engines is of concern when applied to pollution and theater missile ballistic defense strategies. Application of non-intrusive traditional techniques employing Bouguer's law relied on Sauter mean <b>diameter,</b> statistical <b>deviation</b> and the probability density function in order {{to compensate for the}} ambiguities present in the extension of classical Mie theory. Our investigation developed an apparatus which will determine soot particle densities by measuring extinction from absorption of light energy transmitted through an exhaust plume. The method used was a two-pass technique using an optical phase conjugator (OPC) which returned the non-absorbed portion of light energy. When the apparatus was used with a retroreflector, it produced accurate results but did not compensate for thermal blooming or beam steering. Characteristics of a photorefractive crystal used in the OPC process allowed for the return of an incident beam corrected for aberrations. Although the OPC returned the phase conjugate of the incident beam its size precluded the return of all of the transmitted data because data was lost on the blossomed beam. U. S.
