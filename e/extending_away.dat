25|$|Hail {{forms in}} a very intense updraft in a {{supercell}} or a multicellular thunderstorm. As for tornadoes, BWER detection and a tilted updraft are indicative of that updraft but {{does not lead to}} predict hail. The presence of a hail spike in the reflectivity pattern is an important clue. It is an area of weak reflectivity <b>extending</b> <b>away</b> from the radar immediately behind a thunderstorm with hail. It is caused by radiation from the radar bouncing from hailstone to hailstone or the ground before being reflected back to the radar. The time delay between the backscattered radiation from the storm and the one with multiple paths causes the reflectivity from the hail to appear to come from a farther range than the actual storm. However, this artefact is visible mostly for extremely large hail.|$|E
25|$|The main {{building}} {{dates from the}} early 1930s, when the school moved to the site, and is characterised by its arches and clock tower in the Mission Revival architecture style. The Rudd and Hamilton wings, built in 1963, form a T-shape <b>extending</b> <b>away</b> from the {{main building}}, and the modern glass fronted Resource Centre, built in 1996, fills the quadrant. Other buildings on the site include McKenzie wing (built in 1983), Barbara Helen Thomson Sports Complex (opened in 1987), Birtles wing (built in 1973). The main Junior School precinct was completed in early 2008, and a separate building catering exclusively to Prep students was completed in 2007. The Junior School precinct was designed {{in light of the}} introduction of Years Prep to Grade 3 in 2007. The old College Hall (built in 1979) was demolished in late September 2009 and a brand new College Hall was constructed and opened in early June 2011. The present College Hall includes an air conditioned auditorium capable of seating 695 people, the Phil Bisset Gallery, and facilities for the music department.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{designed}} a two-story portico with five arches that faced east toward the city’s skyline. The arches and their tapered support columns were clad in creamy Texas shellstone. The remaining three {{sides of the}} 20,000-square-foot building were also covered with shellstone cladding. Sheltered by the arched portico, the museum's front wall consisted of a two-story curtain of glass windows with bronze mullions. The main entrance lead directly into a two-story hall adorned with {{the same type of}} shellstone used on the exterior, teak wall coverings, and a floor of pink and gray granite. Beyond the main hall were five small galleries of equal size for the display of art. On the mezzanine level were five similar galleries, each with a balcony that overlooked the main hall. These mezzanine galleries served as library and office spaces. To take advantage of the expanse between the two-story portico and the site’s eastern boundary, Johnson {{designed a}} series of broad steps and terraces <b>extending</b> <b>away</b> from the building, with an expansive sunken, grassy plaza as the centerpiece, pointing toward the city’s center.|$|E

2500|$|The switch {{is turned}} on, and a channel has been created, which allows current between the drain and source. Since the drain voltage {{is higher than}} the source voltage, the {{electrons}} spread out, and conduction is not through a narrow channel but through a broader, two- or three-dimensional current distribution <b>extending</b> <b>away</b> from the interface and deeper in the substrate. The onset of this region is also known as pinch-off to indicate the lack of channel region near the drain. Although the channel does not extend the full length of the device, the electric field between the drain and the channel is very high, and conduction continues. The drain current is now weakly dependent upon drain voltage and controlled primarily by the gate–source voltage, and modeled approximately as: ...|$|E
60|$|We there found parties, with an acquaintance, who was going, {{with two}} French gentlemen, into the vaults. It {{is a good}} deal like going down into a mine, each visitor being {{provided}} with a lamp {{at the end of a}} stick; and following the guide along dismal passages, running beneath the streets, and <b>extending</b> <b>away</b> interminably,--roughly arched overhead with stone, from which depend festoons of a sort of black fungus, caused by the exhalations of the wine. Nothing was ever uglier than this fungus. It is strange that the most ethereal effervescence of rich wine can produce nothing better.|$|E
60|$|The first {{impression}} which I received when I had recovered my breath {{was of the}} extraordinary view over the country which we had traversed. The whole Brazilian plain seemed to lie beneath us, <b>extending</b> <b>away</b> and away until it ended in dim blue mists upon the farthest sky-line. In the foreground was the long slope, strewn with rocks and dotted with tree-ferns; farther off in the middle distance, looking over the saddle-back hill, I could just see the yellow and green mass of bamboos through which we had passed; and then, gradually, the vegetation increased until it formed the huge forest which extended {{as far as the}} eyes could reach, and for a good two thousand miles beyond.|$|E

60|$|The {{formation}} of the region was curious. There was {{a drop in the}} land, as it were, to a lower level. From their elevated position the three men could see a turbulent river rushing far below, {{at the base of the}} cliffs on the edge of which they stood. Beyond lay a magnificent and varied stretch of forest scenery, <b>extending</b> <b>away</b> to the horizon, where the prospect terminated in a blue range of hills. No path was at first visible by which the fugitives could reach the plain below. The precipice was almost perpendicular. They were about to leap recklessly over, and trust to descending by means of an occasional bush or shrub which grew on the rocky face, when the negro uttered one of his falsetto exclamations.|$|E

Still, his [...] "shortest way" [...] to Montevideo continued to puzzle me considerably. For {{two or three hours}} we had been riding nearly parallel to a range of hills, or cuchilla, <b>extending</b> <b>away</b> on our left hand towards the south-east. But we were gradually drawing nearer to it, and apparently going purposely out of our way only to traverse a most lonely and difficult country. The few estancia houses we passed, perched on the highest points of the great sweep of moor-like country on our right, appeared to be very far away. Where we rode there were no habitations, not even a shepherd's hovel; the dry, stony soil was thinly covered with a forest of dwarf thorn-trees, and a scanty pasturage burnt to a rust-brown colour by the summer heats; and out of this arid region rose the hills, their brown, woodless sides looking strangely gaunt and desolate in the fierce noonday sun.|$|E
60|$|All that I {{remember}} of {{my early}} life {{at this place}} comes {{between the ages of}} three or four and five; a period which, to the eye of memory, appears like a wide plain blurred over with a low-lying mist, with here and there a group of trees, a house, a hill, or other large object, standing out in the clear air with marvellous distinctness. The picture that most often presents itself is of the cattle coming home in the evening; the green quiet plain <b>extending</b> <b>away</b> from the gate to the horizon; the western sky flushed with sunset hues, and the herd of four or five hundred cattle trotting homewards with loud lowings and bellowings, raising a great cloud of dust with their hoofs, while behind gallop the herdsmen urging them on with wild cries. Another picture is of my mother {{at the close of the}} day, when we children, after our supper of bread and milk, join in a last grand frolic on the green before the house. I see her sitting out of doors watching our sport with a smile, her book lying in her lap, and the last rays of the setting sun shining on her face.|$|E
