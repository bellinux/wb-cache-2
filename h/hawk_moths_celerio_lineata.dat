5000|$|Among {{the more}} {{important}} moth pollinator groups are the <b>hawk</b> <b>moths</b> of the family Sphingidae. Their behavior is similar to hummingbirds, i.e., using rapid wing beats to hover in front of flowers. Most <b>hawk</b> <b>moths</b> are nocturnal or crepuscular, so moth-pollinated flowers (e.g., Silene latifolia [...] ) tend to be white, night-opening, large, and showy with tubular corollae and a strong, sweet scent produced in the evening, night, or early morning. A lot of nectar is produced to fuel the high metabolic rates needed to power their flight. Other moths (e.g., noctuids, geometrids, pyralids) fly slowly and settle on the flower. They do not require as much nectar as the fast-flying <b>hawk</b> <b>moths,</b> and the flowers tend to be small (though they may be aggregated in heads).|$|R

2500|$|An {{alternative}} path {{by which}} A.sesquipedale could have evolved that differed with Darwin and Wallace's explanation was proposed by Lutz Thilo Wasserthal in 1997. According to Wasserthal, <b>hawk</b> <b>moths</b> could have evolved long proboscises as a predatory avoidance strategy from heteropodid spiders. Since such spiders {{have been known}} to jump at hovering moths in an attempt at eating them, <b>hawk</b> <b>moths</b> would be at risk when visiting flowers if such a spider was nearby. Based on this reasoning moths with longer tongues would be less at risk when pollinating flowers since they would be farther away and thus a more challenging target for jumping spiders. [...] As a result, nature would select for <b>hawk</b> <b>moths</b> with longer and longer probosces. The flowers of A.sesquipedale on the other hand would be evolving longer spurs since flowers with longer spurs are more likely to become fertilized by long tongued moths. In other words, the flowers evolve long spurs to fit the pollinators and not the reverse. It has also been observed that the moths will swing side to side when feeding, presumably to evade jumping spiders. Possible problems with this hypothesis is that active predation by spiders on <b>hawk</b> <b>moths</b> visiting flowers has not been observed. It has also been suggested that flying predators such as bats and birds are the more likely predators to <b>hawk</b> <b>moths.</b> Whether or not the pollinator shift model or the coevolution model, or even {{a little bit of both}} are correct is currently the subject of debate.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study of the aerodynamics of an elliptical flap plate wing in pitch-plunge motion. Several wing motion kinematics are derived from the kinematics of the Agrius Convolvuli (<b>hawk</b> <b>moth)</b> in hover. The experiments are conducted at a Reynolds number of 4, 800 and reduced frequency of 0. 38, which are typical of the <b>hawk</b> <b>moth</b> flight. Three cases are reported: the <b>hawk</b> <b>moth</b> kinematics in which the elevation angle is ignored, the <b>hawk</b> <b>moth</b> kinematics with a correction to account for elevation angle effects, and a harmonic pitch-plunge kinematic of the same frequency and amplitude as the <b>hawk</b> <b>moth</b> kinematics. In all cases the wing pivots about the leading edge. The experiments are performed in The University of Michigan water channel. The wing model used has a Zimmerman planform shape with aspect ratio 3. 87. Phase averaged force measurements are reported. Average thrust coefficients of 2. 79, 2. 64 and 2. 39, respectively, are measured for the three cases. The measured peak thrust coefficients are 5. 0, 4. 8 and 6. 1, respectively. The propulsion figure of merit in hover was also measured and found to be 0. 47, 0. 48 and 0. 49 for the three cases. The flow evolution was measured using PIV. The results show formation of Leading Edge Vortices (LEV) and Trailing Edge Vortices (TEV) at different phases of the motion which depend on the particular kinematics. The relation between LEV and TEV vortex evolution and force generation is discussed. Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
