40|$|Recent {{interest}} in the urban transport challenges posed by the <b>demographic</b> <b>outlook</b> of ageing societies has prompted {{a growing body of}} scholarship on the subject. The focus of this paper is on the topic of elderly trip generation and the development of models to help formalise some important relationships between trip-making behaviour and personal, household and contextual variables (such as location). The case study is the Hamilton Metropolitan Area-an important functional component of Greater Toronto, itself one of the regions in Canada where the impact of ageing is expected to be most strongly felt. Using data from Toronto's Transport Tomorrow Survey and mixed ordered probit models, the study investigates the question of spatial and demographic variability in trip-making behaviour. The results support the proposition that trip-making propensity decreases with age. However, it is also found that this behaviour is not spatially homogeneous and in fact exhibits a large degree of variability-a finding that highlights both the challenges of planning transport for the elderly and the potential of spatial analytical approaches to improve transport modelling practice...|$|E

40|$|The {{presentation}} {{intends to}} analyse population change in Romania after 1989 in a regional prospective. Absolute population {{change and the}} changes in the age structure as well as internal and international migrations are put into relation to the labour market changes. In the last two decades the Romanian regions experienced a decline of fertility and an increase in the share of the working age population. The share of the population 65 years and older is still relatively low. This demographic situation, combined with a weak labour market (low labour force demand) leads to various forms of underemployment of the active population and to high emigration. Romanians are the most numerous EU-immigrants to EU- 27 Member States. The demographic and economic importance of these migration flows will be analysed and their mid- and long-term sustainability will be discussed. The <b>demographic</b> <b>outlook</b> for the future decades and the possible consequences for the labour force supply are based on the various scenarios and international and national population projections for Romania at regional level.

30|$|There {{are many}} reasons why labor {{mobility}} matters for productivity and growth. A country with a more mobile labor force uses available resources more effectively and {{is more likely to}} better match its human capital to other factors—both those that are more fluid such as capital, and those that do not move at all such as land. Recent work indicates that labor mobility is critical for social cohesion and the improvement of welfare in lagging regions 15. When people move, they create links between places where economic activity is densely concentrated and those where it is not. These links become channels for resources that flow back to peoples’ places of origin in the form of knowhow and remittances, that sustain the welfare of family members left behind and lead to investments in locally appropriate enterprises. Through these channels, increased labor mobility also contributes to economic convergence within countries, between leading and lagging regions, but also between countries, helping the new member states to achieve the living standards of the older member states. A mobile labor force can better adjust to shocks, and recover more quickly. Given its <b>demographic</b> <b>outlook</b> and the decline in the working-age population, increased labor mobility will be needed in Europe. And {{there is a lot of}} room for it.|$|E

Thus, this paper will only briefly analyze the endowments and the macroeconomic competitiveness of Colombia before deep diving into the software cluster of Bogota analyzing first the context in which it operates, Bogota, before taking {{a closer look at the}} cluster itself.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Combating terrorism and ensuring homeland security have created urgent claims on the nation's attention and on the federal budget. Although an economic recovery seems to be underway, the recession that began last spring has had real consequences for the budget. At the same time, the fiscal pressures created by the retirement {{of the baby boomers}} and rising health care costs continue unchanged. However, the surpluses also put the nation in a stronger position to respond to the events of September 11 and to the economic slowdown. The nation's commitment to surpluses will be tested. A return to surplus will require sustained discipline and difficult choices. Because the longer-term outlook is driven in large part by known <b>demographic</b> trends, the <b>outlook</b> 20 years from now is surer than the forecast for the next few years. The message of GAO's updated simulations remains the same as last year: absent structural changes in entitlement programs for the elderly, persistent deficits and escalating debt will overwhelm the budget in the long term. Both longer-term and new commitments undertaken after September 11 sharpen the need for competing claims and new priorities. A fundamental review of existing programs and activities is necessary both to increase fiscal flexibility and to make government fit the modern world.

40|$|Pension and {{retirement}} policies have changed dramatically in recent years, as governments {{have tried to}} balance the goals of adequate retirement incomes and the long-term financial sustainability of pension systems {{in the face of}} population ageing. Pensions at a Glance 2009 provides a consistent framework for comparing pension policies between countries along with reliable data. This third edition updates information on key features of pension provision in OECD countries and provides projections of retirement income for todays workers. It offers an expanded range of indicators, including measures of assets, investment performance, coverage of private pensions, public pension spending, and the <b>demographic</b> context and <b>outlook.</b> Four special chapters provide an in-depth look at important issues in pension policy today. The first examines the implications of the present financial and economic crisis on pension systems. Which countries and which individuals are most affected? What can governments do to help and which policies should they avoid? The second looks at incomes and poverty of older people, looking at trends over the past two decades. In many countries, the position of pensioners has improved relative to the population as a whole, but there remain pockets of old-age poverty. The third updates the analysis of pension reforms in the second edition of Pensions at a Glance. How have pension systems changed in the period 2004 ‑ 08 ? The final special chapter considers coverage of voluntary private pensions, extending the analysis to look at how this varies with age and earnings. It also evaluates five different policies to expand coverage. This book includes StatLinks, URLs under each graph and table linking to Excel® files containing the underlying data. An extraordinarily useful and careful compilation of pension information for a wide-range of countries, presented in a common format and following a thoughtful structure.

40|$|This report {{reviews the}} current {{development}} {{of housing and}} mortgage market in the SEACEN region; identifies factors influencing housing prices and rents {{as well as the}} mortgage markets; and attempts to better understand the interactions among housing and mortgage markets with other economic variables and with respect to financial stability. The study also recommmends measures to develop the housing and mortgage markets that will be sustainable and beneficial to the conduct of monetary policy. The study finds that rapid growth in housing and mortgage markets in the SEACEN region is mainly due to a rapid growth of population and urbanisation, benign economic environment, increased per capita income, and rapid economic growth. In terms of policy, while different countries have different policies to support housing, in general the main premise of government policy has been to support housing solutions, especially for the poor. Thus governments have largely focused on low-cost housing. The middle and high-cost segments of the market have been mainly market determined. According to available literature, the principal factors affecting housing price include household incomes, interest rates, household formation or other demographic variables, supply side variables, financial market institutions and credit availability, taxes, subsidies, and other public policies directly related to housing. Empirical results of some SEACEN countries are consistent with this view. The Malaysian country paper pointed out that housing price are determined by real income per capita, people's expectations on future income and economic <b>outlook,</b> <b>demographic</b> characteristic factor, real lending rates, and total loans outstanding in the banking system. Using the Granger Causality Test, the Taiwan country paper showed that real GDP, M 2 and stock prices influences housing price with several quarter lags. The study by Chen and Patel in 2002 showed that the strongest factor determining housing price is the household income. A 1 % increase in household income will lead to increase in housing price by 1. 88 %. Meanwhile, on the supply side, 1 % increase in the construction cost will increase the housing price by 0. 70 %. Thailand's country paper also found evidence of a strong causal link from monetary policy to property prices. An increase in the policy rate raises short term interest rates which in turn increase the cost of loans and reduce the demand for credit by both developers and consumers. This consequently decreases housing demand and investment which in turn contributes to a fall in property prices. The link between housing markets and other parts of economy operates mainly through the impact of housing price fluctuations, as they represent the main source of household wealth. Private consumption and investment, and hence output growth, were affected through wealth and balance-sheet effects. Sharp falls in housing prices led to a large-scale deterioration in asset quality and in the profitability of the banking industry, particularly for those banks that were deeply involved in housing or housing-related lending businesses. They undermined the value of bank capital, reducing the banks' lending capacity, and in the extreme case could jeopardise the stability of the financial system as a whole. Empirical evidence in Malaysia suggested that house price move closely to the real output of the economy. The strength of this correlation had increased since the Asian financial crisis, from positive 0. 6 in 1997 to positive 0. 8 in 2004. Using the Granger Causality Test, Taiwan pointed out that house price causes CPI inflations, M 2 and bank loans rates. However, experience of some countries have shown that the impact of housing price on the macroeconomy could be limited. In a study done by Meng in 2002, {{it was found that the}} fluctuations in private residential housing prices do not play a very significant role in Singapore's economy. There are several reasons for this: (i) housing market in Singapore is dominated by public housing, (ii) public housing prices are controlled by the government, (iii) anti-speculative measures introduced in 1996 have reduced homeowners' ability to cash their capital gains when prices rise and also reduced the risk of negative equity when prices fall, (iv) less dependence on the domestic financial system as a source of financing due to the significant presence of multi national corporations in Singapore, (v) and Singapore's highly open global trade. The study also suggested that capital markets could provide an attractive and potentially large source of long term funding for housing, for both developers and investors. Besides financial institutions, developers can take advantage of the capital market as an alternative source of funding. Investors can also diversify their investment portfolio to property funds besides bond and debt instruments. In this regard, the recent rebound in global economies has facilitated further growth in domestic bond markets as well as asset-backed securities in many countries. Securitisation provides a vehicle for mobilising long term savings and is thus very helpful in stmulating domestic housing markets. In addition, securitisation can help broaden the institutional investor base, increase transparency and deepen domestic bond markets. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} national {{scenarios of}} economic activity (GDP) for the time period 1990 to 2100 based on three scenarios (A 2, B 1, and B 2) from the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES; Nakicenovic et al, 2000). Two scenarios (B 1 and B 2) follow (with minor adjustments due to scenario improvements) the original SRES quantifications {{at the level of}} 4 and 11 world regions respectively. The quantification of the original SRES A 2 scenario has been revised in order to reflect recent changing perceptions on the <b>demographic</b> <b>outlook</b> of world population growth. In this revised “high population growth” scenario A 2 world population reaches some 12 billion by 2100 (as opposed to some 15 billion in the original SRES A 2 scenario) and is characterized by a “delayed fertility transition” that is also mirrored in a delayed (economic) development catch-up. Our downscaling approach emphasizes the scenario dependency of the national development path. I. e., national income convergence within a region varies across the scenarios and is guided by the scenario’s specific assumptions for convergence on the macro-regional level. The approach explicitly distinguishes also between countries at different stages of economic development as opposed to earlier downscaling approaches which have employed the (by now widely recognized) problematic method of regionally uniform growth rates as downscaling algorithm. While the results are similar at the regional level to SRES, there are significant differences compared to earlier results from downscaling at the national level...|$|E
40|$|We report here {{spatially}} explicit scenario interpretations {{for population}} and economic activity (GDP) {{for the time}} period 1990 to 2100 based on three scenarios (A 2, B 1, and B 2) from the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). At the highest degree of spatial detail, the scenario indicators are calculated at a 0. 5 by 0. 5 degree resolution. All three scenarios follow the qualitative scenario characteristics, as outlined in the original SRES scenarios. Two scenarios (B 1 and B 2) also follow (with minor adjustments due to scenario improvements) the original SRES quantifications {{at the level of}} 4 and 11 world regions respectively. The quantification of the original SRES A 2 scenario has been revised to reflect recent changing perceptions on the <b>demographic</b> <b>outlook</b> of world population growth. In this revised "high population growth" scenario, A 2 r world population reaches some 12 billion by 2100 (as opposed to some 15 billion in the original SRES A 2 scenario) and is characterized by a "delayed fertility transition" that is also mirrored in a delayed (economic) development catch-up, resulting in an initially stagnating and subsequently only very slow reduction in income disparities. The spatially explicit scenario interpretation proceeds via two steps. Through a combination of decomposition and optimization methods, world regional scenario results are first disaggregated to the level of 185 countries. In a subsequent second step, national results are further disaggregated to a grid cell level, taking urbanization and regional (rural-urban) income disparities explicitly into account. A distinguishing feature of the spatially explicit scenario results reported here is that both methodologies, as well as numerical assumptions underlying the "downscaling" exercise, are 'scenario-dependent', leading to distinctly different spatial patterns of population and economic activities across the three scenarios examined...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Now in its 20 th edition, {{the annual}} Employment in Europe report {{has become an}} {{indispensable}} aid for analysis that supports the European Commission and the Member States in their joint efforts {{to develop and implement}} effective policies in the field of employment under the Lisbon strategy. This year’s report comes in the midst of very uncertain times for the European – and indeed the global – economy. Following several years of sound economic growth and generally very strong employment expansion, the European Union now faces a significant risk of a cyclical downturn {{for the first time since}} the Lisbon strategy was relaunched. A major test undoubtedly lies ahead. In recent years, the Member States and the Commission have together made significant efforts to implement far-reaching employment reforms and improve the performance of European labour markets. I believe that these coordinated reforms put our labour markets in a better position than a few years ago to deal with the adverse employment impact of an economic downturn. In these uncertain times we must not lose sight of our overall long-term aim of creating more and better jobs. As this report shows, promoting job quality can rhyme with job creation and productivity. Short-term measures may be needed in many Member States if they are to respond to the immediate economic and social needs arising for their citizens out of the current crisis. Such measures should, however, be consistent with our ongoing efforts to prepare the EU labour markets structurally for the challenges of the 21 st century. One of the most important of these challenges is the <b>demographic</b> <b>outlook,</b> which suggests a gradually declining supply of labour in Europe. Immigration has been a major source of economic and employment expansion in the Member States over the past few years. Although it cannot provide the sole – or even the main – response to the demographic challenge, it is likely to continue to contribute significantly to solving future labour shortages. Realising this potential will call for additional policy efforts. Nevertheless, the main response to the demographic challenge must come from better use of our internal resources. In particular, improving our understanding of trends in skills requirements will be crucial to designing effective policies for better job matching. Similarly, facilitating geographical mobility within the Union can contribute to making more effective use of the existing labour force, as the largely positive experience with recent enlargements demonstrates. This year’s Employment in Europe report covers all these issues and illustrates the added value of a coordinated approach at EU level and the benefit for the Member States of sharing experience and learning from each other’s successes...|$|E
