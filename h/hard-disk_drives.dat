The off-track-vibration-based TD detection methods are widely applied in current <b>hard-disk</b> <b>drive</b> (HDD) for head-disk TD detection. However, few studies perform {{on how to improve}} the off-track-vibration-based TD detection sensitivity. In this paper, a comparative experimental study was conducted between comparative two off-track-vibration-based TD detection methods: one is based on the low-frequency-forced vibration; the other is based on the off-track-structure vibration. Besides, the skew angle, touch down area (TDA), and the head-stack assembly (HSA) rotation inertia effects on TD detectability were discussed. Bigger skew angle and bigger TDA are helpful for good TD sensitivity for these two methods. To the method based on low frequency forced vibration, the smaller HSA rotation inertia design is also helpful. ...|$|R

50|$|Solid-state drives, {{which are}} flash-based, differ from <b>hard-disk</b> <b>drives</b> in two ways: first, {{in the way}} data is stored; and second, {{in the way the}} {{algorithms}} are used to manage and access that data. These differences can be exploited to recover previously erased data. SSDs maintain a layer of indirection between the logical addresses used by computer systems to access data and the internal addresses that identify physical storage. This layer of indirection hides idiosyncratic media interfaces and enhances SSD performance, reliability, and lifespan (see wear leveling); but it can also produce copies of the data that are invisible to the user and that a sophisticated attacker could recover. For sanitizing entire disks, sanitize commands built into the SSD hardware {{have been found to be}} effective when implemented correctly, and software-only techniques for sanitizing entire disks have been found to work most, but not all, of the time. In testing, none of the software techniques were effective for sanitizing individual files. These included well-known algorithms such as the Gutmann method, US DoD 5220.22-M, RCMP TSSIT OPS-II, Schneier 7 Pass, and Mac OS X Secure Erase Trash.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Virtual {{screening}} of small molecules using molecular docking {{has become an}} important tool in drug discovery. However, large scale virtual screening is time demanding and usually requires dedicated computer clusters. There {{are a number of}} software tools that perform virtual screening using AutoDock 4 but they require access to dedicated Linux computer clusters. Also no software is available for performing virtual screening with Vina using computer clusters. In this paper we present MOLA, an easy-to-use graphical user interface tool that automates parallel virtual screening using AutoDock 4 and/or Vina in bootable non-dedicated computer clusters. Implementation MOLA automates several tasks including: ligand preparation, parallel AutoDock 4 /Vina jobs distribution and result analysis. When the virtual screening project finishes, an open-office spreadsheet file opens with the ligands ranked by binding energy and distance to the active site. All results files can automatically be recorded on an USB-flash drive or on the <b>hard-disk</b> <b>drive</b> using VirtualBox. MOLA works inside a customized Live CD GNU/Linux operating system, developed by us, that bypass the original operating system installed on the computers used in the cluster. This operating system boots from a CD on the master node and then clusters other computers as slave nodes via ethernet connections. Conclusion MOLA is an ideal virtual screening tool for non-experienced users, with a limited number of multi-platform heterogeneous computers available and no access to dedicated Linux computer clusters. When a virtual screening project finishes, the computers can just be restarted to their original operating system. The originality of MOLA lies on the fact that, any platform-independent computer available can he added to the cluster, without ever using the computer <b>hard-disk</b> <b>drive</b> and without interfering with the installed operating system. With a cluster of 10 processors, and a potential maximum speed-up of 10 x, the parallel algorithm of MOLA performed with a speed-up of 8, 64 × using AutoDock 4 and 8, 60 × using Vina. </p...|$|R

In this paper, a method is presented that extrapolates the finite spatial aperture before the DFT is applied, which is based on the impulse response information of the known aperture data. The developed method called linear predictive border-padding is an aperture extrapolation technique that greatly reduces leakage and spatial truncation errors in planar NAH (PNAH). Numerical simulations and actual measurements on a <b>hard-disk</b> <b>drive</b> and a cooling fan illustrate the low error, high speed, and utilization of border-padding.

40|$|Abstract—The {{recording}} {{performance of}} data-storage devices, in which write/read elements move {{relative to a}} storage medium to reliably store and retrieve information, depends on the capa-bility of servo mechanisms to provide the necessary positioning ac-curacy. The desired characteristics of servo mechanisms for data-storage systems include robustness against variations of environ-mental parameters, high resolution, accuracy, stability, and fast response. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of ad-vanced servo-control methods for data storage. The applications are to well-established recording technologies, including magnetic tape and magnetic disk systems as well as CD/DVD/Blue-Ray op-tical data-storage systems. Moreover, newer holographic and near-field optical systems and the emerging probe-storage technology are also addressed.
