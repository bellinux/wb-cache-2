5|$|Just as {{the concept}} of the First World came about as a result of World War II, so did the European Union. In 1951 the {{beginnings}} of the EU were founded with the creation of European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). From the beginning of its inception, countries in the EU were judged by many standards, including economic ones. This is where the relation between globalization, the EU, and First World countries arises. Especially during the 1990s when the EU focused on economic policies such as the creation and circulation of the Euro, the creation of the <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Institute,</b> and the opening of the European Central Bank.|$|E
5|$|In February 1992, European Union {{countries}} {{signed the}} Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Institute</b> which was ultimately dissolved {{in tandem with}} the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank (ECB) and European System of Central Banks. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the Euro, adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they disaggregated their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. , the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> system <b>instituted</b> in Dec. 1978. It became a result of the long lasting search for {{stabilizing}} currency relations between member states of the European Community. Therefore, also the said search is discussed in consideration of the Treaty of Rome provisions of 1957. Particular emphasis wa slaid on theses of the Werner report on the economic-monetary union and of the Tindemans report on the European union. Much attention was focused on the so-called „currency serpent" which was mentioned in the both reports as a prerequisite to achieve the monetary stability. The initiative of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and of Helmut Schmidt to constitute the <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> system was indicated. The system was established by the decission of the European Council of Dec. 1978. The article discusses functions of the <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> system and its specific parts. The evolution of clearing unit effected in the ECU (European Currency Unit) is presented. The way of calculating ECU, scope of its application is explained together with postulates to modify it and transform into a European currency. There are three types of crediting member states related to the monetary system as well as the system of currency intervention what can prove the range of monetary cooperation among the central banks of the Communities' member states. In the concluding remarks there are several postulates expressed as to improvements in functioning the <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> system as well as reservations to the possibility of their realization.

40|$|Since the <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> System was <b>instituted</b> in March 1979, {{there has}} been a {{dramatic}} reduction in the inflation rates of member countries This development is widely attributed to the EMS itself. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to argue that the theoretical and empirical basis for such a claim is far from conclusive. On the theoretical side, the paper develops a model which highlights two issues. First, changes in the "rules" of the exchange rate system need not coincide with changes in expectations about Central Bank behavior. In fact, I expectations in France do not seem to have changed until policy makers "got tough" in 1982 - 83. Second, different researchers have made quite different I assumptions about exactly what "rules" the EMS imposes. The paper shows that how the system works matters in terns of the effect joining will have on inflation. On the empirical side, the paper shows that effects which have been attributed to the EMS are in large part due to the global deflation since 1979 and to the fact that EMS members had relatively low inflation before 1979. However, even these estimates should be interpreted with caution. They are very sensitive to time period and to which non EMS countries are included in the sample. ...|$|R

The analysis deals with two main <b>monetary</b> arrangements, the <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> System (EMS) and the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), and focuses on one country - Italy.
