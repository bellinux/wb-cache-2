40|$|Was {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} alternative methods <b>of</b> <b>detoxification</b> <b>of</b> castor <b>cake</b> on nitrogen balance and ruminal evaluation in sheep fed isocaloric and isonitrogenous experimental diets. Twenty sheep (ten males and ten females) were used in five treatments (castor cake untreated, treated with limestone, treated with urea, treated with phosphate monodicalcium and autoclaved) and four repetitions. For nitrogen balance we used a randomized block design, with the blocks according to the sex and the variables pH and ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N) in the experimental design was split plot, with plots in the diets subplots and the collection times (0, 2, 5 and 8 hours postprandial). The treatments did not influence N intake, N urinary, urea and N-urea concentration in plasma. The Urinary N was higher in diet containing castor cake treated with phosphate monodicalcium (FOS) when compared with those containing castor cake treated by autoclave (ACL). Already the nitrogen balance (BN) was higher in diet ACL when compared to FOS diet. The pH and N-NH 3 were within the normal range of sheep, being little affected by diet. Diets with methods <b>of</b> <b>detoxification</b> <b>of</b> castor <b>cake</b> promoted moderate changes in nitrogen balance with emphasis on the castor cake autoclaved and treated with limestone. The males sheep showed higher nitrogen balance than females. ...|$|R
40|$|Wax esters have {{important}} applications in medicine, {{and in the}} cosmetics and food industries, besides their more traditional usage as lubricants. The value of the wax from sperm whales {{was one of the}} factors responsible for this animals being hunted to near extinction, which prompted the eventual ban on harvesting and the search for alternative sources. Recognition of jojoba oil as an alternative to sperm whale oil has led to a surge of interest in jojoba across the globe. The hardiness of this plant, which is amenable to cultivation even on water-deficient wastelands, has led to it being cultivated as a crop in several semi-arid and arid regions of the world. In addition, oil from the seed de-oiled cake is rich in protein and can be used as livestock feed and as a source of commercial enzymes. The plant is dioecious, and exhibits tremendous variability in male:female ratio in a given population, with male plants generally outnumbering female plants, leading to low yields as expected due to heterogeneity in the population. High yielding genotypes have been selected from experimental plantations, and vegetative propagation methods have been developed to provide genetically uniform, known sex plants to boost yields. Due to limited production, jojoba waxes are not available for a number of applications in spite of high demand. The advent of genetic engineering has provided novel opportunities to tailor the composition of plant lipids and also engineer agronomically suitable oilseed crops to produce high levels of wax esters in the seed oil. This chapter discusses efforts made towards the domestication, genetic improvements for yield and oil content, <b>detoxification</b> <b>of</b> <b>cake</b> for use as a live stock feed, and aspects of micropropagation of this species...|$|R
40|$|Three {{varieties}} of Brassica seeds(Brassica juncea, Brassica campestris, Brassica napus) were studied for their proximate composition and were detoxified by chemical and bio-chemical methods. Composition of Brassica seeds depended upon date of sowing, environmental conditions, such as temperature, drought, length of day, varying fertility levels {{and composition of}} the soil. Hull to kernel ratio of Brassica seeds depended on environmental conditions and availability of nutrients to the plant. Protein, oil and allylisothiocyanate contents of Brassica seeds decreased in order of kernels to seeds and then to hulls respectively. Fibre contents of Brassica seeds decreased in order of hulls to seeds and then to kernels respectively. Microbiological evaluation {{of the amount of}} the Brassica seed meal showed that a fair total amino acids in the meal was not available Microorganisms capable of growing on mustard seed cake were isolated from air in the surroundings of P. C. S. I. R. laboratories and identified. Three strains of mold(Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Mucor mucedo) and two of bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus subtilis var niger) grew well when mustard seed cake was the only source of carbon. Aspergillus flavus also hydrolysed a pure sample of sinigrin(a toxic substance present in the cake) and did not show florescent aflatoxin band. All the locally isolated strains were employed for <b>detoxification</b> <b>of</b> RL- 18 <b>cake.</b> Biological <b>detoxification</b> <b>of</b> RL- 18 <b>cake</b> with Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger and Bacillus subtili var niger resulted in 10. 6, 8. 6 and 10. 1...|$|R
40|$|Jatropha curcas L. {{is natural}} sources of biodiesel. It has high {{potential}} economic values. Different parts of J. curcas {{have their own}} potencies, unfortunately these were not known by the farmers. The aim of this thesis is to give {{an overview of the}} additional values of Jatropha curcas L. by characterization of its natural products that {{can be used as a}} safe pharmaceutical product. In addition the <b>detoxification</b> <b>of</b> the plant <b>cake</b> allowing it to be used for animal stock has been researched. This thesis is a part of larger project for valorization Jatropha curcas L. plantation, especially in Indonesia. From the latex of J. curcas L. two cyclic peptides were isolated and synthesized. Curcacycline A inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtillis. Both curcacyclines did not cause mutagenicity and cytotoxicity. From the pressed <b>cake</b> <b>of</b> J. curcas L, it can be utilized as animal feed, because its protein content is the same as FAO requirement, but the utilization is limited due to the toxic components. Because <b>of</b> that, <b>detoxification</b> process became an interesting object. We developed analytical method using tandem mass spectrometer to differentiate α, β phorbol myristic acetate (PMA) and dehydroxy phorbol ester (DHPEs). With this method we can detect the PMA in low amount (1 µg/mL). We also validated the detoxification results using ecotoxicity, cytotoxicity and mutagenicity tests. Based on those results J. curcas cake was not cytotoxic and mutagenic. These data will be essential to develop the use of J. curcas as new drug candidate and for animal food application...|$|R
