The need to repair these structures arises from their age or construction defects. Polymers are now being used in <b>glued</b> <b>assembly</b> and repairs because of their adhesion quality which ensures bonding of hardened concrete-hardened concrete, hardened concrete-fresh concrete and hardened concrete-metallic concrete. This article presents two tests, one under direct tension and the other based {{on the principles of}} fracture mechanics.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Present {{methods of}} {{determining}} proper glueline cure are inadequate in either production or laboratory situations {{because they are}} time consuming and "after the fact". Monitoring the glueline while the wood composite {{is still in the}} press would provide many advantages over existing methods. Such a system would provide greater control over the degree of cure, helping eliminate variable quality in the glue bond. Dielectric spectroscopy has been proposed as a method capable of continuously monitoring adhesive cure and a specific machine, the Audrey II dielectrometer, has been advertised as being capable of detecting cure of resin systems common to the forest products industry. The objectives of this research were to determine if the Audrey II dielectrometer could measure cure of a highly caustic phenolic plywood adhesive and a resorcinol-formaldehyde laminating adhesive in Douglas-fir gluelines under conditions analogous to mill production. The dielectric spectrometer used in this study produced frequencies of 100 - 1000 Hz and measured voltage, capacitance, phase angle, and dissipation of the <b>glued</b> <b>assembly</b> placed between its electrodes. Capacitance was found to be the property that was most sensitive to changes in the wood-adhesive composite during the cure process. The dielectric spectrometer was able to accurately and consistently measure the capacitance of oven dried wood. Dielectric measurements were very sensitive to the presence of water, and the increase in capacitance with an increase in moisture content was reproducible. Problems were encountered when using the dielectric spectrometer to monitor cure of a resin in wood composites. The lack of repeatability in capacitance measurements led {{to the conclusion that the}} Audrey II dielectric spectrometer could not measure cure of a highly caustic phenolic adhesive or a resorcinolformaldehyde laminating adhesive in Douglas-fir gluelines. Components of a phenol-formaldehyde resin were examined to determine what caused the lack of reproducibility. The capacitance was reproducible with either water or aqueous caustic on the veneers. However, the presence of either phenol or formalin on the veneers resulted in a total lack of repeatability in capacitance. Both phenol and formalin are excellent swelling agents for wood and as wood swells, its microstructure is opened and plasticized. This would increase the capacitance. Other factors that would influence variation in swelling and capacitance would include depth of lathe checks, wood damage, porosity, density, and natural anatomical variation that influences the rate of penetration of chemicals into wood. Even considering the swelling effects and natural variation of wood, the variability in capacitance of the wood-adhesive composite is not readily understood...|$|E

The {{ability to}} predict wood {{shrinkage}} could help manufacturers avoid lumber with abnormal dimensional stability or match pieces with similar properties in <b>glued</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a rapid, nondestructive technique {{that has been}} used to predict various wood properties, including extractive content and density. Fifty-seven mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) blocks were scanned using an NIR spectrometer, and were measured for specific gravity, extractives content, and total volumetric swelling. Models were created to predict the wood properties using the NIR data. These models could provide reasonable predictions of shrinkage, density, and extractives content. The use of nonlinear kernel and wavelet statistical techniques improved model performance.

40|$|Winfree {{introduced}} {{a model of}} self-assembling systems called the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) where square tiles with glues on their edges attach spontaneously via matching glues to form complex structures. A generalization of the aTAM called the 2 HAM (two-handed aTAM) not only allows for single tiles to bind, but also for 2 ̆ 2 supertile 2 ̆ 2 assemblies consisting of any number of tiles to attach. We consider a variety of models based on either the aTAM or the 2 HAM. The underlying commonality of the work presented here is simulation. We introduce the polyTAM, where a tile system consists {{of a collection of}} polyomino tiles, and show that for any polyomino P of size {{greater than or equal to}} 3 and any Turing machine M, there exists a temperature- 1 polyTAM system containing only shape-P tiles that simulates M. We introduce the RTAM (Reflexive Tile Assembly Model) that works like the aTAM except that tiles can nondeterministically flip prior to binding. We show that the temperature- 1 RTAM cannot simulate a Turing machine by showing the much stronger result that the RTAM can only self-assemble 2 ̆ 2 periodic 2 ̆ 2 patterns. We then define notions of simulation which serve as relations between two tile assembly systems (possibly belonging to different models). Using simulation as a basis of comparison, we first show that cellular automata and the class of all tile assembly systems in the aTAM are equivalent. Next, we introduce the Dupled aTAM (DaTAM) and show that the temperature- 2 aTAM and the temperature- 1 DaTAM are 2 ̆ 2 mutually exclusive 2 ̆ 2 by showing that there is an aTAM system that cannot be simulated by any DaTAM system, and vice versa.

40|$|The tannin {{extracted}} from mangium (Acacia mangium Wild) tree bark exhibits strong affinity toward formaldehyde when both being reacted forming the tannin formaldehyde polymer which further {{could serve as}} resin adhesive. To improve the bonding strength and enhance the curing process, the tannin and formaldehyde is co-polymerized with resorcinol to form tannin resorcinol formaldehyde (TRF) resin. This resin is expectedly useful in the gluing work for the manufacture of reconstituted wood or other ligno-cellulosic products such as plywood, glue laminated timber, and laminated veneer lumber. In relevant, the tannin extract (T) was prepared from mangium bark, then allowed to copolymerize through the reaction with resorcinol (R) and formaldehyde (F) to produce the TRF resin. In such copolymerization, the mole ratios of T : R : F was such that the mole portion of R varied at consecutively: 0. 2, 0. 5, 0. 7, 0. 9 and 1. 1, while the mole portion of T and F was constant at the ratio of 1 : 1.

Result revealed that the TRF resin with mole ratio of T : R : F at 1 : 0. 5 : 1 exhibited the highest crystallinity (51. 33 %) and melting glass transition at 277. 14 C. In addition, the TRF adhesive at such mole ratio exhibited the thermogram and diffractogram characterization which were similar to those of the conventional PRF (phenol-resorcinol-formaldehyde) adhesive.

These staves have a triangular cross section carbon foam core, sandwiched between a triangular carbon fibre plate (omega) and a flat top plate (faceplate) onto which the silicon detector modules and services are <b>glued.</b> The <b>assembly</b> is strongly dependant on glue and thermal grease interfaces; high density amorphous materials prone to degradation under high radiation doses. In order to evaluate the mechanical stability and integrity of one of these staves it was decided to impose a very high radiation dose upon it, representative of the full dose IBL will receive in its life-cycle. Because of the lack of availability of proton beams - the closest approximation to the radiation received in operation - with a large enough sweep area and dose it was decided to undertake the experiment using an industrial electron beam. The ionization itself was performed at Ionisos in France, while the pre and post-irradiation tests were shared between CERN and the University of Geneva. After having been exposed to a beta dose equivalent to twice that expected in the IBL lifetime, a series of metrology surveys and thermal cycles were performed. It appears from metrology comparisons between the various steps in the experiment that the stave's stability was only minimally affected, with a maximum faceplate movement of 60 μm between the pre and post-irradiation metrologies. However it appears that the heating effects were of importance considering the grease pads had ran slightly when inspected after the irradiation. The temperature monitoring confirms that the stave experienced excessive temperatures, about 20 ^oC higher than the maximum temperature experienced in operation, during the experiment. It is therefore complicated to separate the consequences of thermal and ionization effects on the stave. A series of peel samples irradiated with the stave in a beta beam as well as in a proton beam were used to compare the effect of these two types of irradiation on the glue interfaces...|$|R

Using the subset of compounds that bound strongly, chemometric analyses based on quantum chemical calculations and similarity and self-similarity indices yielded three classes of Specificity that relate to differential binding. Specificity may not be defined by any one specific atom or position and is influenced by coulomb matrixes, suggesting that it is driven by electrostatic forces. These analyses give the first receptor-specific classification of auxins and indicate that AFB 5 is the preferred site for a number of auxinic herbicides by allowing interactions with analogues having van der Waals surfaces larger than that of indole- 3 -acetic acid.

The {{objective of this}} thesis was {{to look at the}} dynamic behavior of a timber-concrete composite system, where the concrete deck consisted of several prefabricated elements glued together. The shear connector used was a glued-in steel mesh, which had shown strong capacity in previous studies. The concrete was fibre reinforced concrete. A full-scale model was built in the laboratory, and the following tests were performed: A dynamic test (hammer impact test) and a deflection test with 1 kN load. In addition a direct shear test was performed on two asymmetrical specimen to find the stiffness of the shear connector. The fibre reinforced concrete was tested separately to find its characteristic properties. There was also made a numerical model in ABAQUS, to estimate the behavior of the composite beam. The hammer impact test showed that the composite beam satisfied the dynamic requirements sat for the beam. The shear connector proved to be weaker and more ductile than expected. It was discovered this was due to insufficient <b>gluing</b> during the <b>assembly.</b> The numerical analyses done in combination with the empirical tests proved to give good estimates on the behavior of the composite beam. The stiffness of the shear connector proved to be more decisive of the deflection of the beam than the frequency. Expanding the beam to a full-size floor in ABAQUS indicated that the composite beam gave smaller values for the frequency than what would be the case for a full floor.

Atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy analyses found small oligomers (diameter ∼ 60 nm) to bigger annular (outer diameter ∼ 300 nm; inner diameter, 100 nm) and protofibrillar structures after 1 − 2 days of incubation. Rotating-frame Overhauser spectroscopic (ROESY) analysis revealed the presence of several nonbonded proton−proton interactions among the residues, such as amide protons with methylene group, aromatic protons with tertiary butyl group, and methylene protons with tertiary butyl group. These added significant stability to bring the peptides closer to form a well-ordered assembled structure. Hydrogen−deuterium exchange NMR measurement further suggested that two individual amide protons among the three amide groups were strongly engaged with the adjacent tripeptide via H-bond interaction. However, the remaining amide proton was found to be exposed to solvent and remained noninteracting with other tripeptide molecules. In addition to chemical shift values, a significant change in amide bond vibrations of the tripeptide was found due to the formation of the self-assembled structure. The amide I mode of vibrations involving two amide linkages appeared at 1641 and 1695 cm− 1 in the solid state. However, in the assembled state, the stretching band at 1695 cm− 1 became broad and slightly shifted to ∼ 1689 cm− 1. On the contrary, the band at 1641 cm− 1 shifted to 1659 cm− 1 and indicated that the −CO bond associated with this vibration became stronger in the assembled state. These changes in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy frequency clearly indicated changes in the amide backbone conformation and the associated hydrogen-bonding pattern due to the formation of the assembled structure. In addition to hydrogen bonding, molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the number of π−π interactions also increased with increasing number of tripeptides participated in the self-assembly process. Combined results envisaged a cross β-sheet assembly unit consisting of four intermolecular hydrogen bonds.

40|$|The 2 -Handed Assembly Model (2 HAM) is a tile-based {{self-assembly}} {{model in}} which, typically beginning from single tiles, arbitrarily large aggregations of static tiles combine in pairs to form structures. The Signal-passing Tile Assembly Model (STAM) {{is an extension}} of the 2 HAM in which the tiles are dynamically changing components which are able to alter their binding domains as they bind together. For our first result, we demonstrate useful techniques and transformations for converting an arbitrarily complex STAM^+ tile set into an STAM^+ tile set where every tile has a constant, low amount of complexity, {{in terms of the number}} and types of "signals" they can send, with a trade off in scale factor. Using these simplifications, we prove that for each temperature τ> 1 there exists a 3 D tile set in the 2 HAM which is intrinsically universal for the class of all 2 D STAM^+ systems at temperature τ (where the STAM^+ does not make use of the STAM's power of <b>glue</b> deactivation and <b>assembly</b> breaking, as the tile components of the 2 HAM are static and unable to change or break bonds). This means that there is a single tile set U in the 3 D 2 HAM which can, for an arbitrarily complex STAM^+ system S, be configured with a single input configuration which causes U to exactly simulate S at a scale factor dependent upon S. Furthermore, this simulation uses only two planes of the third dimension. This implies that there exists a 3 D tile set at temperature 2 in the 2 HAM which is intrinsically universal for the class of all 2 D STAM^+ systems at temperature 1. Moreover, we show that for each temperature τ> 1 there exists an STAM^+ tile set which is intrinsically universal for the class of all 2 D STAM^+ systems at temperature τ, including the case where τ = 1.

40|$|Abstract Background Tissue {{adhesives}} {{are useful}} means for various medical procedures. Since varying requirements cause {{that a single}} adhesive cannot meet all needs, bond strength testing {{remains one of the}} key applications used to screen for new products and study the influence of experimental variables. This study was conducted to develop an easy to use method to screen and evaluate tissue adhesives for tissue engineering applications. Method Tissue grips were designed to facilitate the reproducible production of substrate tissue and adhesive strength measurements in universal testing machines. Porcine femoral condyles were used to generate osteochondral test tissue cylinders (substrates) of different shapes. Viability of substrates was tested using PI/FDA staining. Self-bonding properties were determined to examine reusability of substrates (n[*]=[*] 3). Serial measurements (n[*]=[*] 5) in different operation modes (OM) were performed to analyze the bonding strength of tissue adhesives in bone (OM- 1) and cartilage tissue either in isolation (OM- 2) or under specific requirements in joint repair such as filling cartilage defects with clinical applied fibrin/PLGA-cell-transplants (OM- 3) or tissues (OM- 4). The efficiency of the method was determined on the basis of adhesive properties of fibrin <b>glue</b> for different <b>assembly</b> times (30 s, 60 s). Seven randomly generated collagen formulations were analyzed to examine the potential of method to identify new tissue adhesives. Results Viability analysis of test tissue cylinders revealed vital cells (> 80 %) in cartilage components even 48 h post preparation. Reuse (n[*]=[*] 10) of test substrate did not significantly change adhesive characteristics. Adhesive strength of fibrin varied in different test settings (OM- 1 : 7. 1 kPa, OM- 2 : 2. 6 kPa, OM- 3 : 32. 7 kPa, OM- 4 : 30. 1 kPa) and was increasing with assembly time on average (2. 4 -fold). The screening of the different collagen formulations revealed a substance with significant higher adhesive strength on cartilage (14. 8 kPa) and bone tissue (11. 8 kPa) compared to fibrin and also considerable adhesive properties when filling defects with cartilage tissue (23. 2 kPa). Conclusion The method confirmed adhesive properties of fibrin and demonstrated the dependence of adhesive properties and applied settings. Furthermore the method was suitable to screen for potential adhesives and to identify a promising candidate for cartilage and bone applications. The method can offer simple, replicable and efficient evaluation of adhesive properties in ex vivo specimens and may be a useful supplement to existing methods in clinical relevant settings. </p...|$|R
