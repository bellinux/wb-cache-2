50|$|In 1775 Hull's Old Dock was opened. This was {{the first}} {{commercial}} floating dock, isolated by a lock rather than a single lock gate.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate meat quality of female post-weaning fat-tailed sheep with <b>docking</b> and <b>level</b> of feeding concentrate from water, fat and protein content. The material used in this experiment was meat of 20 female post-weaning fat-tailed sheep from biceps femoris. Feeds given were elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and concentrate “Gemuk A”. The sheep was house individually in a 0. 75 x 1. 0 m 2 elevated house unit. The method was experiment with Nested Block Randomised Design, with treatmen of docking (D 1) and non-docking (D 0) and level of feeding concentrate (p), i. e. 1 percent (PO) and 3 percent (P 2). The result showed that docking gave no significsntly difference (P> 0. 05) for water content, but for fat and proten content gave very significantly difference (P 0. 05) for water content, but gave very significantly difference (P< 0. 01) for fat and protein content. In the average water content was 72. 46; 72. 77; 73. 40 and 72. 98 percent respectively, fat content 3. 97; 5. 76; 5. 01 and 7. 28 percent respectively and protein content 16. 35; 17. 75; 17. 34 and 18. 84 percent respectively. It could concluded that <b>docking</b> and <b>level</b> feeding of concentrate significantly increased fat and protein contents of meat of female post weaning fat-tailed sheep, but not significantly effect on water content. <b>Docking</b> and <b>level</b> of feeding concentrate at 3 percent of body weight should be considered to get good qualityy of female post weaning fat-tailed sheep from fat and protein content.

50|$|After the New Dock was opened, the Old Dock and its {{cumbersome}} {{lock access}} to the canal was used less and less. From 1908 the old entrance was abandoned and the Old Dock became used for ship repair.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{cardiac glycosides}} ouabain and digitoxin, {{established}} Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitors, {{were found to}} inhibit MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cell migration through an unbiased chemical genetics screen for cell motility. The Na+/K+ ATPase acts both as an ion-transporter and as a receptor for cardiac glycosides. To delineate which function is related to breast cancer cell migration, structure−activity relationship (SAR) profiles of cardiac glycosides were established at the cellular (cell migration inhibition), molecular (Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition), and atomic (computational <b>docking)</b> <b>levels.</b> The SAR of cardiac glycosides and their analogs revealed a similar profile, a decrease in potency when the parent cardiac glycoside structure was modified, for each activity investigated. Since assays were done at the cellular, molecular, and atomic levels, correlation of SAR profiles across these multiple assays established links between cellular activity and specific protein−small molecule interactions. The observed antimigratory effects in breast cancer cells {{are directly related to}} the inhibition of Na+/K+ transport. Specifically, the orientation of cardiac glycosides at the putative cation permeation path formed by transmembrane helices αM 1 −M 6 correlates with the Na+ pump activity and cell migration. Other Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitors that are structurally distinct from cardiac glycosides also exhibit antimigratory activity, corroborating the conclusion that the antiport function of Na+/K+ ATPase and not the receptor function is important for supporting the motility of MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cells. Correlative SAR can establish new relationships between specific biochemical functions and higher-level cellular processes, particularly for proteins with multiple functions and small molecules with unknown or various modes of action...|$|R

50|$|A half tide dock is a {{partially}} tidal dock. They need have no gate, {{but as the}} tide ebbs a raised sill or weir {{on the floor of}} the <b>dock</b> prevents the <b>level</b> dropping below a certain point, meaning that the ships in the dock remain afloat, although they still fall with the first ebb of the tide.

By the 1830s, the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, however, able to devise a solution to this problem. In place of the Overfall he advised better use of three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel. This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls. When the deep sluice opened at low tide, a powerful undertow sucked the silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide.

40|$|AbstractThe precise {{mechanisms}} via which Rac 1 {{is activated}} by cadherin junctions {{are not fully}} known. In keratinocytes Rac 1 activation by cadherin junctions requires EGFR signalling, but how EGFR does so is unclear. To address which activator could mediate E-cadherin signalling to Rac 1, we investigated EGFR and two Rac 1 GEFs, SOS 1 and DOCK 180. EGFR RNAi prevented junction-induced Rac 1 activation and led to fragmented localization of E-cadherin at cadherin contacts. In contrast, depletion of another EGFR family member, ErbB 3, did not interfere with either process. DOCK 180 RNAi, but not SOS 1, prevented E-cadherin-induced Rac 1 activation. However, in a strong divergence from EGFR RNAi phenotype, DOCK 180 depletion did not perturb actin recruitment or cadherin localisation at junctions. Rather, reduced <b>DOCK</b> 180 <b>levels</b> impaired the resistance to mechanical stress of pre-formed cell aggregates. Thus, within the same cell type, EGFR and DOCK 180 regulate Rac 1 activation by newly-formed contacts, but control separate cellular events that cooperate to stabilise junctions...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{structure}} of macrocycles is intimately linked to its biological activities and chemical reactivities. Delineating {{the factors that}} control the macrocycle structure will be very useful in developing novel probes, therapeutics and chemical transformations. Using a systematic strategy with the [13]-macrodilactones as model system and a combinational of X-ray crystallography and computational methods, a general model that explains the effect of stereogenic elements (stereogenic centers and stereogenic plane) on the {{overall structure}} (planar chirality, shape and topology) of the [13]-macrodilactone was constructed. A specific geometrical arrangement in the stereogenic centers set the planar chirality (either pS or pR), shape (either ribbon or alternate) and consequently, the overall topology of substituted [13]-macrodilactones. This specific geometrical arrangement is fundamentally governed by the preference of the substituents to be in pseudo-equatorial position. The general model constructed has useful implications in synthesizing macrocycles with designed structural properties and in optimizing the biological and pharmacological activities of bioactive macrocycles.
