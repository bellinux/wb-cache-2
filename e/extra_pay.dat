5|$|In the convict era, {{particularly}} during Hampton's term as governor, misbehaving prisoners were punished with flogging, solitary confinement, {{and working in}} chain gangs at gunpoint. Particularly difficult prisoners were put to work hand pumping groundwater into the prison's reservoir. Known as cranking, it was especially despised by the prisoners. Staff disliked giving the lashings – in 1851, {{out of a total}} of 400 lashings ordered, 150 were remitted as the superintendent could not find anyone to undertake the task. The role was so disliked that inducements were offered, including <b>extra</b> <b>pay</b> or improved lodgings.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 20 June, two armed Protestant corps coming from Montbéliard and Neuchâtel were {{travelling}} to Besançon. However, some of the troops from the Neuchâtel group decided to abandon the battle, as their request for <b>extra</b> <b>pay</b> had been denied. The other soldiers continued upstream. The remaining soldiers from Neuchâtel {{got into a fight}} with the inhabitants of Morteau; after a fierce battle, they were forced to retreat. After waiting for the group from Neuchâtel, which could not be found, Capitaine Paul de Beaujeu decided to continue with the plan. By midnight, the soldiers had reached Palente, and they hid in the forests of Chalezeule while establishing a plan of attack. With the help of a dozen small boats laid end-to-end, the soldiers crossed the Doubs. To continue the attack, the soldiers would need the help of the townspeople.|$|E
5|$|The pay dispute {{split the}} unit. About two thirds went on strike, {{saying they would}} not return to action unless the Army upped their wages and paid them in foreign currency. Meanwhile, {{some of the more}} {{contented}} Frenchmen made steps to remain permanently, buying cars and having their wives join them in Salisbury. The Army detained the strike's ringleaders for insubordination. With neither side willing to budge—the Army refused to give the strikers <b>extra</b> <b>pay</b> or special treatment, saying this would contravene Rhodesia's policy not to engage mercenaries—the disaffected men were repatriated to France at their own request. The Rhodesian Army considered disbanding the unit altogether, but persevered when Major de l'Assomption convinced his superiors that his remaining men were still loyal and eager to continue serving.|$|E

The first official bank holidays were the four days named in the Bank Holidays Act 1871, but today the term is colloquially used for Good Friday and Christmas Day which were already public holidays under common law and therefore not official bank holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.|$|E

25|$|The {{proportion}} of GNP {{spent on the}} NHS rose from 4.2% in 1964 to about 5% in 1969. This additional expenditure provided for an energetic revival of a policy of building health centres for GPs, <b>extra</b> <b>pay</b> for doctors who served in areas particularly short of them, a significant growth in hospital staffing, and {{a significant increase in}} a hospital building programme. Far more money was spent each year on the NHS than under the 1951–64 Conservative governments, while much more effort was put into modernising and reorganising the health service. Stronger central and regional organisations were established for bulk purchase of hospital supplies, while some efforts were made to reduce inequalities in standards of care. In addition, the government increased the intake to medical schools.|$|E
25|$|In August 1882 Wood {{commanded}} the 4th Brigade on the Egyptian expedition {{to suppress the}} Urabi Revolt. Wolseley kept him on occupation duties in Alexandria, so he missed the Battle of Tel el-Kebir. He returned to Chatham for a while again in November 1882 then returned to be Sirdar (commander) of the Egyptian Army from 21 December 1882 until 1885, during which period he thoroughly reorganised it, with Francis Grenfell and Kitchener working under him. He had 25 British officers (who were given <b>extra</b> <b>pay</b> and Egyptian ranks a grade or two higher than their British ones) and a few NCOs, although to Wood’s annoyance Lt-Gen Stephenson, commander of the British occupation forces, was confirmed as his senior in June 1884. During the cholera epidemic of 1883, British officers earned the respect of Egyptian soldiers by nursing them. Wood gave Sundays off from drill as well as Fridays (the Muslim holy day), so that Egyptian soldiers would see that their British officers took their own religion seriously.|$|E

500|$|In July 1974, Revie {{accepted}} {{the offer of}} the England manager's job, succeeding Alf Ramsey and caretaker-manager Joe Mercer. The Football Association, particularly Ted Croker, were impressed with Revie's personality and ideas. He was a popular appointment with the press and supporters; noted journalist Brian Glanville wrote that [...] "Revie was the obvious choice". Revie attempted to build {{a relationship with the}} media, and also invited 81 prospective and established England players to a meeting in Manchester to make everyone feel included, where he announced that he would establish <b>extra</b> <b>pay</b> for international players as well as bonus payments for wins and draws. He held a meeting with Alan Hardaker, chairman of the Football League, but Hardaker had long resented Revie and was very reluctant to accept his proposal to rearrange league fixtures to benefit the England team. He also had difficult relationships with figures within the FA, most notoriously with chairman Sir Harold Thompson, who allegedly attempted to influence Revie's team selections and undermine him publicly. As well as this he found difficulty in his attempts to introduce the Leeds traditions into the England camp, such as carpet bowls and bingo, which were met with resentment and disdain by some England internationals. Colin Todd stated that Revie was ill-suited to the England job, with his strengths lying in the day-to-day contact found only in club management rather than the politics and committee meetings of international management.|$|E
