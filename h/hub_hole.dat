In this process, the tube is nosed into a cup with a central hole, and then the taper bottom and side wall of the cup are formed into disk and rim portions of the wheel, respectively. The tube is produced by bending a rectangular sheet into a tube and by welding both edges of the bent sheet to prevent the loss of material for the blanking. The stamping sequence of the one-piece wheels was designed by finite element simulation. The central hole of the cup was decreased to a desired diameter of the <b>hub</b> <b>hole</b> without buckling and wrinkling by a 5 -stages nosing operation. The taper bottom of the cup was reversely drawn, and then was flared without folding by 2 stages. The wall thickness of the formed wheel was thick and thin in the disk and rim portions, receptively, and thus the requirement of strength of wheels is satisfied. A one-piece wheel having a <b>hub</b> <b>hole</b> was successfully formed by the designed sequence in a miniature experiment...|$|E

Considered frequency range is 10 – 5000  Hz, and the frequency resolution is 10  Hz. In {{the calculation}} of the sound radiation characteristics of the wheel, the free field condition is assumed, and elements are added to prevent sound leakage through the <b>hub</b> <b>hole.</b> The frequency range investigated is 20 – 4000  Hz with a resolution of 10  Hz.|$|E

50|$|A central {{thesis of}} the book is that absence can still be efficacious. Deacon makes the claim that just as the concept of zero {{revolutionized}} mathematics, thinking about life, mind, and other ententional phenomena in terms of constraints (i.e. what is absent) can similarly help us overcome the artificial dichotomy of the mind body problem. A good example of this concept is the hole that defines the hub of a wagon wheel. The hole itself is not a physical thing, but rather a source of constraint that helps to restrict the conformational possibilities of the wheel's components, such that, on a global scale, the property of rolling emerges. Constraints which produce emergent phenomena may not be a process which can be understood by looking at the make-up of the constitutents' of a pattern, that is emergence is difficult to study because it's complexity does not necessarily decompose into parts. When a pattern is broken down, the constraints are no longer at work; there is no hole, no absence to notice. Imagine a <b>hub,</b> a <b>hole</b> for an axel, produced only when the wheel is rolling, thus breaking the wheel may not show you how the hub emerges.|$|R
