The first commercial ND system which was sold to handle a database was to Jonas Øglænd. The second contract was to Vinmonopolet and required remote terminals in Bergen and Trondheim.

This was achieved by connecting the 150 terminals via XMSG and remained in use until 1990. The same system was delivered to the Swedish Armed Forces.

Two years later the <b>database</b> <b>program</b> Sibas had been completely ported and made available, and the following year a 150-terminal system connected via X.21/X.25 based XMSG and a flight simulator backbone for the F-16 were delivered. In 1978 Norsk Data both bought Tandberg and launched its office suit Notis, although Tandberg was sold again in 1980. ND became the first foreign-listed Norwegian company in 1981, which also saw {{the launch of the}} 32-bit ND-500. Throughout the 1980s ND acquired a series of domestic and foreign hardware and software companies, many loosely oriented at increased hardware sales. At the peak in 1986 and 1987, Norsk Data had 4,500 employees, 2.5 billion Norwegian krone (NOK) in revenue and was Norway's second-largest company by market capitalization—having increased fifty-fold between 1977 and 1985.|$|E
25|$|WordStar, one of {{the first}} widely used word processors, and dBASE, an early and popular <b>database</b> <b>program</b> for small computers, were {{originally}} written for CP/M. Two early outliners, KAMAS (Knowledge and Mind Amplification System) and its cut-down successor Out-Think (without programming facilities and retooled for 8080/V20 compatibility) were also written for CP/M, though later rewritten for MS-DOS. Turbo Pascal, the ancestor of Borland Delphi, and Multiplan, the ancestor of Microsoft Excel, also debuted on CP/M before MS-DOS versions became available. Visicalc, the first-ever spreadsheet program, was made available for CP/M. Another company, Sorcim, created its Supercalc spreadsheet for CP/M, which would go on to become the market leader and de facto standard on CP/M. Supercalc would go on to be a competitor in the spreadsheet market in the MS-DOS world. AutoCAD, a CAD application from Autodesk debuted on CP/M. A host of compilers and interpreters for popular programming languages of the time (such as BASIC, Borland's Turbo Pascal and FORTRAN) were available, among them several of the earliest Microsoft products.|$|E
25|$|The company {{continued}} {{to develop new}} text adventure games, expanding in size to over 100 employees at its peak; by 1984, they had sold over $10 million in game software. Their success drew writer Douglas Adams, who had loved Zork, to help produce two games through them: the first based on Douglas Adams' popular Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and an original work called Bureaucracy. The company also attempted to expand into business software, writing the relational <b>database</b> <b>program</b> Cornerstone, released in 1985; though Cornerstone was well-received, its release was {{at a time of}} a slump in software sales, and the company lost a significant amount of money on the title, as well as divided the company internally on progress going forward. Struggling for funding, Infocom was bought by Activision in 1986 and returned to adventure game development, but following that, the increased power of home microcomputers and graphic-driven games saw the demand for Infocom titles decline. Infocom was late to add graphics to its games as to be able to compete with other titles until 1987. By 1989, the Infocom division at Activision had been reduced to 10 employees, and was ultimately shuttered; Activision would continue to develop some text adventure games inhouse using the Infocom brand but with no connection to the original team. The demise of Infocom is considered {{to be the end of}} the commercial age for interactive fiction, but its legacy would remain; the Z-machine remains a popular source for running non-commercial interactive fiction games developed in more modern tools such as Inform.|$|E

Molyneux was invited to Commodore Europe's headquarters, and he was offered several Amiga systems and a space at a show in Germany. When Molyneux was told that they were anticipating getting his network running on the Amiga, he realised that they had mistaken his company for one called Torus, a producer of networking systems. Molyneux wanted the Amiga systems, so did not inform Commodore of the error. He received them and began writing a <b>database</b> <b>program</b> called Acquisition. Commodore kept asking about the database, and Molyneux gave them excuses because they were threatening to shut Taurus down. When Acquisition was finished, it was shown at the show in Germany, and won product of the year. 2000 copies were sold to a company in the United States, giving Molyneux and Edgar funds to sustain Taurus. Another program Taurus wrote was a Computer Aided Design package called X-CAD. They knew the Amiga was becoming a gaming machine, and a friend of Molyneux's asked him to convert Druid II: Enlightenment from the Commodore 64 to the Amiga. It was around this time Bullfrog was founded in preparation for (according to Edgar) when Acquisition was no longer important and they could focus on games. Bullfrog was originally a brand of Taurus; Molyneux explained that this was because they wanted to avoid confusion over business software and money-making opportunities. The name came from an ornament of a bullfrog located in the office: when asked by [...] why the name [...] "Bullfrog" [...] was chosen, Molyneux stated that they wanted [...] "an idiotic name" [...] without having to find one, and there happened to be a sculpture of a colourful frog on a pedestal labelled [...] "Bull Frog by Leonardo" [...] on the table. Afterwards, Molyneux and Edgar were running out of money, and Edgar suggested that they close the company down. This was when Molyneux {{came up with the idea}} of Populous. The conversion of Druid II: Enlightenment, Populous, and a shoot 'em up game called Fusion were the first games developed under the Bullfrog brand.|$|E
