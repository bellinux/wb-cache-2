40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{in the development of}} terminal device (TD) and UE prosthetic devices is to add to the functional benefits to the wearer, without greatly increasing the weight, or complexity, or the cost of the prosthesis. Using existing TD designs, the opportunity existed to increase the function by increasing the degree of freedom available at the wrist, in several ways. Since the existing hands and <b>electric</b> <b>terminal</b> devices (ETD) were both single degree-of-freedom TDs, improving the positionability of the TD can logically improve the gripping orientation and grip security.

40|$|We present two control {{strategies}} for an oscillating water column-wave energy converter (OWC-WEC) {{in the time}} domain. We consider a fixed OWC-WEC on the open sea with an impulse turbine module. This system mainly consists of a chamber, turbine and electric generator. For the time domain analysis, all of the conversion stages considering mutualities among them should be analyzed based on the Newtonian mechanics. According {{to the analysis of}} Newtonian mechanics, the hydrodynamics of wave energy absorption in the chamber and the turbine aerodynamic performance are directly coupled and share the internal air pressure term via the incompressible air assumption. The turbine aerodynamics and the dynamics of the electric generator are connected by torque load through the rotor shaft, which depends on an <b>electric</b> <b>terminal</b> load that acts as a control input. The proposed control strategies are an instant maximum turbine efficiency tracking control and a constant angular velocity of the turbine rotor control methods. Both are derived by Lyapunov stability analysis. Numerical simulations are carried out under irregular waves with various heights and periods in the time domain, and the results with the controllers are analyzed. We then compare these results with simulations carried out {{in the absence of the}} control strategy in order to prove the performance of the controllers...|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of an existing building commissioning (EBCx) /energy retrofit project, some form of screening is usually applied to determine whether there is sufficient potential for savings to justify a formal EBCx assessment/energy audit. In this study, an improved methodology for potential energy savings estimation from EBCx/retrofit measures, based on Baltazar's methodology (2006), is proposed to perform this type of screening. The improvements are included on optimization parameters, space load calculation, simulation of buildings with multiple types of HVAC systems, AHU shutdown simulation, among others. The improved methodology was used to estimate annual potential energy cost savings for 14 office buildings in Austin, TX with either single duct VAV (SDVAV) systems or dual duct VAV (DDVAV) systems. The estimates are based on very limited information about the buildings and the built-in HVAC systems as well as one year of utility bills. From this analysis, the methodology has predicted an average total potential savings of 36 % for SDVAV systems with <b>electric</b> <b>terminal</b> reheat, 22 % for SDVAV systems with hot water reheat, and 25 % for DDVAV systems. To validate these results, the estimated potential savings are compared with savings proposed in respective EBCx assessment reports. Based on the comparison of the report estimates and the potential savings with the improved methodology, it was found that 'generalized' factors of assessment predicted energy cost savings to estimated potential energy cost savings could be found. The factors identified in these cases were 0. 68, 0. 66, and 0. 61 for each type of system - SDVAV w/electric reheat, SDVAV w/hot water reheat, and DDVAV, respectively...|$|E

40|$|This thesis has {{improved}} Baltazar's methodology for potential energy savings estimation from retro-commissioning/retrofits measures. Important improvements and discussions {{are made on}} optimization parameters, limits on optimization parameter values, minimum airflow setting for VAV systems, space load calculation, simulation of buildings {{with more than one}} type of system, AHU shutdown simulation, and air-side simulation models. A prototype computer tool called the Potential Energy Savings Estimation (PESE) Toolkit is developed to implement the improved methodology and used for testing. The implemented methodology is tested in two retro-commissioned on-campus buildings with hourly measured consumption data. In the Sanders Corps of Cadets Center, the optimized profiles of parameter settings in single parameter optimizations can be explained with engineering principles. It reveals that the improved methodology is implemented correctly in the tool. The case study on the Coke Building shows that the improved methodology can be used in buildings with more than one system type. The methodology is then used to estimate annual potential energy cost savings for 14 office buildings in Austin, TX with very limited information and utility bills. The methodology has predicted an average total potential savings of 36 % for SDVAV systems with <b>electric</b> <b>terminal</b> reheat, 22 % for SDVAV systems with hot water reheat, and 25 % for DDVAV systems. The estimations are compared with savings predicted in the Continuous Commissioning assessment report. The results show it may be helpful to study the correlation by using generalized factors of assessment predicted energy cost savings to estimated potential energy cost savings. The factors identified in this application are 0. 68, 0. 66, and 0. 61 for each type of system. It is noted that one should be cautious in quoting these factors in future projects. In the future, it would be valuable to study the correlation between measured savings and estimated potential savings in a large number of buildings with retrocommissioning measures implemented. Additionally, further testing and modifications on the PESE Toolkit are necessary to make it a reliable software tool...|$|E

The CSI is a one-layer solenoid with an inner diameter of 1. 48 m and a height of 4. 45 m between <b>electric</b> <b>terminal</b> ends. The coil weight with the terminals is approximately 820 kg without insulation. The major goal of the CSI is to measure the temperature margin of the CS under the ITER direct current (DC) operating conditions, including determining sensitivity to load cycles. Performance of the joints, ramp rate sensitivity, and stability against thermal or electromagnetic disturbances, electrical insulation, losses, and instrumentation are addressed separately and therefore are not major goals in this project. However, losses and joint performance will be tested during the CSI testing campaign. The USIPO will build the CSI that will be tested at the Central Solenoid Model Coil (CSMC) Test Facility at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), Naka, Japan.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{technological}} developments have made available efficient bender transducers {{based on the}} piezoelectric effect. In this paper an electrical circuit analog to Timoshenko beam is synthesized using a Lagrangian method and by paralleling capacitive flux linkages to rotation and transverse displacement. A piezo-ElectroMechanical (PEM) beam is conceived by uniformly distributing piezoelectric transducers on a beam and interconnecting their <b>electric</b> <b>terminals</b> via the found analog circuit, completed with suitable resistors. The high performance features of the synthesized novel circuit include the following. (i) The circuit topology is extremely reduced, the used components are all but one two - terminal element, and the only two - port network needed is an ideal transformer. (ii) One and the same dissipative circuit ensures a multiresonance coupling with the vibrating beam and the optimal electric dissipation of mechanical vibrations energy. (iii) For a prototype of a PEM beam, {{the design of the}} analog circuit is possible and the obtained nominal values of the circuital elements ensure that can be technically realized without any external feeding. The insertion of resistors in the analog circuit is determined according to two optimally criteria (namely minimization of strain energy time envelope and maximization of vibration time rate decay), based on specific engineering needs.

40|$|International audienceThis {{review paper}} intends {{to gather and}} {{organize}} a series of works which discuss the possibility of exploiting the mechanical properties of distributed arrays of piezoelectric transducers. The concept {{can be described as}} follows: on every struc- tural member one can uniformly distribute an array of piezoelectric transducers whose <b>electric</b> <b>terminals</b> are to be connected to a suitably optimized electric waveguide. If the aim of such a modification is identified to be the suppression of mechanical vibrations then the optimal electric waveguide is identified to be the ‘electric analog’ of the considered structural member. The obtained electromechanical systems were called PEM (PiezoElectroMechanical) structures. The authors especially focus on the role played by Lagrange methods in the design of these analog circuits and in the study of PEM structures and we suggest some possible research developments in the conception of new devices, in their study and in their technological application. Other potential uses of PEMs, such as Structural Health Monitoring and Energy Harvesting, are described as well. PEM structures can be regarded as a particular kind of smart materials, i. e. materials especially designed and engineered to show a specific and well-defined response to external excitations: for this reason, the authors try to find connection between PEM beams and plates and some micromorphic materials whose properties as carriers of waves have been studied recently.

40|$|An {{engineering}} {{investigation into}} the dynamics and vibrations of magnetostrictive transducers is conducted. The transducers are examined from a linear systems perspective. The system input is electric current. The system output is displacement. A comparison is made between the classic low-signal linear transduction equations for the material and those for the electromechanical transducer containing the material. A magnetomechanical model is derived assuming the magnetostrictive rod behaves as a linear spring. The model is an expression for the complex valued, frequency, coupling, and load dependant magnetic permeability of the magnetostrictive material within the transducer. One-dimensional analytical constant parameter linear electromagnetic models of cylindrical magnetostrictive transducers are derived for the steady state, oscillating magnetic field strength {{as a function of}} radial position, electric current, and excitation frequency, H(r,l,[omega]). The first electromagnetic model is the classic solution for a cylindrical conducting rod in a wound wire solenoid. The second electromagnetic model is for cylindrical transducers with an external conducting cylindrical housing. Both models neglect end effects. The results are electromagnetic-magnetomechanical models of cylindrical magnetostrictive transducers including both the effects of eddy currents occurring within the transducer 2 ̆ 7 s components and dynamic effects. The models are formulated to calculate electrical impedance functions, Z[subscript]ee([omega]), as would be measured at the <b>electric</b> <b>terminals</b> of the transducers when run in their linear range of operation with a known load. Both models simulate the distinctive characteristics of a coupled electromechanical system, i. e., large variations with frequency occur in the electrical impedance magnitude and phase near the mechanical resonant frequency. Numerically disabling dynamic effects allows the calculation of what would be the blocked electrical impedance of the transducers, Z[subscript]e([omega]). Knowledge of Z[subscript] ee([omega]) and Z[subscript] e([omega]) allows calculation of the transduction coefficients, including the effects of eddy currents and the mechanical load connected to the transducer. From there, quantities of engineering interest can be calculated. Comparisons are made between experimental measurements and model simulations of transducer electrical impedance functions, and transducer displacement from current frequency response functions. Simulations of impedance and displacement were typically ± 10...|$|R
