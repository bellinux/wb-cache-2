5|$|After {{his college}} career, Durant {{was one of}} the most {{accomplished}} athletes in the school's history. He held 51 offensive records at the school. During his sophomore season, Durant set the school's single-game record <b>for</b> <b>passing</b> yards with 417 during a victory against Arizona State. In his junior year, he set single-season records with 389 passing attempts, 234 completions and 2,551 passing yards.

5|$|Between his 1969 {{victory in}} the race and 1981, Andretti {{dropped out of the}} races due to part {{failures}} or crashes. His luck seemed to turn around in 1981. Andretti finished second in the 1981 Indianapolis 500 by eight seconds behind Bobby Unser. The following day Unser was penalized one lap <b>for</b> <b>passing</b> cars under a caution flag, and Andretti was declared the winner. Unser and his car owner Roger Penske appealed the race stewards' decision. USAC overturned the one lap penalty four months later, and penalized Unser with a $40,000 fine.|$|E

All elected officials have four-year terms, with a maximum of three terms. The current mayor is Michael Hancock.|$|E
5|$|Milk served almost 11 {{months in}} office and was {{responsible}} <b>for</b> <b>passing</b> a stringent gay rights ordinance for the city. On November 27, 1978, Milk and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated by Dan White, another city supervisor, who had recently resigned to pursue a private business enterprise but who had sought to get his position back after that endeavor failed. White was sentenced to seven {{years in prison for}} manslaughter, later reduced to five years, and after his release in 1983, committed suicide two years later by carbon monoxide inhalation.|$|E

5|$|State quarterback Erik Kramer was the {{cornerstone}} {{of one of those}} high-powered offenses, passing for 2,092yards and 14touchdowns en route to All-ACC honors and being named the ACC's player of the year. He set school records <b>for</b> <b>passing</b> yards in a season and total yards in a season despite being hampered by an injured ankle suffered in the Wolfpack's game against South Carolina. He was ably assisted in the passing game by All-ACC receiver Nasrallah Worthen, who led the team in receptions after catching 41 passes for 686 yards. State's offense was mostly accumulated through the air, as the Wolfpack averaged less than 160 yards per game on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The English Civil War {{affected}} all of England; even {{families were}} split over Royalist or Parliamentarian loyalties.

5|$|Although {{beyond their}} jurisdiction, the Navigation commissioners {{attempted}} {{to extend their}} powers, to improve the river below the junction with Aike Beck. They particularly wanted to replace the stone Hull Bridge, near Beverley, with a swing bridge, {{which would make it}} easier for keels to reach Frodingham bridge. The Corporation of Beverley objected, because the bridge was the main route of communication between Beverley and Holderness, and the commissioners instead dredged parts of the river to improve access. Plans to improve Hull Bridge were again resisted by Beverley Corporation in 1799, but an agreement was finally reached in 1801, and an Act of Parliament was obtained in July of that year. William Chapman acted as engineer, as the act authorised the construction of towpaths, a new cut between Bethels Bridge and the lock at Struncheon Hill, to avoid a long loop in the river, and rebuilding of the bridge. The bridge cost £500, half of which was met by Richard Bethell, the owner of the Leven Canal, on condition that the tolls <b>for</b> <b>passing</b> through it were reduced significantly.|$|E
5|$|By 27 April, Berlin was cut {{off from}} the rest of Germany. Secure radio {{communications}} with defending units had been lost; the command staff in the bunker had to depend on telephone lines <b>for</b> <b>passing</b> instructions and orders and on public radio for news and information. On 28 April, a BBC report originating from Reuters was picked up; a copy of the message was given to Hitler. The report stated that Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler had offered to surrender to the western Allies; the offer had been declined. Himmler had implied to the Allies that he had the authority to negotiate a surrender; Hitler considered this treason. During the afternoon his anger and bitterness escalated into a rage against Himmler. Hitler ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's headquarters in Berlin) shot.|$|E
5|$|Durant {{signed a}} letter of intent to play college {{football}} at the University of North Carolina in 2000. In 2001, during his first NCAA season, Durant established school freshman records with 17 touchdown passes, 142 completions, 1843 passing yards and 1971 yards of total offense. His freshman records <b>for</b> <b>passing</b> yards and completions were broken in 2007 by T. J. Yates. During his freshman season, Durant was named Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Rookie of the Week five times. He finished second overall in ACC Rookie of the Year voting to Florida State quarterback Chris Rix. As a freshman, Durant split time with Ronald Curry, helping the team to {{a victory in the}} 2001 Peach Bowl against Auburn. He was awarded the Jeffrey Cowell Memorial Award as the team's top freshman.|$|E

5|$|Georgia State {{opened the}} second half with a drive to the Alabama 36-yard line {{to set up a}} school record 53-yard field goal by Wil Lutz. Alabama responded with a 68-yard march that ended in a {{touchdown}} pass from Blake Sims to Chris Black for a 45–3 lead. With the score at 45–3, neither team scored again. After a Panthers punt, Alabama's next drive ended with Crimson Tide backup kicker Adam Griffith missing a 30-yard field goal. Before his exit late in the second quarter, McCarron set the Alabama record <b>for</b> <b>passing</b> accuracy at 93.75%, going 15–16 and surpassed the previous record of 84.2% held by Ken Stabler. With the win, Alabama improved its all-time record against Georgia State to 2–0.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the {{angelshark}} is a nocturnal ambush predator that buries itself in sediment and waits <b>for</b> <b>passing</b> prey, mostly benthic bony fishes, but also skates and invertebrates. An aplacental viviparous species, females bear litters of seven to 25 pups every other year. The angelshark normally poses little danger to humans, though if provoked, it is quick to bite. Since the mid-20th century, intense commercial fishing across the angelshark's range has decimated its population via bycatch – it is now locally extinct or nearly so across most of its northern range, and the prospects of the remaining fragmented subpopulations are made more precarious by its slow rate of reproduction. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Critically Endangered.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are often}} awarded after record-breaking or near-record-breaking {{offensive}} seasons. Running back O. J.

When his record was broken by Eric Dickerson in 1984, Dickerson placed second in voting behind quarterback Dan Marino, who that year {{was the first to}} pass for 5,000 yards in a season. Marino's 5,084 yards stood as the record for 27 years before being broken by Drew Brees in 2011, who won that season's award. In turn, 2013 winner Peyton Manning set league single-season records <b>for</b> <b>passing</b> yards (5,477) and passing touchdowns (55).|$|E

5|$|The Longhorns {{were led}} on offense by quarterback James Brown, who {{completed}} 163 of 322 passes (50.6%) for 2,447yards, 19touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. These figures were {{enough for him}} to set the Texas single-season records <b>for</b> <b>passing</b> yards and passing touchdowns. Brown finished the season with a passer rating of 177, No. 1 in the NCAA in 1995. He was limited in practices prior to the Sugar Bowl because of a sprained ankle suffered in Texas' final regular-season game. Brown's favorite receiver was Mike Adams, who led the Southwest Conference by catching 53 passes for 876 yards and three touchdowns during the regular season. Adams was assisted by Justin McLemore, a sixth-year senior who caught 30 passes for 488 yards, including a 161-yard game against Houston. McLemore's 30 receptions were tied by tight end Pat Fitzgerald, who had eight touchdowns, No. 2 in the country for tight ends.|$|E

On the field, Ole Miss featured star quarterback Archie Manning, who despite being just a sophomore, was already making a name for himself and would later go on to set records <b>for</b> <b>passing</b> yardage and passing touchdowns for Ole Miss, en route to becoming one of the greatest quarterbacks in Mississippi history.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Graham {{and some of}} his teammates enlisted in the military but continued to play for Northwestern. Enlistees from other schools also enrolled at Northwestern, where the U.S. Navy had a training station. The 1943 season was a strong one for Northwestern. The team beat Ohio State, the defending national champions, and a good military team at Great Lakes Naval Station. The Wildcats lost to Notre Dame and Michigan, however, and finished the season with an 8–2 record and a ninth-place ranking in the AP Poll. Graham set another Big Ten passing record, was named the conference's Most Valuable Player, received All-American honors and finished third in Heisman Trophy voting.
