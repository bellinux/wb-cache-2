25|$|Cirano is Bob Rock's dog, {{who often}} {{participates in the}} group's missions. He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> dog, though easily bribed with food. He was {{acquired}} by Bob {{very early in the}} issues, and even though the dog is officially his, the entire TNT group takes care of him, with mostly Alan, Bob or The Boss taking him for walks and/or feeding him. More than once, he was used by Sir Oliver for his various schemes. Running gag in the series is his frequent attempts to eat Squitty, only to be stopped and then violently assaulted by The Boss.|$|E
25|$|Staal is an {{excellent}} skater, adept shot blocker and regular penalty killer with the Rangers. Offensively, he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> passer who makes the intelligent plays to his teammates and generally plays positionally. Due to his skating ability, he periodically joins the offensive rush despite being a defenceman. He has a very accurate wrist shot and a hard slapshot that has improved in accuracy since his NHL debut. His improving offence led him to see more ice time on the power play beginning in the 2010–11 season, where he can apply those offensive skills more directly in the scoring effort. Upon entering the NHL, the Rangers coaching staff have primarily used him in a defensive role. However his point totals improved steadily his first few years in the NHL, and each year from 2007–08 to 2009–10, he established new career highs in goals, assists and points.|$|E

500|$|Inside Man has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes sampled 197 reviews, and currently has an 86% rating, making it [...] "Certified Fresh". The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Spike Lee's energetic and clever bank-heist thriller <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> genre film {{that is not}} only rewarding on its own terms, but manages to subvert its pulpy trappings with wit and skill -- and Denzel Washington is terrific as a brilliant hostage negotiator." [...] Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned Inside Man a weighted average score of 76 (out of 100) based on 39 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be [...] "generally favorable reviews". CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] on an A+ to F scale, with exit polls showing that 54% of the audience was male, while 68% was at least 30 years old or older. The American Film Institute named Inside Man {{as one of the top}} ten films of 2006.|$|E
500|$|On June 14 and 22, 2005, Deep Impact {{observed}} two {{outbursts of}} activity from the comet, {{the latter being}} six {{times larger than the}} former. The spacecraft studied the images of various distant stars to determine its current trajectory and position. Don Yeomans, a mission co-investigator for JPL pointed out that [...] "it takes 7½ minutes for the signal to get back to Earth, so you cannot joystick this thing. You have to rely {{on the fact that the}} Impactor <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> spacecraft as is the Flyby spacecraft. So you have to build in the intelligence ahead of time and let it do its thing." [...] On June 23, 2005, the first of the two final trajectory correct maneuvers (targeting maneuver) was successfully executed. A 6m/s (20ft/s) velocity change was needed to adjust the flight path towards the comet and target the impactor at a window in space about [...] wide.|$|E
500|$|Nell on {{the other}} hand <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> and {{responsible}} girl, age seventeen {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She too goes through character development. Initially, as one reviewer put it, Nell is filled with a [...] "maelstorm of angst" [...] as she tries to figure out her relationship with Brooke and both [...] "shocked and intrigued" [...] by Brooke's eccentric behaviour. Though she expresses herself as in the control of most situations, in fact she is not, especially when Brooke is involved. One reviewer noted that Nell's voice in the novel is not altogether convincing, saying [...] "the levels of diction and spelling here seem rather high to be coming up from the kitchen". The centrality of Nell in the novel was inspired by a postcard that Dawson bought which showed the maids from The Orchard during Brooke's stay. Though inspired by real individuals, Nell's character primarily draws inspiration from many individuals in Dawson's own life. The name Nell Golightly is a mix of two names: Izzie Golightly, a close friend of Dawson's mother, and Nelly Boxall, Virginia Woolf's servant.|$|E

500|$|In March 2009, {{speculation}} arose that Walton {{had taken}} a medical leave; however, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported {{that she had been}} asked to accept a salary cut and had decided to leave. The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill. She later clarified her departure as having to do with [...] "family and this economy". She stated: [...] "I felt so bad that so many people have lost their jobs, that, all of a sudden, I thought: 'This is really silly. I have a wonderful job and I really think I owe it to myself and my family to continue on.'" [...] In February 2012, Walton signed a new contract with the soap opera, which would continue her portrayal of the role for an unspecified amount of time. The actress was then announced to be taking a leave of absence beginning that April, slated to last six months. [...] She made her return on November 2, 2012. After her return, Walton confirmed in an interview with Soap Opera Digest that she had voluntarily dropped to recurring status to allow for more time with her family.|$|E
500|$|When Chapter 27 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, {{the film}} was debated {{fiercely}} by critics. A website reported, [...] "the audience's reactions made it obvious that some people would love it and others would not." [...] Andrew O'Hehir from Salon wrote, [...] "Some viewers may well find Chapter 27 sleazy or distasteful, and I won't argue the point. But Schaefer's movie creates its own highly compelling world, which {{is pretty much the}} prime directive in filmmaking." [...] He stated that [...] "Leto almost makes you feel how it happened," [...] and called his acting a [...] "highly compelling performance on many levels." [...] He also enjoyed Lohan's performance. Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Chapter 27 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> attempt to distill the twisted psychology and motivation of Mark David Chapman, which we've all superficially gleaned through mass-media reports and intermittent updates on Chapman's incarceration." [...] He praised Leto's acting saying, [...] "Jared Leto is mesmeric as the bloated, deranged Chapman. It's a brilliantly measured performance, evincing the tale of a madman through his own awful rhyme and reason." [...] He also praised Schaefer's direction, the other cast and crew. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars saying, [...] "By the end of this modest, strange venture, Leto made me believe it was worth being forced to hang out on the sidewalk with this man, if only to get a creeping sense of what that might've been like." ...|$|E
500|$|Kaminey {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} from critics who praised {{many aspects of}} the film. Raja Sen of Rediff.com rated the film 4.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Kaminey is startlingly clever, an innovative film with genuine surprises. A kind of film whose success we ought all pray for, because it'll prove smart cinema works." [...] The Indian Express gave a rating of 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "Bollywood's first all-the-way-out-to-there pulp fiction". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 4 stars out of 5, called it a [...] "must watch" [...] and wrote, [...] "t's an unpredictable crime drama that combines violence and dark humor in a manner that's reminiscent of the films of Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and the Coen Brothers. And yet Kaminey is so original and inventive {{in the manner in which}} it takes Bollywood's favorite formulatwin brothersand turns it on its head." [...] He praised the writingwhich he said was the film's real strength, the non-linear screenplay and the dialogue, and wrote that the film has [...] "the best performance you will see by an ensemble cast in a long time". Nikhat Kazmi from The Times of India rated the film 4 out of 5, and said it is [...] "Bollywood's first film which is full of brains, brawn and belligerence besides being a bravura attempt to rewrite the tried and tested idiom of desi movielore. Kaminey <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> and balsy film that brings Hollywood to Bollywood which catapult the viewer into the dark, violent world of crime and criminals, leaving you no time to blink or breathe easy...Tarantino, take a bow. Brave new Bollywood is here." ...|$|E

Originally, Tiana {{was supposed to be}} known as [...] "Maddy". Mark Henn served as the supervising animator for Tiana in both human and frog form, making her one of several Disney lead female characters he has animated. Henn declared that he attempted to make a character that could stand on its own [...] "without repeating what I've done on Belle, Ariel, and Jasmine", with Tiana having a more cynical and grounded personality. Rose's performance influenced much of the animation, with the actress even suggesting to Henn for Tiana to be left-handed like herself.|$|E
