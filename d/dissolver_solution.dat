40|$|The {{first step}} in {{processing}} low-enriched uranium (LEU) targets for production of {sup 99 }Mo is to dissolve the neutron-irradiated uranium foil coming from the reactor.

On the basis of these dissolution rates, the process chemistry, and a model that integrates dissolution rates as a function of temperature and composition, a closed stainless-steel dissolver was designed, built, and tested for dissolving up to 18 g of uranium foil. The results were quite successful, with the uranium foil being dissolved within one hour as desired. To do this, the dissolver temperature must be in the range from 97 to 102 C, and the <b>dissolver</b> <b>solution</b> (cocktail) must have a composition of 3 M nitric acid and 2 M sulfuric acid.

40|$|The {{solutions}} {{from the}} dissolution of sand, slag, and crucible (SS&C) material are sufficiently different from previous solutions processed via the F-Canyon Purex process that the effectiveness of individual process steps needed to be ascertained. In this study, the effectiveness of gelatin strike was tested {{under a variety of}} conditions. Specifically, several concentrations of silica, fluoride, nitric acid (HNO{sub 3 }), boric acid (H{sub 3 }BO{sub 3 }), and aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (ANN) were studied. The disengagement times of surrogate and plant SS&C dissolver solutions from plant solvent also were measured. The results of the tests indicate that gelatin strike does not coagulate the silica at the low concentration of silica ({tilde 30 } ppm) expected in the SS&C dissolver solutions because the silicon is complexed with fluoride ions (e. g., SiF{sub 6 }{sup - 2 }). The silicon fluoride complex is expected to remain with the aqueous phase during solvent extraction. The disengagement times of the dissolver solutions from the plant solvent were not affected by the presence of low concentrations of silica and no third phase formation was observed in the disengagement phase with the low silica concentrations. Tests of surrogate SS&C dissolver solutions with higher concentration of silica (less than 150 ppm) did show that gelatin strike followed by centrifugation resulted in good phase disengagement of the surrogate SS{ampersand}C <b>dissolver</b> <b>solution</b> from the plant <b>dissolver</b> <b>solution.</b> At the higher silica concentrations, there is not sufficient fluoride to complex with the silica, and the silica must be entrained by the gelatin and removed from the <b>dissolver</b> <b>solution</b> prior to solvent extraction...|$|E

Decontamination factor of AGS (silica-gel impregnated with silver nitrate) column for iodine- 129 removal was measured {{to be more}} than 36, 000. The measurement of iodine- 129 profile in the adsorption column showed that the nuclide was effectively trapped by the adsorbent. Measurement of iodine- 129 in the <b>dissolver</b> <b>solution</b> after the iodine-stripping operation using NO 2 gas at 363 K, revealed that less than 0. 57 % of total iodine- 129 generated, which was estimated by ORIGEN II calculation, was remained in the <b>dissolver</b> <b>solution.</b> Also, measurement of iodine- 129 by an iodine-stripping operation from the <b>dissolver</b> <b>solution</b> using potassium iodate showed that another 2. 72 % of total iodine- 129 precipitated as iodide. In addition, about 70 % of total iodine generated was measured in the AGS columns. Rest of iodine- 129 was supposed to adsorb to a HEPA filter and the inner surface of dissolver off-gas lines. Those results on iodine- 129 distribution were found to be almost identical to the results obtained in the study using iodine- 131 as tracer and the results reported by other works. It was demonstrated that the two-steps iodine-stripping method using potassium iodate could expel additional iodine from the solution, more effectively than iodine-stripping operation using NO 2 gas. Iodine- 131 was also detected on the AGS columns at the spent fuel dissolution. Increasing burnup showed larger amount of iodine- 131 since amount of curium- 244 contained in the spent fuel increased with the burnup.

This tape will disentangle in the normal H-Canyon <b>dissolver</b> <b>solution</b> and have no detrimental effect on the H-Canyon process. Upon placement of Fasson 0802 tape into the <b>dissolver</b> <b>solution,</b> nitric acid will attack and disentangle the block copolymer network and destroy the adhesive nature of the material, resulting in insoluble particles that can be removed via centrifuge operations (cake weight increase of no more than 1 percent). The addition of the tape will not generate off-gas products and the resultant solution characteristics (surface tension, viscosity, density, and disengagement time) will be unaffected. Further, the potential effect on the down-stream evaporation system is negligible. Since the tape will not be placed in a high radiation environment, radiation stability is not an issue. Through detailed discussions with Avery Dennison chemists and based on analytical tests, a fairly detailed understanding of the constituents comprising the proprietary adhesive system has been assembled.

HB-Line dissolves plutonium dioxide (PuO{sub 2 }) from K-Area parting {{support of the}} 3013 Destructive Examination (DE) program. The PuO{sub 2 }-bearing solids originate {{from a variety of}} unit operations and processing facilities, but all of the material is assumed to be high-fired (i. e., calcined in air for a minimum of two hours at {ge} 750 C). The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) conducted dissolution flowsheet studies on 3013 DE Sample 10 - 16 (can R 610826), which contains weapons-grade plutonium (Pu) as the fissile material. The dissolution flowsheet study was performed for 4 hours at 108 C on unwashed material using 12 M nitric acid (HNO{sub 3 }) containing 0. 20 M potassium fluoride (KF). After 4 hours at 108 C, the {sup 239 }Pu Equivalent concentration was 32. 5 g/L (gamma, 5. 0 % uncertainty). The insoluble residue comprised 9. 88 wt % of the initial bulk weight, and contained 5. 31 - 5. 95 wt % of the initial Pu. The residue contained Pu in the highest concentration, followed by tungsten (W). Analyses detected 2, 770 mg/L chloride (Cl{sup -}) in the final <b>dissolver</b> <b>solution</b> (3. 28 wt %), which is significantly lower than the amount of Cl{sup -} detected by prompt gamma (9. 86 wt %) and the 3013 DE Surveillance program (14. 7 wt %). A low bias in chloride measurement is anticipated due to volatilization during the experiment. Gas generation studies found approximately 60 mL of gas per gram of sample produced during the first 30 minutes of dissolution. Little to no gas was produced after the first 30 minutes. Hydrogen gas (H{sub 2 }) was not detected in the sample. Based on detection limits and accounting for dilution, the generated gas contained < 0. 12 vol % H{sub 2 }, which is well below the 4. 0 vol % flammability limit for H{sub 2 } in air.

Subsequently, SRTC/MTS was requested to develop and perform a corrosion testing program {{to assess the impact}} of new flow sheets on corrosion of the dissolver wall. The two primary variables evaluated were the fluoride and aluminum concentrations of the <b>dissolver</b> <b>solution.</b> Fluoride was added as Calcium Fluoride (CaF{sub 2 }) while the aluminum was added either as metallic aluminum, which was subsequently dissolved, or as the chemical aluminum nitrate (Al(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 3 }). The dissolved aluminum metal was used to simulate the dissolution of the aluminum from the Mark 42 cladding and fuel matrix. Solution composition for the corrosion tests bracketed the flow sheet for the Mark 42. Corrosion rates of AISI Type 304 stainless steel coupons, both welded and non-welded coupons, were calculated from measured weight losses and post-test concentrations of soluble Fe, Cr and Ni. The corrosion rates, which ranged between 2. 7 and 32. 5 mpy, were calculated from both the one day and the one week weight losses. These corrosion rates indicated a relatively mild corrosion on the dissolver vessel. The welded coupons consistently had a higher corrosion rate than the non-welded coupons. The difference between the two decreased as the solution aggressiveness decreased. In these test solutions, aggressiveness corresponded with the fluoride concentration.

An investigation was made of the thermodynamics and limits of flammability of gases expected during the dissolution of sodium-bonded stainlesssteel-clad fuels in aqua regia or sulfuric acid. The amount of hydrogen evolved during Darex dissolution of 304 stain less steel was studied as a function of the fraction of total dissolving time and the total gas evolved.

Transpassivation potential of U metal was found weakly effected by HNO 3 concentration varying from 448 to 470 mV/Ag/AgCl.

The results of corrosion and dissolution studies of Tc metal and Tc - Ru alloys containing from 19 to 70 at. % Ru in 0. 5 0 – 6 M HNO 3 indicate the formation of passive films of Tc(IV) – Ru(III,IV) hydroxides at the electrode surface in the solutions containing less than 2 M HNO 3 at the potentials less than 650 mV/Ag/AgCl. The increase of HNO 3 concentration to values exceeding 3 M and the shift of the electrode potential towards positive direction causes the transition of the Tc and Tc-Ru alloys to transpassive state.

40|$|The hybrid K-edge {{densitometry}} (KED) and {{x-ray fluorescence}} (XRF) densitometer {{is a unique}} nondestructive assay (NDA) technique to determine the concentrations of nuclear material (SNM) in solutions. The technique is ideally suited to assay the <b>dissolver</b> <b>solutions</b> {{as well as the}} uranium and plutonium product solutions from reprocessing It is an important instrument for safeguarding reprocessing; it is also a useful tool in analytical laboratories because of its capability of analyzing mixed solutions of SNM without chemical separation. Figure 1 shows the hardware of an hybrid system developed at Los Alamos. The hybrid densitometer employs a combination of two complimentary techniques: absorption KED and XRF. The KED technique measures the transmission of a tightly collimated photon beam through the sample; it is therefore quite insensitive to the radiation emitted by the sample material. Fission product level of {approximately} 1 Ci/mL can be tolerated. The technique is insensitive to matrix variation. XRF measures the fluorescent x-rays from the same sample and can be used to determine the ratios of SNM. The technique can be applied to thorium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, and americium concentration determination. The technique can also be applied to mixed solutions found in nuclear fuel cycle without separation: thorium-uranium, uranium-plutoniun neptunium-plutonium-americium. The design of the hybrid densitometer is shown schematically in Figs. 1 and 2; Fig. 1 shows the top view; Fig. 2 shows the side view. The heart of the design is the changer. The sample changer can accommodate a sample tray, which holds up to six samples. The samples can be a 2 -cm path length cell, 4 -cm path length cell, or a mixture of both sizes. The sample tray is controlled by a "Compumotor" which in turn is controlled by a computer. The absolute position of the sample cell can be reproduced to a standard deviation of 0. 02 mm. The sample changer is housed inside square stainless steel tubing which is bolted onto the glove box. The sample cells can be observed during the movement or assay through a leaded glass viewport, as shown in Fig. 3...|$|R
40|$|Two water-filled {{concrete}} pools (K Basins) in the 100 -K Area of the U. S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site in Washington State contain about 2100 {{metric tons}} of irradiated metallic uranium fuel elements and about 52 cubic meters of heterogeneous radioactive sludge. In the D&D of this facility, chemical processing of the sludge is being considered {{as a means to}} decrease the sludge’s chemical reactivity, dispose the radioactivity onsite to existing facilities, and ensure criticality safety.

40|$|Several {{processes}} are reviewed for recovering 3 ssion platinoids from radioactive liquids and solid material that typically originate during the reprocessing of {{spent nuclear fuel}} by the Purex process. The liquids are radioactive high-level liquid waste and the solution obtained on dissolving the spent nuclearfitel in nitric acid (<b>dissolver</b> <b>solution).</b> The solid is the undksolved fuel residue (dissolver residue). The processes described here have been particularly developed to recover platinoids or; ifaimed at the separation of actinides, platinoid recovery is included. Hydrometallurgical {{processes are}} predominantly based on solvent extraction, electrodeposition and ion exchange, and less frequently on precipitation and extraction chromatography. Pyrochemical processes are based on extraction or distillation. In Part I of this paper, general aspects of the recovery of fission platinoids from wastes resulting from reprocessing spent nuclear fuels by the Purex process were described (1). The main platinoid fractions are released from the Purex process in the radioactive htgh-level liquid waste (HLLw) an...|$|E

These acidic dissolver solutions must be made alkaline by treatment with NaOH solution before they are disposed to ~ the Tank Waste Remediation System on the Hanford Site. During the alkali treatments, sodium diuranate, hydroxides of iron and aluminum, and radioelements (uranium, plutonium, and americium) will precipitate from the <b>dissolver</b> <b>solution.</b> Laboratory tests, discussed here, were pefiormed to provide information on these precipitates and their precipitation behavior that is important in designing the engineering flowsheet for the treatment process. Specifically, experiments were conducted to determine the optimum precipitation conditions; the completeness of uranium, plutonium, and americium precipitation; the rate of sedimentation; and the physico-chemical characteristics of the solids formed by alkali treatment of simulated acidic dissolver solutions. These experiments also determined the redistribution of uranium, plutonium, and americium flom the sodium di~ate and iron and al&inurn hydroxide precipitates upon contact with carbonate- and EDTA-bearing simulated waste solutions.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this report involved comprehensive bench-scale testing of nitric acid (HNO{sub 3 }) dissolution of actual sludge materials from the Hanford K East (KE) Basin to confirm the baseline chemical pretreatment process. In addition, process monitoring and material balance information was collected to support the development and refinement of process flow diagrams. The testing was performed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for the US Department of Energy's Office of Spent Fuel Stabilization (EM- 67) and Numatec Hanford Corporation (NHC) {{to assist in the}} development of the K Basin Sludge Pretreatment Process. The baseline chemical pretreatment process for K Basin sludge is nitric acid dissolution of all particulate material passing a 1 / 4 -in. screen. The acid-insoluble fraction (residual solids) will be stabilized (possibly by chemical leaching/rinsing and grouting), packaged, and transferred to the Hanford Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility (ERDF). The liquid fraction is to be diluted with depleted uranium for uranium criticality safety and iron nitrate for plutonium criticality safety, and neutralized with sodium hydroxide. The liquid fraction and associated precipitates are to be stored in the Hanford Tank Waste Remediation Systems (TWRS) pending vitrification. It is expected that most of the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), associated with some K Basin sludges, will remain with the residual solids for ultimate disposal to ERDF. Filtration and precipitation during the neutralization step will further remove trace quantities of PCBs within the liquid fraction. The purpose of the work discussed in this report was to examine the dissolution behavior of actual KE Basin sludge materials at baseline flowsheet conditions and validate the. dissolution process step through bench-scale testing. The progress of the dissolution was evaluated by measuring the solution electrical conductivity and concentrations of key species in the <b>dissolver</b> <b>solutions</b> as a function of reaction (dissolution) time, by analyzing offgas generation rate and composition, and by analyzing intermittent and final acid-insoluble solids at the end of the dissolution. The testing was conducted in a system designed to assess parameters that can influence sludge dissolution and provide information that can be used to determine operating conditions for the actual system...|$|R

The {{design of the}} equipment, experimental studies and operating experience are described. Dissolution of yellow cake and recycled uranium oxide materials was readily carried out in a 100 ℓ <b>dissolver</b> to give <b>solutions</b> containing 300 gU ℓ - 1 and 0. 5 to 4 П nitric acid. Filtration of silica from this solution prior to solvent extraction was not necessary in this work for yellow cake containing 0. 25 per cent silica. A low acid flowsheet for uranium purification was developed in which the nitric acid consumption was reduced by 76 per cent and the throughput of the mixer-settler units was increased by 67 per cent compared with the initial design flowsheet. Nine extraction and seven scrubbing stages were used with a feed solution containing 300 gU ℓ - 1 and 1. 0 П nitric acid and with {{a portion of the}} product recycled as scrub solution.
