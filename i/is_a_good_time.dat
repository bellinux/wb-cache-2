500|$|Wayne Storr of On the Box {{stated the}} series premiere is [...] "another {{cracking}} episode," [...] and [...] "truly wonderful that Spooks still pulls it together {{to be one}} of the best British shows on telly." [...] Storr also stated the episode is an [...] "absolute must watch for anyone who has ever been a fan. For those who aren't, now <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to start." [...] Whilst also reviewing the second episode, as both episodes are considered a two-parter, Greg O'Keefe of the Liverpool Echo stated it was [...] "packed with great action sequences, razor-sharp writing and the usual quota of twists and turns.

He asserted: [...] "Cougar Town hasn't taken as big of a step up from season one to season two as it did from the first part of season one to the last part of season one. But the step from 'average' to 'good' was the easy part. Season two is the season where viewers are going {{to find out if the}} show has what it takes to make the small steps needed to get from 'good' to 'great'. There's every indication that it's on the way there in the premiere because it's finally started to wrestle with some of the knottier questions at its center." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall opined that the show averted from its original premise; [...] "It's become one of my favorite comedies, and whether you care about Aniston or not, tonight <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> to sample it if you dismissed it last year because of the title, the original premise or some of those early episodes." ...|$|E
