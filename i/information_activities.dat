He said that the media must never give the terrorists a tribune or help them acquire operational information, and double media standards are intolerable. He proposed a contract on anti-terror between the authorities and the media with a behavioural codex of the journalists {{and the creation of a}} special state body for informational counteraction organisation and coordination of the <b>information</b> <b>activities</b> of all state structures operating to counter terror. In his view, the media are to a certain degree a catalyst for terrorism because terrorist acts of such a volume would be impossible without them; also, the press induces panic in the organs of state authority and affects the public negatively.|$|E

40|$|This study {{measures}} the economic consequences of <b>information</b> security <b>activities,</b> in general, {{and more specifically}} {{the market value of}} disclosures of <b>information</b> security <b>activities.</b> Since <b>information</b> security <b>activities</b> are primarily non-revenue generating, management tends to view them as the cost-of-doing-business, with no impact on firm value. Furthermore, managers are reluctant to share the details, because that {{they do not want to}} attract the attention of hackers. However, voluntary disclosures of information security can help reduce information asymmetry, which leads to belief revisions by investors, and hence corrects the misspecifications (if any) of the firm’s market value. In other words, voluntary disclosures of security activities are signaling mechanisms. The objective of this dissertation is to develop a taxonomy of disclosures of <b>information</b> security <b>activities,</b> and empirically test the value relevance of such disclosures. Based on a sample of 1, 637 disclosing firms, the empirical results provide support for the argument that voluntary disclosures of <b>information</b> security <b>activities</b> are value-relevant. Industry-wide analyses support the disclosure taxonomy developed, and highlight that firms which are technology an...|$|R

The Effectiveness of <b>Information</b> Gap <b>Activity</b> to Teach Speaking Viewed from Students’ Creativity (An Experimental Research at the Second Gradeof SMA N 1 Madiun in the Academic Year of 2013 / 2014). Thesis. Surakarta. English Education Department of Graduate School, Sebelas Maret University. 2013. The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are: (1) to reveal whether <b>Information</b> Gap <b>Activity</b> {{is more effective than}} Direct Instruction to teach Speaking; (2) to reveal whether students having high creativity have better speaking skill than those having low creativity; and (3) to reveal whether there is an interaction between teaching methods and the students’ creativity in teaching Speaking. The experimental research was conducted at SMA N 1 Madiun, from May to June 2014. The sample of the research was two classes; those were social science class- 1 which was treated as experimental class taught by using <b>Information</b> Gap <b>Activity</b> and social science class- 3 which was treated as control class taught by using Direct Instruction. Each of them consisted of 20 students. The instruments of collecting data were tests. They were creativity test and speaking test. The researcher analyzed the data using ANOVA or analysis of variance and Tukey test. Based on the result of data analysis, the research findings are: (1) <b>Information</b> Gap <b>Activity</b> is more effective than Direct Instruction to teach speaking; (2) the students having high creativity have better speaking skill than those having low creativity; and (3) there is an interaction between teaching methods and students’ creativity in teaching speaking. Finally the research findings imply that <b>Information</b> Gap <b>Activity</b> is an effective method to teach speaking. The findings show that students who are taught using <b>Information</b> Gap <b>Activity</b> have better speaking skill than those who are taught using Direct Instruction Method, it recommended for English teachers to apply <b>Information</b> Gap <b>Activity</b> in teaching speaking class Key word: <b>Information</b> Gap <b>Activity,</b> Direct Instruction Method, Creativity, Experimental Study. ...|$|R
