50|$|The {{reserve is}} rich in wetland plants with large areas of reed and willow and {{uncommon}} species such as <b>eight-stamened</b> <b>waterwort,</b> flowering rush, marsh fern and hop sedge. Among the insects are hairy dragonfly, variable damselfly and various water beetles. Mammals include otter and water vole.|$|E
50|$|The {{aquatic flora}} {{composed}} of reed, common club-rush, flowering rush, yellow iris, greater water-parsnip, brooklime, bulbous rush, toad rush, <b>eight-stamened</b> <b>waterwort,</b> needle spike-rush, spring quillwort, amphibious bistort, pale persicaria, rigid hornwort, horned pondweed, perfoliate pondweed, blunt-leaved pondweed, grass-wrack pondweed, fennel pondweed, various-leaved pondweed, lesser pondweed, fan-leaved water-goosefoot, whorled water-milfoil, alternate water-milfoil, spiked water-milfoil, Canadian waterweed, Nuttall's waterweed, and common duckweed. There are stoneworts such as Chara delicatula and Nitella flexilis.|$|E
50|$|The loch is botanically-rich loch and Martnaham Wood {{is one of}} {{the largest}} oak woods in Ayrshire; {{although}} it was clear felled in 1914, it has regenerated with little disturbance. The loch exhibits vegetation of submerged, floating and emergent type plant communities. The margin has extensive areas of reed-swamp dominated by common reed. Branched bur-reed, water-plantain, nodding bur-marigold, trifid bur-marigold, greater spearwort, and <b>eight-stamened</b> <b>waterwort</b> are found at the site. In the deeper water white and yellow water-lilies dominate. Canadian pondweed is an invasive plant and is here in abundance. The loch is classed as mesotrophic (moderately nutrient-rich), however it has eutrophic characteristics.|$|E
40|$|The {{past and}} present {{occurrence}} of Elatine hydropiper L. (<b>eight-stamened</b> <b>waterwort),</b> E. hexandra (Lapierre) DC. (six-stamened waterwort) and E. triandra Schkuhr (three-stamened waterwort) in the Netherlands is discussed. It has proved possible to distinguish the slightly curved seeds of E. hexandra and E. triandra in subfossil material on morphological grounds. E. hexandra {{is the most common}} species at present, but subfossil finds are confined to Late-glacial and Pre-boreal sediments of one lake in the Pleistocene area of the Netherlands. Living plants of E. triandra have only been found in the Netherlands in 1838 â€“ 1839, but there are 17 records from five archaeological sites, all located in the western Dutch estuarine area. Several of these sites also yielded E. hydropiper, archaeobotanically the most common species. The occurrence of E. triandra and E. hydropiper in the Netherlands seems to have been favoured by high summer temperatures. The ecological amplitude of this combination of species gives firm clues for the reconstruction of the environment, which must have been a freshwater tidal area. Since this type of environment is strongly threatened on a worldwide scale, the presence of these species in the past may also provide interesting information for present nature development projects in the Dutch estuarine are...|$|E
