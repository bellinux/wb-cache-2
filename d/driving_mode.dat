25|$|The {{production}} Prius Plug-in has {{a number}} of key changes from the demonstration units that were deployed in the field for testing based on that experience and customer feedback. The production version has two key modifications from the demonstration vehicle to improve efficiency: the ability to select between EV and hybrid mode, and the ability to recharge the battery from regenerative braking. Toyota decided to include a selectable electric <b>driving</b> <b>mode</b> (EV mode), allowing drivers to conserve energy for use in those places where EV mode is more efficient, such as city driving. Production Prius PHVs may direct the regenerative braking energy to the electric-vehicle battery, rather than the regular hybrid system battery, thus providing additional range in EV mode.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{mobility}} prediction of batteries for an emission-free Electric Vehicle. The data-driven {{model has been}} developed based on empirical data from two different road types –highway and local streets –and two different <b>driving</b> <b>modes</b> – aggressive and moderate. Battery State of Charge (SoC) can be predicted on any new roads based on the trained model by selecting the drving mode. In this paper, the performance of Adaptive Recurrent Neural Network (ARNN) and regression is evaluated using two benchmark data sets. The ARNN model at first estimates the speed profile of the new road based on slope and then both slope and speed {{is going to be}} used as the input to estimate battery current and SoC. Through comparison it is found that if ARNN system is appropriately trained, it performs with better accuracy than Regression in both two road types and <b>driving</b> <b>modes.</b> The results show that prediction SoC model follows the Columbcounting SoC according to the road slope. 1 1...|$|R

40|$|Several hybrid-electric vehicle {{architectures}} {{have been}} commercialized to serve different categories of vehicles and driving conditions. Such architectures can be optimally controlled by switching among <b>driving</b> <b>modes,</b> namely, the power distribution schemes in their planetary gear (PG) transmissions, {{in order to}} operate the vehicle in the most efficient regions of engine and motor maps. This paper proposes a systematic way to identify the optimal architecture for a given vehicle drive cycle, rather than parametrically optimizing one or more pre-selected architectures. An automatic generator of feasible <b>driving</b> <b>modes</b> for a given number of PGs is developed. For a powertrain consisting of one engine, two motors and two PGs, this generator results in 1116 modes. A heuristic search is then proposed to find a near-optimal pair of modes for a given driving cycle and vehicle specification. In a study this process identifies a dual-mode architecture with an 8 % improvement in fuel economy compared to a commercially available architecture over a standard drive cycle. ...|$|R
