His ban against alcoholic beverages, which made entertainment news during 2008, {{was an attempt to}} prevent the disruptive and distracting movement of audience members leaving their seats during the performances. In a 2009 interview, Morrison stated: [...] "I do not consciously aim to take the listener anywhere. If anything, I aim to take myself there in my music. If the listener catches the wavelength of what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> or singing, or gets whatever point whatever line means to them, then I guess as a writer I may have done a day's work." ...|$|E

Spears told MTV News that after she first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Spears spoke about Martin's productions on Femme Fatale, saying, [...] "Max played a huge role on this album {{and he has been}} there since the beginning so there is such a huge level of trust. He gets exactly what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> when I tell him what I want and don’t want musically". Spears recorded her vocals at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The track was later mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It was registered on Broadcast Music Incorporated under the legal title [...] "In Love With a Criminal". On March 2, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account a link to a 17-second clip of the song, describing it as [...] "one of [...] favorites".|$|E

Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of [...] "the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book..." [...] Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism [...] "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe." [...] Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: [...] "It's not in my nature to talk about banning books. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying,</b> read it– with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about. And read it beside African works." [...] Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled [...] "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": [...] "Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And {{if it were not for}} what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction." ...|$|E

It's all marketing, baby." [...] O'Neal also added that had he stayed with the Lakers, he and Bryant would have won another three or four titles. [...] "We're still the greatest little-man, big-man 1-2 punch ever created {{in the history of the}} game", O'Neal said. At the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, O'Neal, Bryant, and Jackson were all reunited on the West squad. O'Neal and Bryant were both named co-MVPs for the game and were shown laughing and hugging during the game. O'Neal told Bryant to keep the MVP trophy, but Bryant instead gave it to O'Neal's son. For O'Neal, Bryant's gesture marked a turning point in their relationship. Bryant and the Lakers would go to face the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA Finals.
