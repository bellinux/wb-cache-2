However, the measured experimentally effective lifetime of minority carriers in the n-type black silicon is 1. 55 ms and is determined by the surface lifetime. The measured effective lifetime of minority charge carriers in the p-type polished silicon is 1. 24 ms.

40|$|Casuarina {{trees were}} planted as {{windbreak}} belts along the perimeters of the Taichung Harbor for thirty years. Due to the harsh local environments and strong typhoon attacked in recent years, numerous Casuarina trees have died. As a result, various canopy {{gaps in the}} intended windbreak belt have been created. This study was mainly conducted to understand the influences of these canopy gaps on the local microclimate in the windbreak belt, by the multi-layer anemometer, instruments of microclimate, and TDR (Time-Domain-Reflectometry) soil moisture observations. The {{results of this study}} may be useful for coast windbreak management. The results indicated that the soils in the forest zone of Taichung harbor is sand with extremely low organic matter content. This is unfavorable to grow and sprout in forest. The bulk density and particle density of soils in each canopy gaps are between 1. 44 ～ 1. 48 g/cm 3 and 2. 28 ～ 2. 46 g/cm 3 respectively and have no conspicuous difference. The average porosity of the soils is 38 % in the experimental areas. Casuarina trees have good salinity tolerance, and the electrical conductivity experiment shows that the soil salinity level is low. As a result, it has small influences on growing of Casuarina trees. Moreover, the smaller canopy gap is, the smaller air temperature difference is, but the relative humidity is higher (more than 78 %). The atmospheric pressure and soil moisture have little difference in different canopy gaps of forest. The soil moisture in the fully stocked forest land, forest land with a small and medium canopy gap is 0. 4 % higher then it in forest land with a large canopy gap and the check plot. The daily sunshine duration, radiation, illumination, evaporation, and soil temperature appeared to positively related to canopy gaps. The average height of Casuarina trees in the study area lies between 10 ～ 13 m, and the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>cone</b> lies between 7 ～ 9 m approximately. Most seeds can float 10. 8 ～ 17. 2 m by wind, a few can float even farther. Therefore, it is proposed that 30 m to be used as the thinning interval. 台中港木麻黃防風林造林迄今已屆 30 年，由於立地環境惡劣，以及近年來強勁颱風吹襲之影響，許多林木開始衰退枯萎、倒塌，林帶內逐漸產生各種大小的空隙。為瞭解不同空隙對微氣候之影響，本研究在台中港防風林區勘選 6 個試區，以多層風速計、微氣候及TDR (Time-Domain-Reflectometry) 土壤水分觀測儀等進行觀測分析，所得結果可提供海岸防風林營造以及林帶疏伐之參考依據。 由研究結果得知，台中港林區屬於砂土，有機質含量極低，不利於林木生長與萌芽。各空隙間之土壤總體密度與顆粒密度，分別介於 1. 44 ～ 1. 48 g/cm 3 及 2. 28 ～ 2. 46 g/cm 3 之間，差異不大。因根系作用，土壤孔隙率較高，各試區平均為 38 ％。由於木麻黃本身屬於耐鹽樹種，經電導度試驗結果顯示，各試區土壤鹽度不高，因此，對於木麻黃生長影響較小。 再者，林帶空隙愈小，其氣溫差也愈小，但相對濕度較高，平均達 78 ％以上，至於氣壓及土壤水分在不同林帶空隙間之差異極微。整體平均而言，鬱閉林帶、小空隙及中空隙之土壤水份僅高於對照點及大空隙約 0. 4 %；然而，日照時數、全天日射量、光度、蒸發量及土壤溫度皆隨林帶空隙愈大而有增加的趨勢。 由於本研究試區之木麻黃平均樹高介於 10 ～ 13 m之間，其毬果高度約在 7 ～ 9 m處，種子在氣流吹送下，多數可飄行 10. 8 ～ 17. 2 m，少部分能飄更遠，因此，建議於林帶更新時，疏伐間距可採用 30 m。摘要	I Abstract	II 目錄	IV 圖目錄	VII 表目錄	X 第一章 緒論	 1 一、前言	 1 二、研究動機	 2 三、研究目的	 4 四、研究流程	 4 第二章 前人研究	 6 一、防風林之相關研究	 6 二、飄鹽量之相關研究	 8 三、林帶空隙之相關研究	 9 四、林帶微氣候之相關研究	 11 第三章 試驗地點、材料與方法	 14 一、試區勘選	 14 二、試區概況	 17 （一）位置、地形與地質	 17 1. 位置	 17 2. 地形	 17 3. 地質	 18 (1) 現代沖積層	 19 (2) 頭嵙山層	 19 (3) 卓蘭層	 19 (4) 錦水頁岩	 19 （二）氣象資料	 21 1. 風速與風向	 24 2. 氣溫與相對溼度	 24 3. 氣壓	 24 4. 降水量與蒸發量	 24 5. 日照量與雲量	 25 （三）潮汐水位	 25 三、材料與方法	 27 （一）土壤性質試驗	 27 1. 土壤採集	 27 2. 水份係數	 28 3. 有機質含量	 28 4. 總體密度(假比重) 	 29 5. 顆粒密度(真比重) 	 29 6. 孔隙率	 29 7. 質地分析	 29 8. 電導度	 31 （二）微氣候測定	 32 （三）風速與風向測定	 34 （四）種子飄落試驗	 39 1. 木麻黃樹高測定	 39 2. 現地種子飄落試驗	 40 3. 風洞試驗	 40 第四章 結果與討論	 44 一、土壤性質分析	 44 （一）有機質含量	 44 （二）總體密度（假比重）	 44 （三）顆粒密度（真比重）	 47 （四）孔隙率	 47 （五）質地分析	 48 （六）電導度	 49 二、微氣候資料分析	 51 （一）氣溫 	 51 （二）相對溼度	 54 （三）氣壓 	 56 （四）日照時數	 59 （五）光度	 60 （六）全天日射量	 61 （七）蒸發量	 63 （八）土壤溫度	 64 （九）土壤水份	 66 三、風向與風速測定 	 69 四、種子飄落範圍分析	 72 （一）木麻黃樹高測定	 72 （二）現地種子飄落試驗	 72 （三）風洞試驗	 76 第五章 結論與建議	 80 一、結論 	 80 （一）土壤性質分析方面	 80 （二）微氣候分析方面	 80 （三）風向風速分析方面	 82 （四）種子飄落範圍分析方面	 82 二、建議 	 83 第六章 參考文獻 	 84 附錄一 	 9...|$|E

5000|$|The term {{gravitational}} shielding {{refers to}} a hypothetical process of shielding an object from {{the influence of a}} gravitational field.

30|$|This model {{extends the}} {{previously}} discussed Bocquet bipolar model [91, 92] in the “Bocquet Bipolar Model” section. In the previous model, the equations were defined keeping a cylindrical CF in mind, so the equations {{here have been}} modified {{to account for the}} change in the CF shape. The truncated cone CF is described by two different radii. CF is considered to grow from the top electrode to the bottom; the interface radius with the top electrode (TE) is rCFT which is always greater than the radius of the interface with the bottom electrode (BE) rCFB. This adheres to the structure <b>of</b> the truncated <b>cone.</b> An assumption is made here that during CF rupture, <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cone</b> is not affected; this makes the model open to fluctuations if there is any filament gap produced due to premature growth of CF. Although a forming process is considered for the device, it is not included in the model making the model not suitable for application to devices where forming is a significant factor. A possible explanation for leaving out the forming process is to avoid adding more complexity to the model because the forming parameters have {{to be included in the}} set/reset equations as well.|$|R

The modern edifice (Young Gorely) occupies the central part of caldera, represented by three fused cones, which form the ridge which stretch out in the North-West direction. The absolute <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the central <b>cone</b> is 1829 m. At the top there is a 11 craters superimposed on each other, and on the slopes there are about 40 cinder cones with lava flows of varying lengths...|$|R
5000|$|The test {{is carried}} out using a metal mould {{in the shape of}} a conical frustum known as a slump cone or Abrams cone, that is open at both ends and has {{attached}} handles. The tool typically has an internal diameter of 100 mm at the top and of 200 mm at the bottom with a <b>height</b> <b>of</b> 305 mm.The <b>cone</b> is placed on a hard non-absorbent surface. This cone is filled with fresh concrete in three stages. Each time, each layer is tamped 25 times with a 2 ft (600 mm)-long bullet-nosed metal rod measuring [...] in (16 mm) in diameter. At the end of the third stage, the concrete is struck off flush with the top of the mould. The mould is carefully lifted vertically upwards, so as not to disturb the concrete cone.|$|R

Nano and micro-satellites do not generally employ active solar arrays, opting instead for pas- sive, body mounted solar panels which perform poorly at highly oblique angles. We design a moth-eye AR surface to increase power production on nano and micro-satellites by improving transmission of light, particularly at angles of incidence at or above 50 ◦. We determine that during typical nano-satellite Earth observation missions (altitude 750 km, sun-synchronous orbit, 3 U CubeSat configuration with surface mounted solar pan- els) the cumulative effect of increased transmission of light by moth-eye AR technology is to increase power production by 10 % over each orbit. Moth-eye surface is fabricated on quartz coverglass using a combination of nano-sphere lithography, inductively coupled plasma etching and reactive ion etching techniques. The surface consists of a hexagonal array of quartz nano-cones; the spacing and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cones</b> is optimized to suppress reection of incoming light for wavelengths between 350 nm and 1800 nm. We characterize the transmission and reection of the moth-eye AR surface as well as the performance of commercially available triple junction cells using moth-eye enhanced coverglas...|$|R
50|$|The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> {{the main}} <b>cone</b> has been {{constantly}} changed by eruptions but was 1281 m in 2010. Monte Somma is 1132 m high, {{separated from the}} main cone by the valley of Atrio di Cavallo, which is 5 km long. The slopes of the volcano are scarred by lava flows, while the rest are heavily vegetated, with scrub and forests at higher altitudes and vineyards lower down. Vesuvius is still regarded as an active volcano, although its current activity produces little more than sulfur-rich steam from vents {{at the bottom and}} walls of the crater. Vesuvius is a stratovolcano at the convergent boundary where the African Plate is being subducted beneath the Eurasian Plate. Layers of lava, ash, scoria and pumice make up the volcanic peak. Their mineralogy is variable, but generally silica-undersaturated and rich in potassium, with phonolite produced in the more explosive eruptions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{slant height}} (or lateral <b>height)</b> <b>of</b> a right {{circular}} cone is {{the distance from}} any point on the circle to the apex <b>of</b> the <b>cone</b> via a straight line along the surface <b>of</b> the <b>cone.</b> It is given by , where [...] is the radius of the base the cone and h is the height. This can be proved by the Pythagorean theorem.|$|R
