This structure {{is composed of}} a one-dimensional granular crystal of hollow spherical particles in contact, containing linear resonators.

The generic dynamics of the system involves a degradation of the well-known traveling pulse of the standard Hertzian chain of elastic beads. Nevertheless, the present system is richer, in that as the primary pulse decays, secondary ones emerge and eventually interfere with it creating modulated wavetrains. Remarkably, upon suitable choices of parameters, this interference "distills" a weakly nonlocal solitary wave (a "nanopteron"). This motivates the consideration of such nonlinear structures through a separate Fourier space technique, whose results suggest the existence of such entities not only with a single-side tail, but also with periodic tails on both ends.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Hollow</b> glass <b>beads</b> (HGBs) are a {{new kind}} of filler in rubber, plastics, and coating {{industries}} for the production of light, sound, or thermal insulation products with their smooth surface and stiffness. The tensile properties and flexural strength of acrylnitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer (ABS) filled with HGBs have been measured at room temperature to identify the effects of the particle contents on these properties. The mean diameter of the beads is 70 mm. The surface of the particles are pretreated with a silane coupling agent. The results show that the Young’s modulus increases approximately linearly with the increase in volume fraction (f) of the HGB. When f is < 5 %, the tensile yield stress increases and then decreases with increasing f. When f is < 15 %, the tensile strength at break of the composites increases with the increase of f and then it remains roughly constant. Similarly, the tensile fracture strain of the composites increases when f is < 5 %, and then it decreases with increasing f. Furthermore, the flexural strength increases with an increase of f, and the relationship between them is consistent in a quadratic equation. The improvement of the tensile and flexural properties of the composite may be attributed to the smooth spherical surface and good interfacial bonding between the ABS matrix and the <b>hollow</b> <b>beads...</b>|$|R

40|$|Water {{scarcity}} {{and pollution}} are now urgent problems around the world. Thus efficient water treatment {{is an important}} research topic. Forward osmosis (FO) and solar evaporation are two most important desalination technologies that could overcome water scarcity problem since seawater is abundant. FO is an emerging desalination technology taking advantage of natural osmosis-driven movement of water, while solar evaporation pond is widely used to produce fresh water and sea salts {{at the same time}} by harnessing solar energy. And a wide range of sorbent materials have been developed for spilled oil cleanup to prevent seawater pollution. Although present materials for water treatment have been widely applied in industry, novel materials are stilled required to achieve better performance with lower energy consumption and less environmental pollution. Carbon-based composites have a bright application prospect due to the broad available precursors, relatively low cost and excellent properties of carbon materials. This thesis studies novel environmentally friendly carbon-based composite materials in the field of water treatment including FO, solar evaporation and oil sorption with high performance and relatively low cost by recycle or using free solar energy. Draw agent is a major issue required to be addressed to promote commercial implementation of FO. Incorporation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in polymer hydrogels greatly increased the softness of composite hydrogels and improved inter-particle and particle-membrane contact, leading to over double water fluxes of pure hydrogels. Furthermore, the light-absorbing property of rGO accelerated dewatering process, in which pure water from the hydrogels was harvested using heat induced from absorbed solar energy at twice the rate of the pure hydrogels. In another desalination process, solar evaporation, water evaporation enhancement by floating photothermal material which aims to increase water surface temperature was carried out. Fe 3 O 4 /C magnetic particles were synthesized by carbonization of poly(furfuryl alcohol) (PFA) incorporated with Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. The results indicated that these floating Fe 3 O 4 /C particles led to an increase as high as 230 % in water evaporation rate. In addition, Fe 3 O 4 /C particles were easily recycled using a magnet, and stable after recycled three times. To make particles more easily collected and handled, another millimetre-sized <b>hollow</b> carbon <b>beads</b> were also prepared for solar evaporation. These hydrophobic <b>hollow</b> carbon <b>beads</b> were obtained after carbonization of polymer/silica beads synthesized by phase inversion method. Monodispersed <b>hollow</b> carbon <b>beads</b> with 1. 5 mm in diameter achieved a maximum evaporation rate of 1. 28 L m- 2 h- 1, which is around 234 % of the rate attained without carbon beads, and also higher than that of Fe 3 O 4 /C particles, indicating the particle size had an impact on evaporation rate. Moreover, the good recyclability was also demonstrated. Due to the hydrophobic nature and porous structure, <b>hollow</b> carbon <b>beads</b> were also applied as sorbents in oil cleanup process.
