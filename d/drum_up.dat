5|$|Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society {{was formed}} with the {{intention}} of fulfilling a number of goals. It hoped to educate women on why they {{should have the right to}} vote and convince men of the same. It had links with Liberal MPs and intended to use these to pressure the government to allow women's suffrage. In addition, the society tried to <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> support for their cause by holding small scale events, often with speakers at the Yamen Cafe in Liverpool's Bond Street. The events would also include poetry, singing or performances of acting or ballet by the Blue Bird Theatre Company.|$|E
5|$|Motley asked Otto Graham for a {{job with}} the Washington Redskins when Graham was head coach there in the late 1960s, but he was again turned away. Motley also signed on to coach an all-girl {{professional}} football team called the Cleveland Dare Devils in 1967. By 1969, the team had only played a few exhibition games as Cleveland theatrical agent Syd Freedman struggled to <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> interest in a women's league. Later in life, Motley worked for the U.S. postal service in Cleveland, HM Miller Construction Suffield, Ohio, the Ohio Lottery and for the Ohio Department of Youth Services in Akron. He died in 1999 of prostate cancer.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{took the}} cross, or vowed {{to go on}} crusade, along with King Henry and many others in January 1188, or when he began his preaching {{campaign}} on 11 February 1188 to <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> support for the Third Crusade. In April 1188, Baldwin was in Wales on a tour attempting to secure support for the king's crusade, and was forcing his servants and followers to exercise on foot up and down hills {{in preparation for the}} journey to the Holy Land. He spent most of the year in Wales, preaching the crusade, accompanied by the chronicler Gerald of Wales. Gerald claimed about 3000 recruits for the crusade from his and Baldwin's efforts in Wales, although he also suggested that Baldwin mainly embarked on the tour to avoid his dispute with the Canterbury monks.|$|E

25|$|Early in Lomasney's career, he {{established}} the Hendricks Club {{in the heart}} of the neighborhood. The Hendricks began as a social club and gathering place, but later turned into the center of Lomasney's political machine.

25|$|The pilot {{episode was}} {{released}} in screener for test audiences {{and members of the}} entertainment industry to preview the show and <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> business. The screener was subsequently leaked on the Internet and thus has received a much wider critical review process than initially conceived. There were few differences between the unbroadcast pilot and the version that was broadcast. Ashley Scott played the role of Allison in the unbroadcast pilot, but was replaced by Andrea Anders and the character name changed to Alex.|$|E
25|$|The troupes {{orchestra}} {{would be}} made up of such instruments as the trumpet, trombone, violin, trap drum and cymbals.

25|$|Shinwell did not resume ministerial {{office when}} Labour {{returned}} {{to power in}} October 1964, but instead the new Prime Minister Harold Wilson appointed him Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, and during the 1964-6 Parliament he worked hard to <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> backbench support for the government, which had a very narrow majority. He {{was appointed to the}} Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1965 Birthday Honours. He was vehemently opposed to Wilson’s attempt to enter the EEC in 1966, and resigned as Chairman of the Labour Party in 1967.|$|E
25|$|The {{confusion}} over {{the origins of}} the name led over the years to variant spellings such as Kaatskill and Kaaterskill, both of which are also still used: the former in the regional magazine Kaatskill Life, the latter as the name of a mountain peak and a waterfall. The supposed Indian name for the range, Onteora ("land in the sky"), was actually created by a white man in the mid-19th century to <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> business for a resort. It, too, persists today as the name of a school district and as the name of a Boy Scout summer camp (Onteora Scout Reservation).|$|E
25|$|The Yak-16-II {{passed its}} manufacturer's trials in April 1948 and was {{submitted}} for the State acceptance trials shortly afterwards. These revealed several deficiencies {{that caused the}} horizontal tail area to be increased and deicing equipment to be fitted on the leading edges of the wings and tail. It was resubmitted for another round of State acceptance trials which approved it for production. However, it was not selected for production as the Antonov An-2 {{was thought to be}} more versatile in both roles. Some effort was made to <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> export sales in Eastern Europe, but no interest was shown because it was not in service with Aeroflot. The prototypes were used for a time by the Yakovlev OKB and Factory No. 464 which had built them.|$|E

25|$|UMWA {{support for}} the strike, however, {{was not nearly as}} strong. International union {{president}} Thomas Lewis had not condoned the strike, and criticized efforts by leaders in surrounding UMWA Districts to <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> increased {{support for the}} strikers. But in March 1910, a special meeting of the UMWA international executive board voted to support the strike, forcing Lewis to grudgingly offer the union's resources. Eventually, the union gave more than $1 million in relief payments to the strikers. Lewis, however, continued to work to undermine the union's support for the strike. He backed an insurgent faction in District 6 to unseat leaders who supported the strike. The act led to internecine warfare in the union and charges that Lewis and his candidates were in league with mine owners.|$|E

In 1837, while raiding the Kiowa horse herds along the North Fork of the Red River, a party of 48 Cheyenne Bowstring Men were discovered and killed by Kiowa and Comanche warriors. Porcupine Bear, chief of the Dog Soldiers, took up the war pipe of the Cheyenne. He carried it to the various Cheyenne and Arapaho camps to <b>drum</b> <b>up</b> support for revenge against the Kiowa. He reached a Northern Cheyenne camp along the South Platte River just after it had traded for liquor from American Fur Company men at Fort Laramie.|$|E
