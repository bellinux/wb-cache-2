5|$|Gromyko and Harriman debated how states {{not universally}} {{recognized}} (e.g., East Germany and China) could join the agreement. The US proposed asserting that accession {{to the treaty}} would not indicate international recognition. This {{was rejected by the}} Soviet Union. Eventually, with Kennedy's approval, US envoys Fisher and McNaughton devised a system whereby multiple government would serve as <b>depositaries</b> for the treaty, allowing individual states to sign only the agreement held by the government of their choice in association with other like-minded states. This solution, which overcame one of the more challenging roadblocks in the negotiations, also served to allay mounting concerns from Macmillan, which were relayed to Washington, that an agreement would once again be derailed. Finally, in an original Soviet draft, the signature of France would have been required for the treaty to come into effect. At Harriman's insistence, this requirement was removed.|$|E

Their main function was that of being a court of justice of second instance —court of appeal— in penal and civil matters, but also the Audiencias were courts the first instance in the city where it had its headquarters, and also in the cases involving the Royal Treasury. Besides court of justice, the Audiencias had functions of government as counterweight the authority of the viceroys, since they could communicate with both the Council of the Indies and the king without the requirement of requesting authorization from the viceroy. This direct correspondence of the Audiencia with the Council of The Indies made possible that the Council gave to the Audiencia all kinds of orientations about general aspects of government.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} <b>depositary</b> receipt prices in {{regulated}} markets and free-entry markets. Because of their unique environments, the Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets provide interesting settings {{that have not}} yet been explored in the literature. In particular, we focus on the following: (1) the difference in the long-term price relationships between <b>depositary</b> receipts and underlying securities in free-entry and regulated areas, (2) the price dynamics of the <b>depositary</b> receipts for firms with and without the long-term equilibrium relationships between <b>depositary</b> receipts and underlying securities, and (3) the incremental information content of the qualifed foreign institutional investor (QFII) ownership ratio for the <b>depositary</b> receipts issued by Taiwanese firms. The empirical results reveal that long-term equilibrium relationships between <b>depositary</b> receipts and underlying security prices exist for firms listed in Hong Kong, a free-entry market, but do not necessarily exist for firms listed in Taiwan with foreign ownership restrictions. The long-term equilibrium relationships between <b>depositary</b> receipts and underlying se-curities and the local market conditions are the most important factors in explaining the <b>depositary</b> receipt returns when the equilibrium exists. In the absence of equilibrium, the lagged returns of <b>depositary</b> receipts or underlying securities and the local market conditions become important. In addition, QFII ownership ratios significantly explain the <b>depositary</b> receipt price variations in a regulated market, which implies the restric-tion effect on the price dynamics of the <b>depositary</b> receipts. 1...|$|R

It was a necessity for him to live, and that plan of his for avoiding the world did not answer. He, however, and others around him who still maintained the same staunch principles of protection--men like himself who were too true to flinch at the cry of a mob--had their own way of consoling themselves. They were, and felt themselves to be, the only true <b>depositaries</b> left of certain Eleusinian mysteries, of certain deep and wondrous services of worship by which alone the gods could be rightly approached.

6000|$|However, all the {{mutations}} so increasingly discernible in village life did not originate {{entirely in the}} agricultural unrest. A depopulation was also going on. The village had formerly contained, {{side by side with}} the argicultural labourers, an interesting and better-informed class, ranking distinctly above the former--the class to which Tess's father and mother had belonged--and including the carpenter, the smith, the shoemaker, the huckster, together with nondescript workers other than farm-labourers; a set of people who owed a certain stability of aim and conduct to the fact of their being lifeholders like Tess's father, or copyholders, or occasionally, small freeholders. But as the long holdings fell in, they were seldom again let to similar tenants, and were mostly pulled down, if not absolutely required by the farmer for his hands. Cottagers who were not directly employed on the land were looked upon with disfavour, and the banishment of some starved the trade of others, who were thus obliged to follow. These families, who had formed the backbone of the village life in the past, who were the <b>depositaries</b> of the village traditions, had to seek refuge in the large centres; the process, humorously designated by statisticians as [...] "the tendency of the rural population towards the large towns", being really the tendency of water to flow uphill when forced by machinery.|$|E

Two or three very plain and practical plannings of desirable procedures in reference to some possible homely explication of all this nonsense--so he would momentarily denominate it--now and then flittingly intermitted his pervading mood of semi-madness.

That will never do. You remember, do you not, often seeing the Miss Pennies, hatless and without a shawl, hurrying through the village, like two postmen intent on dropping some tit-bit of precious gossip? What a morsel for them, Pierre, have you, if you now call upon them. Verily, their trumpets are both for use and for significance. Though very deaf, the Miss Pennies are by no means dumb.

6000|$|Of this immense {{conflict}} Mr. Gladstone, {{like most}} of the leading statesmen of the time, and like the majority of his countrymen, failed to take the true measure. The error that lay at the root of our English misconception of the American struggle is now clear. We applied ordinary political maxims to what was not merely a political contest, but a social revolution. Without scrutiny of the cardinal realities beneath, we discussed it like some superficial conflict in our old world about boundaries, successions, territorial partitions, dynastic preponderance. The significance of the American war was its relation to slavery. That war arose from the economic, social, and political consequences that flowed from slavery—its wasteful cultivation, the consequent need for extension of slave territory, the probable revival of the accursed African trade, the constitution of slave-holders as the sole <b>depositaries</b> of social prestige and political power. Secession was undertaken for the purpose of erecting into an independent state a community whose whole structure was moulded on a system that held labour in contempt, that kept the labourer in ignorance and cruel bondage, that demanded a vigilant censorship of the press and an army of watchmen and spies. And this barbaric state was to set itself up on the border of a great nation, founded on free industry, political equality, diffused knowledge, energetic progress. Such was the meaning of secession. “The rebellion,” as Charles Sumner well said to Mr. Gladstone in 1864, “is slavery in arms, revolting, indecent, imperious.” Therefore those who fought against secession fought against slavery and all that was involved in that dark burden, and whatever their motives may at different times have been, they rendered an immortal service to humanity.(49) ...|$|E
6000|$|During {{this period}} of heroism it had been {{necessary}} to Houston to have some confidential friend to whom {{from time to time}} he could speak of his purpose. He could not go on eating slices of boiled mutton at eating-houses, and drinking dribblets of bad wine out of little decanters no bigger than the bottles in a cruet stand, without having some one to encourage him in his efforts. It was a hard apprenticeship, and, coming as it did rather late in life for such a beginning, and after much luxurious indulgence, required some sympathy and consolation. There were Tom Shuttlecock and Lord John Battledore at the club. Lord John was the man as to whose expulsion because of his contumacious language so much had been said, but who lived through that and various other dangers. These had been his special friends, and to them he had confided everything in regard to the Tringle marriage. Shuttlecock had ridiculed the very idea of love, and had told him that everything else was to be thrown to the dogs in pursuit of a good income. Battledore had reminded him that there was [...] "a deuced deal of cut-and-come-again in a hundred and twenty thousand pounds." [...] They had been friends, not always altogether after his own heart, but friends who had served his purpose when he was making his raid upon Lombard Street. But they were not men to whom he could descant on the wholesomeness of cabbages as an article of daily food, or who would sympathise with the struggling joys of an embryo father.
