5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E
5|$|If non-surgical {{measures}} are unsuccessful, drilling {{may be considered}} to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. Arthroscopic drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (<b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the rate <b>of</b> routine <b>follow-ups</b> <b>of</b> children attending our Healthy Child Clinic and the factors that can inşuence the follow-ups. Material and Methods: The files of 540 babies registered in our Healthy Child Clinic between January 2003 and May 2005 have been investigated retrospectively. Results: 46 % of children were regularly brought to <b>follow-up.</b> The rate <b>of</b> regular <b>follow-ups</b> <b>of</b> children who were born with caesarean section and who had a history of preterm birth were significantly higher. There were no significant relationships between regular follow-up and parent’s education levels, mother’s work status, presence of social security, neighborhood, birth weight, gender, number of siblings, parent’s age. Conclusion: It has been determined that the rate <b>of</b> regular <b>follow-ups</b> <b>of</b> children born with caesarean section or prematurity is significantly higher. We believe that with an effective communication between doctor and the family, and explanation of the importance of routine examinations of healthy children to all parents, the <b>follow-ups</b> <b>of</b> healthy children can be carried on more successfully...|$|R
