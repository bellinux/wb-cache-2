40|$|HVDC grids {{have been}} made {{practical}} {{with the introduction of}} the voltage source converter (VSC). The development of VSC technology has been, and continues to be rapid, with new converter topologies and new manufacturers entering the market. For the power transmission industry to fully exploit the benefits a ‘multi-vendor’ supply chain is considered essential. However, unlike AC grids, there is at present no standardised grid code for HVDC grids and <b>interoperability</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> and systems, purchased from many different and competing suppliers, is a major concern. Compatibility of control between converters supplied by different manufacturers has been considered by several groups such as CENELEC TC 8 X – WG 6. The initial findings were that there was little reason to suggest that restrictions should be placed on which control strategy should be employed. However recent work uncovered an adverse interaction between converters with differing operating modes. This study illustrates how multiple operating points in the control characteristics could occur and show why such operation is undesirable and how it can be avoided by careful scheme design...|$|E
40|$|Currently, fire {{department}} notification {{of a building}} fire comes from either a building fire alarm system monitoring service or a 911 call. The emergency responders {{know very little about}} the situation until they arrive on the scene. Information for their initial response begins with the pre-emergency building survey, if available, and is supplemented upon arrival by the visual “size up ” of the situation. Many {{fire department}}s are replacing paper pre-emergency building surveys with electronic information that can be accessed from mobile computing equipment in the apparatus. Unfortunately, there are currently no standards for the content of building emergency information or its display format. Without these standards, <b>interoperability</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> to share electronic information between all first responders to large-scale emergencies will be a problem. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop standards for building emergency information to improve situational awareness. Practical methods to supply and use the information are also investigated. The standards effort will cover six areas: information content, representation, storage, access, transport, and presentation. This effort enables improvement in the safety and efficiency of emergency responders. It provides the foundation for a future emergency decision support system that takes advantage of modern developments in building fire and other hazard predictions...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} introduced communications standard IEC 61850 {{is having a}} major impact on the structure of new protection systems and schemes. In itself it describes the concepts for sub-station communications covering protection, control and metering functions. However, although it is going to have {{a major impact on}} the power systems communications, it will also influence the design of future protection systems. How are protection systems going to develop in light of IEC 61850 ? Will these be protection computers or protection relays? The aim of IEC 61850 is to reduce costs, respond to the increasing demands for communications and to provide for standard protocols available from different manufacturers. It aims to provide for future-proofed equipment, <b>interoperability</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> from different manufacturers and easing the management of future power system sub-station equipment. There will also be a host of other opportunities and advantages that can be realised. These include easier repair, refurbishment and replacement of protection. They also provide for greater use of general purpose IEDs, self healing systems, and plug and play type facilities. The paper examines how future generations of protection systems will develop in order to meet these objectives. It takes a close look at the development of distributed computer systems and draws several parallels from this pointing to the possible future computerised protection. The future for protection systems is full of change, challenge and promise. The rate of change will be governed by the acceptance of the new concepts by the industry. Change is inevitable and the driving forces are well established...|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} {{computers}} installed in urban and transport networks has grown tremendously in recent years, also the local processing capabilities and digital networking currently available. However, the heterogeneity <b>of</b> existing <b>equipment</b> {{in the field}} of ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) and the large volume of information they handle, greatly hinder the <b>interoperability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equipment</b> and the design of cooperative applications between devices currently installed in urban networks. While the dynamic discovery of information, composition and invocation of services through intelligent agents are a potential solution to these problems, all these technologies require intelligent management of information flows. In particular, it is necessary to wean these information flows of the technologies used, enabling universal interoperability between computers, regardless of the context in which they are located. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a systematic methodology to create ontologies, using methods such as a semantic clustering algorithms for retrieval and representation of information. Using the proposed methodology, an ontology will be developed in the ITS domain.

50|$|Some countries, {{including}} the United States, have allocated spectrum {{differently from the}} ITU recommendations, so that the standard bands most commonly used for UMTS (UMTS-2100) have not been available.

40|$|Project (M. B. A., Business Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. The Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS) {{industry}} is a unique niche industry that facilitates telephone calls for primarily for deaf and hard of hearing individuals. Regulation {{plays a key role}} in this industry, and as such traditional market dynamics do not always apply. Governmental rulemakings have significant impacts on the way TRS companies create and execute strategy. This paper examines this unique industry, paying particular attention to the impacts of recent Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rulemakings. There are two specific questions addressed in this paper. First, how has the FCC???s 2006 ruling on the <b>interoperability</b> <b>of</b> TRS <b>equipment</b> impacted the industry? Second, what are the potential implications of the FCC???s 2008 TRS ten-digit numbering order? Overall this paper seeks to understand how these industry shocks impact consumers, regulators, and TRS providers. Data for this paper comes from publicly available materials, including FCC filings, consumer advisories, and fact sheets. Significant data was also obtained from the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA). In conclusion this paper finds the need for additional education of TRS consumers, and calls on consumer groups and FCC regulators to help ensure that TRS consumers understand their rights and responsibilities. Furthermore, this paper suggests strategies for TRS companies to peruse in response to the FCC???s recent TRS rulemakings. These strategies vary based on each company???s relative market share as well as the degree to which they specialize in providing TRS. Additional implications for regulators are also discussed.

The building is the site of a major demonstration of the BACnet communication protocol. The energy management and control systems (EMCS) in the building were retrofitted with BACnet compatible controllers in order to integrate certain existing systems on one common network. In this respect, the project has been a success. <b>Interoperability</b> <b>of</b> control <b>equipment</b> from different manufacturers has been demonstrated in a real world environment. Besides demonstrating interoperability, the retrofits carried out in the building were also intended to enhance control strategies and capabilities, and to produce energy savings. This report presents analyses of the energy usage of HVAC systems in the building, control performance, and the reaction of the building operators. The report does not present an evaluation of the performance capabilities of the BACnet protocol. A monitoring system was installed in the building that parallels many of the EMCS sensors and data were archived over a three-year period. The authors defined pre-retrofit and post-retrofit periods and analyzed the corresponding data to establish the changes in building performance resulting from the retrofit activities. The authors also used whole-building energy simulation (DOE- 2) as a tool for evaluating the effect of the retrofit changes. The results of the simulation were compared with the monitored data. Changes in operator behavior were assessed qualitatively with questionnaires. The report summarizes the findings of the analyses and makes several recommendations as to how to achieve better performance. They maintain that the full potential of the EMCS and associated systems is not being realized. The reasons for this are discussed along with possible ways of addressing this problem.
