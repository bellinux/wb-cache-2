5|$|In 1962, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} at Bell Laboratories discovered laser action in xenon, and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium. The first <b>excimer</b> <b>laser</b> used a xenon dimer (Xe2) energized by a beam of electrons to produce stimulated emission at an ultraviolet wavelength of 176 nm.|$|E
25|$|The LASIK {{technique}} was {{implemented in the}} U.S. after its successful application elsewhere. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commenced a trial of the <b>excimer</b> <b>laser</b> in 1989. The first enterprise to receive FDA approval to use an <b>excimer</b> <b>laser</b> for photo-refractive keratectomy was Summit Technology (founder and CEO, Dr. David Muller).|$|E

25|$|The {{invention}} of deep UV <b>excimer</b> <b>laser</b> photolithography by Kanti Jain at IBM c.1980 has enabled the smallest features in ICs to shrink from 800 nanometers in 1990 to {{as low as}} 10 nanometers in 2016. Prior to this, excimer lasers had been mainly used as research devices since their development in the 1970s. From a broader scientific perspective, the {{invention of}} <b>excimer</b> <b>laser</b> lithography has been highlighted {{as one of the}} major milestones in the 50-year history of the laser.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the size}} {{limitation}} of the <b>excimer</b> <b>laser</b> used for LTPS, the AMOLED size was limited. To cope with the hurdle related to the panel size, amorphous-silicon/microcrystalline-silicon backplanes have been reported with large display prototype demonstrations.|$|E
40|$|<b>Excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> are pulsed gas lasers. Depending on the {{gas mixture}} laser {{emission}} is generated on single lines in the UV and VUV portion of the electromagnetic spectra. These emission lines are at wavelengths between 355 nm and 157 nm. The pulse length is normally 5 - 20 ns. Compact <b>Excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> typically have single pulse energy of 10 mJ. The maximum repetition rate is 1 kHz in the compact class. Large <b>Excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> can operate with repetition rates less than 300 Hz, but with single pulse energies up to 1 J. The laser emission is initiated by a pulsed electrical discharge in high pressure gas, having a mixture of rare gases and a halogen. The materials of the laser vessel must be resistant against the Fluorine, or Chlorine. Contaminations must be avoided during assembly and operation of the laser system. Therefore, the newest generation of <b>Excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> is completely metal sealed. All surfaces of the laser vessel - which {{are exposed to the}} corrosive laser gas-are s pecially cleaned and partly coated. By introducing this new technique in the past decade, the lifetime of the laser chamber rose from approximately hundred million pulses up to 10 billion and more. Main applications of compact <b>Excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> are the ophthalmology, the vision correction (LASIK), and metrology for semiconductor manufacturing. Large <b>Excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> are used in industrial applications like surface treatment and as light source in wafer steppers producing highly integrated processors and memory chips...|$|R

25|$|Gas lasers, {{laser diodes}} and {{solid-state}} lasers can be manufactured to emit ultraviolet rays, and lasers are available which {{cover the entire}} UV range. The nitrogen gas laser uses electronic excitation of nitrogen molecules to emit a beam that is mostly UV. The strongest ultraviolet lines are at 337.1nm and 357.6.6nm, wavelength. Another type of high power gas laser is the <b>excimer</b> <b>laser.</b> They are widely used lasers emitting in ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet wavelength ranges. Presently, UV argon-fluoride (ArF) excimer lasers operating at 193nm are routinely used in integrated circuit production by photolithography. The current wavelength limit of production of coherent UV is about 126nm, characteristic of the Ar2* <b>excimer</b> <b>laser.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>excimer</b> <b>laser</b> uses an eye {{tracking}} system {{that follows the}} patient's eye position up to 4,000 times per second, redirecting laser pulses for precise placement within the treatment zone. Typical pulses are around 1 millijoule (mJ) of pulse energy in 10 to 20 nanoseconds.|$|E
25|$|Various {{refractive}} eye surgery techniques {{change the}} shape of the cornea {{in order to reduce the}} need for corrective lenses or otherwise improve the refractive state of the eye. In many of the techniques used today, reshaping of the cornea is performed by photoablation using the <b>excimer</b> <b>laser.</b>|$|E
5000|$|UV <b>excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to about 126 nm (for Ar2*). Mercury arc lamps are designed to maintain a steady DC current of 50 to 150 Volts, however <b>excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> have a higher resolution. <b>Excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> are gas-based light systems that are usually filled with inert and halide gases (Kr, Ar, Xe, F and Cl) that are charged by an electric field. The higher the frequency, the greater {{the resolution of the}} image. KrF lasers are able to function at a frequency of 4 kHz [...] In addition to running at a higher frequency, <b>excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> are compatible with more advanced machines than mercury arc lamps are. They are also able to operate from greater distances (up to 25 meters) and are able to maintain their accuracy with a series of mirrors and antireflective-coated lenses. By setting up multiple lasers and mirrors, the amount of energy loss is minimized, also since the lenses are coated with antireflective material, the light intensity remains relatively the same from when it left the laser to when it hits the wafer.|$|R
50|$|In ophthalmology, <b>excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> {{are used}} for {{changing}} {{the shape of the}} cornea, procedures known as LASIK and LASEK.|$|R
50|$|<b>Excimer</b> <b>lasers,</b> such as XeF and KrF, {{can also}} be made {{slightly}} tunable {{using a variety of}} prism and grating intracavity arrangements.|$|R
25|$|The university's {{extensive}} list {{of research}} facilities includes the James R. Macdonald Laboratory {{for research in}} atomic, molecular and optical physics and the NASA Center for Gravitational Studies in Cellular and Developmental Biology. The <b>excimer</b> <b>laser,</b> which made LASIK eye surgery possible, is a technology developed by Kansas State researchers.|$|E
25|$|The {{second step}} of the {{procedure}} uses an <b>excimer</b> <b>laser</b> (193nm) to remodel the corneal stroma. The laser vaporizes the tissue in a finely controlled manner without damaging the adjacent stroma. No burning with heat or actual cutting is required to ablate the tissue. The layers of tissue removed are tens of micrometres thick.|$|E
25|$|Lasers {{have been}} used to {{indirectly}} generate non-coherent extreme UV (EUV) radiation at 13.5nm for extreme ultraviolet lithography. The EUV is not emitted by the laser, but rather by electron transitions in an extremely hot tin or xenon plasma, which is excited by an <b>excimer</b> <b>laser.</b> This technique does not require a synchrotron, yet can produce UV {{at the edge of the}} X-ray spectrum. Synchrotron light sources can also produce all wavelengths of UV, including those at the boundary of the UV and X-ray spectra at 10nm.|$|E
50|$|The double-discharge method {{required}} to initiate stable high-pressure gas discharges {{can be used}} both below and above atmospheric pressure, and these devices too {{can be referred to}} as TEA <b>lasers.</b> Commercial <b>excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> operating in the ultraviolet use a double-discharge regime very similar to the CO2 TEA laser. Using krypton, argon or xenon chloride or fluoride gas buffered with helium to 2 - 3 atmospheres of pressure, <b>Excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> can produce megawatt pulses of ultraviolet laser light.|$|R
40|$|The further {{development}} of discharge <b>excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> depends upon a better degree {{of control over the}} discharge stability. A problem is the large difference between the breakdown and steady-state voltage which requires a time dependent impedance of the power circuit. Further the large attachment rates of halogens like HCl, causing electric field disturbances require a short rise time of the applied current pulse. A large effort has been expended towards this goal by researchers since the early development of discharge <b>excimer</b> <b>lasers...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{major focus}} of work done at Air Products and Chemicals' Laser Application Laboratory is on use of {{ultraviolet}} radiation using high energy <b>excimer</b> <b>lasers.</b> Because light within the wavelength of <b>excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> is invisible, it can cause serious damage to eyes and tissue. To contain the laser beam, Air Products Incorporated a Jet Propulsion Laboratory invention described in a technical support package into its beam stops. The technology interrupts the laser pathway and allows workers {{to remain in the}} target area without shutting off the laser...|$|R
25|$|The vacuum {{ultraviolet}} (VUV) band (100–200nm) can {{be generated}} by non-linear 4 wave mixing in gases by sum or difference frequency mixing of 2 or more longer wavelength lasers. The generation is generally done in gasses (e.g. krypton, hydrogen which are two-photon resonant near 193nm) or metal vapors (e.g. magnesium). By making one of the lasers tunable, the VUV can be tuned. If one of the lasers is resonant with a transition in the gas or vapor then the VUV production is intensified. However, resonances also generate wavelength dispersion, and thus the phase matching can limit the tunable range of the 4 wave mixing. Difference frequency mixing (lambda1 + lambda2 − lambda3) has an advantage over sum frequency mixing because the phase matching can provide greater tuning. In particular, difference frequency mixing two photons of an ArF (193nm) <b>excimer</b> <b>laser</b> with a tunable visible or near IR laser in hydrogen or krypton provides resonantly enhanced tunable VUV covering from 100nm to 200nm. Practically, the lack of suitable gas/vapor cell window materials above the lithium fluoride cut-off wavelength limit the tuning range to longer than about 110nm. Tunable VUV wavelengths down to 75 nm was achieved using window-free configurations.|$|E

40|$|Precise {{ablation}} of polymers is {{a challenging}} task for <b>excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> emitting in the ultraviolet.

High power, defocused <b>excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> may be used in conjunction with masks as an alternative to direct laser writing to provide higher throughput. Repeated pulsing with <b>excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> may eliminate the need for secondary plating techniques for metal film buildup. A comparison between the thermal and photochemical deposition processes is made...|$|R
5|$|The {{noble gases}} {{are used in}} <b>excimer</b> <b>lasers,</b> {{which are based on}} {{short-lived}} electronically excited molecules known as excimers. The <b>excimers</b> used for <b>lasers</b> may be noble gas dimers such as Ar2, Kr2 or Xe2, or more commonly, the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF, KrF, XeF, or XeCl. These lasers produce ultraviolet light which, due to its short wavelength (193 nm for ArF and 248nm for KrF), allows for high-precision imaging. <b>Excimer</b> <b>lasers</b> have many industrial, medical, and scientific applications. They are used for microlithography and microfabrication, which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture, and for laser surgery, including laser angioplasty and eye surgery.|$|R
2500|$|Five years later, in 1985, Steven Trokel at the Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University in New York City, {{published}} his work using the <b>excimer</b> <b>laser</b> in radial keratotomy. [...] He wrote, ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Rangaswamy Srinivasan, at the IBM Research laboratory, {{discovered}} that an ultraviolet <b>excimer</b> <b>laser</b> could etch living tissue, with precision {{and with no}} thermal damage to the surrounding area.

2500|$|Wavefront-guided LASIK is a {{variation}} of LASIK surgery in which, rather than applying a simple correction of only long/short-sightedness and astigmatism (only lower order aberrations as in traditional LASIK), an ophthalmologist applies a spatially varying correction, guiding the computer-controlled <b>excimer</b> <b>laser</b> with measurements from a wavefront sensor. The goal is to achieve a more optically perfect eye, though the final result still depends on the physician's success at predicting changes that occur during healing and other factors that {{may have to do}} with the regularity/irregularity of the cornea and the axis of any residual astigmatism. Another important factor is whether the <b>excimer</b> <b>laser</b> can correctly register eye position in 3 dimensions, and to track the eye in all the possible directions of eye movement. If a wavefront guided treatment is performed with less than perfect registration and tracking, pre-existing aberrations can be worsened. In older patients, scattering from microscopic particles (cataract or incipient cataract) may play a role that outweighs any benefit from wavefront correction. Therefore, patients expecting so-called [...] "super vision" [...] from such procedures may be disappointed.|$|E
