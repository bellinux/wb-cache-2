The design and execution of the revised design of new junction is greatly derided, mostly because of the three roundabouts giving no priority to the main flow of traffic, (A43-M40 London), and the slip roads off and onto the motorway (except the one accessed via the services) have sharp turns and adverse cambers, which results lorries frequently tipping over and spilling their loads especially on the roundabout {{at the end of the}} northern carriageway. The junction fails to perform its function as an <b>effective</b> <b>traffic</b> junction.

30|$|The GPCR {{structures}} {{that have been}} solved with fusion partners did not share the same precise placement location for their fusion partner, as in they did in this study, therefore, a lack of positional optimization can be expected when reviewing these results.

Overall, the expression levels of the 826 Nt_BRIL GPCR constructs was higher than at the ICL 3 _BRIL constructs, it can be concluded that a well-organized N-terminus is helpful for <b>effective</b> <b>trafficking</b> of the post-translational receptor to cell membrane. Another possible conclusion is that the N-terminal fusion partner may make the tertiary structure more stable and less toxic to the cell as a result.|$|R

40|$|Effective immune {{responses}} {{require the}} directed migration of leukocytes from the vasculature {{to the site}} of injury or infection. How immune cells "find" their site of extravasation remains largely obscure. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized role of platelets as pathfinders guiding leukocytes to their exit points in the microvasculature: upon onset of inflammation, circulating platelets were found to immediately adhere at distinct sites in venular microvessels enabling these cellular blood components to capture neutrophils and, in turn, inflammatory monocytes via CD 40 -CD 40 L-dependent interactions. In this cellular crosstalk, ligation of PSGL- 1 by P-selectin leads to ERK 1 / 2 MAPK-dependent conformational changes of leukocyte integrins, which promote the successive extravasation of neutrophils and monocytes to the perivascular tissue. Conversely, blockade of this cellular partnership resulted in misguided, inefficient leukocyte responses. Our experimental data uncover a platelet-directed, spatiotemporally organized, multicellular crosstalk that is essential for <b>effective</b> <b>trafficking</b> of leukocytes {{to the site of}} inflammation...|$|R

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, {{it had become}} {{apparent}} that road builders could not count on further road construction alone to control congestion. As one traffic engineer remarked, the demand for freeways grew so substantially that some roadways were [...] "becoming obsolete the minute that they opened." [...] Having pioneered the use of video surveillance and television monitors in Houston and Dallas, TTI researchers continued advancing freeway and traffic operations technologies and techniques. TTI researchers began studying the integration of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes on Texas freeways, with more emphasis given to research into expanding transit services in urban and rural areas.

50|$|Podgorica's {{location}} in central Montenegro {{makes it a}} natural hub for rail and road transport. Roads in Montenegro (especially those connecting Podgorica to northern Montenegro and Serbia) are usually inferior to modern European roads. Both major Montenegrin motorway projects, Belgrade-Bar motorway and Adriatic Ionian motorway, will pass near Podgorica. The newly built Sozina tunnel (4.2 km) shortened the journey from Podgorica to Bar (Montenegro's main seaport) to under 30 minutes. Also a new road bypass has been constructed in 2011, to remove transport routes {{from north to south}} of the country, out of the city centre. A south-western bypass has also been planned , with same goal of moving heavy transport out of the city core. Podgorica is also characteristic for its extensive network of multi-lane boulevards which make inner city transport quick and <b>effective.</b> <b>Traffic</b> over the Morača River also goes fluently since river banks are very well connected with 6 vehicular and 3 pedestrian bridges.|$|E

Construction began in 1957, from a first core of the district named [...] "Gallaratese G.1". The original plan by Bottoni was then refined and developed by over 60 architects, led by Gianluigi Reggio. [...] A second and third part of the district, named [...] "Gallaratese G.2" [...] and [...] "San Leonardo" [...] respectively, were developed between 1964 and 1974. In those years, the [...] "tower houses" [...] that now characterize the Gallaratese' sklyine were built. The final outcome was quite different from the original plans; the district was in fact developed with less green areas and less services than it had been planned, resulting in a definitely [...] "satellite" [...] district.|$|E

Traffic accidentally collided with [...] on 5 June 1929, and sustained some damage to the starboard side of the hull. After enquiries revealed that Traffic was notoriously difficult to handle, new propellers were produced by Harland and Wolff and fitted in October 1929.

Nomadic and Traffics owners became Société Cherbourgeoise de Remorquage et de Sauvetage in 1934, and both ships were repainted in the new livery and renamed, Traffic becoming Ingénieur Riebell and Nomadic Ingénieur Minard.|$|E
