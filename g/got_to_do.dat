5|$|With Misery we had {{the luxury}} of doing a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious these days. And we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. We were there for two days and it was like an art project.|$|E

25|$|Tina's {{accounts}} on {{her life}} with Ike Turner were later documented in the autobiography, I, Tina, released in 1986. In 1988, both Tina and Ike signed away their rights to have their lives dramatized in a biopic based off Tina's book. Ike Turner would later claim that he signed against his will since he was heavily addicted to crack {{at the time and}} accepted a $50,000 payment, waiving the right to sue the film company for their portrayal of him in the film. The film What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It helped to damage Ike's career in the 1990s. Due to the film and the book, Ike's name became synonymous with domestic violence, overshadowing his contributions to music.|$|E
25|$|Roast Beef's {{birthday}} is April 22. Some of his accomplishments include {{a program that}} determines how many eggs and how much milk you need to buy in a given week, and another that determines the amount of loose change lying around your house and makes a reservation at a restaurant accordingly. Roast Beef is partial to UNIX and his preferred programming language is Java. He likes Stella Artois beer and Guinness. He is perhaps the world's greatest historian of the Great Outdoor Fight, and drove Ray to compete (and win) in the 2006 Fight. He also managed {{to get into the}} Fight himself by hacking the Fight's database. He fully accepted the fact that Ray would have to beat him senseless in order to win, and was shocked beyond belief when Ray destroyed the Fight rather than fight him. He drives a 1965 Ford Galaxie (powered by Ford's rare 427 SOHC V8 engine) that was a gift from Ray. He has also gone to the moon, by stealing Pat's home-made rocket, and to the afterlife (both heaven and hell), via various methods including some of the aforementioned shooting incidents and vomiting into an electrical outlet. He has also produced his very own zine, titled Man Why You Even <b>Got</b> <b>To</b> <b>Do</b> A Thing.|$|E

500|$|After {{her divorce}} from Ike Turner, she rebuilt her career through live performances. In the 1980s, Turner {{launched}} a major comeback with another string of hits, starting in late 1983 {{with the single}} [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] followed by the 1984 release of her fifth solo album Private Dancer which became a worldwide success. The album contained the song [...] "What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It", which became Turner's biggest hit and won four Grammy Awards including Record of the Year.

In 1993, [...] "What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It" [...] {{was used as the}} title of a biographical film adapted from her autobiography, along with the film's accompanying soundtrack album. In addition to her musical career, Turner has also garnered success acting in films, including the role of the Acid Queen in the 1975 rock musical Tommy, a starring role alongside Mel Gibson in the 1985 action film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and a cameo role in the 1993 film Last Action Hero.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Ike & Tina Turner were {{inducted}} to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Phil Spector later accepted {{on their}} behalf. That same year, the ex-couple signed away {{their rights to}} have their lives dramatized in the semi-autobiographical film What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It, later released in 1993 and starring Angela Bassett as Tina and Laurence Fishburne as Ike, with the actors receiving Best Actress and Best Actor Academy Award nominations for their portrayals of the former husband-and-wife team. Turner contributed to the soundtrack for What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It, re-recording songs from her Revue days and recording several newer songs, including {{what turned out to}} be her last Top 10 U.S. hit, [...] "I Don't Wanna Fight." [...] Other than helping Bassett with her wardrobe and teaching her dance steps as well as providing songs for the soundtrack, and appearing as herself at the end of the film, she refused to be involved fully in the film, telling an interviewer, [...] "Why would I want to see Ike Turner beat me up again? I haven't dwelled on it; it's all in the past where it belongs." [...] Following the film's and soundtrack's release, Turner embarked on her first US tour in seven years. Following the tour's end, Turner moved to Switzerland and took a year off from the road at the end of the tour.|$|E
500|$|... "Honestly {{the song}} was created for the gay community. I kept {{stressing}} to Jermaine , ‘I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something for the kids.’ I had talked {{about it on the}} last album – and there was a song that I had, and it wasn’t quite completed. And I talked about it to the papers, gay magazines, and it didn't wind up on the album with the cut-off date. I felt really badly about that. So he just handed me a CD and said, ‘Here are 10 tracks for the kids; tell me which one you like the best.’ I fell in love with 'Rock With U'." ...|$|E

Hetrick underwent ten hours of make-up for the sequence where Q shows Vash what could have happened if he did not save her life following an insect bite in the Gamma Quadrant. [...] The experience left her with a newfound appreciation for not having to wear prosthetics like other members of the cast.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the crisis, Kerr did {{not tell}} Whitlam of his {{increasing}} concerns, nor did he suggest that he might dismiss Whitlam. He believed nothing he said would influence Whitlam, and feared that, if Whitlam perceived him as a possible opponent, the Prime Minister would procure his dismissal from the Queen. Accordingly, though Kerr dealt with Whitlam in an affable manner, he did not confide his thinking to the Prime Minister. Labor Senator Tony Mulvihill later related that [...] "Whitlam {{would come back to}} each caucus meeting and say, 'I saw His Excellency... No worry. He's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it his way.'... at no time did he hint that the Governor-General was frowning." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Todd Rundgren {{found the}} album hilarious, {{thinking}} {{that it was a}} parody of Springsteen. The singer quotes him as saying: [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this album. It's just so out there." [...] They told the producer that they had previously been signed to RCA. In one 1989 interview with Classic Rock magazine, Steinman labeled him [...] "the only genuine genius I've ever worked with." [...] In a 1989 interview with Redbeard for the In the Studio with Redbeard episode on the making of the album, Meat Loaf revealed that Jimmy Iovine and Andy Johns were potential candidates for producing Bat Out of Hell before being rejected by Meat and Steinman in favor of Rundgren, who Meat initially found cocky but grew to like.|$|E

500|$|In November 1983, Tina {{released}} her cover of Al Green's [...] "Let's Stay Together", with Capitol. The record became a hit, reaching several European charts, including a top 10 placement in the United Kingdom. The song peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Turner's first solo {{entry into the}} U.S. charts. It also peaked at the top 10 of the Hot Dance Club Songs and Hot Black Singles charts. The success of the song forced Capitol to rethink its contract with Turner, offering the singer a three album deal, demanding an album on short notice, which had Turner staging what Ebony magazine later called an [...] "amazing comeback." [...] Recorded in two months in London, the album, Private Dancer, was released in June 1984. That same month, Capitol issued the album's second single, [...] "What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It.", earlier recorded by the rock group Bucks Fizz in 1984. It reached the top 10 within a month and in September had reached number 1 on the Hot 100 in the U.S. Featuring hit singles, such as [...] "Better Be Good to Me" [...] and [...] "Private Dancer", the album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200, selling five million copies alone in the states and selling over twenty million copies worldwide, making it her most successful album. Turner's comeback culminated in early 1985 when she won four Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year for [...] "What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It." [...] In February of that year, she embarked on her second world tour supporting the Private Dancer album, where she toured to huge crowds. One show, filmed at Birmingham, England's NEC Arena, was later released on home video. During this time, she also contributed on vocals to the USA for Africa benefit song [...] "We Are the World." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s {{a number of}} American {{painters}} began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips. Roy Lichtenstein made drawings of comic strip characters in 1958. Andy Warhol produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced Look Mickey and Popeye in 1961. Although Warhol had produced silkscreens of comic strips and of other pop art subjects, he supposedly relegated himself to Campbell's Soup Cans as a subject {{at the time to}} avoid competing with the more finished style of comics by Lichtenstein. He once said [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing." ...|$|E

If {{you take a look}} at a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it.
