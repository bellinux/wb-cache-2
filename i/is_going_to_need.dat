It fills me with horror to think of those old people spending another winter out there on the plain." ...|$|E

He went back to Cornelia, and Harriet may have supposed that he was as happy with her as ever. Still, it was judicious to begin to lay on the whitewash, for Shelley <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> many a coat of it now, and the sooner the reader becomes used to the intrusion of the brush the sooner he will get reconciled to it and stop fretting about it.|$|E

In the outsourcing model, one supplier handled all aspects and needs of the clients. The company was confined and had to choose one provider to do all the different areas of the work even though they may have not been the best when it came to fulfilling these requirements. Now that company's have many suppliers, they {{have to make sure that}} the provider is doing exactly what they need and they have to keep an eye for future providers that could replace current ones or provide them with an entirely new service altogether.|$|R

The film clearly sides with the homosexual community ....While there's certainly no film that's going {{to convince me that}} homosexuality is wrong or needs [...] "correcting," [...] I wouldn't mind seeing a film that's a bit smarter, or raises better questions, or presents an opposing side that's less fanatical or more widely identifiable.
