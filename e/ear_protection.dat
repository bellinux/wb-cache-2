5|$|Cannon sounds have {{sometimes}} {{been used in}} classical pieces with a military theme. One {{of the best known}} examples of such a piece is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. The overture is to be performed using an artillery section together with the orchestra, resulting in noise levels high enough that musicians are required to wear <b>ear</b> <b>protection.</b> The cannon fire simulates Russian artillery bombardments of the Battle of Borodino, a critical battle in Napoleon's invasion of Russia, whose defeat the piece celebrates. When the overture was first performed, the cannon were fired by an electric current triggered by the conductor. However, the overture was not recorded with real cannon fire until Mercury Records and conductor Antal Doráti's 1958 recording of the Minnesota Orchestra. Cannon fire is also frequently used annually in presentations of the 1812 on the American Independence Day, a tradition started by Arthur Fiedler of the Boston Pops in 1974.|$|E

25|$|Mask or goggles: Masks are {{safety devices}} players are {{required}} to wear at all times on the field, {{to protect them from}} paintballs. The original equipment used by players were safety goggles of the type used in labs and wood shops; today's goggles are derived from skiing/snowboarding goggles, with an attached shell that completely covers the eyes, mouth, ears and nostrils of the wearer. Masks can also feature throat guards. Modern masks have developed to be less bulky compared with older designs. Some players may remove the mouth and/or <b>ear</b> <b>protection</b> for aesthetic or comfort reasons, but this is neither recommended nor often allowed at commercial venues.|$|E

Additional findings were that Del Monte did not have a safety plan {{in the event of an}} emergency, did not make first aid kits available to employees, did not provide <b>ear</b> <b>protection</b> to workers in high decibel environments and did not provide gas masks to employees using chemical sprays.|$|E
25|$|In retirement, Brabham {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} motorsport events, appearing at contemporary and historic motorsport events around the world where he often drove his former Cooper and Brabham cars until the early 2000s. In 1999, after competing at the Goodwood Revival at the age of 73 he commented that driving stopped him getting old. Despite a large accident at the 2000 Revival, the first racing accident to put him in hospital overnight, he {{continued to}} drive until at least 2004. By the late 2000s, ill-health was preventing him from driving in competition. In addition to the deafness caused by years of motor racing without adequate <b>ear</b> <b>protection,</b> his eyesight was reduced due to macular degeneration and he had kidney disease for which by 2009 he was receiving dialysis three times a week. Nonetheless, that year he attended a celebration of the 50th anniversary of his first world championship at the Phillip Island Classic festival of motorsport, and in 2010 flew to Bahrain with most of the other Formula One world Drivers' Champions for a celebration of 60 years of the Formula One world championship.

25|$|The Malaysian Army {{currently}} has a soldier modernisation programme called the Future Soldier System. Under the FSS, The Malaysian Army plans to equip all soldiers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as Kevlar helmets, Kevlar vests, Oakley goggles and <b>ear</b> <b>protection</b> equipment. The programme also includes arming all the standard issue M4 carbines with SOPMOD kits, {{as well as}} equipping soldiers with a Glock series pistol. Sapura, a Malaysian electronics company, is offering their SAKTI soldier system concept via work in three areas: Head Sub-System (HSS), Body Sub-System (BSS) and Weapon Sub-System (WSS). The HSS consists of a Helmet–Mounted Micro Camera and night vision capability with a data output, helmet-mounted display and earpiece and microphone; the WSS consists of a Rifle Control Unit consisting of a five-button wireless controller for one handed use with key features including push to talk for the radio, switching the HMD on and off, turning the HMD brightness {{up and down as}} well as video transmission to friendly forces. The BSS consists of a controller system, energy unit with a power pack for the communication interface, micro-camera and HMD with a single polymer lithium ion battery for up to ten hours of operation; a communications interface for secure IP based radio which from the image is a Thales St@rmille radio and finally a navigation unit with a display for blue force tracking and situational awareness, colour digital mapping and terrain and urban profile analysis.

5000|$|If one brings one's own firearms, <b>ear</b> and eye <b>protection,</b> it {{is often}} {{possible}} to buy a 50-round box of 9 mm ammunition and target, rent an indoor lane for an hour, and enjoy shooting for under $50 in the United States. Fees for outdoor ranges are often even less, often running $6.50 for 3 hours of range time. Along with a 500-round brick of [...]22 LR ammunition that often costs less than $60.00, it is possible on an outdoor range to enjoy an afternoon of shooting for under $70. Firearm rental fees vary, depending on the model and caliber, but for a typical, non-exotic handgun, costs are only modestly higher. Hearing and eye protection rental fees are modest, often available for under $3 each.|$|R
50|$|Comparatively, <b>ear</b> <b>protection</b> {{commonly}} used while shooting provides 18 to 32 dB of sound reduction at the ear. Further, chainsaws, rock concerts, rocket engines, pneumatic drills, small firecrackers, and ambulance sirens are rated at 100 to 140 dB.|$|E
50|$|Personal noise {{reduction}} devices can be passive, active or a combination. Passive <b>ear</b> <b>protection</b> includes earplugs or earmuffs which can block noise up {{to a specific}} frequency. Earplugs and earmuffs can provide the wearer with 10 dB to 40 dB of attenuation. However, use of earplugs is only effective if the users have been educated and use them properly; without proper use, protection falls far below manufacturer ratings. Higher consistency of performance has been found with custom-molded earplugs. Because of their ease of use without education, and ease of application or removal, earmuffs have more consistency with both compliance and noise attenuation. Active <b>ear</b> <b>protection</b> (electronic pass-through hearing protection devices or EPHPs) electronically filter out noises of specific frequencies or decibels while allowing the remaining noise to pass through.|$|E

40|$|Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causative agents of {{bacterial}} otitis media, and no vaccine has been shown to be effective against it. Three outer membrane lipoproteins of NTHi have been investigated extensively and are leading candidates for inclusion in a vaccine against this organism. Hi-PAL (P 6), recombinant PCP (rPCP), and e (P 4) proteins are antigenically conserved among NTHi strains and elicit bactericidal and protective antibodies. A genetic fusion of the rPCP and Hi-PAL proteins has also been reported. Mixtures of these proteins were used for active immunization experiments in the chinchilla model of otitis media. Chinchillas were immunized either with a mixture of all three lipoproteins or with the mixture of rPCP-PAL hybrid plus e protein. When these animals were challenged with a NTHi strain injected directly into the middle <b>ears,</b> no <b>protection</b> from infection or disease, as measured by otoscopy, was observed in either group. However, effusion and inflammation measured by tympanometry were significantly reduced in animals immunized with the three lipoproteins. Animals that had been immunized with either whole NTHi cells or total outer membranes and then challenged with the homologous strain were significantly protected from both infection and disease, as determined by tympanometry and otoscopy. Unlike other animals antisera, chinchilla antisera against the purified proteins had no bactericidal activity against NTHi but did fix complement on the cell surface. Thus, the chinchilla immune responses to mixtures of these lipoproteins differ from the immune responses observed in other animal species. Further evaluation of these proteins for their vaccine potential remains to be done...|$|R
40|$|Background: Eustachian tube {{dysfunction}} and tuba aperta {{occurs when}} a patient {{has a problem with}} performing {{one or more of the}} primary functions of the Eustachian tube: Ventilation, clearance and middle <b>ear</b> sound <b>protection.</b> Recent research is primarily focused on treatment options, especially in obstruction of the Eustachian tube. Without clear diagnostic criteria, it is difficult to compare the results of these studies, as the inclusion criteria for the patient group differ between the studies. This thesis is a review of articles about tests of Eustachian tube function. Methods: Literature review of articles about Eustachian tube function tests. Search performed in PubMed in April 2016, 1229 abstracts were reviewed and 129 articles included in the thesis. All articles with a test of ET function and clear methodology were included, as well as review papers. Results: 129 articles on several types of tests were evaluated. The included papers had limitations. The methods were often either complicated or too simplified. Few authors list bias or test accuracy. The instruments described were not always commercially available. There are tests that can diagnose tuba aperta with a high level of sensitivity and specificity, but there currently exists no gold standard test in the diagnosis of Eustachian tube dysfunction. Promising new tools include the Eustachian tube dysfunction questionnaire (ETDQ- 7) and the Eustachian tube score (ETS- 7). Conclusion: There is no gold standard on diagnosing Eustachian tube dysfunction, but tuba aperta can in most cases be diagnosed with a simple test battery. In Eustachian tube dysfunction, several tests need to be combined to increase the accuracy of diagnosis until further research is conducted...|$|R
