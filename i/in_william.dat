5|$|Many {{of those}} {{involved}} in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent around the country to encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character <b>in</b> <b>William</b> Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E

5|$|The Jeffersonian Republicans opposed {{banks and}} cities, and favored France. They built their own {{national}} coalition {{to oppose the}} Federalists.

All the newspapers were characterized by intense personal attacks, major exaggerations and invented claims. In 1801, Hamilton established a daily newspaper, the New York Evening Post and brought <b>in</b> <b>William</b> Coleman as editor. It is still publishing (as the New York Post).|$|E

5|$|The {{power of}} the House of Lancaster was {{severely}} reduced after this battle.

Later generations remembered the battle as depicted <b>in</b> <b>William</b> Shakespeare's dramatic adaptation of Henry's life—Henry VI, Part 3, Act2, Scene5. In 1929, the Towton Cross was erected on the battlefield to commemorate the event.

5|$|Desha {{returned}} to Kentucky after the congressional session. He responded to Governor Isaac Shelby's call for volunteers to serve <b>in</b> <b>William</b> Henry Harrison's campaign into Upper Canada. He was commissioned a major general and given {{command of the}} 2nd Division of Kentucky militia. The 3,500-man division, composed of the 2nd and 5th Brigades and the 11th Regiment, assembled on the Ohio River at Newport, Kentucky. They joined Harrison in forcing the British retreat from Detroit and held the Indian allies of the British off his left flank during the American victory at the Battle of the Thames on October 5, 1813. According to historian Bennett H. Young, Desha's old friend William Whitley had a premonition of his own death {{the night before the}} battle and gave his rifle and powderhorn to Desha, asking him to convey it to his widow, along with a message of his affection. Whitley was indeed killed in the fighting the following day.|$|E
5|$|He entrenched his {{position}} in northern England by marrying Ælfflæd, the daughter of Ealdred, Earl of Bamburgh. After killing Ealdred's successor Eadulf in 1041, Siward gained control of all Northumbria. He exerted his power in support of Cnut's successors, kings Harthacnut and Edward, assisting them with vital military aid and counsel. He probably gained control of the middle shires of Northampton and Huntingdon by the 1050s, {{and there is some}} evidence that he spread Northumbrian control into Cumberland. In the early 1050s Earl Siward turned against the Scottish ruler Mac Bethad mac Findlaích ("Macbeth"). Despite the death of his son Osbjorn, Siward defeated Mac Bethad in battle in 1054. More than half a millennium later the Scotland adventure earned him a place <b>in</b> <b>William</b> Shakespeare's Macbeth. Siward died in 1055, leaving one son, Waltheof, who would eventually succeed to Northumbria. St Olave's church in York and nearby Heslington Hill are associated with Siward.|$|E
