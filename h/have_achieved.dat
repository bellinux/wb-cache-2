40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Welsh Baccalaureate Advanced Diploma Qualification (WBQ) in 2003, an increasing number of students are applying to higher education institutions (HEIs) with this qualification. The advanced-level WBQ is regarded as equivalent to one General Certificate of Education A-Level (GCE A-Level). This study assesses the impact of attaining the WBQ in addition to three GCE A-Levels on overall university degree performance in comparison to attaining four GCE A-Levels, in three cohorts of undergraduate students (Year 1 [*]=[*] 318, Year 2 [*]=[*] 280, Year 3 [*]=[*] 236) studying Biosciences from 2005 to 2011 at a UK HEI. Binary logistic regression was used to compare the academic attainment of students who <b>had</b> <b>achieved</b> four GCE A-Levels to those who <b>had</b> <b>achieved</b> three GCE A-Levels in addition to the WBQ. Comparisons were also made between students who <b>had</b> <b>achieved</b> three GCE A-Levels and those who <b>had</b> <b>achieved</b> three GCE A-Levels in addition to the WBQ. The results suggest that students who achieved the WBQ qualification in its current form, in addition to three GCE A-Levels, performed less well academically in undergraduate studies than those who achieved four GCE A-Levels. Furthermore, this effect was still present when the balance between coursework and examination was considered, and when students who <b>had</b> <b>achieved</b> the WBQ in addition to three GCE A-Levels were compared to students who <b>had</b> <b>achieved</b> three GCE A-Level...|$|R
