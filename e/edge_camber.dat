Wing leading <b>edge</b> <b>camber</b> was achieved through a deflection of the outboard 30 % of the local wing semispan of a reference 75 deg swept flat delta wing. The four wing models have leading edge deflection angles delta sub F of 0, 5, 10, and 15 deg measured streamwise. Data for the wings with delta sub F = 10 and 15 deg showed that hinge line separation dominated the lee-side wing loading and prohibited the development of leading edge separation on the deflected portion of wing leading edge. However, data for the wing with delta sub F = 5 deg showed that at an angle of attack of 5 deg, a vortex was positioned on the deflected leading edge with reattachment at the hinge line. Flow visualization results were presented which detail the influence of Mach number, angle of attack, and camber on the lee-side flow characteristics of conically cambered delta wings.

The HiMAT model was investigated in detail to determine the canard and wing vortex flow field development, vortex paths, and vortex breakdown characteristics as a function of angle of attack and sideslip. The presence of the canard caused the wing vortex to form further outboard and delayed the breakdown of the wing vortex to higher angles of attack.

40|$|Hydrodynamic {{scaling laws}} and {{extensive}} experimental {{data for the}} performance of fully submerged propellers have existed and have been used to advantage since the 1950 s and earlier. Modern high performance boats require surface piercing propellers. I present three new hydrodynamic scale-free predictions for the relative performance of both submerged and surface-piercing propellers and boats. For the surface piercing case I compare my scaling predictions with official APBA OPC kilo records, using a single class record in each case as a baseline for my predictions. One scaling law allows propeller diameter to be predicted from an established baseline where shaft hp and shaft RPM are the variables. The second scaling law accurately predicts the speed loss when the gear ratio is lowered. The third scale-free prediction is inferred from Froude nr. scaling and allows boat speed to be predicted based on shaft hp and weight, given a known baseline in the same class of drag coefficient and submerged depth of boat. I also discuss the existing available data on surface piercing propellers and compare the data with both typical competition data and speed records.

The dependency of the critical Mach number on airfoil leading <b>edge</b> curvature, <b>camber,</b> and angle of attack is investigated. Evidence is presented {{to show that a}} local region of supersonic flow occurs on an oscillating airfoil, even for a freestream Mach number as low as 0. 2, if the boundary layer remains attached and the angle of attack is sufficiently high; that a shock terminates this local supersonic bubble; and that the vorticity that this shock generates grows rapidly and becomes very unstable as the angle of attack increases beyond the value at which the maximum local flow speed first exceeds the speed of sound. It is suggested that these shock-induced effects compete with the dynamic viscous effects occurring in the boundary layer in determining the onset of separation, which can lead to premature dynamic stall and can significantly reduce the maximum dynamic lift that can otherwise be obtained...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-dimensional airframe design methodology for low noise emission and high fuel efficiency, {{based on a}} blended-wing-body type aircraft. The design methodology uses a combination {{of high and low}} fidelity tools to assess the performance and acoustics of the aircraft. The goal set by the Silent* * Aircraft Initiative is a viable, commercial aircraft design with noise levels imperceptible outside the airport perimeter in a well-populated urban environment. To be viable, the aircraft requires a fuel burn comparable to modern conventional aircraft. The detailed airframe design incorporates leading <b>edge</b> <b>camber</b> of the centerbody to provide pitch trim without penalties in induced drag, wave drag, and trim drag. A low noise approach is achieved with reduced approach velocity and increased distance between the airframe and the observer. This slow and steep approach profile is enabled through a combination of thrust vectoring, quiet drag generation, and leading edge high-lift devices. The blended-wing-body type airframe design presented in this paper is both quiet with an OASPL of approximately 65 dBA and highly efficient with a cruise ML/D of 18. 5.

40|$|Morphing, or {{geometric}} {{adaptation to}} off-design conditions, {{has been considered}} in aircraft design since the Wright Brothers’ first powered flight. Decades later, smooth, bio-mimetic shape variation for control over aerodynamic forces still remains elusive. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are prime targets for morphing implementation as they must adapt to large changes in flight conditions associated with locally varying wind or large changes in mass associated with payload delivery. The Spanwise Morphing Trailing Edge (SMTE) concept is developed to locally vary the trailing <b>edge</b> <b>camber</b> of a wing or control surface, functioning as a modular replacement for conventional ailerons without altering the wing’s spar box. The SMTE design was realized utilizing alternating active sections of Macro Fiber Composites (MFCs) driving internal elastomeric compliant mechanisms and passive sections of anisotropic, elastomeric skin with tailorable stiffness, produced by additive manufacturing. Experimental investigations of the modular design via a new scaling methodology for reduced-span test articles revealed that increased use of more MFCs within the active section did not increase aerodynamic performance due to asymmetric voltage constraints. The comparative mass and aerodynamic gains for the SMTE concept are evaluated for a representative finite wing as compared with a conventional, articulated flap wing. Informed by a simplistic system model and measured control derivatives, experimental investigations identified {{a reduction in the}} adaptive drag penalty up to 20 % at off-design conditions. To investigate the potential for augmented aeroelastic performance and actuation range, a hybrid multiple-smart material morphing concept, the Synergistic Smart Morphing Aileron (SSMA), is introduced. The SSMA leverages the properties of two different smart material actuators to achieve performance exceeding that of the constituent materials. Utilizing the relatively higher work density and phase transformation of Shape-Memory Alloys combined with the larger bandwidth and conformal bending of MFCs, the resultant design is demonstrated to achieve the desired goals while providing additional control authority at stall and for unsteady conditions through synergistic use of reflex actuation. These advances highlight and motivate new morphing structures for the growing field of UAVs in which adaptation involves advanced compliance tailoring of complex geometry with synergistic actuation of embedded, smart materials...|$|E
40|$|Axial {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in many aerodynamic applications. The design of an axial compressor configuration presents many challenges. Until recently, compressor design was done using 2 -D viscous flow analyses that solve the flow field around cascades or in meridional planes or 3 -D inviscid analyses. With the advent of modern computational methods {{it is now possible}} to analyze the 3 -D viscous flow and accurately predict the performance of 3 -D multistage compressors. It is necessary to retool the design methodologies {{to take advantage of the}} improved accuracy and physical fidelity of these advanced methods. 	In this study, a first-principles based multi-objective technique for designing single stage compressors is described. The study accounts for stage aerodynamic characteristics, rotor-stator interactions and blade elastic deformations. A parametric representation of compressor blades that include leading and trailing <b>edge</b> <b>camber</b> line angles, thickness and camber distributions was used in this study A design of experiment approach is used to reduce the large combinations of design variables into a smaller subset. A response surface method is used to approximately map the output variables as a function of design variables. An optimized configuration is determined as the extremum of all extrema. 	This method has been applied to a rotor-stator stage similar to NASA Stage 35. The study has two parts: a preliminary study where a limited number of design variables were used to give an understanding of the important design variables for subsequent use, and a comprehensive application of the methodology where a larger, more complete set of design variables are used. The extended methodology also attempts to minimize the acoustic fluctuations at the rotor-stator interface by considering a rotor-wake influence coefficient (RWIC). Results presented include performance map calculations at design and off-design speed along with a detailed visualization of the flow field at design and off-design conditions. 	The present methodology provides a way to systematically screening through the plethora of design variables. By selecting the most influential design parameters and by optimizing the blade leading edge and trailing edge mean camber line angles, phenomenon s such as tip blockages, blade-to-blade shock structures and other loss mechanisms can be weakened or alleviated. It is found that these changes to the configuration can have a beneficial effect on total pressure ratio and stage adiabatic efficiency, thereby improving the performance of the axial compression system. Aeroacoustic benefits were found by minimizing the noise generating mechanisms associated with rotor wake-stator interactions. The new method presented is reliable, low time cost, and easily applicable to industry daily design optimization of turbomachinery blades. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Lakshmi N.

The turbulent flow around the cambered airfoil with the sinusoidal leading edge was computed at different angles of attack with the open source solver OpenFOAM, using two different eddy viscosity models integrated to the wall. The reported research focused on the effects of the modified leading edge in terms of lift-to-drag performance and the influence of camber on such parameters. For these reasons a comparison with a symmetric airfoil is provided. The research was primarily concerned with the elucidation of the fluid flow mechanisms induced by the bumps and the impact of those mechanisms on airfoil performance, on both symmetric and cambered profiles. The bumps on the leading edge influenced the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil, and the lift curves were found to feature an early recovery in post-stall for the symmetric profile with an additional gain in lift for the cambered profile. The bumps drove the fluid dynamic on the suction side of the airfoil, which in turn resulted in the capability to control the separation at the trailing edge in coincidence with the peak of the sinusoid at the leading edge...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{data analysis}} of a flexible wing wind tunnel model with a variable camber continuous trailing edge flap (VCCTEF) design for drag minimization tested at the University of Washington Aeronautical Laboratory (UWAL). The wind tunnel test was designed to explore the relative merit of the VCCTEF concept for improved cruise efficiency {{through the use of}} low-cost aeroelastic model test techniques. The flexible wing model is a 10 %-scale model of a typical transport wing and is constructed of woven fabric composites and foam core. The wing structural stiffness in bending is tailored to be half of the stiffness of a Boeing 757 -era transport wing while the torsional stiffness is about the same. This stiffness reduction results in a wing tip deflection of about 10 % of the wing semi-span. The VCCTEF is a multi-segment flap design having three chordwise camber segments and five spanwise flap sections for a total of 15 individual flap elements. The three chordwise camber segments can be positioned appropriately to create a desired trailing <b>edge</b> <b>camber.</b> Elastomeric material is used to cover the gaps in between the spanwise flap sections, thereby creating a continuous trailing edge. Wind tunnel data analysis conducted previously shows that the VCCTEF can achieve a drag reduction of up to 6. 31 % and an improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio (L=D) of up to 4. 85 %. A method for estimating the bending and torsional stiffnesses of the flexible wingUWAL wind tunnel model from static load test data is presented. The resulting estimation indicates that the stiffness of the flexible wing is significantly stiffer in torsion than in bending by as much as 9 to 1. The lift prediction for the flexible wing is computed by a coupled aerodynamic-structural model. The coupled model is developed by coupling a conceptual aerodynamic tool Vorlax with a finite-element model of the flexible wing via an automated geometry deformation tool. Based on the comparison of the lift curve slope, the lift prediction for the rigid wing is in good agreement with the estimated lift coefficients derived from the wind tunnel test data. Due to the movement of the VCCTEF during the wind tunnel test, uncertainty in the lift prediction due to the indicated variations of the VCCTEF deflection is studied. The results show a significant spread in the lift prediction which contradicts the consistency in the aerodynamic measurements, thus suggesting that the indicated variations as measured by the VICON system may not be reliable. The lift prediction of the flexible wing agrees very well with the measured lift curve for the baseline configuration. The computed bending deflection and wash-out twist of the flexible wing also match reasonably well with the aeroelastic deflection measurements. The results demonstrate the validity of the aerodynamic-structural tool for use to analyze aerodynamic performance of flexible wings...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{alleviate}} the dynamic stall effects in helicopter rotor, the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method is employed to optimize the characteristics of airfoil under dynamic stall conditions based on the SC 1095 airfoil. The geometry of airfoil is parameterized by the class-shape-transformation (CST) method, and the C-topology body-fitted mesh is then automatically generated around the airfoil by solving the Poisson equations. Based on the grid generation technology, the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are chosen as the governing equations for predicting airfoil flow field and the highly-efficient implicit scheme of lower–upper symmetric Gauss–Seidel (LU-SGS) is adopted for temporal discretization. To capture the dynamic stall phenomenon of the rotor more accurately, the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model is employed to close the RANS equations. The optimized airfoil with a larger leading <b>edge</b> radius and <b>camber</b> is obtained. The leading edge vortex and trailing edge separation of the optimized airfoil under unsteady conditions are obviously weakened, and the dynamic stall characteristics of optimized airfoil at different Mach numbers, reduced frequencies and angles of attack are also obviously improved compared with the baseline SC 1095 airfoil. It is demonstrated that the optimized method is effective and the optimized airfoil is suitable as the helicopter rotor airfoil...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{was determined}} of incorporating the Navier-Stokes computational code, CFL 3 D, into the supersonic wing design process. The approach taken is of two steps. The {{first step was}} to calibrate CFL 3 D against existing experimental data sets obtained on thin sharp edged delta wings. The experimental data identified six flow types which are dependent on the similarity parameters of Mach number and angle of attack normal to the leading edge. The calibration showed CFL 3 D capable of simulating these various separated and attached flow conditions. The second step was to use CFL 3 D to study the initial formation of leading edge separation over delta wings at supersonic speeds. This consisted of examining solutions obtained on a 65 deg delta wing at Mach number of 1. 6 with varying cross sectional shapes. Reynolds number was held constant at 1000000 and the Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model was used. The study showed that through the use of leading <b>edge</b> radius and/or <b>camber,</b> the onset of leading edge separation can be delayed to a higher angle of attack than observed on a flat sharp edged wing. Based on the geometries studied, three wind tunnel models are being designed to verify these results...|$|R
40|$|With {{emerging}} {{applications for}} high speed boats in commercial, military and off shore industries, {{there is a}} focus in the naval architecture community to improve the efficiency and performance characteristics of planing hulls. In the 1960 's, Eugene Clement showed that considerable reductions in resistance at high speeds {{can be obtained by}} converting a conventional planing hull to a Dynaplane stepped planing hull. A Dynaplane stepped planing hull refers to a hull configuration where the majority of lift is provided by a swept back cambered surface, while the remainder of the lift is provided by an aft lifting surface that also provides trim control and stability. The afterbody is fully ventilated by use of a V-shaped step positioned at the trailing <b>edge</b> of the <b>cambered</b> surface. Clement's semi-empirical conversion method was based off tests performed at the David Taylor Model Basin and is limited to boats with a deadrise of less than 15 °. Since the publication of his paper, advancements in CFD programs have made it possible to conduct accurate simulations of planing hulls with complex geometry, allowing for further development of Clement's method. This thesis expands Clement's method to high deadrise by applying it to a notional version of the Mark V Special Operations Craft used by the United States Navy with a design speed of 55 kts. CFD simulations with fixed trim were run in order to refine the cambered surface, design the step and afterbody, to position the hydrofoil and to test the low speed performance of the interceptor. Once the hull design was finalized, simulations with two degrees of freedom were run to assess the dynamic stability of the hull. Through simulations, {{it was found that the}} configuration is dynamically stable and is able to reduce hull resistance at design speed by as much as 54 % when compared with that of the original hull. by Calley Dawn Gray.

40|$|The {{rotorcraft}} {{community has}} a {{growing interest in}} the development of high-speed helicopters to replace outdated fleets. One barrier to the design of such helicopters is the lack of understanding of the aerodynamic behavior of retreating rotor blades in the reverse flow region. This work considers two fundamental models of this complex unsteady flow regime: static and oscillating (i. e., pitching) airfoils in reverse flow. Wind tunnel tests have been performed at the University of Maryland (UMD) and the United States Naval Academy (USNA). Four rotor blade sections are considered: two featuring a sharp geometric trailing edge (NACA 0012 and NACA 0024) and two featuring a blunt geometric trailing <b>edge</b> (ellipse and <b>cambered</b> ellipse). Static airfoil experiments were performed at angles of attack through 180 deg and Reynolds numbers up to one million, representative of the conditions found in the reverse flow region of a full-scale high-speed helicopter. Time-resolved velocity field measurements were used to identify three unsteady flow regimes: slender body vortex shedding, turbulent wake, and deep stall vortex shedding. Unsteady airloads were measured in these three regimes using unsteady pressure transducers. The magnitude of the unsteady airloads is high in the turbulent wake regime when the separated shear layer is close to the airfoil surface and in deep stall due to periodic vortex-induced flow. Oscillating airfoil experiments were performed on a NACA 0012 and cambered ellipse to investigate reverse flow dynamic stall characteristics by modeling cyclic pitching kinematics. The parameter space spanned three Reynolds numbers (165, 000; 330, 000; and 500, 000), five reduced frequencies between 0. 100 and 0. 511, three mean pitch angles (5, 10, and 15 deg), and two pitch amplitudes (5 deg and 10 deg). The sharp aerodynamic leading edge of the NACA 0012 airfoil forces flow separation resulting in deep dynamic stall. The number of associated vortex structures depends strongly on pitching kinematics. The cambered ellipse exhibits light reverse flow dynamic stall {{for a wide range of}} pitching kinematics. Deep dynamic stall over the cambered ellipse airfoil is observed for high mean pitch angles and pitch amplitudes. The detailed results and analysis in this work contributes to the development of a new generation of high-speed helicopters...|$|R
40|$|Two micro air vehicles, namely Sapthami and Sapthami-flyer, are {{developed}} in this thesis. Their total weight {{is less than}} 200 grams each. They ﬁt inside a 30 cm and 32 cm sphere respectively and carry the commercially available Kestrel autopilot hardware. The vehicles have an endurance of around 20 - 30 minutes. The stall speed of Sapthami is around 7 m/s and that of Sapthami-flyer is around 5 m/s as found by nonlinear modeling. The low stall speed {{makes it possible for}} them to be launched by hand. This enhances their portability as they do not require any launching equipment. The vehicle installed with Kestrel autopilot system is capable of many modes of operations. It is capable of fully autonomous flight {{with the aid of a}} variety of sensors like the GPS unit, heading sensor, 2 -axis magnetometer, 3 -axis accelerometer and 3 -axis gyros. The vehicle carrying the Kestrel autopilot hardware is capable of autonomous and semi-autonomous flights after installation and tuning of feedback loops. Sapthami, is a tailless flying wing with an inverse zimmermann profile. A flying wing is a preferred configuration for the MAV as it maximizes the lifting area for a given size constraint. For a maximum size constraint of 30 cm and aspect ratio around 1, the vehicle operates at Reynolds number between 100, 000 to 250, 000, at flight velocity 7 m/s to 15 m/s. The Inverse Zimmerman profile has a higher lift coefficient, CL, in comparison to the other planforms such as rectangular, elliptical and Zimmermann, for aspect ratio 1 to 1. 25 and tested at Reynolds number of 100, 000. The configuration of Sapthami is clean as there is no fuselage and all the components like autopilot hardware and battery are housed inside the wing. A thick reflex Martin Hepperle (MH) airfoil MH 18 is chosen which gives sufficient space to place the components. This airfoil is specially used for tailless configurations due to its negative camber at the trailing <b>edge.</b> This negative <b>camber</b> helps in reducing the negative pitching moment of the wing, since no separate horizontal tail is available on a tailless aircraft to compensate for it. The vehicle is fabricated using the blue foam, having a density of 30 kg/m 3. The wing is fabricated by CNC machining after which slots are cut manually to embed the electronics. The vehicle is found to have stable flying characteristics. Limited flight trials are done for Sapthami. It takes large time to fabricate the vehicle due to limited availability of CNC machining facility. Therefore, a new tailless, wing-fuselage configuration, which can be fabricated with balsa wood, is designed. Sapthami-flyer is the second vehicle designed in this thesis. Its wing span is slightly more than Sapthami. Since it is a wing-fuselage configuration, therefore there is no need for a thick airfoil. Mark drela’s AG airfoils are found to have better lift than MH airfoils for the inverse Zimmerman profile. The thickness of the airfoils is reduced to 1 % so that the wing can be made by a 1. 5 mm thick balsa sheet to reduce weight. The inverse Zimmermann profile wing with the AG 09 airfoil is found to have best lift-to-drag ratio when compared to AG 36, MH 45 and MH 18. The analysis is done using commercially available AVL software. AG 09 with 1 % thickness is used in the final configuration. This configuration has better short period damping than Sapthami. It also has slower modes of operation than Sapthami. The operating modes of most of the MAVs, including Sapthami and Sapthami-flyer, are lowly damped but fast. This makes it difficult for the pilot to fly the vehicle. To improve the flying qualities of the vehicle artificial stabilization is required. The feedback is implemented on the Kestrel autopilot hardware. It allows only PID based feedback structures to be implemented, hence gives no choice to the designer to implement higher order control. The digital integrator and differentiator implementation for feedback are non-ideal. This further reduces the effectiveness of control. The problem is dealt with by incorporating the additional dynamics introduced by these implementation while formulating the control problem. Further the modeling of the micro air vehicle is done by using vortex lattice simulation based softwares. The fidelity of the obtained dynamics is low. Therefore, there is high uncertainty in the plant model. The controller also needs to reject the wind gust disturbances which are of the order of the flight speed of the vehicle. All the above stated requirements from the control design can be best addressed by a robust control design. Sapthami-flyer uses aileron and elevator for control. There is no rudder in the configuration in order to reduce weight. In the longitudinal dynamics, pitch rate and pitch error feedback to elevator are used to increase the short period and phugoid damping respectively. In the lateral dynamics, a combination of roll rate, yaw rate and roll error feedback is given to aileron to improve the dutch roll damping and stabilize the spiral mode. The feedback loops for both longitudinal and lateral dynamics are multi-output single input design problems, therefore simultaneous tuning of loops is beneficial. The PID control is designed by first converting the actual plant to a static output feedback equivalent plant. The dynamics introduced by non-ideal differentiator and integrator implementation on the autopilot hardware are incorporated in the open loop static output feedback formulation. The robust pole placement for the SOF plant is done by using the modified iterative matrix inequality algorithm developed in this thesis. It is capable of multi-loop, multi-objective feedback design for SOF plants. The algorithm finds the optimal solution by simultaneously putting constraints on the H 2 performance, pole placement, gain and phase margin of the closed loop system. The pole placement is done to minimize the real part of largest eigenvalue. A single controller is designed at a suit-able operating point and constraints are put on the gain and phase margin of the closed loop plant at other operating points. The designed controller is tested in flight on board Sapthami-flyer. The vehicle is also capable of tracking commanded pitch and roll attitude with the help of pitch error, roller or feedbacks. This is shown in the flight when the pilot leaves the RC stick and the vehicle tracks the desired attitude. The vehicle has shown improved flying characteristics in the closed loop mode...|$|R
