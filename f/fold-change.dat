2500|$|The enriched motifs {{have been}} {{proposed}} to follow convergent evolution, suggesting they are [...] "optimal designs" [...] for certain regulatory purposes. For example, modeling shows that feed-forward loops are able to coordinate the change in node A (in terms of concentration and activity) and the expression dynamics of node C, creating different input-output behaviors. The galactose utilization system of E. coli contains a feed-forward loop which accelerates the activation of galactose utilization operon galETK, potentially facilitating the metabolic transition to galactose when glucose is depleted. The feed-forward loop in the arabinose utilization systems of E.coli delays the activation of arabinose catabolism operon and transporters, potentially avoiding unnecessary metabolic transition due to temporary fluctuations in upstream signaling pathways. Similarly in the Wnt signaling pathway of Xenopus, the feed-forward loop acts as a <b>fold-change</b> detector that responses to the fold change, rather than the absolute change, {{in the level of}} β-catenin, potentially increasing the resistance to fluctuations in β-catenin levels. Following the convergent evolution hypothesis, the enrichment of feed-forward loops would be an adaptation for fast response and noise resistance. A recent research found that yeast grown in an environment of constant glucose developed mutations in glucose signaling pathways and growth regulation pathway, suggesting regulatory components responding to environmental changes are dispensable under constant environment.|$|E

Estimates {{of the factors}} determining protein levels in human tissues do not distinguish between (i) the factors determining the variability between the abundances of different proteins, i. e., mean-level-variability and, (ii) the factors determining the physiological variability of the same protein across different tissue types, i. e., across-tissues variability. We sought to estimate the contribution of transcript levels to these two orthogonal sources of variability, and found that scaled mRNA levels can account {{for most of the}} mean-level-variability but not necessarily for across-tissues variability. The reliable quantification of the latter estimate is limited by substantial measurement noise. However, protein-to-mRNA ratios exhibit substantial across-tissues variability that is functionally concerted and reproducible across different datasets, suggesting extensive post-transcriptional regulation. These results caution against estimating protein <b>fold-changes</b> from mRNA <b>fold-changes</b> between different cell-types, and highlight the contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to shaping tissue-type-specific proteomes.

While RNA-based sensors, called ‘thermometers’, have been investigated in both natural and synthetic contexts, an important challenge is to design diverse responses to temperature, differing in sensitivities and thresholds. We address this issue by constructing a library of RNA thermometers, based on thermodynamic computations, and experimentally measuring their activities in cell-free biomolecular ‘breadboards’. Using free energies of the minimum free energy structures as well as melt profile computations, we estimated thata diverse set of temperature responses were possible. We experimentally found a wide range of responses to temperature in the temperature range 29 ◦C– 37 ◦C, with <b>fold-changes</b> varying over 3 -fold around the starting thermometer. The sensitivities of these responses ranged over 10 -fold around the starting thermometer. We correlated these measurements with computational expectations, finding that while there was no strong correlation for the individual thermometers, overall trends of diversity, <b>fold-changes,</b> and sensitivities were similar. These results present a toolbox of RNA-based circuit elements with diverse temperature responses...|$|R
40|$|In {{functional}} genomics experiments, researchers often select genes to follow-up or validate {{from a long}} list of differentially expressed genes. Typically, sharp thresholds are used to bin genes into groups such as significant/non-significant or fold change above/below a cut-off value, and ad hoc criteria are also used such as favouring well-known genes. Binning, however, is inefficient and does not take the uncertainty of the measurements into account. Furthermore, p-values, <b>fold-changes,</b> and other outcomes are treated as equally important, and relevant genes may be overlooked with such an approach. Desirability functions are proposed as a way to integrate multiple selection criteria for ranking, selecting, and prioritising genes. These functions map any variable to a continuous 0 – 1 scale, where one is maximally desirable and zero is unacceptable. Multiple selection criteria are then combined to provide an overall desirability that is used to rank genes. In addition to p-values and <b>fold-changes,</b> further experimental results and information contained in databases can be easily included as criteria.

40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between enzymes and metabolites, the two major constituents of metabolic networks? We propose three alternative relationships between enzyme capacity and metabolite concentration alterations based on a Michaelis-Menten kinetic; that is enzyme capacities, metabolite concentrations, or both could limit the metabolic reaction rates.

Our results reveal an inverse relationship between <b>fold-changes</b> in substrate metabolites and their catalyzing enzymes.

40|$|In this work, I {{investigate}} {{the role of}} gene regulatory changes {{in the evolution of}} Drosophila melanogaster. As a first step, I performed a survey of gene expression variation in the species using whole-genome microarrays. I surveyed eight strains from an ancestral African population and eight strains from a derived European population using an experimental design that allowed for the detection of expression differences within and between populations. Levels of gene expression variation were nearly equal within the two populations, but a higher amount of variation was detected in comparisons between the two populations. Most gene expression variation within populations appears to be limited by stabilizing selection. However, some genes that are differentially expressed between the two populations might be targets of positive selection. Some of these encode proteins associated with insecticide resistance, food choice, lipid metabolism, and flight. These genes are good candidates for studying adaptive regulatory evolution that accompanied the out-of-Africa migration of D. melanogaster. To verify the accuracy of the microarray experiments, I performed quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR), which is another method to measure gene expression, on a subset of genes. I compared the <b>fold-changes</b> in gene expression between pairs of strains determined by the two methods. I also compared the pattern of expression variation in male and female flies. The qPCR approach supported the general accuracy of the microarray experiments, as the <b>fold-changes</b> measured by the two techniques were highly correlated. Expression differences among the strains tended to be similar for male and females. However, exceptions to this general pattern could be found by looking at the pairwise <b>fold-changes</b> for individual genes, some of which differed in expression pattern between males and females. I also investigated the molecular evolution and population genetics of the protein-encoding and upstream regulatory regions of genes that have potentially undergone adaptive evolution at the gene-regulatory level. These genes represent a subset of the genes that showed a significant difference in gene expression between the African and European populations. A set of control genes, which showed no significant difference in expression between the two populations, was also included in the analysis. Overall, I found evidence for both positive and purifying selection in the coding and non-coding regions. However, patterns of polymorphism and divergence did not differ significantly between the candidate genes and the control genes. One of the genes that showed an interesting pattern of expression in the microarray and qPCR experiments was subjected to further, more detailed population genetic analysis. This gene, CG 9509, has twofold higher expression in the European strains than in the African strains. The coding and the upstream regions of this gene show evidence of recurrent positive selection since the split of D. melanogaster and its close relative, D. sechellia. A polymorphism survey of the CG 9509 region uncovered a 1. 2 -kb segment, which included the putative CG 9509 promoter that showed no polymorphism in the European population. The European population also has several fixed or nearly-fixed derived mutations in this region. These observations, coupled with statistical analysis, provide evidence for a selective sweep in the European population. The selective sweep was likely driven by local adaptation at the level of gene expression...|$|R

The widely accepted measures are inadequate for distinguishing genes transcribed from distinct regulatory mechanisms in the complicated genomes of higher eukaryotes. Results By defining the regulatory similarity between a gene pair {{as the number of}} common known transcription factor binding motifs in the promoter regions, we compared the performance of several expression distance measures on seven mouse expression data sets.

However, translational insights on these observations are lacking. Here we show that IVIg therapy in rheumatic patients leads to significant raise in plasma IL- 33. However, IL- 33 was not contributed by human DC-SIGN 1 dendritic cells and splenocytes. As IL- 33 has been shown to expand basophils, we analyzed the proportion of circulating basophils in these patients following IVIg therapy. In contrast to mice data, IVIg therapy led to basophil expansion only in two patients who also showed increased plasma levels of IL- 33. Importantly, the <b>fold-changes</b> in IL- 33 and basophils were not correlated and we could hardly detect IL- 4 in the plasma following IVIg therapy.

While differentially upregulated expressed genes are related to transport and protein metabolic process, downregulated expressed genes are related to DNA and RNA binding. Using microarray data, 6 imprinted genes were identified as conserved among rabbits, humans and mice: GRB 10, ATP 10 A, ZNF 215, NDN, IMPACT and SFMBT 2. We also found that 26 putative genes have at least one member of that gene family imprinted in other species. These data strengthen the view that a large fraction of genes is differentially expressed between parthenogenetic and normal embryos cultured under the same conditions and offer a new approach to the identification of imprinted genes in rabbit...|$|R
40|$|Allergen {{exposure}} induces {{the airway}} epithelium to produce chemoattractants, proallergic interleukins, matrix-modifying proteins, and proteins {{that influence the}} growth and activation state of airway structural cells. These proteins, in turn, contribute to the influx of inflammatory cells and changes in structure that characterize the asthmatic airway. To use {{the response of the}} airway epithelium to allergen to identify genes not previously associated with allergic responses, we compared gene expression in cytokeratin-positive cells before and after segmental allergen challenge. After challenge with concentrations of allergen in the clinically relevant range, 755 (6 %) of the detectable sequences had geometric mean <b>fold-changes</b> in expression, with 95 % confidence intervals that excluded unity. Using a prospectively defined conservative filtering algorithm, we identified 141 sequences as upregulated and eight as downregulated, with confirmation by conventional polymerase chain reaction in all 10 sequences studied. Using this approach, we identified asthma-associated sequences including interleukin (IL-) - 3, IL- 4, and IL- 5 receptor subunits, the p 65 component of nuclear factor-�B, and lipocortin. The genomic response of the human airway to concentrations of allergen in the clinically relevant range involves a greater number of genes than previously recognized, including many not previously associated with asthma that are differentially expressed after airway allergen exposure...|$|R
