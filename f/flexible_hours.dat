25|$|Horizontal {{segregation}} {{refers to}} differences {{in the number of}} people of each gender present across occupations. Horizontal segregation is likely to be increased by post-industrial restructuring of the economy (post-industrial society), in which the expansion of service industries has called for many women to enter the workforce. The millions of housewives who entered the economy during post-industrial restructuring primarily entered into service sector jobs where they could work part-time and having <b>flexible</b> <b>hours.</b> While these options are often appealing to mothers, who are often responsible for the care work of their children and their homes, they are also unfortunately most available in lower-paying and lower status occupations. The idea that nurses and teachers are often pictured as women whereas doctors and lawyers are often assumed to be men are examples of how highly engrained horizontal segregation is in our society.|$|E

25|$|The Gender Equality Bureau {{defines a}} work-life balance {{as a society}} in which an {{individual}} is not limited by his/her gender in choosing a fulfilling occupation that will accommodate each stage of an individual's life. Japanese workers on average have a minimum of ten work days for vacation time per year and are given zero paid public holidays, numbers that are far below any other industrialized nation except the United States. In order to ensure that Japanese workers are free to lead a healthy and affluent life in a style of their choosing while also maintaining their economic independence, the Gender Equality Bureau in 2007 recommended a variety of policies for both the public and private sector in order to increase time-off for employees. The Bureau has pushed private employers to offer <b>flexible</b> <b>hours</b> that can cater to a variety of lifestyles, such as offering child-care leave for men in order to promote the male's role in child-rearing. Government, per the Bureau's recommendation, is tasked with providing a policy structure that meets both male and female needs, hiring only companies that practice work-life balance for public contracts, and passing legislation that signifies the importance of both genders taking an active role in domestic work.|$|E
500|$|Parenting {{is a large}} task within itself, {{and when}} a parent has a career as well, it can cause a double burden, or work–family conflict. Strain begins to develop when women and men find that the demands of their family are {{conflicting}} with the demands from their job. When one is faced with a double burden like this, it affects how decisions are made within a career and in a family; this burden could potentially effect when a couple decides to have children. 75% of all women who have jobs are in their childbearing prime. When the conflict between one's family and work presents itself, the unpaid work that is being done in the home may be cut down, because of the certain health effects, or {{as a solution to}} deal with the greater demands from the workplace. Social outings and visits, and family dinners are two of the first things that get cut back on due to the work/family conflict. In a study by Ari Väänänen, May V. Kevin, et al. found that if a man put a higher importance on their family, were more likely to stay home from work {{in order to deal with}} extreme family demands. Ways that the double burden can be lessened for is with hired help in the house, day-care facilities, and longer maternity leaves for women. For instance, in Norway women are allowed the options of 10months of maternity leave, where they will get 100% of their pay, or 12months leave, where they will only paid 80% of their earnings. Some companies are realizing the effect the double burden of work and a family is having on their employees and are offering flexible work schedules in order to help their employees cope. Not only do these <b>flexible</b> <b>hours</b> help the employee deal with their stress, but it also benefits the company because workers are happier, less likely to be absent, more productive, and the turnover rate is lower for the company. As Sophia Mwangi says, [...] "Parenthood is a joy. Let us never be burdened by it but let's celebrate the joy that it brings. Celebrate those first steps or words, the first school play, their graduation day, passing those exams, landing their first job, getting married, making you grandparents. Whatever it is, let's celebrate our children. It's not easy, but the art of juggling can always be mastered!" ...|$|E

To illustrate her concerns, she said that Russian doctors were poorly paid and had low status and that this was the result of having an almost entirely female workforce (rather than it being a reflection of Russian 20th century political history). She then drew a parallel between doctors and teachers, saying: [...] "Years ago, teaching was a male-dominated profession - and look what happened to teaching". She later clarified her comments, explaining that her intention had been to warn that unless provision was made for female doctors to balance work and family life and be given extra support with childcare and <b>flexible</b> <b>hours,</b> they would tend not to enter what she called [...] "the more demanding" [...] branches of medicine or to serve on government committees.|$|E

40|$|Objectives The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the relationship between <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> and work-life balance in the educational sector in Finland. Furthermore, researching this {{main objective}} was done by analyzing and critically reviewing the literature on the flexibility and work-life balance, by interviewing teachers about their work flexibility and by theoretically analyzing and by interpreting the data gathered from the interviews. Summary This study examines the perceived impact of <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> on work-life balance in the educational sector in Finland. The literature review explains the history and development of work-life balance practices and flexible working arrangements. It talks about teaching as a profession and reveals the perceived teacher workload and work-life balance. Furthermore, a qualitative research was conducted in Finland which aimed to provide new, in-depth information and understanding about the relationship between <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> and work-life balance. Conclusions The findings of the research indicated that the perceived teacher work-life balance in Finland is satisfactory. However, teacher workload has increased significantly. Teachers’ work is also very seasonal since there are busier periods such as exam weeks, which increase considerably work, stress and pressure. Therefore, work-life balance fluctuates as well as the amount of flexibility. One finding is that teachers perceived <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> to be a positive thing. However, it was found that flexibility is more beneficial for the work life than for the non-work life. <b>Flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> can be risky since flexibility can easily lead to work colonializing the other aspects of life. Therefore, <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> do not necessarily affect positively work-life balance. In addition, strategies were found to have a decisive role when utilizing <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> to maintain a good work-life balance...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine whether}} any {{impairments}} {{in health and}} social lives can be found under different kinds of <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours,</b> and whether such effects are related to specific characteristics of these working hours. METHODS: Two studies - a company based survey (N= 660) and an internet survey (N= 528) - have been conducted. The first one was a questionnaire study (paper and pencil) on employees working under some 'typical' kinds of different flexible working time arrangements in different companies and different occupational fields (health care, manufacturing, retail, administration, call centres). The second study was an internet-based survey, using an adaptation of the questionnaire from the first study. RESULTS: The results of both studies consistently show that high variability of working hours is associated with increased impairments in health and well-being and {{this is especially true}} if this variability is company controlled. These effects are less pronounced if variability is self-controlled; however, autonomy does not compensate the effects of variability. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for an appropriate design of <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> should be developed in order to minimize any impairing effects on health and psychosocial well-being; these recommendations should include - besides allowing for discretion in controlling one's (<b>flexible)</b> working <b>hours</b> - that variability in <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> should be kept low (or at least moderate), even if this variability is self-controlled...|$|R
