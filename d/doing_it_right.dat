500|$|The main cast was put {{together}} {{through a process of}} auditions and readings. Actors often did not know whether Chase liked their performances or not. Michael Imperioli, who beat out several actors for the part of Christopher Moltisanti, recalls [...] "He's got a poker face, so I thought he wasn't into me, and he kept giving me notes and having me try it again, which often is a sign that you're not <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>right.</b> I thought, I'm not getting this. So he said, 'Thank you,' and I left. I didn't expect to hear back. And then they called." [...] Chase also said he wanted Imperioli because he had been in Goodfellas. James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film True Romance. Lorraine Bracco, who had played the role of mob wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas, was originally asked {{to play the role of}} Carmela Soprano. She took the role of Dr. Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. Tony Sirico, who has a criminal background, signed on to play Paulie Walnuts as long as his character was not to be a [...] "rat".|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was hugely {{successful}} upon its release on September 24, 1991. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard charts, {{and went on to}} sell thirteen million copies worldwide. The unexpected success instantly turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: [...] "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'" [...] Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was [...] "too high, too far, too soon. Everything seemed to be happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it." [...] He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to hear voices in his head telling him [...] "you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now." [...] Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism; however, [...] "by the age of twenty, I started <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls. To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star." [...] He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform, but left for California the next morning; according to the guitarist, [...] "it was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer. It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, but just the direction it was going." [...] He was replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the {{executives}} {{involved in the}} botched transition and later changes subsequently left NBC. Zucker was fired by Comcast Executive Vice President Steve Burke, but stressed that the late-night conflict was not to blame, but rather Comcast's insistence to install their own team. Marc Graboff opted to leave his contract early that November, as did Gaspin. While O'Brien admitted in 2012 that he occasionally still felt resentment over the events that transpired, he noted that [...] "I had an amazing partnership with NBC and was very disappointed at the outcome, but I didn't feel entitled to Late Night or Tonight or to the TBS show. If you're in this business and haven't experienced profound pain at some point, you're not <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>right.</b> I strongly believe that." [...] He has had no contact with Leno, noting [...] "the odds are we will both leave this Earth without speaking to each other, which is fine. There's really nothing to say. We both know the deal.

60|$|MY DEAR BURROUGHS,--As you {{describe}} me I can picture myself as I was 20 years ago. The portrait is correct. You think I have grown some; upon my word {{there was room}} for it. You have described a callow fool, a self-sufficient ass, a mere human tumble-bug.... imagining that he is remodeling the world and is entirely capable of <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>right.</b> Ignorance, intolerance, egotism, self-assertion, opaque perception, dense and pitiful chuckle-headedness--and an almost pathetic unconsciousness of it all.

Doubtless, in so clear and filial a heart there must have dwelt the perennial feeling of silent worship; which silent feeling, as we have seen, he was eager enough to express by all good ways of utterance; zealously adopting such appointed forms and creeds as the dignitaries of the World had fixed upon and solemnly named recommendable; prostrating his heart in such Church, by such accredited rituals and seemingly fit or half-fit methods, as his poor time and country had to offer him,--not rejecting the said methods till they stood convicted of palpable unfitness and then <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> gently withal, rather letting them drop as pitiably dead for him, than angrily hurling them out of doors as needing to be killed. By few Englishmen of his epoch had the thing called Church of England been more loyally appealed to as a spiritual mother.|$|E
