5|$|Women's {{health is}} an issue which has been taken up by many feminists, <b>especially</b> <b>where</b> {{reproductive}} health is concerned and the international women's movement was responsible {{for much of the}} adoption of agendas to improve women's health.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, <b>especially</b> <b>where</b> natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, {{blackbuck}} numbers declined sharply due {{to excessive}} hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation. Some blackbucks are killed illegally <b>especially</b> <b>where</b> they are sympatric with nilgai. Until India's independence in 1947, blackbuck and chinkara were hunted in many princely states with specially trained captive Asiatic cheetahs. By the 1970s, blackbuck were extinct in several areas. Nevertheless, populations in India have increased from 24,000 {{in the late}} 1970s to 50,000 in 2001.|$|E

5|$|It {{occurs in}} a wide variety of habitats, {{including}} riparian woodlands such as river red gum, bimble box and black box with an understory of lignum or saltbush; mallee woodland, <b>especially</b> <b>where</b> mixed with thickets of Broombush or Emu Bush; woodlands of Native Pine growing on sand ridges; and semi-arid scrubland dominated by Acacia including lancewood. On the coast The striped honeyeater is found in swamp forests of paperbark and Casuarina, and in developed areas containing native and exotic trees and shrubs such as caravan parks, reserves, gardens, and farms and orchards.|$|E
5|$|Mycena aurantiomarginata uses a tetrapolar mating system, whereby genes at two {{different}} locations on the chromosomes regulate sexual compatibility, or mating type. This system prevents self-fertilization and ensures {{a high degree}} of genotypic diversity. When the fungal mycelia is grown in culture on a petri dish, the colonies are white, odorless, and typically have a central patch of congested aerial hyphae that grow upward from the colony surface, which abruptly become flattened to submerged, and occasionally form faint zone lines. The hyphae commonly form deposits of tiny amorphous crystals where they contact other mycelial fronts, <b>especially</b> <b>where</b> the hyphae are vegetatively incompatible and destroy each other by lysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is {{primarily}} terrestrial, but occasionally arboreal, <b>especially</b> <b>where</b> {{it occurs in}} forest. Typically it inhabits neglected areas of scrub, termite mounds, abandoned burrows and rock crevices. It is adapted to terrain ranging from savannah and woodland to rocky slopes and dense forests. The black mamba prefers moderately dry environments such as light woodland and scrub, rocky outcrops, and semi-arid dry savannah, to dense forest or arid desert.|$|E

5|$|Architecture in Croatia {{reflects}} {{influences of}} bordering nations. Austrian and Hungarian influence {{is visible in}} public spaces and buildings {{in the north and}} in the central regions, architecture found along coasts of Dalmatia and Istria exhibits Venetian influence. Large squares named after culture heroes, well-groomed parks, and pedestrian-only zones, are features of these orderly towns and cities, <b>especially</b> <b>where</b> large scale Baroque urban planning took place, for instance in Osijek (Tvrđa), Varaždin and Karlovac. Subsequent influence of the Art Nouveau was reflected in contemporary architecture. Along the coast, the architecture is Mediterranean with a strong Venetian and Renaissance influence in major urban areas exemplified in works of Giorgio da Sebenico and Niccolò Fiorentino such as the Cathedral of St. James in Šibenik.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia inflorescences {{attract a}} variety of birds to the garden. Tough enough {{to be used as}} a street plant in parts of Sydney, B.ericifolia is a fairly easy plant to grow in the {{conditions}} it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, like most eastern banksias As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia ericifolia is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high pH. This can happen <b>especially</b> <b>where</b> soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Josquin's {{earliest}} chansons {{were probably}} composed in northern Europe, {{under the influence}} of composers such as Ockeghem and Busnois. Unlike them, however, he never adhered strictly to the conventions of the formes fixes– the rigid and complex repetition patterns of the rondeau, virelai, and ballade– instead he often wrote his early chansons in strict imitation, a feature they shared with many of his sacred works. He {{was one of the first}} composers of chansons to make all voices equal parts of the texture; and many of his chansons contain points of imitation, in the manner of motets. However he did use melodic repetition, <b>especially</b> <b>where</b> the lines of text rhymed, and many of his chansons had a lighter texture, as well as a faster tempo, than his motets.|$|E

5|$|Predators of the {{tawny owl}} include large birds such as Ural owls, eagle owls, {{northern}} goshawks, golden eagles, and common buzzards. Pine martens may raid nests, <b>especially</b> <b>where</b> artificial nest boxes make the owls easy to find, and several instances {{have been recorded}} of Eurasian jackdaws building nests {{on top of a}} brooding female tawny owl leading to the death of the adult and chicks. A Danish study showed that predation by mammals, especially red foxes, was an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young, with 36% dying between fledging and independence. The mortality risk increased with fledging date from 14% in April to more than 58% in June, and increasing predation of late broods may be an important selective agent for early breeding in this species.|$|E
