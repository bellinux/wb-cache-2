5|$|On April 25, 1935 at 6:43pm, a {{custodial}} engineer {{called the}} Salem Fire Department to report smoke. Citizens helped to remove {{items from the}} smoky building, but when firefighters arrived, they ordered everyone to leave the structure, which was soon engulfed in flame. Among the helping citizens was twelve-year-old Mark Hatfield, who later became governor. It was determined the fire started <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east wing and quickly spread to piles of old records. A strong updraft in the hollow columns enclosing the dome's eight supporting steel lattice girders pulled the flames through the rotunda to upper stories.

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 7November 1974, the children's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was bludgeoned to death <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lucan family home. Lady Lucan was also attacked; she later {{identified}} Lucan as her assailant. As the police began their murder investigation, Lucan telephoned his mother, asking her to collect the children, and then drove a borrowed Ford Corsair to a friend's house in Uckfield, East Sussex. Hours later, he left the property and vanished without trace. The car was found abandoned in Newhaven, its interior stained with blood and its boot containing a piece of bandaged lead pipe similar to one found at the crime scene. A warrant for Lucan's arrest was issued a few days later, and in his absence the inquest into Rivett's death named him as her murderer, the last occasion in Britain a coroner's court did so.|$|E
5|$|Ralston, however, finally heeded {{the calls}} for action and {{declared}} martial law to protect the city and to force {{an end to the}} strike.
