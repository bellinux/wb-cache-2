5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms.

Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop <b>falls</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> pond, and both the spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E
