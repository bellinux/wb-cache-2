5|$|For {{the open}} office of {{district}} attorney, vacated by Dilworth {{when he ran}} for mayor, the Democrats nominated city councilman Victor H. Blanc against the Republicans' Wilhelm F. Knauer. Blanc, a veteran of both World Wars and former assistant district attorney, had been elected to city council in an at-large seat in 1951. During his time on the council, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> an investigation into corruption in construction at Philadelphia International Airport. Knauer, a state deputy attorney general, was a long-time Republican party leader. His wife, Virginia Knauer, would later be elected to city council. As in the mayor's race, the Democrats were victorious, and Blanc was elected. His vote totals led the Democratic ticket, exceeding even Dilworth's numbers.|$|E

5|$|In 1291, he {{came under}} Tatar {{suzerainty}} and in 1292 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> an unsuccessful campaign against neighbouring Serbia. Even though the Serbs captured Vidin in their counter-offensive, perhaps thanks to Tatar influence Shishman was placed once {{more as the}} ruler of the region, this time as a Serbian vassal. However, he continued to rule his lands largely independently. As his son and successor as despot of Vidin Michael Shishman acceded to the Bulgarian throne in 1323, Shishman was the progenitor of the last medieval Bulgarian royal dynasty, the Shishman dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Ivan the Russian {{rose to a}} high rank in the Bulgarian {{military}} {{in the wake of}} the accession of Michael Shishman to the throne.

5|$|Oskar Gröning (sometimes transliterated as Oscar Groening in English; born 10 June 1921) is a German former SS junior squad {{leader who}} was {{stationed}} at Auschwitz concentration camp. His responsibilities included counting and sorting the money taken from prisoners, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the personal property prisoners had arrived with. On a few occasions he witnessed the procedures of mass-killing in the camp. After being transferred from Auschwitz to a combat unit in October 1944, Gröning {{was captured by}} the British on 10 June 1945 when his unit surrendered. He was eventually transferred to Britain as {{a prisoner of war}} and worked as a forced labourer.|$|E
5|$|The Minister of Finance (Da sinong 大司農) {{was also}} called the Grand Minister of Agriculture, and before 144 BC, was known as Clerk of the Capital for Grain (Zhisu neishi 治粟內史). This {{minister}} was the central government's treasurer for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces. While the Chancellor drafted the state budget, the Minister of Finance was responsible for funding it. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> storing the poll taxes, which were gathered in coin cash, and land tax, which was gathered {{as a proportion of}} farmers' annual crop yields. He was also responsible for setting the standards for units of measurement. In addition to reviewing tax collections, he could implement policies for price control exacted on certain commercial commodities.|$|E
5|$|Uanna {{also looked}} after {{security}} at other bases {{that might be}} used by the 509th in an emergency, such as Iwo Jima. He supervised the loading of the Little Boy bomb into the Enola Gay, and during the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> a communications center on Iwo Jima that relayed messages back to Tinian. He was therefore {{one of the first people}} to know that Hiroshima was the target, and that it had been attacked. After the subsequent unconditional surrender of Japan, he accompanied the Manhattan Project team sent to survey the damage, spending four weeks in Nagasaki.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, in 1808, he {{was offered}} the {{position}} of First Squire of the Emperor in Napoleon's Military Household, a dignity that offered an annual revenue of 30,000 Francs and which gained importance when the Grand Squire, General Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt, was sent to Saint-Petersburg as ambassador. Napoleon allegedly chose Nansouty for his elegant manners and education, aristocratic posture and talent for administration. In his capacity as First Squire, Nansouty thus had to accompany the Emperor during the latter's short campaign in Spain (from November 1808 to early January 1809). There, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> several administrative tasks linked with managing the Emperor's stable services and suite and commanding his orderly officers. The Emperor's aides-de-camp had their own aides-de-camp, who were also placed {{under the command of}} the First Squire. Although never very far away from the Emperor in a campaign that included many battles, Nansouty himself never exercised a field command during this campaign, and in January 1809, he accompanied his master back to France, as the outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition was imminent.|$|E
5|$|Billy Bonds is {{the only}} manager to have managed both clubs. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> West Ham from February 1990 to August 1994, {{managing}} the club for 227 games as the team yo-yoed between the First and Second divisions. He guided them to two promotions and one relegation. He resigned in August 1994. He was appointed as Millwall manager in May 1997 by chairman Theo Paphitis— an unpopular decision with many Lions fans due to his West Ham allegiance. Bonds, from south London, had several family members who were Millwall fans; a fact which meant some supporters felt he {{should be given a}} chance. After a good start, the team narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 18th in the Second Division. Bonds was sacked in May 1998, having been in charge of the side for only 53 games.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Jeffries was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Citizens Military Force on 22 August 1914. By this time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the survey department at the Abermain Collieries, but was mobilised for home defence duties and the instruction of volunteers for the newly raised Australian Imperial Force at Newcastle and Liverpool camps. Promoted lieutenant in the Citizens Military Force in July 1915, he transferred to the Australian Imperial Force on 1 February 1916 with the substantive rank of second lieutenant, and was placed in command of C Company of the 34th Battalion. In May, the battalion embarked from Sydney for the United Kingdom, with Jeffries aboard HMAT Hororata. Arriving in late June, the battalion spent the next five months training in England, during which time Jeffries was promoted to lieutenant.|$|E

5|$|Henry D. Smyth was a {{professor}} of physics {{and chairman of the}} physics department of Princeton University from 1935 to 1949. During World War II, he was involved in the Manhattan Project from early 1941, initially {{as a member of the}} National Defense Research Committee’s Committee on Uranium, and later as an associate director of the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. In late 1943, the President of Princeton University, Harold W. Dodds, began insisting that Smyth work part-time at Princeton, where there was a shortage of physicists because so many of them were engaged in war work. Princeton had commitments to teach army and navy personnel, and he needed physicists like Smyth to meet those commitments. Smyth therefore became a consultant at Chicago, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> designing a nuclear reactor that used heavy water as a neutron moderator, and commuted from Princeton, working in Chicago on alternate weeks.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Parkinson {{was part}} of the Fiji Expeditionary Force. This was raised {{following}} a request from the Fijian government for military forces to support local police dealing with striking labourers and farmers. The force, numbering about 55 men and under the command of the then Major Edward Puttick, was based on Fiji for two months before returning home. Promoted to captain the following year, he spent two years in Dunedin instructing the Territorial Force artillery, before being posted to Auckland. There, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> harbour defences. In 1925, he was sent to a gunnery course in England and, for the following two years, was seconded to the Royal Artillery. He returned to New Zealand in 1927, accompanied by his wife Barbara Waiohine Howe, who he had married in Birmingham on 30 August the previous year. A series of staff and instructional postings in Wellington, and then Auckland, followed. He was promoted to major in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Lukis {{went on to}} lead No.1 Squadron in {{the early}} 1930s, and was {{promoted}} to group captain in 1938.

He later held forward commands in the South West Pacific theatre, including Northern Area (later North-Eastern Area), for which he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and No.9 Operational Group (later Northern Command). Lukis also served on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body, as Air Member for Personnel. After retirement from the Air Force in 1946, he became a manager with Australian National Airways, and was active in veterans' associations. He died in 1966 at the age of sixty-nine.|$|E
