40|$|The {{clinical}} skills remain {{crucial for}} effective patient care in today’s medical environment. Research works {{have shown that}} students lack clinical skills even after graduation. One reason which could be the cause is that the faculty is unable to evaluate the students on the clinical <b>skills</b> <b>exam,</b> if the student is informed {{about the significance of}} clinical skills and about a certification exam structure which not only evaluates the student on a theory exam section but also on a clinical <b>skills</b> <b>exam</b> section, this may lead to increase focus and practice of the clinical skills more often by the students, not because the training program requires it but also because the certification they are about to appear for consist of a clinical exam section along with a theory exam section.

The most significant approach of evaluating clinical skills is by direct observation of the student performing the clinical skills. Eventually clinical skills training can be put to test by finally challenging a certification exam by the student which evaluates the students not only on a theory exam but also on a clinical <b>skills</b> <b>exam,</b> this will not only motivate the student to work harder on the clinical <b>skills</b> <b>exam</b> but will also encourage the student to learn and practice the skills to a level that it can be performed on the clinical <b>skills</b> <b>exam.</b> The student can then perform the clinical skills in the direct observation of a qualified evaluator who can then document the results for the clinical <b>skills</b> <b>exam.</b> Research works have shown that clinical skills are deficient in students who perform least in the direct observation of the faculty member in training period; this may sometimes lead to not passing the clinical <b>skills</b> <b>exam</b> on the certification.

40|$|Background: The {{assessment}} of medical students {{is a complicated}} process with medical schools ‎making constant updates. This ensures that assessment is not only comprehensive and robust, but ‎also standardised and fair. Nowadays, there is more stress laid upon the importance of formative ‎assessment in medical schools. ‎Introduction: Some University of Nottingham students undertake their final year surgical ‎placement at the Lincoln County Hospital. Each rotation has 6 students and runs over 9 weeks ‎with an <b>exam</b> <b>skills</b> workshop being conducted in the final week of the placement as a formative ‎assessment tool. The workshop is a 6 station OSCE conducted using real patients and a number ‎of examiners with varying levels of experience. Candidates have 7 minutes to perform the ‎allocated task in each station, followed by 2 minutes for the examiner to give feedback to the ‎candidate about his/her performance in that particular station. ‎Objective: To assess the importance of an <b>exam</b> <b>skills</b> workshop as a formative tool for final year ‎medical students {{at the end of}} their surgical placement at the Lincoln County Hospital. ‎Method: All the candidates were asked to complete an anonymous post-exam questionnaire. The ‎results were tabulated on an excel database and then analysed. Student performance in the ‎summative (annual) OSCE was compared against those Nottingham students who had not ‎attended the workshop (control group). ‎Results: 24 students attended the workshop during the course of the academic year (2010 - 2011). ‎‎ 75 % of them felt that it was reflective of the summative OSCE. 16 % of the students felt that the ‎examiners were not being strict with time-keeping in the <b>exam</b> <b>skills</b> workshop, which made this ‎less reflective of the annual OSCE where time-keeping is strict. All the students felt that this ‎experience would help them in coping better with the summative OSCE as they now had an idea ‎about what to expect on the day. Pass rate in the annual OSCE for the students who attended ‎the <b>exam</b> <b>skills</b> workshop was 100 % as compared to 83 % for the control group (p-value 0. 0197). ‎Limitations: The results are limited by the small number of students who were exposed to this ‎workshop. Another difficulty is ascertaining the extent that the <b>exam</b> <b>skills</b> workshop ‎contributed to the student’s overall success in the summative OSCE. ‎Conclusion: The use of a formative assessment, an <b>exam</b> <b>skills</b> workshop, is valued by students. ‎An <b>exam</b> <b>skills</b> workshop may improve performance in summative assessment. Further research ‎that identifies and controls for confounding factors is needed to confirm this observation. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{construct}} an inexpensive, convenient, and portable attachment for smartphones for {{the acquisition of}} still and live retinal images. Methods. A small optical device {{based on the principle}} of direct ophthalmoscopy was designed to be magnetically attached to a smartphone. Representative images of normal and pathological fundi were taken with the device. Results. A field-of-view up to ~ 20 ° was captured at a clinical resolution for each fundus image. The cross-polarization technique adopted in the optical design dramatically diminished corneal Purkinje reflections, making it possible to screen patients even through undilated pupils. Light emission proved to be well within safety limits. Conclusions. This optical attachment is a promising, inexpensive, and valuable alternative to the direct ophthalmoscope, potentially eliminating problems of poor <b>exam</b> <b>skills</b> and inexperienced observer bias. Its portability, together with the wireless connectivity of smartphones, presents a promising platform for screening and telemedicine in nonhospital settings. Translational Relevance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Learning {{to perform}} pelvic and breast {{examinations}} produces anxiety for many medical students. Clerkship directors have long sought strategies {{to help students}} become comfortable with the sensitive nature of these examinations. Incorporating standardized patients, simulation and gynecologic teaching associates (GTAs) are approaches gaining widespread use. However, there is a paucity of literature guiding optimal approach and timing. Our primary objective was to survey obstetrics and gynecology (Ob/Gyn) clerkship directors regarding timing and methods for teaching and assessment of pelvic and breast examination skills in United States medical school curricula, and to assess clerkship director satisfaction with current educational strategies at their institutions. METHODS: Ob/Gyn clerkship directors from all 135 Liaison Committee on Medical Education accredited allopathic United States medical schools were invited to complete an anonymous 15 -item web-based questionnaire. RESULTS: The response rate was 70 %. Pelvic and breast examinations are most commonly taught during {{the second and third}} years of medical school. Pelvic examinations are primarily taught during the Ob/Gyn and Family Medicine (FM) clerkships, while breast examinations are taught during the Ob/Gyn, Surgery and FM clerkships. GTAs teach pelvic and breast examinations at 72 and 65 % of schools, respectively. Over 60 % of schools use some type of simulation to teach examination skills. Direct observation by Ob/Gyn faculty is used to evaluate pelvic <b>exam</b> <b>skills</b> at 87 % of schools and breast <b>exam</b> <b>skills</b> at 80 % of schools. Only 40 % of Ob/Gyn clerkship directors rated pelvic examination training as excellent, while 18 % rated breast examination training as excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic and breast examinations are most commonly taught during the Ob/Gyn clerkship using GTAs, simulation trainers and clinical patients, and are assessed by direct faculty observation during the Ob/Gyn clerkship. While the majority of Ob/Gyn clerkship directors were not highly satisfied with either pelvic or breast examination training programs, they were less likely to describe their breast examination training programs as excellent as compared to pelvic examination training-overall suggesting an opportunity for improvement. The survey results will be useful in identifying future challenges in teaching such skills in a cost-effective manner...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Third year medical {{students}} at UMass. Medical School {{have only a}} brief exposure to dermatology during their first two years, resulting in limited skills in dermatology physical diagnosis. While other skills of the physical exam – e. g. the cardiac exam, the abdominal exam – are taught in the first 2 years and are applied and refined with repetition and instruction during students’ clinical rotations, dermatology remains limited in its exposure and instruction during the third year. This may prevent students from gaining the needed physical diagnosis skills in this important clinical area. Given this scenario, a computer-assisted instruction module was created and beta-tested to improve students’ physical diagnosis skills in dermatology. Method:A computer-based dermatology physical diagnosis presentation was created using Microsoft PowerPoint to instruct third year {{medical students}} in dermatology physical <b>exam</b> <b>skills.</b> Each slide presented students with a dermatology physical exam finding, a brief description, and a picture. In order to test the students’ knowledge of dermatology physical exam findings, a 23 -item multiple-choice exam was created using XCom Exam Composer. 9 questions dealt with knowledge of verbal descriptions of lesions, while 14 questions dealt with the identification of lesions. The test was administered {{both before and after}} the presentation to 15 students taking a required 6 -week Family Medicine clerkship at UMass. Medical School. Results: 13 out of the 15 sampled students completed the curriculum. The average pre-test score was 18. 4 / 23 questions correct (80 %); the average post-test score was 20. 5 / 23 questions correct (89. 1 %) - with an average improvement of 2. 1 points (9. 1 %). These results (i. e., the increase in scores post-test) were statistically significant using both a parametric paired t-test (t = 2. 720; p=. 019) as well as a non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test to take the small sample size into account (z = 2. 508; p=. 012). Discussion: This computer-assisted instruction in dermatology significantly improved students’ physical <b>exam</b> <b>skills,</b> as measured by this multiple-choice exam. Informal comments were positive: students enjoyed the module, and appreciated the increased exposure to dermatology. Future studies are needed to evaluate student experience during this module, as well as their competence and confidence in diagnosing dermatologic lesions. Also, the Family Medicine Clerkship faculty intends to evaluate this module with a larger population of students, including those at different stages of their third year medical training, in order to examine the module’s effects. Furthermore, studies using a larger population are needed to evaluate the benefit and cost-effectiveness of this computer-assisted instruction program versus traditional book-based instruction...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} how often medical {{students are not}} allowed to perform gynecological examinations during their obstetrics-gynecology clerkship, identify the barriers to participation related to physicians and patients, explore the role of the supervisory physician in not allowing medical student involvement, and explore differences between male and female students' experiences. METHOD: All medical students entering their obstetrics-gynecology clerkship at a medical school in the Netherlands between May and October 2011 were invited to participate in this study's questionnaire, which asked them to report the number of gynecological examinations they were allowed and not allowed to perform during their clerkship. Eighteen questionnaire respondents participated in three focus groups. RESULTS: Of the 139 medical students invited, 76 (55 %) completed the questionnaire. Students reported a total of 2, 196 instances in which they were not allowed to participate in the examination; 89 % (n = 1, 956) were related to the supervisory physician. Qualitative data from the focus group interviews showed that female supervisory physicians prioritized patients' autonomy above students' learning needs. Furthermore, female students were less assertive than male students in asking the supervisory physician for permission to participate. CONCLUSIONS: The physician's role in not allowing student involvement is substantial and results in fewer opportunities for students to perform gynecological examinations. For students to develop the necessary gynecological <b>exam</b> <b>skills</b> during their clerkship, medical educators need to improve the learning environment...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} student {{beliefs of}} how anatomy education influenced their preparation for standardized clinical assessments and clinical skills. We conducted three annual surveys of {{students of the}} David Geffen School of Medicine (DGSOM) at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and students of the University of California, Riverside (UCR) /UCLA Thomas Haider Program in Biomedical Sciences from 2010 to 2012. Students were asked, “What specific knowledge or skills {{did you learn from}} your gross anatomy experience that helped you prepare for USMLE board exams, third-year clerkships, and physical examination skills?” All students who responded to the survey viewed anatomy as a highly valued part of the medical curriculum. Almost all students felt that anatomy knowledge in general was useful for their success with United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) exams, how they perceived their physical <b>exam</b> <b>skills,</b> and how they perceived their preparation for third- or fourth-year clerkships. On the other hand, when asked about how the anatomy curriculum helped prepare students for fourth-year clerkships, there was a downward trend over a three-year period with each subsequent class. Although anatomy is a highly valued part of the medical school experience, students value integration of the anatomical and clinical sciences, as evidenced by a perceived diminishing value of anatomy pedagogy taught outside of clinical context with subsequent classes over the course of three years...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the combined predictive validity of intelligence and personality factors on multiple measures of academic achievement. Students in a college {{of higher education in}} the Netherlands (N 0137) completed a survey that measured intelligence, the Big Five personality traits, motivation, and four specific personality traits. Student performance was measured with grade point average (GPA) and time to graduation, as well as with five specific performance measures: regular <b>exams,</b> <b>skills</b> training, team projects, internships, and a written thesis. Results show that 33 % of the variance in GPA and 30 % of the variance in time to graduation can be explained by combining intelligence, personality, and motivational predictors. Conscientiousness is the best predictor across a broad spectrum of academic achievement measures and explains five times as much variance in GPA as does intelligence. The practical implications are that institutes of higher education should collect personality data on students at the outset and then help students accordingly. Highly conscientious students who are organized and internally motivated might potentially be offered more challenging honours programs with corresponding special commendations on their diplomas, whereas students who score low on conscientious would receive more structure through student study groups, frequent deadlines, shorter assignments, group assignments, clearly defined learning goals, and less second chances for passing examinations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Point-of-care {{ultrasound}} (POCUS) {{is expanding}} across all medical specialties. As {{the benefits of}} US technology are becoming apparent, efforts to integrate US into pre-clinical medical education are growing. We report our efforts of integrating POCUS into the medical curriculum through a multi-disciplinary effort. Our objective is to describe our process of integrating POCUS as an educational tool into the medical school curriculum and how such efforts are perceived by students. Methods: This was a pilot study to introduce ultrasonography into the “blinded for peer review” curriculum to first and second year medical students.   Didactic and hands-on sessions were introduced to first year students during gross anatomy and to second year students in the physical exam course.   Student-perceived attitudes, understanding, and knowledge of US, and its applications to learning the physical exam were measured by a post-assessment survey. RESULTS: All 1 st year anatomy students (n= 176) participated in small group hands-on US sessions. In the 2 nd year physical diagnosis course, 38 students participated in 4 sessions.   All students (91 %) {{agreed or strongly agreed}} that additional US teaching should be incorporated throughout the 4 year medical school curriculum. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: POCUS can effectively be integrated into the existing medical school curriculum by utilizing didactic and small group hands-on sessions.  Medical students perceived US training as valuable in understanding human anatomy and in learning physical <b>exam</b> <b>skills.</b> This innovative program demonstrates US as an additional learning modality.   Future goals include expanding on this work to incorporate US education into all 4 years of medical school...|$|E
40|$|Education in women's {{health is}} now {{considered}} a core curricular component during residency training in Internal Medicine. There is potential for insufficient training in women's health for residents with a continuity clinic based at a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital. OBJECTIVE: To determine {{the impact of a}} 3 -year continuity clinic based at a VA hospital on residents' self-reported competencies in women's health. DESIGN: Cross sectional survey using an internal website. SETTING: University-based residency program in Ann Arbor, Michigan. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Comparison of residents with a VA clinic with residents with non-VA clinics (university and community) in self-reported competencies in knowledge base, counseling, and physical <b>exam</b> <b>skills</b> in the area of women's health. Responses were obtained from 66 % (n = 72) of eligible residents. When compared to residents with either a university hospital– or community-based clinic site, VA-based residents reported less confidence in the majority of competencies surveyed. Clinic site had the strongest impact in the knowledge base domain, accounting for between 17 % and 33 % of the variance in each specific competency. For estimated number of Pap smears and breast exams done in the prior year, VA-based residents reported doing, on average, less than 5 of each per year while non-VA residents reported doing between 11 and 20 of each exam. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that despite other clinical opportunities in women's health during ambulatory rotations, regular clinical experiences in women's health in the continuity clinic setting are necessary to improve education in this area...|$|E
