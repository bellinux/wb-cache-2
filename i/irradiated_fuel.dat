25|$|During {{refuelling}} {{operations on}} Reactor 2, an <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuel</b> element failed to {{release from the}} grab (this is used to hold an element while it is withdrawn from a reactor). Routine methods were used to release the grab. However, the <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuel</b> element snagged during the operation and was lifted out of its shielding resulting in the operators on the pile cap being exposed to the intense radiation being emitted from the <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuel</b> element. Personnel responded quickly, and the radiological dose they received was small.|$|E
25|$|During routine {{defuelling}} {{activities on}} Reactor 3, a basket containing twenty-four low rated irradiated Magnox fuel elements fell {{a few feet}} within the discharge machine onto {{the door at the}} top of the fuel discharge well. Remote TV camera inspections revealed that twelve of the elements had fallen just over 80ft (24.4m) down the discharge well into a water filled transport flask at the bottom. The NII initiated an investigation because dropping <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuel</b> elements is a serious issue even when, as in this event, BNFL had advised NII that there had been no release of radiological activity.|$|E
500|$|Neptunium is fissionable, {{and could}} {{theoretically}} {{be used as}} fuel in a fast neutron reactor or a nuclear weapon, with {{a critical mass of}} around 60 kilograms. In 1992, the U.S. Department of Energy declassified the statement that neptunium-237 [...] "can be used for a nuclear explosive device". It is not believed that an actual weapon has ever been constructed using neptunium. As of 2009, the world production of neptunium-237 by commercial power reactors was over 1000 critical masses a year, but to extract the isotope from <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuel</b> elements would be a major industrial undertaking.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNeutron {{radiography}} of <b>irradiated</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> {{provides more}} comprehensive {{information about the}} internal condition of <b>irradiated</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> than any other non-destructive technique to date. Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has multiple nuclear fuels research and development programs that routinely evaluate <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuels</b> using neutron radiography. The Neutron Radiography reactor (NRAD) sits beneath a shielded hot cell facility where neutron radiography and other evaluation techniques are performed on these highly radioactive objects. The NRAD currently uses the foil-film transfer technique for imaging fuel that is time consuming but provides high spatial resolution. This paper describes the NRAD and hot cell facilities, the current neutron radiography capabilities available at INL, planned upgrades to the neutron imaging systems, and new facilities being brought online at INL related to neutron imaging...|$|R
500|$|Construction on B Reactor {{began in}} August 1943 and was {{completed}} on September 13, 1944. The reactor went critical in late September and, after overcoming nuclear poisoning, produced its first plutonium on November 6, 1944. Plutonium {{was produced in}} the Hanford reactors when a uranium-238 atom in a fuel slug absorbed a neutron to form uranium-239. U-239 rapidly undergoes beta decay to form neptunium-239, which rapidly undergoes a second beta decay to form plutonium-239. The <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuel</b> slugs were transported by rail to three huge remotely operated chemical separation plants called [...] "canyons" [...] that were about [...] away. A series of chemical processing steps separated {{the small amount of}} plutonium that was produced from the remaining uranium and the fission waste products. This first batch of plutonium was refined in the 221-T plant from December 26, 1944, to February 2, 1945, and delivered to the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico on February 5, 1945.|$|E

50|$|The reactor uses a plutonium-uranium mixed carbide {{fuel and}} liquid sodium as a coolant. The fuel is an {{indigenous}} mix of 70 percent plutonium carbide and 30 percent uranium carbide.

40|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of <b>irradiated</b> nuclear <b>fuels</b> is usually extrapolated {{from the data}} acquired on fresh ceramics, incorporating in the formulation a burn-up dependency. However, the burn-up parameter covers several recoverable or not recoverable mechanisms. This methodology could be justified for low burn-up, but is no more applicable at high burn-up, mainly in case of recristallization. An example {{is the effect of}} the addition of plutonium in UO 2. The common understanding is that the lower conductivity of the fresh MOX {{is a result of the}} differences in size and mass between the U and Pu atoms. However, this interpretation does not take into account the impact of the Pu valence, which leads to local fluctuations in stoichiometry in heterogeneous MOX, which in turn has a strong impact on the {{thermal conductivity}}. For unirradiated fuels, neglecting the effect of the stoichiometry fluctuations has no impact on the accuracy of the thermal conductivity correlations, because their parameters are adjusted to reproduce the experimental results which are available in sufficient number. However, when extrapolated to <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuels,</b> these correlations overestimate the effect of Pu because the oxygen distribution evolves differently between plutonium rich agglomerates, matrix and coating phase. The use of an appropriate model is strongly needed in interpreting experimental data, as far as the number of available characterizations is small, and their interpretation tricky. The investigation of the Pu and stoichiometry effects combines experimental results obtained on <b>irradiated</b> <b>fuels</b> at ITU and also in-pile temperature measurements conduced for EDFJRC.
