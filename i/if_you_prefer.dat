25|$|In the Dialogi de Vita Martini I, 26 by Sulpicius Seuerus (AD 363–425), {{one of the}} {{partners}} in the dialogue utters the rhetorical commonplace that his deficient Latin might insult the ears of his partners. One of them answers: uel Celtice aut si mauis Gallice loquere dummodo Martinum loquaris ‘speak Celtic or, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> Gaulish, {{as long as you}} speak about Martin’.|$|E
25|$|Niggle's yearnings after {{truth and}} beauty (God's creations) are echoed in his great painting; after death, Niggle is rewarded with the {{realisation}} (the making-real) of his yearning. Or, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> Niggle's Tree always existed – he simply echoed {{it in his}} art. From a metanarrative viewpoint, Tolkien's Arda is itself a subcreation designed to honour the true stories of the real world. Thus, the Middle-earth legendarium, despite its lack of overt religious elements, {{can be interpreted as}} a profoundly religious work.|$|E
500|$|Jack Garner of the Democrat and Chronicle {{gave the}} film {{a rating of}} 8 out of 10, {{concluding}} that he was pleasantly surprised at the documentary's entertainment value. He described it as educational, despite Fucks repetitive use of the word. In The Boston Globe Wesley Morris commented that the director's flippant style was beneficial, enabling him to make serious educational points to the audience. Sally Foster of Film Threat said that {{the crux of the}} film was the debate about freedom of speech, and that the film was funny and thought-provoking. A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: [...] "Mr. Anderson's movie is staged as a talking-head culture-war skirmish between embattled upholders of propriety (or repression, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer)</b> and proponents of free expression (or filth), but its real lesson is that the two sides depend upon each other. Or rather, that the continued vitality of the word—its unique ability to convey emphasis, relieve stress, shock grown-ups and function as adverb, noun, verb, intensifier and what linguists call 'infix'—rests on its ability to mark an edge between the permissible and the profane". In the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that the documentary was an amusing film and an educational commentary on the word. According to Glenn Garvin of The Miami Herald, the film was an expansive merging of perspectives from politics, history and culture.|$|E

2500|$|In 1933 {{he conceded}} of his {{original}} formulation of the death drive 'the improbability of our speculations. [...] A queer instinct, indeed, directed {{to the destruction of}} its own organic home!'. [...] He wrote moreover that [...] "Our hypothesis is that there are two essentially different classes of instincts: the sexual instincts, understood in the widest sense—Eros, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> that name—and the aggressive instincts, whose aim is destruction". In 1937, he {{went so far as to}} suggest privately that 'We should have a neat schematic picture if we supposed that originally, at the beginning of life, all libido was directed to the inside and all aggressiveness to the outside'. [...] In his last writings, it was the contrast of [...] "two basic instincts, Eros and the destructive instinct [...] our two primal instincts, Eros and destructiveness, on which he laid stress. [...] Nevertheless, his belief in [...] "the death instinct [...] a return to an earlier state [...] into an inorganic state" [...] continued to the end.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{interpreted}} the words [...] "sufficient for his need, whatever is lacking for him" [...] in [...] {{to teach the}} level to which the community must help an impoverished person. Based on these words, the Rabbis taught in a Baraita that if an orphan applied to the community for assistance to marry, the community must rent a house, supply a bed and necessary household furnishings, {{and put on the}} wedding, as [...] says, [...] "sufficient for his need, whatever is lacking for him." [...] The Rabbis {{interpreted the}} words [...] "sufficient for his need" [...] to refer to the house, [...] "whatever is lacking" [...] to refer to a bed and a table, and [...] "for him ( [...] , lo)" [...] to refer to a wife, as [...] uses the same term, [...] "for him ( [...] , lo)," [...] to refer to Adam's wife, whom [...] calls [...] "a helpmate for him." [...] The Rabbis taught that the words [...] "sufficient for his need" [...] command us to maintain the poor person, but not to make the poor person rich. But the Gemara interpreted the words [...] "whatever is lacking for him" [...] to include even a horse to ride upon and a servant to run before the impoverished person, if that was what the particular person lacked. The Gemara told that once Hillel bought for a certain impoverished man from an affluent family a horse to ride upon and a servant to run before him, and once when Hillel could not find a servant to run before the impoverished man, Hillel himself ran before him for three miles. The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that once the people of Upper Galilee bought a pound of meat every day for an impoverished member of an affluent family of Sepphoris. Rav Huna taught that they bought for him a pound of premium poultry, or <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> the amount of ordinary meat that they could buy with a pound of money. Rav Ashi taught that the place was such a small village with so few buyers for meat that every day they had to waste a whole animal just to provide for the pauper's needs. Once when a pauper applied to Rabbi Nehemiah for support, Rabbi Nehemiah asked him of what his meals consisted. The pauper told Rabbi Nehemiah that he had been used to eating well-marbled meat and aged wine. Rabbi Nehemiah asked him whether he could get by with Rabbi Nehemiah on a diet of lentils. The pauper consented, joined Rabbi Nehemiah on a diet of lentils, and then died. Rabbi Nehemiah lamented that he had caused the pauper's death by not feeding him the diet to which he had been accustomed, but the Gemara answered that the pauper himself was responsible for his own death, for he should not have allowed himself to become dependent on such a luxurious diet. Once when a pauper applied to Rava for support, Rava asked him of what his meals consisted. The pauper told Rava that he had been used to eating fattened chicken and aged wine. Rava asked the pauper whether he considered the burden on the community of maintaining such a lifestyle. The pauper replied that he was not eating what the community provided, but what God provided, as [...] says: [...] "The eyes of all wait for You, and You give them their food in due season." [...] As the verse does not say [...] "in their season" [...] (in the plural), but [...] "in His season" [...] (in the singular), it teaches that God provides every person the food that the person needs. Just then, Rava's sister, who had not seen him for 13 years, arrived with a fattened chicken and aged wine. Thereupon, Rava exclaimed at the coincidence, apologized to the pauper, and invited him to come and eat.|$|E
