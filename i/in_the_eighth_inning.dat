Manager Jim Leyland used Banister as a pinch hitter for pitcher Doug Drabek <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>inning</b> of that day's game against the Atlanta Braves at Three Rivers Stadium. Using Cecil Espy's bat, Banister hit a ball from Dan Petry and just beat shortstop Jeff Blauser's throw to first base.

Alexander finished with his second complete game of the series and gave up only two runs on eight hits, while striking out six batters. The three Yankee pitchers combined to give up thirteen hits, seven earned runs, three unearned runs, and one home run.|$|E

Tony Phillips led off the ninth for the Angels with a home run to avoid a shutout, but Johnson retired the next three Angels hitters to record his sixth complete game and 18th win of the season.|$|E
5|$|In an August 16 contest {{against the}} Marlins, Heyward hit {{two home runs}} for his first multi-home run game with the Cardinals.

With the bases loaded and no outs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>inning,</b> Addison Russell hit a fly ball that Heyward caught running and threw home to catcher Yadier Molina to tag out Anthony Rizzo by two steps, preserving a 4–3 win. In the second game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh on September 30, Heyward hit his second career grand slam in an 11–1 win, giving the Cardinals their 100th victory of the season while clinching their third consecutive National League Central division title. He also robbed both Francisco Cervelli and Michael Morse of hits in this game.|$|E
5|$|On September 25, manager Bruce Bochy {{decided to}} give Zito one final start with the Giants {{as a tribute to}} his tenure with the team. Zito responded by {{allowing}} two runs (one earned) over five innings and earning the win in a 7–4 victory over the Dodgers. However, because Zito was removed between innings during the Dodger game, Bochy sent him in to pitch in relief in the final game of the year so that Giants' fans could give him a standing ovation. Zito entered with two outs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>inning</b> on September 29 and struck out Mark Kotsay (playing his final game) as the Giants beat the Padres 7–6. He finished the 2013 season at 5–11 with a 5.74 ERA in 30 games, 25 of which were starts. Following the season, Zito took out a full-page ad in the San Francisco Chronicle thanking Giants fans for their support. The Giants declined Zito's 2014 option, buying it out for $7 million.|$|E

The Athletics took a lead in Game 4, as Carney Lansford hit a single that scored Willie McGee from second base. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>inning,</b> however, the Reds loaded the bases after singles by Barry Larkin and Herm Winningham, and an error that allowed Paul O'Neill to reach base. Larkin scored on a groundout and Winningham scored on a {{sacrifice}} fly to give Cincinnati the lead, 2–1. The lead held, as Myers came in for Rijo after one out in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the Reds became World Series champions. Bates did not play in either game.

5|$|For {{the sixth}} {{time in his}} major league career, Doby was named an All-Star during the 1954 season, one of five Indians named. The game was held at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium and {{featured}} the second-largest crowd to watch an All-Star Game (the largest was in 1935 at the same stadium). In what would prove his final career All-Star at bat, Doby hit a pinch-hit solo home run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>inning</b> {{to tie the game}} at 9–9; the AL squad went on to win, 11–9. His home run was the first hit by a black player in an All-Star Game. The game, which had a record 17 hits by the AL and was the highest-scoring All-Star Game until 1998, was called the best ever by All-Star Game founder Arch Ward. As the regular season resumed, Doby helped the Indians to win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant. His regular season 32 home runs and career-high 126 RBIs were highest in the AL, which led to him finishing second in AL MVP voting. The Indians were swept in the 1954 World Series by Doby's former Eagles teammate Monte Irvin and the New York Giants.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} seasons with White Sox, Pierce's control {{problems}} continued; his 137 walks in 1950 tied {{him for the}} fourth most ever by an AL left-hander. But those seasons also included indications of his developing excellence, {{as well as the}} struggles he would face in gaining run support. On May 29, 1949, in just his sixth start with Chicago (and the 11th of his career), the 22-year-old Pierce was matched against 42-year-old Negro league legend Satchel Paige in a road game against the defending World Series champion Cleveland Indians. The pitchers' duel went into the 11th inning, when Pierce walked leadoff hitter Ken Keltner, followed by two bunt singles. After Pierce was replaced by a reliever and the next batter lined to shortstop Luke Appling, Lou Boudreau singled to give Cleveland a 2–1 win; Pierce had himself scored Chicago's only run after singling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>inning.</b> And on June 15, 1950 against the World Series champion Yankees, Pierce got his first career shutout – a 5–0 one-hitter, interrupted by rain delays in the second, fourth and fifth innings totaling over an hour and a half, with the only hit being Billy Johnson's single in the fifth inning.|$|E

5|$|Loup pitched 1 {{innings of}} {{relief for the}} Blue Jays against the Cleveland Indians on Opening Day. On April 10, {{in a game against}} the Detroit Tigers, Loup {{recorded}} his first career win. On April 12, Loup recorded his first major league save in a game against the Kansas City Royals. He would later record a second major league save in a game against the San Diego Padres on June 2. On April 20, Loup committed a two-run throwing error in the eleventh inning against the New York Yankees. During the first two months of the Blue Jays' lackluster 2013 season, Loup and other relief pitchers helped to keep the Blue Jays from more defeats. Loup was the ninth and final pitcher in an eighteen-inning game against the Texas Rangers on June 8. The game, which was the longest in Blue Jays history, resulted in a win after Loup gained a pair of groundouts. In another game against the Rangers on June 14, Loup pitched <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>inning</b> and participated in a shutout. Loup ended the 2013 season with a 4–6 record, 2.47 ERA and 53 strikeouts in 69 innings.|$|E
5|$|López {{reached the}} playoffs as the Giants won the NL West {{for the first}} time since 2003. He made two {{appearances}} in the NLDS against the Atlanta Braves to face Jason Heyward, whom he struck out both times. The Giants won the series in four games. Against the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS, he made five appearances, all scoreless except for Game 4, in which he allowed a run. In the deciding Game 6, he pitched a scoreless seventh inning and was awarded with a win after Juan Uribe hit a game-winning home run against Ryan Madson <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>inning.</b> López made two appearances against the Texas Rangers in the 2010 World Series, striking out the two batters he faced. In Game 2, he struck out Josh Hamilton to end the top of the eighth inning with a runner on second and preserve a 2–0 lead, although the Giants went on to win 9–0. He won his second World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first World Series since 1954.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the fifth}} inning saw no more hits, and after a Keltner double, three Indians {{were out in the}} top of the sixth inning. The Red Sox began to fight back in the bottom of the sixth inning. After getting Pesky out, Ted Williams reached first base on an error by Gordon. Stephens struck out, and with two outs in the inning, Bobby Doerr hit his 27th home run of the season to make the score 6–3. No runs were scored in the seventh inning, though Bearden and Mitchell both reached base. The Indians were able to score another run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>inning</b> after Jim Hegan was {{intentionally}} walked. Bearden then hit a fly ball to Williams, who dropped it, allowing Hegan to score and making it 7–3 in the Indians' favor. The Indians were able to score one more run in the ninth when Robinson scored after Keltner grounded into a bases-loaded double play. Bearden got the final three Red Sox out in the bottom of the ninth, finishing the game with an 8–3 Indians victory and giving Bearden a complete game.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{acquisition}} of Coveleski, combined with winning the 1924 World Series, the Washington Senators were considered favorites to win the AL in 1925. During his first season in Washington, Coveleski bounced back from his 1924 season, and by mid-July, critics regarded his success as the biggest surprise in baseball; Cleveland considered him to be past his best. He won 20 games and lost five that year, and his ERA of 2.84 led the AL. Coveleski also finished 12th in MVP voting that year. The Senators won the AL and were to face the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1925 World Series, but Coveleski suffered from sore back muscles late in the season. Coveleski pitched two games in the World Series. In game two, he faced Vic Aldridge in a pitcher's duel; the teams were tied at one apiece <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>inning,</b> but a Pittsburgh home run led to a 3–2 loss. Aldridge and Coveleski faced off again in game five, and Coveleski allowed four runs in under seven innings, leading to a 6–3 Pirates win. The Senators lost the series in seven games, and he finished with a 3.77 ERA, five walks, three strikeouts, {{and two of the}} Senators' four losses.|$|E
5|$|From May 8 through July 24, Affeldt had a twentyeight inning {{scoreless}} streak. During the streak, on May 15, {{he struck}} out a seasonhigh four batters in an 86 loss to the Mets.

The streak did not end until July 28, when Brandon Medders allowed one of Affeldt's runners to score {{in a game against}} Pittsburgh. On August 2, with runners on first and second with one out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>inning</b> against the Philadelphia Phillies, he retired Chase Utley and Ryan Howard to help the Giants win 73. He won the final game of the season against San Diego by pitching two scoreless innings as the Giants won 43 in ten innings. Affeldt finished the season with a career best 1.73 ERA in seventyfour games. He was named tenth on one writer's ballot for MVP voting, placing him in a tie for twentyeighth on the list.

However, the Mets re-signed him to a two-year, $5 million contract on December 7. After spending two weeks in the minors, Mota rejoined the Mets on May 30, 2007. He struggled in his first 16 games, collecting a 7.71 ERA in them. In his next 15 games, however, he amassed a 1.89 ERA. During those games, on August 3, he was the winning pitcher when he threw a scoreless inning in a 6–2 victory over the Chicago Cubs. He struggled after that, though, as he had a 7.48 ERA over his final 21 games of the season. On August 28, he was the losing pitcher when he gave up a walk-off home run to Ryan Howard in the 10th inning of a 4–2 loss to Philadelphia. He earned the win on September 12 in a 4–3 victory over the Atlanta Braves despite losing a two-run lead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> <b>inning.</b> His final decision of the season came on September 16, when he gave up three runs without recording an out in a 10–6 loss to Philadelphia. Mota finished the season with a 2–2 record and a 5.76 ERA in 52 games. On November 20, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Johnny Estrada.|$|E
