25|$|Norrie {{disease can}} also have {{cognitive}} and behavioral symptoms. Developmental delay and mental retardation are present in about 30 to 50% of males who have Norrie disease. Psychotic-like features and poorly characterized behavior abnormalities may also be present. Auditory symptoms are common with Norrie disease. Progressive hearing loss starts in early childhood {{for a majority of}} males with the condition. <b>Early</b> <b>hearing</b> loss is sensorineural, mild and asymmetric. By adolescence, high-frequency hearing loss begins to appear. Hearing loss is severe, symmetric, and broad-spectrum by the age of 35. However, studies show that while the hearing loss is deteriorating, the ability to speak well is highly preserved. The slowly progressing hearing loss is more problematic to adjust to than the congenital blindness for most people with Norrie disease.|$|E
