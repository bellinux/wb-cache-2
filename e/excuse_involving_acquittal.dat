She says she needs to stay away from Chuck since her wedding is in a month. Chuck asks what {{happened}} since the crash and Blair dismisses it with an <b>excuse</b> <b>involving</b> the wedding. Louis mentions that Blair has been distant since the crash and he's becoming so jealous that he's thinking about hiring a private investigator.|$|R
40|$|The label 2 ̆ 7 defences 2 ̆ 7 {{can be used}} to {{describe}} a range of excusing or justificatory answers to a criminal charge, or as 2 ̆ 7 grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 2 ̆ 7, according to Article 31 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Defences are often categorized as excuses or justifications, with a justification being a challenge as to whether the act was wrongful and an <b>excuse</b> <b>involving</b> acceptance that the act was wrongful but seeking to avoid attribution of criminal responsibility. This chapter addresses defences to international crimes and is structured in two parts; the first considers those defences which have a counterpart in domestic criminal laws, such as duress, self-defence, mistake, or mental incapacity, and the second those defences which can be considered in some ways unique to international criminal law, such as superior orders and reprisal...|$|R
500|$|The {{situation}} at Vanity Fair deteriorated upon management's return. They {{sent out a}} memo forbidding the discussion of salaries {{in an attempt to}} rein in the staff. Benchley, Parker, and Sherwood responded with a memo of their own, followed by placards around their necks detailing their exact salaries for all to see. Management attempted to issue [...] "tardy slips" [...] for staff who were late. On one of these, Benchley wrote out, in very small handwriting, an elaborate <b>excuse</b> <b>involving</b> a herd of elephants on 44th Street. These issues contributed to a general deterioration of morale in the offices, culminating in Parker's termination, allegedly due to complaints by the producers of the plays she skewered in her theatrical reviews. Upon learning of her termination, Benchley tendered his own resignation. Word of it was published in Time by Alexander Woollcott, who was at a lunch with Benchley, Parker, and others. Given that Benchley had two children {{at the time of his}} resignation, Parker referred to it as [...] "the greatest act of friendship I'd ever seen." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Iranian network Press TV interviewed Webster Tarpley and Stephen Lendman, {{who both}} doubted the {{official}} story of bin Laden's death. Tarpley {{said he believed}} bin Laden {{had been dead for}} a long time. He also claimed that the public was deceived by a staged announcement. [...] Both Tarpley and Lendman suggested that Obama's announcement was also an <b>excuse</b> to <b>involve</b> the United States in wars with Pakistan and Middle Eastern nations.|$|R
5000|$|For the people, {{what we call}} {{dishonesty}} {{is taken}} for granted. What you should do is to ease its public intemperance with works showing that the national treasury is not going entirely to your pocket. [...] "To'úna pero toyapó", to use but to do something. Putting this condition, {{everything is going to}} go well. Another condition that clogs the evil of exploiting the common wealth is resorting to the <b>excuse</b> of <b>involving</b> others. [...] "To'una, anínte ho'upaitereí ha'eño; to porokonvidamimi", he who exploits common wealth should involve others in doing so, too.|$|R
50|$|The deputy laundress, Mrs. Fadget, treats Ellie badly, {{forcing her}} to work long hours without a break, and tries to suck up to Grace when Grace visits the laundry to make up excuses to drag Ellie out of her work to talk to her. (These <b>excuses</b> often <b>involve</b> {{numerous}} unwashed chemises and precious silk handkerchiefs that need scrubbing from ink stains.) In the 2nd book, Betrayal, Mrs. Fadget treats Ellie so badly she gets quinsey. While Grace is on a Captain Drake's ship, Mary Shelton cares for Ellie until Grace comes back with Lady Sarah. By that time Ellie is much better.|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} at the Court of Appeal, Moldaver was <b>involved</b> in the <b>acquittal</b> of two longstanding murder convictions. Led by Innocence Canada, Steven Truscott’s case was brought before the Court in 2006. In 2007, Moldaver joined the court in acquitting Truscott of his 1959 rape and murder convictions, due to new medical {{evidence}} and fresh testimony. During the trial, Moldaver was critical of the investigating team, questioning them {{as to why they}} never considered a sexual psychopath as a suspect.|$|R
50|$|The shootout {{resulted}} in {{a great deal of}} controversy for the ATS. The ATS was suspected of staging a fake encounter and subsequently dragged to court. A magisterial inquiry was ordered as questions were raised on the use of 450 rounds of ammo and the need for a “daylight” encounter. The ATS was also charged with walking away with Rs 7 million which belonged to Maya Dolas. Petitions alleging corruption were also filed against Khan. However, the trial ended with Khan and other <b>involving</b> ATS officers <b>acquittal.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Justification Hypothesis (JH) {{is a novel}} {{proposal}} that allows for both {{the understanding of the}} evolution of culture and for identifying what makes humans distinct animals. A basic initial claim of the JH is that the process of justification is a crucial component of human mental behavior at both the individual and societal level. Unlike all other animals, humans everywhere ask for and give explanations for their actions. Arguments, debates, moral dictates, rationalizations, and <b>excuses</b> all <b>involve</b> the process of explaining why one's claims, thoughts or actions are warranted. In virtually every form of social exchange, from warfare to politics to family struggles to science, humans are constantly justifying their behavioral investments to themselves and others.|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{seeks to}} resolve key areas of debate {{regarding}} {{the nature of}} provocation as a defence in English Law, by reference to both historical and philosophical analysis. Academic commentators on the doctrine disagree on {{whether it should be}} seen as essentially an excusing condition alone, such as insanity, or should be understood as an <b>excuse</b> <b>involving</b> some element of "partial [moral] justification", such as duress. I seek to resolve this debate by considering at a deeper philosophical level the nature of anger and action in anger. I argue that English Law has historically operated with two equally plausible conceptions of anger, anger as righteous indignation and anger as a loss of self-control. The former was the conception drawn on {{in the development of the}} early modern law, and the latter is the conception drawn on in the development of the modern law. I go on to argue that controversy, referred to above, over the nature of provocation as a defence, can be only resolved by making clear the distinction between the two kinds of anger. Action in anger conceived as a loss of self-control bears more of a family resemblance to defences such as (temporary) insanity. Action in anger conceived as righteous indignation bears more of a family resemblance to defences such as duress. I argue that whichever conception of anger is in issue, however, action in anger can be open to moral criticism, because all kinds of action in anger are based on at least a judgment of moral wrongdoing, that may be subject of such criticism. I argue that the law may thus legitimately require at least some moral justification for action in anger before allowing a defence of provocation to be pleaded successfully. </p...|$|R
40|$|Three studies {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} empathy {{and the level of}} fictionality of short stories on consumers' evaluations of emotional melodramatic entertainment. We find that high empathizers' evaluations are more favorable when the story is low in fictionality (i. e., real) versus high. In contrast, low empathizers' evaluations do not differ, regardless of the level of fictionality, except when these individuals (i. e., males) are provided with an <b>excuse</b> to become <b>involved</b> in the story; in this case a story that is high (i. e., make-believe) as opposed to low in fictionality is evaluated more favorably. Finally, transportation (i. e., absorption into a narrative) with the story is found to both moderate and mediate the effects. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Justification and excuse are {{different}} defenses {{in a criminal}} case. Both defenses admit that the defendant committed an act proscribed by law. The proscribed act has justification if the act had positive effects that outweigh its negative effects, or is not wrong or blameworthy. The proscribed act is excused if the defendant's violation was not entirely voluntary, such as if they acted under duress or under a false belief. Martin v. Ohio (1986) established that states may make justification an affirmative defense, placing {{the burden of proof}} on defendant. Patterson v. New York (1977) established that states may make <b>excuses,</b> such as <b>involving</b> mental state, an affirmative defense, rather than part of the mens rea element the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.|$|R
40|$|Professor Yates {{has covered}} in {{considerable}} detail {{the major problem}} areas {{in the use of}} force majeure clauses. His work is admirable in its technical details as well as in its use for the practitioner. I wish to add but a few brief comments about 2 chronic difficulties with the enforcement of force majeure clauses. To some extent these difficulties are common to all cases that <b>involve</b> <b>excuse</b> by way of frustration, impossibility, or commercial impracticability. The first has to do with foreseeability and the second has to do with post-excuse remedies. It has become a truism that a force majeure clause provides relief from difficulties caused by a fortuitous event. Some courts tend to limit the application of a force majeure clause to those events which are completely unexpected...|$|R
40|$|Through the use {{of social}} acts (e. g., excuses, {{justifications}} and pauses) adults preserve relationships, ‘smooth the waters’ and signal the potential inconvenience of an upcoming request. Claims have been made that adults use more social acts when making requests of high versus low imposition. When granting requests, adults are generally brief, whereas refusing often <b>involves</b> <b>excuses,</b> justifications, ‘er’s’, ‘um’s’ and apologies, etc. which serve to soften the blow of the refusal. To explore whether children will perform in this differential manner typical of adults, 114 children aged 5 – 13 years made and responded to requests of varying imposition. Analysis of transcripts showed that children used more total acts and more different acts when making high versus low imposition requests and when refusing requests versus granting requests. Older children used more acts and more different acts than younger children...|$|R
2500|$|In 1992 Matt Wobensmith's zine Outpunk {{also became}} a record label, and began to release its own queercore compilations, singles, and albums, and was crucial to the {{development}} of queercore. The first recordings by Tribe 8 and Pansy Division were released by the label. Some of the bands appearing later in the mid-1990s on the label include Sta-Prest, Cypher in the Snow and Behead the Prophet, No Lord Shall Live. It was also at this time in the early 1990s that Riot Grrrl emerged. [...] "In many ways the angry- girl genre owes its existence to punk homocore 'zines..." [...] writes Emily White in Rock She Wrote. It follows that many of the participants, their zines, and bands like <b>Excuse</b> 17 were <b>involved</b> in both movements. Along with Outpunk, independent record labels such as Alternative Tentacles, K Records, Kill Rock Stars, Lookout! Records, Yoyo Recordings and Candy Ass Records also supported and released material by queercore artists but in the mid to late 1990s several other small labels, alongside Outpunk, sprung up solely devoted to queercore.|$|R
40|$|This {{article will}} examine the law of excuse as espoused in the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). It {{will examine the}} {{relevant}} case law applying the doctrine of impediment found in CISG Article 79. The question posed in this analysis is whether the word “impediment” relates only to the occurrences of force majeure, impossibility and frustration of purpose events or if it also includes changed circumstances, impracticability and hardship events. For purposes of simplicity, {{the first set of}} excuse or exemption doctrines will be analyzed under the heading of “impossibility” and the second set will be discussed under the heading of “hardship”. The key issue to be explored in this article is the distinction between excuse requiring impossibility or frustration of contractual purpose and hardship as it relates to Article 79 of the CISG. These terms and doctrines have often been conflated. This is understandable given the number of such doctrines found in various national laws and international law instruments, such as impossibility, impracticability, frustration of purpose, force majeure or Act of God, hardship, change of circumstances, and so forth. The question posed is whether the impediment doctrine provides an exemption from liability only for “absolute” excuse (impossibility, force majeure) or if it also extends to the more liberal “relative” excuse doctrines (hardship, changed circumstances, impracticability). Given the vagueness of Article 79 ’s use of the word impediment, its interpretation and application has had to be constructed anew. This has to, of course, be done with all CISG provisions under the autonomous interpretation mandate. However, the interpretation of the exemption of impediment is an especially difficult task given the context of the numerous excuse doctrines in the various national legal systems, as well as the conflation of different excuse doctrines within national legal systems. French law has the most form of excuse recognizing only force majeure events that make it impossible to perform; the United Kingdom’s law is slightly more liberal, adding the doctrine of frustration of purpose to the impossibility doctrine; and German law incorporates the more common civil law bifurcation of impossibility and hardship doctrines, while also recognizing frustration of purpose, as well as recognizing both physical and economic impossibility. The United States has a tripartite <b>excuse</b> regime <b>involving</b> impossibility, frustration, and impracticability. Part II briefly examines the law of excuse in the German and American legal systems focusing on the German concept of changed circumstances and the American doctrine of impracticability, while Part III briefly reviews the law of excuse provided in the UNIDROIT’s Principles of International Commercial Contracts (PICC) and the Principles of European Contract Law (PECL). The reviews in Parts II and III will set the context for analyzing the case law relating to CISG Article 79 that is undertaken in Part IV...|$|R
