5|$|In March 2012, the MBTA {{announced}} that the contamination had been fully removed, and revealed plans to place solar panels in the west part of 5-Yard. The panels would be <b>installed</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintained</b> for at least 20 years by an outside contractor. Bidding began in May 2012, with the stipulation that the solar array would be operational {{by the spring of}} 2013. The contract was chosen in September 2012, with a revised completion date of October 2013. In July 2013, MassDOT (the MBTA's parent agency) {{announced that}} construction would not begin until at least 2014 due to a state solar program reaching capacity earlier than expected. , the installation was to occur in June 2015.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, {{the concept}} of {{installing}} perforated pipes in dams was introduced to control water levels at the Northeastern Wildlife Conference as a solution for problem beaver ponds. In 1963, Laramie reported that the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department had successfully <b>installed</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintained</b> beaver pipes in 46 dams. In 1978, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation began designing and testing various culvert protection devices, of which the T-culvert guard was {{the most effective and}} cost-beneficial. In 1992, Clemson University developed the Clemson Beaver Pond Leveler, a device that prevented beavers from damming areas of concern by directing water through existing dams using a strategically designed pipe system. Over the years, these designs have been modified and improved in order to address flow problems that occur in a variety of different landscapes. The most recent innovations in flow devices combine fencing techniques which exclude beaver with pipe systems which deceive beaver.|$|E
25|$|From 9 March to 17 March {{members of}} the 9th Military Police were {{positioned}} at both ends and all along the bridge to guide {{a steady stream of}} POWs, vehicles, and troops. Other MPs were detailed as snipers to watch for German frogmen who might attempt to blow up the bridge. When a vehicle was hit or the driver wounded, they helped get the vehicle off the bridge, even if it meant driving it. They manned aid stations and POW cages on both shores, and they <b>installed</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintained</b> wire communications across the bridge, all while under artillery fire. The entire 9th Military Police Company was recognized with the Meritorious Unit Citation, the Belgian Fourragère, and the Presidential Unit Citation for its performance at the Ludendorff Bridge. 1st LT John Hyde of the 9th Military Police Company was in charge of a massive influx of vehicles and troops for more than 15 days.

2500|$|Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) Joe Johnston sketched and Colin Cantwell built {{models that}} {{eventually}} became the final X-wing fighter in Star Wars. The X-wings {{were designed to}} appear more [...] "traditional" [...] than the Empire's TIE fighters. ILM built miniatures in various scales, with wing markings indicating which prop represented which pilot. When ILM fell behind on generating X-wing footage, Star Wars producer George Lucas and his editors temporarily used World War II dogfight footage for initial editing cuts. Each X-wing model was built around a hollow core made from surgical tubing, which allowed lighting, cooling, and electrical connectors for the wing motors to be <b>installed</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintained.</b> The cockpit windows were made from faceted glass so that accurate reflections could be filmed. Although the movie's initial script and novelization describe the X-wings as belonging to [...] "Blue squadron", limitations in bluescreen photography led to the markings on the filming models, {{as well as the}} fictional squadron affiliation being changed to red.|$|E
