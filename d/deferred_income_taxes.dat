40|$|Estimates of {{stranded}} commitments for US investor-owned {{electric utilities}} range widely, from {{as little as}} $ 20 billion {{to as much as}} $ 500 billion (more than double the shareholder equity in US utilities). These potential losses are a consequence of the above-market book values for some utility-owned power plants, long-term power-purchase contracts, <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes,</b> regulatory assets, and public-policy programs. Because of the wide range of estimates and the potentially large dollar amounts involved, state and federal regulators need a clear understanding of the methods used to calculate these estimates. In addition, they may want simple methods that they can use to check the reasonableness of the estimates that utilities and other parties present in regulatory proceedings. This report explains various top-down and bottom-up methods to calculate stranded commitments. The purpose of this analysis is to help regulators and others understand the implications of different analytical approaches to estimating stranded-commitment amounts. Top-down methods, because they use the utility as the unit of analysis, are simple to apply and to understand. However, their aggregate nature makes it difficult to determine what specific assets and liabilities affect their estimates. Bottom-up methods use the individual asset (e. g., power plant) or liability (e. g., power-purchase contract, fuel-supply contract, and <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes)</b> as the unit of analysis.

40|$|Tax-effect {{accounting}} {{has been}} controversy since its origin in allocation {{has generally been}} adopted the subject in the 1940 s. Tax across the English speaking world, even though underlying basic issues have not been resolved. A {{review of the literature}} shows that issues such as: whether <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> is an expense; whether the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> is a liability and whether the provision for future <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> benefit is an asset have not been resolved because of differing opinions as to what is an expense, liability or an asset. The development of a conceptual framework in Australia, which provides definitions of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, has provided an opportunity to reexamine some of the unresolved issues mentioned above. Since the conceptual framework, in SAC 4, defines an expense in terms of whether it increases a liability or reduces an asset the re-examination was directed at ascertaining whether the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> satisfies the definition and recognition criteria for a liability. The results were inconclusive. However, it was possible to conclude that the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> does not readily satisfy the criteria in SAC 4. An empirical investigation was then undertaken to ascertain whether selected user groups treat the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> as a liability. The investigation surveyed investment houses, company secretaries, auditors and the parties to trust deeds. Evidence gathered suggest that investment houses and company secretaries treat the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> all a liability.

40|$|Utilizing {{a random}} sample of 80 Canadian public companies, this thesis {{establishes}} that {{a significant increase in the}} number and magnitude of deferred income tax drawdowns occurred in the recessionary period of the early 1980 s. The behaviour of deferred income tax expense is then investigated to determine if the observed increase in drawdowns related to a reduction in fixed asset additions or was the result of accounting losses.;The existing literature on <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> implicitly assumes that drawdowns are the result of involuntary reversals of timing differences that result in a sacrifice of economic resources. However, the data gathered from financial statements leads one to believe that many drawdowns, and in particular the larger ones, are the result of accounting losses.;It was not possible to determine the exact proportion of drawdowns resulting from losses as current Canadian accounting standards do not require that the reason for a drawdown be provided. For this reason, the researcher contacted management of 13 of the companies experiencing drawdowns in the early 1980 s. The result was a substantiation of the belief that losses were a very important factor underlying the increase in drawdowns. It is believed that this has the potential to mislead a financial statement reader as a company 2 ̆ 7 s consolidated financial statements can indicate a profit, yet the drawdown can relate to losses in one or more subsidiaries. This is due to a Canadian requirement that each legal entity file its own separate tax return and therefore each separate legal entity in the consolidated group must individually determine its deferred income tax.;In addition, a review of companies notes relating to loss carryforwards indicated potential departures from the CICA Handbook and a lack of data that the researcher believes is necessary for a usesr to make an assessment of the potential benefit that may be associated with these loss carryforwards.;Partial tax allocation, using the deferral method, is recommended for rapid write-off assets such as Class 29 assets, but the critical recommendations relate to disclosure. Current Canadian accounting standards do not require disclosure of the reasons for changes in <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes,</b> yet the data analyzed shows that it is not possible to make accurate inferences about this behaviour from companies 2 ̆ 7 financial statements.

40|$|In the {{interest}} of encouraging workers to save for retirement, Congress has authorized several kinds of retirement savings plans that qualify for reduced or <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> <b>taxes.</b> These plans provide a financial incentive for people to save, either by allowing workers and employers to deduct from income the amount they contribute to the plan or to take tax-free distributions from the plan after they retire. This CRS Report summarizes the provisions of law that govern the taxes applicable to pre-retirement distributions from retirement accounts, and the situations in which distributions must be taken from a plan {{in order to avoid}} a tax penalty. Because tax-deductible contributions to retirement plans and deferral of taxes on investment earnings reduce federal income tax collections, Congress has placed limits on the amount that can be contributed to these plans each year. To assure that the tax preferences granted to retirement accounts are used to promote retirement income security rather than to subsidize transfers of wealth {{from one generation to the}} next, federal law requires owners of retirement accounts that are funded with taxdeductible contributions to begin taking required minimum distributions from the accounts after they reach age 70 ½. Failure to take a required minimum distribution will result in a tax penalty equal to 50 % of the amount that should have been distributed. Retirement plans that are funded with after-tax income — like the “Roth IRA” — do not have required minimum distributions during the account owner’s lifetime. To discourage individuals from taking pre-retirement withdrawals from retirement savings accounts, the Internal Revenue Code (I. R. C.) imposes a 10 % penalty on withdrawals taken before age 59 ½, which is levied in addition to any other applicable income tax. Recognizing that some significant events might require people to withdraw money from their retirement accounts earlier than expected, Congress has provided in law for waiving the 10 % early withdrawal penalty in some situations. As with required distributions after age 70 ½, Roth IRAs have a special rule with respect to early withdrawals. Because contributions to a Roth IRA must consist entirely of income on which income tax has already been paid, qualified distributions from a Roth IRA are not subject to income taxes or penalties...|$|E

In this paper, besides examining the level of book-tax conformity in Poland, we investigate the determinants of book-tax differences in the one-book and twobook accounting systems, with <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax.</b> We use the single factor ANOVA variance analysis, robust fixed effects estimator and the fixed effects linear model with an AR(1) disturbance estimator for panel data of 26, 657 private limited liability and non-public joint-stock companies for the period of 2003 – 2014 (177, 667 firm-year observations). The originality of this paper results from the deep quantita-tive analysis of the determinants of book-tax conformity on a novel dataset of Polish private firms. We confirm a strong significant influence of tax law on the shape of the one-book accounting system in Poland. Larger enterprises show fewer book-tax differences. Book-tax conformity is lower in private companies that incur financial losses and in private companies conducting the one-book accounting system. Family-owned companies have higher mean and median book-tax conformity than businessgroups members, due to higher demand for information from their accounts to support stewardship func-tions and to monitor the activities of the management board in the business groups...|$|R

Provisions are classified according to the type of a liability they concern among the remaining and even the main operating costs, financial costs or extraordinary losses.
