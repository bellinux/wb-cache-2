5|$|Akane {{was created}} to be a {{relatable}} character who would question the setting and answer the viewer's questions. Early in the show's development, the production staff planned the way Akane would mature throughout the story. Early critical reception to Akane has been mixed. Some critics saw her as typical new cop often seen in dramas; others criticized her as uninteresting. However, her growth in the story earned praise <b>for</b> <b>becoming</b> a highly appealing protagonist.|$|E

5|$|At Eurocorp New York HQ, Denham and Merit believe Kilo is brain-dead {{and send}} him to be rebooted while they plan to {{retrieve}} Lily's chip and recover useful information on DART 6. Kilo begins to remember his secret past: he learns that Denham led a Eurocorp team to kill his parents and abduct him as a baby because he has genes ideal <b>for</b> <b>becoming</b> an agent. Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of Eurocorp's agents were abducted as children and their memories were modified so they would remain loyal to Eurocorp. Lily created the DART 6 chip, hoping {{to use it to}} make the syndicates retain their humanity and care about both chipped and un-chipped civilians, but she realizes she was naïve to think that way.|$|E
5|$|By 26 August a new Czechoslovak {{representative}} {{requested the}} whole issue {{be removed from the}} Security Council's agenda. Shirley Temple Black visited Prague in August 1968 to prepare <b>for</b> <b>becoming</b> the US Ambassador for a free Czechoslovakia. However, after the 21 August invasion she became part of a U.S. Embassy-organized convoy of vehicles that evacuated U.S. citizens from the country. In August 1989, she returned to Prague as U.S. Ambassador, three months before the Velvet Revolution that ended 41 years of Communist rule.|$|E
5|$|For their victory, {{each team}} member and coach {{received}} three championship rings designed by Jostens: a university-issued title ring, a BCS issued title ring, {{and another for}} winning the SEC championship.

Also as part of the A-Day celebrations, the 2009 team captains Javier Arenas, Rolando McClain, and Mike Johnson were honored at the Walk of Fame ceremony at the base of Denny Chimes.

5|$|It {{is unclear}} how {{initiation}} may have affected a devotee's rank within the cult. After going through his third initiation, Lucius becomes a pastophoros, {{a member of a}} particular class of priests. If the third initiation was a requirement <b>for</b> <b>becoming</b> a pastophoros, it is possible that members moved up in the cult hierarchy by going through the series of initiations. Nevertheless, Apuleius refers to initiates and to priests as if they are separate groups within the cult. Initiation may have been a prerequisite for a devotee to become a priest but not have automatically made him or her into one.|$|E

5|$|The average SPAR {{officer was}} 29 years old, single, a college graduate, and had worked {{seven years in}} a {{professional}} or managerial position (in education or government) before entering the service. The average enlisted SPAR was 24 years old, single, a high school graduate, and had worked for over {{three years in a}} clerical or sales job before joining the service. The likelihood was that she came from the state of Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, or California. The reasons <b>for</b> <b>becoming</b> a SPAR differed, but most likely it was patriotism, self-advancement, desire for travel and adventure, or the loss of a loved one in the war.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2008, Obama {{typically}} led McCain in national polls by single-digit margins, and also led in several key swing states. McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due {{at least in part}} to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year. McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent <b>for</b> <b>becoming</b> the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.|$|E

5|$|Competing at {{her first}} Summer Olympics, Fumilay Fonseca was notable for {{carrying}} the São Tomé and Príncipe flag {{at the opening}} ceremony and <b>for</b> <b>becoming</b> the youngest person to represent the nation aged 16 years and 92 days, a record that still stands today. She qualified for the 2004 Athens Games after being granted a wildcard place as she had not competed in any notable sporting event. She competed in the 20 kilometer walk on 23 August against 56 other athletes. She finished last of the 52 that finished {{with a time of}} 2 minutes and 4.54 seconds. Mauritius' Yolene Raffin ranked ahead of her with a time of 1 minute 49.28 seconds.

5|$|During the Second World War, Constantine {{worked for}} the Ministry of Labour and National Service as a Welfare Officer {{responsible}} for West Indians employed in English factories. In 1943, {{the manager of a}} London hotel refused to accommodate Constantine and his family on the grounds of their race; Constantine successfully sued the hotel company. Commentators recognise the case as a milestone in British Racial Equality. Constantine qualified as a barrister in 1954, while also establishing himself as a journalist and broadcaster. He returned to Trinidad in 1954, entered politics and became {{a founding member of the}} People's National Movement, subsequently entering the Trinidad government as minister of communications. From 1961 to 1964, he served as Trinidad's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and, controversially, became involved in issues relating to racial discrimination, including the Bristol Bus Boycott. In his final years, he served on the Race Relations Board, the Sports Council and the Board of Governors of the BBC. Failing health reduced his effectiveness in some of these roles, and he faced criticism <b>for</b> <b>becoming</b> a part of the British Establishment. He died of a heart attack on 1 July 1971, aged 69.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Constantine {{became a}} {{founding}} member of the Sports Council, which aimed to develop sport in Britain. Two years later, he was appointed to the three-person Race Relations Board, formed through the Race Relations Act, to investigate cases of racial discrimination. In this role he spoke out against the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, a stance that led to an offer from the Liberal Party, which he declined, to stand as parliamentary candidate for Nelson. Later, he was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate the release, after a military coup, of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, the overthrown Prime Minister of Nigeria. Constantine was appointed to the BBC's General Advisory Committee in 1966 and became a BBC Governor two years later, although declining health restricted his involvement. The following year the students of St Andrews University elected Constantine as Rector, but again his health prevented him performing effectively in this role. In his last years, Constantine was criticised <b>for</b> <b>becoming</b> part of the Establishment; Private Eye mocked him, while the new generation of West Indian immigrants believed he was out of touch. More radical black spokesmen disapproved of his conciliatory approach to racist incidents.|$|E
5|$|Jackie Robinson Day is a {{traditional}} event which occurs annually in Major League Baseball, commemorating and honoring the day Jackie Robinson made his major league debut. April 15 was Opening Day in 1947, Robinson's first season in the Major Leagues. Initiated {{for the first time}} on April 15, 2004, Jackie Robinson Day is celebrated each year on that day. The festivity is a result of Robinson's memorable career, best known <b>for</b> <b>becoming</b> the first black major league baseball player of the modern era in 1947. His debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers (today known as the Los Angeles Dodgers) ended approximately 80 years of baseball segregation, also known as the baseball color line, or color barrier. He also was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962, remembered for his services with the number 42 jersey.|$|E
