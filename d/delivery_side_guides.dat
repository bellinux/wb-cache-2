40|$|Abstract. In the {{hot rolling}} process, the steel slab may {{experience}} a temperature gradient along its transverse direction which may cause camber and wedge after rolling. Camber and wedge phenomenon {{will affect the}} quality of the steel plate. To eliminate camber and wedge phenomenon, a pair of <b>side</b> <b>guides</b> is placed before and behind the hot rolling mill. The position mode and the force mode are the control modes for <b>side</b> <b>guides</b> to correct the slab shape and to guide the slab to follow rolling direction. Finite element analysis using ABAQUS was applied to simulate hot rolling process to find the correction mechanism of rolling equipment. The centerline of slab was traced and the shape of slab was predicted. The difference of rolling load between work side and drive side of roller was determined. Furthermore, the load, stress and velocity distribution on the slab at roll bite were analyzed. By using numerical model, hot rolling parameters including <b>side</b> <b>guide</b> control strategy can be predicted, which can provide the hot rolling line as a guideline {{to improve the quality of}} the steel slab...|$|R

50|$|In {{comparison}} to normal household current on two wires, current on the <b>delivery</b> <b>side</b> {{of the power}} grid uses three wires and phases. At any given instant, the sum of those three is always positive (or negative). So while any given wire in a three-phase system undergoes zero-crossing events {{in exactly the same}} fashion as household current, the system as a whole does not, it simply fluctuates between the maximum and a slightly lower value.|$|R

In the initial stage, fee-for-service predominated for both public and private providers.

30|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine the cause for hemodynamic instability in patients and to predict the best treatments. Currently, cardiovascular resuscitation options are triggered by arterial pressure and cardiac output (CO) measures, focusing on the oxygen <b>delivery</b> <b>side</b> of the circulation. However, the primary determinants of CO reside on the venous side. Veins are 30 – 50 times more compliant than arteries and contain approximately 75 % of the total blood volume [1 – 5]. Mean circulatory filling pressure (Pmcf) provides vital information on this “forgotten venous side of the circulation” [6].|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened on}} 1 March 1862 by the Border Union Railway. The station was {{situated}} {{at the end of}} an unnamed minor road. The goods yard was moderately sized and was on a lower level than the station. It was composed of three sidings, the siding to the north serving a cattle dock and pens. The station closed to passengers on 15 June 1964.

40|$|The {{public sector}} is the {{dominant}} financier {{of health care in}} most OECD countries. But {{in the last two decades}} the extent of private finance has increased in most of these countries, and private finance now accounts for around a quarter of all health care finance. On the <b>delivery</b> <b>side,</b> the dominance of the public sector is much less strong and mixed public and private provision is common. Many recent reforms in health care have sought to increase the role for the private sector in health care provision. Against this backdrop, this paper examines the case for, and the empirical evidence to support, an increase in the role for the private sector in finance and delivery. The paper starts with a brief overview of the current position. It then examines the case and evidence on the finance side, and then the case and evidence on the <b>delivery</b> <b>side.</b> The evidence used is drawn primarily from the experience of OECD countries other than the USA, both because the American experience is better known and because the USA is an outlier in terms of the level of private finance and delivery within this group of countries. Nearly all of the recent reforms, which have sought to increase the role for the private sector, have been in countries where the public sector plays a greater role in both finance and delivery than in the USA...|$|R

50|$|Small {{automatic}} valves {{are available to}} fit individual radiators. As these need to operate in any orientation, they use a different mechanism rather than a float. The Aladdin HVC30 system uses a 'hygroseal' cartridge. This is a small disc of material that expands when wet and shrinks if warm and dry. A dry valve acts as an air vent until a dribble of water passes through it and swells the cartridge. If the valve dries out again, it re-opens. A characteristic of these valves is that they function best on the hot <b>delivery</b> <b>side</b> of a radiator and may not open as vents unless the water supply is hot.|$|R

50|$|The station {{opened on}} 1 June 1848 by the Leeds Northern Railway. The station was {{situated}} {{on the south side}} of the Wormald Green - Markington Road, just west of its junction with Ripon Road on the A61. There were four sidings, two of which served a coal depot. Pepper's Lime quarry had a private siding. There were more sidings to the north serving Monkton Moor quarries. In 1911, the main freight handled at the station was barley (155 tons) and 128 wagons of livestock. After close to passengers on 18 June 1962, the station was still open to goods traffic but it was downgraded to an unstaffed public <b>delivery</b> <b>siding</b> until its complete closure on 31 August 1964.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{successive}} forging {{process of}} long aluminum {{and stainless steel}} plates with an inclined punch was developed to produce a long plate having an inclined cross-section. In this process, the forging load becomes small due to the repeat of local deformation. A <b>side</b> <b>guide</b> and a grooved die were introduced to prevent the curvature of the forged plate. The effects of the forging interval on the deformation behavior of the plate and the forging load were examined.

The train runs on rubber wheels which are connected to bogies, and is laterally guided by means of <b>side</b> <b>guiding</b> wheels. The rubber-steel interface between train and guideway will have a good friction coefficient, leading to decreased vibration transmission to the train from the track.

50|$|Later, a {{mechanically}} {{more complicated}} rake was developed, {{known as the}} <b>side</b> <b>delivery</b> rake. This usually had a gear-driven or chain-driven reel mounted roughly at a 45-degree angle to the windrow, so the hay was gathered and pushed {{to one side of}} the rake as it moved across the field. A <b>side</b> <b>delivery</b> rake could be pulled longitudinally along the windrow by horses or a tractor, eliminating the laborious and inefficient process of raising, lowering, and back-and-forth raking required by a dump rake. This allowed for the continuous spiraling windrows of a classic mid-20th-century farm hayfield. Later versions of the <b>side</b> <b>delivery</b> rake used a more severe transverse angle and a higher frame system, but the basic principles of operation were the same.|$|R

In this report, Moessbauer spectroscopy was used to study the local environmentals of LSFT with various level of oxygen deficiency.

Post-fracture X-ray data of the OTM fractured at 1000 C in environment were refined by FullProf code and results indicate a distortion of the parent cubic perovskite to orthorhombic structure with reduced symmetry. TGA-DTA studies on the post-fracture samples also indicated residual effect arising from the thermal and stress history of the samples.
