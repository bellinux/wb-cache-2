25|$|The dialogical part of ontological hermeneutics {{states that}} Dasein co-creates meaning from his self-interpretations and {{subjective}} experiences {{through the process}} of dialogue, i.e. conversing with others. Human beings are constantly engaged in dialogue with others and their world around them. Macmurray postulated that dialogue is our primary, if not only, source of knowledge. Bakhtin claimed that human beings are more than beings who engage in dialogue, but that they are dialogical beings composed of multiple simultaneous voices: voices that are their own and voices that belong to others. These voices represent who Dasein is, his or her dispositions, and his or her roles in society. In this case, the term voice is meant to signify a particular role Dasein takes up or a particular aspect of who Dasein is. These voices of human beings are not {{to be thought of as}} hallucinated voices, as in psychosis, but rather different elements of who Dasein is: I like Italian food as one voice and I do not like it when people interrupt me as another voice, or I am a therapist as one voice but I am a patient when <b>I</b> <b>visit</b> my primary care physician as another. That is not to say that these voices determine Dasein's actions or behaviors. On the contrary, Dasein is an agentic being (a being capable of choice) who thinks, acts, and chooses for himself. But this process “emerges through conversations among functionally independent elements within persons” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2). The emergence of these multiple voices within us via multitudes of ongoing conversations with others is why Bakhtin described us as polyphonic beings, or “products of ongoing series of dialogues among distinct voices” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2).|$|E

Alumni use reverent terms when speaking about Bunce Court and numerous alumni have written memoirs, all mentioning their time at Bunce Court. Martin Lubowski, who lost his family to Nazi concentration camps, said, [...] "I feel I am walking on holy ground whenever <b>I</b> <b>visit</b> Bunce Court". Richard W. Sonnenfeldt wrote in his book, Witness to Nuremberg, [...] "While I was there, and forever after, Bunce Court has been my Shangri-La." [...] Michael Trede, a German who was not Jewish, said that Bunce Court was, [...] "not a 'normal' school, not an institution, rather more of an emergency association, like an extended family. Frank Auerbach called it a [...] "remarkable school, which {{was more than a}} school but a sort of community, a small republic". For many pupils, as well as their teachers, Bunce Court was a last refuge that not only literally saved their lives, but also gave them new meaning and substance." [...] After the school closed, alumni organized reunions for 55 years. Numerous people associated with the school wrote memoirs, both pupils and teachers, as well as Essinger family members and Anna Essinger, whose memoir was not published.|$|E
