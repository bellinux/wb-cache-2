40|$|Catalytic fast {{pyrolysis}} (CFP) of pine <b>wood,</b> alcohols (<b>methanol,</b> 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol and 2 -butanol) and their mixtures with ZSM- 5 catalyst {{were conducted in}} a bubbling fluidized bed reactor. The effects of temperature and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) on the product carbon yields and selectivities of CFP of pure pine <b>wood</b> and <b>methanol</b> were investigated. A maximum carbon yield of petrochemicals (aromatics + C 2 –C 4 olefins + C 5 compounds) from pine wood of 23. 7 % was obtained at a temperature of 600 °C and WHSV of 0. 35 h− 1. A maximum petrochemical yield from methanol of 80. 7 % was obtained at a temperature of 400 °C and WHSV of 0. 35 h− 1. Thus, the optimal conditions for conversion of pine <b>wood</b> and <b>methanol</b> are different. The CFP of pine <b>wood</b> and <b>methanol</b> mixtures was conducted at 450 °C and 500 °C. The hydrogen to carbon effective (H/Ceff) ratio of the feed was adjusted by changing the relative amount of <b>methanol</b> and <b>wood.</b> The petrochemical yield was {{a function of the}} H/Ceff ratio and more petrochemicals are produced from biomass when methanol is added to the CFP process. Co-feeding of 12 C pine wood and 13 C methanol was carried out at 450 °C. The isotopic study showed that all the hydrocarbon products contained mixtures of 12 C and 13 C, indicating that the carbon is mixed within the zeolite. However, the distribution of carbon was skewed depending on the product. The toluene, xylene, propylene and butenes contained more 13 C. The naphthalene and ethylene contain more 12 C. Wood was also co-processed with 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol, and 2 -butanol, which showed a similar effect as methanol with an increasing petrochemical yield with an increasing H/Ceff ratio of the feed. This paper demonstrates that CFP can selectively produce a mixture of compounds where the overall yield {{is a function of the}} H/Ceff ratio of the feed...|$|R
