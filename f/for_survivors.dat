The sister aircraft Najaden arrived later in the afternoon with relatives of the deceased and journalists; its main objective was to search <b>for</b> <b>survivors,</b> but there was no possibility for it to land on the mountain and so could not help with the salvaging. Later a Widerøe aircraft arrived as well, which transported DNL's technical director Bernt Balchen, Captain Eckhoff, who worked for the aviation authorities, and Gjermundson from the insurance company.
