40|$|Abstract. The <b>impact</b> {{performance}} of ZnAl 27 Cu 2. 5 MgMn alloy from room Temperature to 2500 0 C {{has been investigated}} by pendulum <b>impact</b> testing. The surface morphology of <b>impact</b> fracture is observed by scan electron microscope (SEM). The results indicate that <b>impact</b> energy of the alloy decreases as the temperature increases when the temperatures are lower than 100 ℃. Between 100 ℃ and 200 ℃, <b>impact</b> energy increases as the temperature increases. And when the temperature exceeds 250 ℃, <b>impact</b> energy decreases dramatically. <b>Impact</b> energy gets to the maximum at room temperature. <b>Impact</b> behavior of the alloy can be evaluated by the width of <b>impact</b> spectrum curve.

40|$|Rockfall <b>impact</b> {{is one of}} {{the fatal}} hazards in {{pipeline}} transportation of oil and gas. The deformation of oil and gas pipeline caused by rockfall <b>impact</b> was investigated using the finite element method in this paper. Pipeline deformations under radial <b>impact,</b> longitudinal inclined <b>impact,</b> transverse inclined <b>impact,</b> and lateral eccentric <b>impact</b> of spherical and cube rockfalls were discussed, respectively. The effects of <b>impact</b> angle and eccentricity on the plastic strain of pipeline were analyzed. The results show that the crater depth on pipeline caused by spherical rockfall <b>impact</b> is deeper than by cube rockfall <b>impact</b> with the same volume. In the inclined <b>impact</b> condition, the maximum plastic strain of crater caused by spherical rockfall <b>impact</b> appears when incidence angle α is 45 °. The pipeline is prone to rupture under the cube rockfall <b>impact</b> when α is small. The plastic strain distribution of <b>impact</b> crater is more uneven with the increasing of <b>impact</b> angle.

40|$|Identification of low-velocity <b>impacts</b> to {{composite}} structures {{has become increasingly}} important in the aerospace industry. Knowing when <b>impacts</b> have occurred would allow inspections to be scheduled only when necessary, and knowing the approximate <b>impact</b> location would allow for a localized search, saving time and expense. Additionally, an estimation of the <b>impact</b> magnitude {{could be used for}} damage prediction. This study experimentally investigated a methodology for <b>impact</b> identification. To achieve the approach, the following issues were covered in this study: <b>impact</b> detecting; signal processing; feature extractioon; <b>impact</b> identification. In <b>impact</b> detection, them smart stuctures, two piezoelectric sensors embedded in {{composite structures}}, are designed to measure <b>impact</b> signals caused by foreign object <b>impact</b> events. The <b>impact</b> signals were stored in computer system memory through the <b>impact</b> monitoring system developed in this study. In signal processing, the cross correlation method was used to process the measured <b>impact</b> signals. This processing built the correlation between the <b>impact</b> signals and location of <b>impacts</b> as well as <b>impact</b> magnitude. In feature extraction, the initial feature data were gained from the cross correlation results through the point and segmentation processing. thie final feature data were selected from the initial feature data with a fuzzy clustering method. In <b>impact</b> identification, the adaptive deuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) were built with the feature data to identify abscissas of <b>impact</b> location, ordinates of <b>impact</b> location and <b>impact</b> magnitude. The parameters of the ANFISs were refined with a hybrid learning rule i. e. the combination of the Least Square Estimation and the Steepest Descent algorithm. Real time software developed in Visual Basic code manipulated the monitoring and control system for the <b>impact</b> experiments. Also a software package developed with MATLAB, implemented the <b>impact</b> identification and the system simulation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
