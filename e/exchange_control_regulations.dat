25|$|First, {{citizens}} must {{support the}} Government's policy, thus entailing objective congruence between the promoter of moral suasion {{and the target}} whose behaviour should be changed. That support emanates from such factors that determine compliance as; potential illegal gain; severity and certainty of sanctions; individual's moral development and their standards of personal morality; individual's perceptions of how just and moral are rules being enforced; and social environmental influences. For example, during the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe, most business people were accepting foreign currency as a medium of exchange {{in violation of the}} country's <b>Exchange</b> <b>Control</b> rules and <b>regulations</b> despite calls by the Central Bank to persuade stakeholders to accept only the local currency as medium of exchange. The business community felt that the rules being enforced through moral suasion were not just and moral. Thus in cases where factors that determine compliance are in line with Government's objectives, the cost of non-compliance increases as behaviours which are contrary to social moral values suffer social reputation if members know about the non compliance.|$|R

Accordingly, the <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> and its liberalisation involve a considerable volume of legal aspects and procedures.

40|$|This study {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} the impact of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> on economic performance of emerging economies and South Africa in particular. Amidst South Africa’s newly established stable political environment and its reintroduction to the global economy, a fierce debate exists on whether some measure of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> are necessary or whether they should be abolished altogether. The debate also extends {{to the nature of}} the economic liberalisation process in the removal of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls,</b> either in an instantaneous “big bang” approach or in a gradual manner. The research describes arguments for both the support of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> and their abolition. This includes a description of the path South Africa has adopted and an assessment of the merits of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls.</b> Experience from other emerging economies is investigated and correlated with the South African experience. Results indicated that a gradual approach in the relaxation of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> is recommended and that domestic monetary and fiscal policy and trade reforms first before liberating the capital account. It was found that the intensive use of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> as a means of capital account restriction appears to hinder good economic performance; instead it is recommended to create and maintain an institutional environment in which the investment process can occur and where policy-makers can stimulate investment activity with a consequential elimination of capital flight.

50|$|The Swedish Government adopted {{tightened}} <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> <b>regulations</b> in November 1944 {{and made}} great progress in identifying German properties and eliminating German influences from its economy. However, negotiations {{for the return}} of looted gold allegedly sent to Sweden by Germany as payment for goods dragged on for many years. Allied estimates of the value of looted gold ranged between $18.5 million and $22.7 million, but although the British, US and French agreed that Sweden's gold reserves had increased during the war, they were unable to agree how much - if any - of these rises were due to looted gold. Sweden eventually agreed to distribute more than $66 million in liquidated German assets as reparations, including a special $36 million fund at the Riksbank to forestall disease and unrest in Germany and to finance purchases essential for the German economy. It also agreed to provide more than $8 million in gold to make up for that amount of Belgian monetary gold sold to Sweden during the War, but negotiations regarding 8,600 kilograms of Dutch gold ($9.7 million) stalled when Sweden argued that the gold had been acquired before the January 1943 London Declaration on looted gold. In April 1955 the Dutch claim was finally proved conclusive, and Sweden returned about $6.8 million in gold.|$|E

40|$|MCom (South African and International Tax), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 On 8 June 2012, National Treasury amended Regulation 10 (1) (c) of the <b>Exchange</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Regulations</b> to {{specifically}} include intellectual property. In so doing, all companies wishing to dispace intellectual property to an offshore destination had to obtain prior approval from National Treasury. However, National Treasury is reticent to grant permission to reassign these assets, as revenue from intellectual property {{is perceived to}} contribute vastly to the South African tax revenue. This amendment came into being shortly after the dismissal in the Oilwell case. This case, in essence, held that intellectual property is not capital for the purposes intended by National Treasury, and therefore no prior approval to assign it offshore is required from National Treasury. This dismissal led to a large outflow of intellectual property to tax favourable foreign locations. At the same time, it exposed transfer pricing risks that had previously gone unnoticed. Although these risks have once again been mitigated by the amendment to Regulation 10 (1) (c), {{it does not mean}} that it is now a thing of the past, best left forgotten. The South African government intends to relax or abolish all <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> <b>regulations</b> in the future. At present the exact date when this is to take place is not known. Once the <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> <b>regulations</b> are abolished, the transfer pricing risks associated with intellectual property will once again come to the forefront and will lead to significant loss to South African tax revenue. The three main risks that became apparent during the period before the amendment to Regulation 10 (1) (c) are the following: * Transfer pricing risk consisting of mainly: - A lack of a comparables database to enable tax administrators to determine an appropriate arm’s length price for intellectual property. - A lack of the relevant skills, experience and knowledge required to accurately assess transfer prices of intellectual property. * Challenges in obtaining relevant, comprehensive and timely information to accurately determine arm’s length prices for intellectual property transactions. * A lack of understanding the principle of economic substance and legislation in South Africa to define economic substance parameters. * In this mini-dissertation, these weaknesses are discussed in more detail to highlight to SARS the trials it faces when the exchange controls regulations are expelled. Various ways in which these flaws can be challenged head-on are also presented. Master...|$|E

It reviews the theory and evidence surrounding current and capital account liberalisation and argues that there is a lack of sufficiently refined de jure measures of capital account openness. A new index for measuring exchange control restrictiveness is created based on data from the International Monetary Fund’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER) for the 15 SADC member states. It identifies substantial variation in the <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> <b>regulations</b> across SADC countries that other existing, more indices fail to account for. The new index illustrates the considerable range of variation of exchange restrictiveness within SADC, as well as illustrating SADC’s relative exchange restrictiveness compared with other countries, inside and outside of Africa. The new index also correlates with several measures of financial development, certain balance of payment items, and some measures of institutional development, which makes it a useful measure for SADC integration.
