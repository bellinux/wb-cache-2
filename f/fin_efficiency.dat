40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors William Beckman and John Mitchell; 455 pp. Due to assumptions, idealizations, and detailed specifications often required by existing TRNSYS components, difficulties are encountered in modeling the performance of cataloged components within TRNSYS transient thermal system simulations. A cataloged component {{is defined as a}} component whose performance is described by a manufacturer's catalog data. This performance data may be in either tabular or graphical form. To avoid these difficulties, a method has been developed for modeling cataloged components within TRNSYS. This method defines characteristic performance parameters through the manipulation of the basic equations governing the behavior of the component. These characteristic parameters are often combinations of terms, such as geometric specifications, <b>fin</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> or other quantities that require detailed knowledge of the construction of the component. Such detailed information is generally not found in manufacturers' catalogs. Other terms from the basic equations, such as fluid transport properties, are retained to provide a robust model. This method has been successfully used to predict the performance of sensible heat exchangers, chilled water cooling coils, and direct expansion cooling coils. Originally developed with the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software package, the parameter estimation routine has been programmed to operate in the TRNSYS environment. Using a TRNSED interface, an Input Data File, a standard TRNSYS Type, and an optimization subroutine from a library of numerical routines, the best-fit values of the characteristic parameters are determined. These values can then be used in a TRNSYS simulation that utilizes that particular cataloged component...|$|R

Today many processes and glass compositions are already optimized, but due to more strict legislation on toxic elements and substances there must be changes in many glass compositions.

Another intention is to study the structure of 20 R 2 O- 10 CaO- 70 SiO 2 (R = Na, K) with Cu 2 + as probe ion and thus get a deeper knowledge of the surrounding glass matrix.   The optical basicity scale is used to determine the acid/base character of the different glass compositions.   <b>Fining</b> <b>efficiency</b> results showed a remarkable increase of the number of remaining bubbles when the glass contains either approximately equal amounts of Na and K or Ca and Ba, Mg or Sr. The much higher number of bubbles in the potassium containing glasses compared to the sodium containing is explained by the increase in viscosity, the increase in optical basicity and thus lower oxygen activity. The differences in the fining efficiency when altering alkaline earth ions cannot be explained by the optical basicity values, it seems to be a more complicated situation.   This thesis also reports maximum in Vickers hardness and packing density as well as minimum in glass transition temperature for the mixed alkali glasses.
