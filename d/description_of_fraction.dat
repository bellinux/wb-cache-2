40|$|The {{separation}} of the desirable parts of a medicinal plant in air flow is a widely applied procedure. Therefore there has been established the goal to measure flow characteristics of sage (Salvia officinalis L.) and peppermint (Mentha piperita L.) leaves. Leaves were picked from stem and classified according to dimensions in four (sage) and three (peppermint) fractions. The <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>fraction</b> collectives according to dimensions, after either manual or laboratory screen sorting, and data entering into log-normal distribution paper, is given by median and standard deviation. The flow characteristics defined by the air velocity of fluidization of a material layer show the possibility of separating sage leaves and stems, due to {{a significant difference in}} velocity values, 1. 75 m s" 1 maximum for leaves and 3. 35 m s" 1 for stems. Due the difference in flow characteristics the {{separation of}} different peppermint leaves fractions is also possible. The values of air velocity of fluidization for large peppermint leaves and stems were not significantly different, 3. 50 m s* 1 and 4. 18 m s", respectively. Therefore, for their separation, a machine with more homogenous air velocity field is required...|$|E

The phase fraction evolution is examined for a number of characteristic examples, including cyclic loading resulting in oscillatory transformation paths, and internal loops of partial transformation with associated attractor loops.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model is presented that describes {{all aspects of}} flow-induced crystallization of isotactic polypropylene at high shear rates and elevated pressures. It incorporates nonlinear viscoelasticity, including viscosity change {{as a result of}} formation of oriented fibrillar crystals (shish), compressibility, and nonisothermal process conditions caused by shear heating and heat release as a result of crystallization. In {{the first part of this}} chapter, the model is validated with experimental data obtained in a channel flow geometry. Quantitative agreement between experimental results and the {{numerical model}} is observed in terms of pressure drop, apparent crystallinity, parent/daughter ratio, Hermans’ orientation, and shear layer thickness. In the second part, the focus is on flow-induced crystallization of isotactic polypropylene at elevated pressures, resulting in multiple crystal phases and morphologies.

40|$|A one-dimensional, {{numerical}} model describing the fate and vertical transport of oil spilled {{on the surface}} of a water body is presented. The model simulates the movement of oil through a control volume that extends the full thickness of the water column. The model includes the processes of emulsification, dissolution, and biodegradation of the oil in the water column. Vertical forces (weight, buoyancy, and drag) on an individual oil droplet are also included. The time-dependent release of oil droplets from the sea surface into the water column, controlled by the energy dissipated at the sea surface by waves and other parameters, is modeled stochastically. Droplets may change density and/or size due to emulsification, dissolution, and biodegradation once introduced to the water column. Collision with suspended solids may cause droplets to fall to the seafloor, this motion being resisted by the buoyant and drag forces. The model provides a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> oil present in each phase or region of the model: on the surface, at the seafloor, or dissolved, suspended or biodegraded in the water column.

Here we investigate whether one can constrain the nature and properties of these sources, using Fanaroff-Riley type II (FR II) radio galaxies as probes. These sources are easy to identify since the angular separation of their lobes remains almost constant at some tens of arcseconds for z> 1. Using a simple algorithm applied to the FIRST survey, we obtain the largest FR II sample to date, containing over 104 double-lobed sources. A subset of 459 sources is matched to SDSS quasars. This sample yields a statistically meaningful <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> quasars with lobes {{as a function of}} redshift and luminosity.

We find that the observed density {{can be explained by the}} population of known quasars, implying that the majority of powerful jets originate from a radiatively efficient accretion flow with a linear jet-disc coupling. Finally, we show that high-redshift jets are more often quenched within 100 kpc, suggesting a higher efficiency of jet-induced feedback into their host galaxies.

40|$|Charge inventory, the {{accounting}} of distributed fluid mass in closed systems, {{is important to}} the modeling of vapor compression systems. Public domain simulation models used to predict the performance of unitary equipment are currently unable to accurately determine charge inventory. Several issues have been identified as sources of error in these models including incomplete internal volume accounting, absent refrigerant-oil diffusion effects, and void fraction uncertainty. ^ The goal of this work is to improve the accuracy of charge inventory system modeling. This includes identifying and evaluating the relative importance of the various modeling issues. Initially, detailed models of the heat exchangers were developed to isolate charge inventory modeling issues from the overall system dynamics. Three commercially available air conditioners were fully instrumented and tested to provide inputs to the component models and to provide model validation. The component models were further developed into two types of system models: a detailed, local model and a simplified, global model. The simplified model was compared to the detailed system simulation to examine the balance between execution speed and prediction accuracy. ^ The present results suggest that the most important charge inventory issue is proper void fraction determination. This was true for both the component modeling results and the system modeling results. For the component models, the Baroczy void fraction correlation gave the best agreement with the measured charge inventory. However, models that incorporate a dependence on the Froude number give the most accurate <b>description</b> <b>of</b> void <b>fraction</b> over a wide range of conditions. As such, the combination of the Yashar model for separated flow and the Taitel and Barnea model for slug flow is recommended for broad use in charge inventory system modeling.

The substrate used for pyrolysis in terms of this master thesis was the printed circuit boards’ fraction (PCBs) and thus a particular <b>description</b> <b>of</b> this <b>fraction</b> is included. Furthermore, the pyrolysis as a thermal treatment method is fully described for getting an overview of the entire process. The next section of the current master thesis includes a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the instrumentation used for conducting the experimental part, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the Analytical Pyrolysis (PY-GC-MS). The experimental part included as well the samples preparation in order to obtain a homogeneous mixture since various substances are used for PCBs manufacturing. Furthermore, samples were sent to an external company for elemental, proximate and ultimate analysis. After the samples preparation, the TGA and GC-MS were both used as analytical tools in order to identify the main substances produced, the reactions kinetics taking place, and various others important parameters. Furthermore, the results derived from the experimental were further analyzed using various calculations tools such as Microsoft Office Excel and Matlab as well as the software of GC-MS. The results section also includes a deep discussion of the results since the pyrolysis of electronic waste is still under research an extensive analysis is necessary. Summarizing, the results illustrates all the data gathered from the composition analysis, the TGA curves and a qualitative and quantitative analysis.

Here {{we show that}} the groups of all torus links are groups <b>of</b> <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> so-called Garside monoids, i. e., roughly speaking, monoids with a good theory of divisibility, which allows us to reprove that those groups are automatic, but, in addition, gives a completely explicit <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the involved automata, thus partially answering a question of D. F. Holt...|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} {{reference}} materials with defined mouthfeel properties {{makes it difficult}} to progress in finding the chemical compound or group of compounds responsible for such properties in complex foods or beverages such as wine. The present work aimed at developing a chemo-sensory strategy providing different odorless fractions with consistent mouthfeel properties. Three wines with different mouthfeel properties were separated in six different odorless fractions per wine by semipreparative liquid chromatography and Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE). Fractions were sensory analyzed by sorting task, repertory grid, triangulation and Rate-All-That-Apply (RATA) with wine experts. In parallel, fractions were chemically characterized by spectrophotometrical strategies, UPLC-MS and MALDI-TOF-MS. A list of 23 terms related to in-mouth properties (18 to mouthfeel) was generated and successfully employed in the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> wines and <b>fractions</b> by RATA analysis. <b>Fractions</b> containing oligomers <b>of</b> flavanols (from tetra- mers up to decamers) were mainly coarse, grainy, dry on the tongue and dry on the palate. More surprising was the sensory properties <b>of</b> a <b>fraction</b> containing anthocyanin-derivative pigments, which was especially dry, bitter and persistent as was the original wine. This fraction did not contain either oligomers or polymers of fl avanols or flavanol-anthocyanin pigments, but a series of trimers of anthocyanins tentatively identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Further separation strategies are being developed to isolate anthocyanin-derived compounds to further confirm their sensory impact in wines...|$|R

In this thesis we consider the reduction of p-cyclic branched covers of the projective K-line. Making certain assumptions on the branch locus we obtain a criterion for good reduction {{as well as an}} explicit <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the semi-stable reduction of such a cover. Furthermore we develop techniques to study the reduction of p-group covers in special cases. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} characterization <b>of</b> a multicomponent <b>fraction</b> {{is needed}} for the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> a complex mixture (PVT data) or of a solution constituted by the complex mixture and a solvent, as in a solvent extraction. The <b>description</b> and prediction <b>of</b> the phase behavior needs some information on the components and their compositions and some physical properties. In this work three different approaches are presented which differ in the information available about the global composition. All the approaches {{are based on the}} use of Henry constants determined by Inverse Gas Chromatographic technique for the representation of the mixture, for the determination of binary interaction parameters of a thermodynamic model (EOS) and for <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the phase behavior <b>of</b> petroleum <b>fractions...</b>|$|R
