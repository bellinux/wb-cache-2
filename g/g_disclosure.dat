40|$|Objective Transparent {{evidence-based}} {{decision making}} {{has been promoted}} worldwide to engender trust in science and policy making. Yet, {{little attention has been}} given to transparency implementation. The degree of transparency (focused on how uncertain evidence was handled) during the development of folate and vitamin D Dietary Reference Values was explored in three a priori defined areas: (i) value request; (ii) evidence evaluation; and (iii) final values. Design Qualitative case studies (semi-structured interviews and desk research). A common protocol was used for data collection, interview thematic analysis and reporting. Results were coordinated via cross-case synthesis. Setting Australia and New Zealand, Netherlands, Nordic countries, Poland, Spain and UK. Subjects Twenty-one interviews were conducted in six case studies. Results Transparency of process was not universally observed across countries or areas of the recommendation setting process. Transparency practices were most commonly seen surrounding the request to develop reference values (e. g. access to risk manager/assessor problem formulation discussions) and evidence evaluation (e. <b>g.</b> <b>disclosure</b> of risk assessor data sourcing/evaluation protocols). Fewer transparency practices were observed to assist with handling uncertainty in the evidence base during the development of quantitative reference values. Conclusions Implementation of transparency policies may be limited by a lack of dedicated resources and best practice procedures, particularly to assist with the latter stages of reference value development. Challenges remain regarding the best practice for transparently communicating the influence of uncertain evidence on the final reference values. Resolving this issue may assist the evolution of nutrition risk assessment and better inform the recommendation setting process...|$|E
40|$|Objective Provide an {{orientation}} to psychoneuroimmunology, {{a rationale for}} including assessments of immune function in intervention studies of pediatric chronic illness, review the current literature, and provide recommendations for future research. Methods Using electronic searches and previous reviews, selected and reviewed published studies in which immunological changes related to psychological interventions were assessed in pediatric samples. Results Eight studies were identified and included in the review. These utilized a range of interventions (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>disclosure</b> and hypnosis) and included a variety of pediatric samples (e. g., those with asthma, HIV infection, or lupus). Conclusions Results suggest that psychological intervention can influence immune function in pediatric samples. Recommendations for advancing our knowledge by studying populations for whom the immune system plays {{an active role in}} disease pathophysiology, measuring disease-relevant immune mediators, studying pediatric patients under times of stress, and focusing on interventions aimed at altering the stress system are provided. Key words intervention; pediatric chronic illness; psychoneuroimmunology; review. The field of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) has grown dramatically {{over the past three decades}} as researchers and the lay public have become increasingly interested in the bi-directional associations between psychological and biological processes, as well as in the intriguing hypothesis that psychological factors influence disease initiation and course (Lovallo, 2005; Rabin, 1999). Researchers have sought to determine associations between psychological factors (e. g., stress, depression, hostility, and optimism) and diseases (e. g., hypertension, cancer, asthma, and the common cold), as well as between psychological factors and specific biological processes (e. g., biological stress response and immune function) that underlie medical conditions and might mediate the association between psychological factors and disease (see reviews by Herbert & Cohen, 1993 a,b...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) -positive adolescents face {{a number of}} challenges in dealing with their disease, treatment, and developmental tasks. This qualitative study describes {{some of the reasons}} why, and the extent to which, adolescents may or may not disclose their condition to others. METHODS: A semistructured interview lasting 40 - 110 minutes was conducted with each of 29 adolescents 12 - 20 years old, 22 female and seven male) living in Switzerland. Interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim. The analysis of the content of interviews allowed us to identify salient topics (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>disclosure),</b> which were then explored in detail. RESULTS: Of 29 participants, eight had not disclosed their condition to anyone outside the family, 19 had disclosed it to good friends, and 16 had disclosed it to some teachers. Four participants had engaged in public disclosure, and six of 10 sexually active teenagers disclosed their status to their partners. The attitudes toward disclosure among younger adolescents were mostly related to those of the parents, particularly the mother. Older adolescents, engaged in their search for autonomy, tended to decide independently what to say and to whom. Although foster/adoptive parents would often encourage disclosure, biological parents, especially HIV-positive mothers, insisted on not disclosing the adolescent's status for fear of stigma. CONCLUSION: The health care team should systematically address the issue of disclosure with the adolescent and his family (or foster parents), the aim being to balance the right of the adolescent and that adolescent's family to maintain privacy against the concerns of sexual partners, as well as the adolescent's interest in divulging HIV status to relatives, school staff, and friends...|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} has shown improvements in analysts’ forecast accuracy around various events (e. <b>g.,</b> new <b>disclosure</b> regulations or cross-listings), but these studies do not consider {{a change in the}} composition and ability of the analysts providing forecasts over time. By studying foreign firms cross-listing on U. S. stock exchanges, we find that analyst composition changes by more than 50 percent during the three-year period around cross-listing. We show that cross-listing is associated with a shift away from analysts who are less accurate forecasters and toward analysts who are more accurate forecasters. This shift in analyst composition accounts for a significant improvement, of 9. 5 percent, in analyst forecast accuracy. In addition, we document that changes in both analyst ability and public information disclosure affect analyst forecast accuracy around cross-listing. Our results indicate that researchers should control for changes in analyst composition and ability when measuring the impact of specific events on analyst forecast accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Background: Practising {{physicians}} frequently {{seek advice}} on the most effective interventions for dementia. In this article, we provide practical guidance on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions {{for the management of}} mild to moderate dementia based on recommendations from the Third Canadian Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia. Methods: We developed evidence-based guidelines using systematic literature searches, with specific criteria for the selection and quality assessment of articles, and a clear and transparent decision-making process. We selected articles published from January 1996 to December 2005 that dealt with the management of mild to moderate stages of Alzheimer disease and other forms of dementia. Recommendations based on the literature review were drafted and voted on. Consensus required 80 % or more agreement by participants. Subsequent to the conference, we searched for additional articles published from January 2006 to April 2008 using the same major keywords and secondary search terms. We graded the strength of the evidence using the criteria of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Results: We identified 1615 articles, of which 954 were selected for further study. From a synthesis of the evidence in these studies, we made 48 recommendations for the management of mild to moderate dementia (28) and dementia with a cerebrovascular component (8) as well as recommendations for addressing ethical issues (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>disclosure</b> of the diagnosis) (12). The updated literature review did not change these recommendations. An exercise program is recommended for patients with mild to moderate dementia. Physicians should decide whether to prescribe a cholinesterase inhibitor on an individual basis, balancing anticipated benefits with the potential for harm. For mild mood and behavioural concerns, nonpharmacologic approaches should be considered first. Interpretation: Although the available therapies for dementia can help with the management of symptoms, {{there is a need to}} develop more effective interventions...|$|E
40|$|In a {{decentralized}} setting, are policy targets {{imposed by}} the central government on local elected officials effective? And when? We address these questions in Italy, where the central government has set a target for childcare coverage at the municipal level for Southern regions of Italy since 2007. We first implement a difference-in-differences estimator where the municipalities already complying with the target comprise the control group. We then implement a triple-difference estimator with the additional control group of municipalities in the bordering Central regions. Our results show that elected officials comply with the target only when it is coherent with voters' preferences (as measured by {{the characteristics of the}} resident female population) rather than political incentives (as measured by partisan alignment among levels of government). The policy implications of our findings are that central targets are ineffective unless they are complemented with policies sustaining local demand (e. g., tax allowances) or penalizing local government that do not comply (e. <b>g.,</b> full <b>disclosure</b> and yardstick competition) ...|$|R
40|$|Data Integration Systems (DIS) are {{concerned}} with integrating data from multiple data sources to resolve user queries. Typically, organisations providing data sources specify security policies that impose stringent requirements on the collection, processing, and disclosure of personal and sensitive data. If the security policies were not correctly enforced by the integration component of DIS, the data is exposed to data leakage threats, e. <b>g.</b> unauthorised <b>disclosure</b> or secondary use of the data. SecureDIS is a framework that helps system designers to mitigate data leakage threats during the early phases of DIS development. SecureDIS provides designers {{with a set of}} informal guidelines written in natural language to specify and enforce security policies that capture confidentiality, privacy, and trust properties.

40|$|Aims: To {{elucidate}} psychosocial {{and ethical}} issues faced by adults {{at risk for}} alpha- 1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) that have received little attention. Methods: Eleven individuals with AATD were interviewed in detail for 2 hours each. Results: Several specific aspects of AATD created critical, socially dynamic issues that shaped the patients' responses. The disease being relatively newly discovered, physicians do not know much about it and thus often do not consider or recommend testing for it. Hence, patients who may benefit from diagnosis and treatment are not always diagnosed. General practitioners, when they do diagnose patients, often refer them to specialists and thus remain inexperienced in treating the disorder. As a result, many individuals, too, remain unaware of this disease in their families and thus do not consider mentioning its possibility to doctors or family members. Thus, intrafamilial disclosures by patients become critical. Patients may be shocked and upset at diagnosis, as they might possibly already have transmitted the mutation to offspring, which further impedes disclosure to family members. Conclusions: These issues highlight how patients' interactions with doctors and others concerning genetics are critical, {{and need to be}} further explored and addressed. Several aspects of physician education and practice (e. <b>g.,</b> regarding <b>disclosures</b> to at-risk family members) need to be improved...|$|R

40|$|How {{does the}} {{development}} of financial markets change the interaction between banks and corporations? This paper compares the importance of interlocking boards of directors between corporations and banks in Brazil, Mexico and the United States circa 1909. The hypothesis tested is that {{the development of}} financial markets and the institutions that accompany it (e. <b>g.</b> financial <b>disclosure</b> rules, investor protections, etc) allows corporations to rely less on connections to banks. There are two hypotheses tested in this work. First, bankers were less central in Brazil than in Mexico and the United States. Second, the availability of other financing options reduced the importance of bank connections for corporations in Brazil and Mexico. I test these hypotheses using network analysis and a simple multivariate regression that explains bank connections. I use comparable business directories to create databases with names of directors and financial information for all major corporations for Mexico and Brazil in 1909. The findings show that using different centrality measures, connections between banks and corporations were less important in Brazil than in Mexico and the United States. Also, in Brazil, the availability of bonds as a way to obtain financing allowed corporations to reduce their average number of bank connections drastically, while in Mexico, the access that foreign companies had to external financial markets reduced their average bank connections in...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{availability}} of climate change information, offered to scientists and policy makers through climate services. However, climate services are not well {{taken up by the}} policy-making and planning community. Climate services focus on primary impacts of climate change, e. <b>g.,</b> the <b>disclosure</b> of precipitation and temperature data, and this seems insufficient in meeting their needs. In this paper, we argue that, in order to reach the spatial planning community, climate services should take on a wider perspective by translating climate data to policy-relevant indicators and by offering support in the design of adaptation strategies. We argue there should be more focus on translating consequences of climate change to land-use claims and subsequently discuss the validity, consequences and implications of these claims with stakeholders, so they can play a role in spatial planning processes where much of the climate adaptation takes place. The term Climate Adaptation Services is introduced as being a stepwise approach supporting the assessment of vulnerability in a wider perspective and include the design and appraisal of adaptation strategies in a multi-stakeholder setting. We developed the Climate Adaptation Atlas and the Climate Ateliers as tools within the Climate Adaptation Services approach to support decision-making and planning processes.

40|$|Intelligence whistleblowers are {{generally}} Intelligence Community (IC) employees or contractors who bring to light allegations of agency wrongdoings by, for example, disclosing information on such wrongdoings to congressional intelligence committees. Such disclosures can aid oversight of, or help curb misconduct within, intelligence agencies. However, intelligence whistleblowers could face retaliation from their employers for their disclosures, {{and the fear}} of such retaliation may deter whistleblowing. Congress and President Obama have taken measures to protect certain intelligence whistleblowers from retaliation, and thereby seemingly encourage these whistleblowers to disclose information on agency wrongdoing. These measures are the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA), Presidential Policy Directive 19 (PPD- 19), and Title VI of the Intelligence Authorization Act of 2014 (Title VI). Each of these measures details what disclosures fall within the scope of its protections, which generally include certain disclosures through government channels (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>disclosures</b> to agency inspectors general or congressional intelligence committees). None of these measures protect against retaliation or potential criminal liability arising from disclosures to media sources. The ICWPA applies to both IC employees and contractors, whereas PPD- 19 and Title VI appear to apply only to IC employees. The ICWPA is the oldest of the three intelligence whistleblower protections and, of the three, provides the least amount of protection to those falling within its scope. The ICWPA does not explicitly prohibit retaliation against IC whistleblowers. Rather, it outlines procedures through which whistleblowers can disclose to the congressional intelligence committees information on “urgent concerns,” such as violations of law or false statements to Congress. The ICWPA further contains no explicit mechanism for obtaining a remedy for retaliation stemming from disclosure of an urgent concern to Congress. It merely allows an IC whistleblower who has faced an adverse personnel action because he disclosed an urgent concern to the congressional intelligence committees to then use the ICWPA’s disclosure procedures to inform the committees of the retaliation. PPD- 19, unlike the ICWPA, expressly prohibits an IC employee from taking an adverse personnel action or security clearance determination against another employee because of a protected disclosure. It additionally requires intelligence agencies to develop procedures for internally investigating, through agency Inspectors General, allegations of impermissible retaliation. After finding that impermissible retaliation has occurred, Inspectors General can recommend that agency heads take corrective action. When an employee has exhausted the internal review procedures that must be established under PPD- 19, he can appeal to the Director of National Intelligence, who then has the discretion to convene a review panel. If it finds that improper retaliation occurred, the review panel can recommend that the agency head take remedial action. Title VI seemingly codifies, and expands upon, some of the protections of PPD- 19. Its protections, and modes of enforcement, differ {{depending on the type of}} retaliation alleged. More specifically, Title VI’s protected disclosures and enforcement methods in the context of allegations of adverse personnel action are distinct from its protected disclosures and enforcement methods for allegations of adverse security clearance or information access determinations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDual-listed firms {{simultaneously}} {{follow the}} relevant rules {{in their home}} country and in their cross-listed country. In contrast, other firms only listed in the cross-listed country are only subject to the local regulations. Previous literature has found evidence that cross-listing can improve firms’ information transparency because of more stringent listing rules in the cross-listed country. The existing research, however, has not paid enough attention to the potential influence of dual-listed firms and their home country institutional factors (e. <b>g.</b> unique <b>disclosure</b> policies) on other firms only listed in the cross-listed country (i. e. spillover effect). In the Hong Kong market, Chinese dual-listed firms are under the mandatory profit warning regulation of mainland China, but other firms listed only in Hong Kong only need to follow the voluntary disclosure rule of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Such a setting provides us {{with the opportunity to}} investigate a spillover effect, i. e. whether these Chinese dual-listed firms influence their peers only listed in Hong Kong to release profit warnings. We find that firms only listed in Hong Kong are more likely to issue profit warnings if their Chinese dual-listed peers have also issued warnings. We further find that this spillover effect increases with the market capitalization of Chinese dual-listed firms and increases with the market share of these firms before they dominate the industry. Lastly, due to an underlying duty to disclose material information in Hong Kong, the spillover effect is weaker for firms with large earnings surprises...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies block {{trades and}} tender offers as {{alternative}} means for transferring corporate control in firms with a dominant minority blockholder and an otherwise dispersed ownership structure. Incumbent and new controlling parties strictly prefer to trade the controlling block. From a social point of view, however, {{this method is}} inferior to tender offers, because it preserves {{a low level of}} ownership concentration which induces more inefficient extraction of private control benefits. This discrepancy is caused by the free-riding behaviour of small shareholders. Moreover, the controlling block trades at a premium which reflects, in part, the surplus that the incumbent and the acquirer realize by avoiding a tender offer and the consequent transfer to small shareholders. Therefore, factors that alter the pay-offs of small shareholders in a tender offer (e. <b>g.</b> supermajority rules, <b>disclosure</b> rules and non-voting shares) also alter the block premium. Finally, the paper argues that greenmail, like block trading, enables the controlling parties to preserve low levels of ownership concentration and large private control benefits. block premia; greenmail; takeover regulation; tender offers...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} how to engage customers socially in the full-service restaurant industry. More specifically, based on the existing theoretical background, it was hypothesized that server disclosure induces customer disclosure. By a literature review, it was further hypothesized that server disclosure and customer disclosure influence trust, which in turn positively affects commitment and loyalty. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed hypotheses were empirically tested using data collected from 287 full-service restaurant patrons. Structural equation modeling was conducted to empirically test the proposed theoretical hypotheses and evaluate the proposed conceptual model. Findings – Based on the data analysis results, server disclosure was found to be a key predictor of customer disclosure. In addition, server disclosure and customer disclosure aid in the creation of trust, and can thus help to enhance commitment and loyalty. The theory building process revealed that gender is a significant moderator. Practical implications – First, restaurant managers need to develop a systematic training program which would help restaurant servers attain adequate knowledge of their job. Furthermore, the restaurant servers must know the importance of frankness when providing services; a frank confession is the key to understanding the minds of people. Finally, restaurant managers are required to hire employees with an outgoing and likeable personality because they are more likely to induce customer disclosure. To achieve this, restaurant managers should conduct in-depth interviews or personality tests in the recruiting process, which help clarify an applicant’s personal traits. Originality/value – Social penetration theory was applied to identify the relationship between server disclosure and customer disclosure, as it is first attempted in the hospitality industry. In addition, this study separated mutual disclosure into two subdimensions (e. <b>g.</b> server <b>disclosure</b> and customer disclosure) and investigated the impact of these two subdimensions.

We explore and compare socio-cultural issues that shape EoL care in seven European countries and critically appraise the existing research evidence on cultural issues in EoL care generated in the different countries. Methods: We scoped the literature for Germany, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Portugal, carrying out electronic searches in 16 international and country-specific databases and handsearches in 17 journals, bibliographies of relevant papers and webpages. We analysed the literature which was unearthed, in its entirety and by type (reviews, original studies, opinion pieces) and conducted quantitative analyses for each country and across countries. Qualitative techniques generated themes and sub-themes. Results: A total of 868 papers were reviewed. The following themes facilitated cross-country comparison: setting, caregivers, communication, medical EoL decisions, minority ethnic groups, and knowledge, attitudes and values of death and care. The frequencies of themes varied considerably between countries. Sub-themes reflected issues characteristic for specific countries (e. <b>g.</b> culture-specific <b>disclosure</b> in the southern European countries). The work from the seven European countries concentrates on cultural traditions and identities, and there was almost no evidence on ethnic minorities. Conclusion: This scoping review is the first comparative exploration of the cultural differences in the understanding of EoL care in these countries. The diverse body of evidence that was identified on socio-cultural issues in EoL care, reflects clearly distinguishable national cultures of EoL care, with differences in meaning, priorities, and expertise in each country. The diverse ways that EoL care is understood and practised forms a necessary part of what constitutes best evidence for the improvement of EoL care in the future. © 2012 Gysels et al...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Although {{the goal}} of {{pervasive}} data sharing has persisted for over a decade, most large-scale efforts fail to reach the critical mass of participation necessary to sustain it due to the excessive costs involved. These costs often stem {{from the lack of}} standardized methodology and tools to implement disclosure controls that address data sharing risks. We present a framework that addresses the problem comprehensively by considering policy level risk (e. g., NDAs) and technical (e. <b>g.,</b> data anonymization) <b>disclosure</b> control issues in concert. Doing so facilitates a superior balance of utility and risk mitigation by ensuring that policy and technical approaches complement one another. Moreover, the framework is driven by the pragmatic utility goals of the data release rather than general risk factors, which helps to focus the effort on exactly those parts of the data necessary to achieve desired goals. The output of the framework is a standardized audit trail and description of the data sharing scenario, which enables the reuse of key components in other data sharing efforts. The framework greatly decreases the data publisher’s overall costs while simultaneously enabling a more evolved and effective balance between utility and risk management in data sharing. I...|$|R

Advances in technology, {{as well as}} regulatory and legislative actions (e. <b>g.,</b> Regulation Fair <b>Disclosure,</b> Sarbanes-Oxley, new NYSE and NASDAQ requirements) have led {{to an increase in}} the quantity of information available to the public. In this dissertation, I describe two experiments that examine the effects of information quantity and consistency (holding information quality constant) on the judgments and trading behavior of unsophisticated investors. I find that increasing the quantity and the consistency of information causes unsophisticated investors to show greater confidence and trading aggressiveness. This relation is not explained by an increase in cognitive effort, suggesting a direct effect of information quantity on confidence. The effect of increased quantity reduces investors' expected and actual wealth in simulated experimental markets, while the effect of consistency on wealth depends on whether the additional, low-quality signals are consistent or inconsistent with the high-quality signal investors receive. Results highlight possible negative consequences of increased disclosure, and suggest directions for future experimental and archival research.

40|$|As the web moves {{increasingly}} towards publishing data, {{a significant}} challenge arises when integrating data from diverse sources that have heterogeneous security and privacy policies and requirements. Data Integration Systems (DIS) {{are concerned with}} integrating data from multiple data sources to resolve users' queries. DIS are prone to data leakage threats, e. <b>g.</b> unauthorised <b>disclosure</b> or secondary use of the data, that compromise the data's confidentiality and privacy. We claim that these threats are caused by the failure to implement or correctly employ confidentiality and privacy techniques, and by the failure to consider the trust levels of system entities, {{from the very start}} of system development. Data leakage also results from a failure to capture or implement the security policies imposed by the data providers on the collection, processing, and disclosure of personal and sensitive data. This research proposes a novel framework, called SecureDIS, to mitigate data leakage threats in DIS. Unlike existing approaches that secure such systems, SecureDIS helps software engineers to lessen data leakage threats during the early phases of DIS development. It comprises six components that represent a conceptualised DIS architecture: data and data sources, security policies, integration approach, integration location, data consumers, and System Security Management (SSM). Each component contains a set of informal guidelines written in natural language to be used by software engineers who build and design a DIS that handles sensitive and personal data. SecureDIS has undergone two rounds of review by experts to conrm its validity, resulting in the guidelines being evaluated and extended. Two approaches were adopted to ensure that SecureDIS is suitable for software engineers. The first was to formalise the guidelines by modelling a DIS with the SecureDIS security policies using Event-B formal methods. This verified the correctness and consistency of the model. The second approach assessed SecureDIS's applicability to a real data integration project by using a case study. The case study addressed the experts' concerns regarding the ability to apply the proposed guidelines in practice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background As more {{patients}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) reach adulthood {{and participate in}} age-appropriate activities (e. <b>g.</b> employment, dating), <b>disclosure</b> of medical status becomes more important. This study assessed rates of disclosure and its perceived impact on relationships using the Adult Data for Understanding Lifestyle and Transitions (ADULT) online survey. Methods Adults with CF participated in the survey via the United States national network of CF Centers. Descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized. Results Participants (n = 865) {{were more likely to}} disclose to relatives (94 %) and close friends (81 %) than to dating partners (73 %), bosses/supervisors/teachers (51 %) or co-workers (39 %). Respondents generally reported a neutral/positive effect on relationships following disclosure. Negative effects of disclosure were infrequent, but more likely with dating partners or bosses/supervisors/teachers. Results also indicated that disclosure may be influenced by severity of lung disease and gender, with those having normal/mild lung disease less likely to disclose their diagnosis to both co-workers (p Conclusions Most adults with CF disclosed their disease to relatives and close friends. Individuals with severe CF lung disease were more likely to disclose their diagnosis to coworkers and supervisors/teachers. It may be helpful to provide support for disclosure of disease in situations such as employment and dating. </p...|$|R
40|$|Public health {{agencies}} face considerable challenges {{trying to prevent}} overweight and obesity in society, primarily because a person 2 ̆ 7 s own behavior is often {{the root cause of}} the disease. Individuals make personal choices about their diet, exercise, and lifestyle, so disease is often thought of as a matter of personal, not governmental, responsibility. This Commentary shows how law {{can be used as a}} tool to prevent overweight and obesity (see Table). The tools discussed in this article include: - <b>Disclosure</b> - e. <b>g.,</b> labels and consumer information - Tort liability - e. <b>g.,</b> inadequate <b>disclosure</b> of risks, misleading advertisements, and targeting children - Surveillance - e. g., reporting of glycosylated hemoglobin for diabetes management - Targeting children and adolescents - e. g., restricting food advertising during children 2 ̆ 7 s programs; counter advertising to promote good nutrition and physical activity; limiting the use of cartoon characters; and restricting web-based games and promotions - Taxation of unhealthy food - e. g., 2 ̆ 2 junk food, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 snack, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Twinkie 2 ̆ 2 tax provides disincentive for purchasing calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods; tax revenue could also be used to promote healthy nutrition - School policies - e. g., require schools to adhere to dietary guidelines and portion size; increase opportunities for nutrition education and physical activities - Built Environment - e. g., limit fast food restaurants, build recreational parks and bike paths, expand mass transportation, and provide lighting and playgrounds in housing developments - Food Prohibitions - e. g., ban trans fat from restaurants Despite the undoubted political risks, should public {{health agencies}} push for strong measures to control obesity, perhaps even banning hazardous foods? The justification lies with the epidemic rates of overweight and obesity, the preventable morbidity and mortality, and the stark health disparities based on race and socioeconomic status. Although the public dislikes paternalism, it is at least worth considering whether such an approach is ever justified to regulate harms that are apparently self-imposed, but which are deeply socially embedded and pervasively harmful to the public...|$|R
40|$|This study {{distinguishes between}} {{incremental}} and relative information content. Incremental comparisons ask whether one accounting measure provides information content beyond that provided by another, and apply when one measure {{is viewed as}} given and an assessment is desired regarding the incremental contribution of another (e. <b>g.,</b> a supplemental <b>disclosure).</b> Relative comparisons ask which measure has greater information content, and apply when making mutually exclusive choices among alternatives, or when rankings by information content are desired (e. g., when comparing alternative disclosures). Questions of both incremental and relative information content arise frequently in accounting. However, few previous studies have examined questions of relative information content. Possible explanations include unfamiliarity with the relative versus incremental distinction, and the additional statistical complexity involved in testing for relative information content. First, we examine analytically the relation between incremental and relative information content, demonstrating that they address different research questions and require different tests for statistical significance. Second, we identify accounting research contexts in which questions of relative and incremental information content arise. Third, we propose a new regression-based test for relative information content. This test applies to both returns and valuation studies, generalizes to any number of predictor variables, {{and can be used}} in conjunction with White's (1980) adjustment for heteroskedasticity. Fourth, we illustrate tests for relative and incremental information content in a familiar research setting that compares the information contents of net income, cash flows, and net sales in 40 industries. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Adolescents {{are among}} the highest users of {{technology}} and are typically early adopters of new technologies, including internet, mobile phones, social media and other devices. However, currently there is little understanding {{of the impact of}} technology use on adolescents’ relationships with their parents and family. Such an understanding is critical given that a warm, loving relationship with parents, along with experiencing effective parenting are key factors in both protecting adolescents from developing behavioural difficulties and for promoting their positive development. This study aimed to investigate the influence of technology on the parent-adolescent relationship, parenting practices and behavioural outcomes of adolescents (behavioural difficulties and social competence). One hundred and fourteen parents of adolescents (aged 11 – 18 years) completed an online survey. It was hypothesised that high adolescent and parent technology use and technology dependence would be associated with poor parent-adolescent relationships, ineffective parenting practices and poor adolescent outcomes. Similarly, it was hypothesised that lower levels of technology dependence and use would be associated with the development of adolescent social competence. As expected parenting practices (e. <b>g.</b> involvement, spontaneous <b>disclosure,</b> discipline processes) and aspects of the parent-adolescent relationship (hostility and connectedness) were important for the development of adolescents. Mixed support was found for the influence of technology. Adolescent and parent use of technology and parental dependence did not predict adolescent outcomes or the parent-adolescent relationship. However, adolescent dependence on technology was associated with lower social competence and more adolescent behavioural problems. Further, these effects were mediated by hostility suggesting that technology has the potential to negatively impact parentadolescent relationships and in turn adolescent outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to study whether Human Resource Practices (HRP) {{disclosure}} in sustainability reports of Financial Services Sector (FSS) firms comply with G 3 guidelines. The paper raises issue on compliance of practices with G 3 because it is considered as a generally acceptable reporting framework by many organisations around the world and expects firms to provide consistent and comparable information in sustainability reports. To measure compliance it compares HRP disclosure with the <b>disclosure</b> guidelines in <b>G</b> 3 and then compliance between firms within a region and between regions, namely: Europe, Asia and 'Others'. Using content analysis the paper measures HRP <b>disclosure</b> compliance with <b>G</b> 3 standard <b>disclosures</b> between companies in the financial service sector within region and between regions and (ii) then uses hierarchical regression analysis to investigate the determinants of the compliance level. The paper reveals that the level of compliance with G 3 by FSS firms is higher in Europe than in Asia or the 'Others' region. The regression analysis suggests that region, strength of reporting, ethical behaviour of firm, labour/employer relations and capacity of the firms to innovate are the main explanatory variables of HRP disclosures in the FSS firms. Findings of this study would be useful to potential employees, trade unions as well as national regulators and international organisations such as the International Labour Organisations (ILOs) and the OECD. This study also infers that good corporate communication on HRP maintains good labour/employer relationshipGriffith Business School, Department of Accounting, Finance and EconomicsFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Understanding {{students}} 2 ̆ 7 {{perceptions of}} {{and responses to}} lapses in professionalism is important to shaping students 2 ̆ 7 professional development. OBJECTIVE: Utilize realistic, standardized professional dilemmas to obtain insight into students 2 ̆ 7 reasoning and motivations in 2 ̆ 2 real time. 2 ̆ 2 DESIGN: Qualitative study using 5 videotaped scenarios (each depicting a student placed in a situation which requires action {{in response to a}} professional dilemma) and individual interviews, in which students were questioned about what they would do next and why. SETTING: University of Toronto. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen fourth-year medical students; participation voluntary and anonymous. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: A model to explain students 2 ̆ 7 reasoning in the face of professional dilemmas. RESULTS: Grounded theory analysis of interview transcripts revealed that students were motivated to consider specific actions by referencing a Principle (an abstract or idealized concept), an Affect (a feeling or emotion), or an Implication (a potential consequence of suggested actions). Principles were classified as 2 ̆ 2 avowed 2 ̆ 2 as ideals of our profession (e. <b>g.,</b> honesty or <b>disclosure),</b> or 2 ̆ 2 unavowed 2 ̆ 2 (unacknowledged or undeclared, e. g., obedience or allegiance). Implications could also be avowed (e. g., concerning patients) or unavowed (e. g., concerning others); but students were predominantly motivated by considering 2 ̆ 2 disavowed 2 ̆ 2 implications: those pertaining to themselves (e. g., concern for grades, evaluations, or reputation), which are actively denied by the profession and discouraged as being inconsistent with altruism. CONCLUSIONS: This 2 ̆ 2 disavowed curriculum 2 ̆ 2 has implications for education, feedback, and evaluation. Instead of denying their existence, we should teach students how to negotiate and balance these unavowed and disavowed implications and principles, in order to help them develop their own professional stance...|$|R
