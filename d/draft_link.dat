Focusing on defining and unbundling key governance components, such as rule of law, voice and accountability, corruption control, and state capture, we then provide evidence which suggests a sobering picture: on average, {{there appears to}} be scant progress worldwide in recent times in improving rule of law and governance, in controlling corruption, and in improving institutional quality [...] although there is clearly variance across countries. Further, recent empirical research points to the private sector as influencing public governance, thereby challenging traditional notions of the functioning of politicians, public policy and the public sector, and on the conventional determinants of the investment climate. We posit that the interplay between the elite’s vested interests and the political dynamics within a country, in turn affecting governance and corruption, has often been under-emphasized in program design. These argue for revisiting conventional approaches to promote institutional reform. In particular, we challenge the notion that passing laws by fiat, creating new public institutions, or embarking on anti-corruption 'campaigns', can be very effective, and question the value of traditional public sector management and conventional legal/judiciary reform approaches for many emerging economies.

50|$|Banks {{may also}} create an {{acceptance}} credit facility allowing {{a company to}} issue time <b>drafts</b> not <b>linked</b> to specific shipments {{in order to provide}} general working capital finance. Under the arrangement the issuing company presents bills of exchange to the bank for acceptance, confirmation and sale at a discount to face value (representing the finance cost until maturity). The discounted sum is made available to the issuing company until the bill's maturity when it is obliged to repay the bill's full face value to the bank. The process may then be repeated to provide a so-called rolling facility. While popular in the pre-electronic era, such facilities have since been widely replaced by financing arrangements which do not require the issue of paper.|$|R

In particular, we challenge the notion that passing laws by fiat, creating new public institutions, or embarking on anti-corruption 'campaigns', can be very effective, and question the value of traditional public sector management and conventional legal/judiciary reform approaches for many emerging economies. We argue instead that sharper focus on external accountability is required, focusing on: transparency mechanisms and empirically-based monitoring tools (including e*governance), as well as participatory 'voice' and incentive-driven approaches for prevention. These need to feature more prominently in providing checks and balances on traditional public institutions, in empowering non-traditional stakeholders, and in ameliorating state capture and mitigating the very ‘unequal influence' playing field in many countries. In turn, this necessitates probing deeper into the private-public governance nexus, which inter alia leads to focusing on concrete measures to address the challenges of political contestability, political financing reform, and transparency in parliaments, the judiciary and the executive.

These services present highly demanding real-time {{requirements that}} need great bandwidths {{in order to}} provide acceptable quality levels. Meanwhile, the variety of network architectures employed by final users to access these contents is wider and wider.

The inherent dynamic nature of these networks entails the use of appropriate routing protocols in order to obtain good performance in the services supported by the system.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method {{that is based on}} {{enterprise}} core competitiveness to reengineer a procurement and supplier management system. Competition of the notebook industry {{is becoming more and more}} intense, with the uncertainty of demand, the vast number of different components and their rapid change in design result in a very complicated supply chain. From the viewpoint of cost, the cost of components is at least 70 % of the total cost of a notebook; therefore, components management is very important for improving the competitiveness of an enterprise. In this research, our focus is on the procurement and supplier management reengineering to improve competitiveness. The proposed methodology considers the overall view of the entire enterprise and the long term optimization perspective to reengineer the procurement and supplier management system. The Difference Analysis method is used to check the differences of the enterprise performance and the required measures of the key success factors. Based on Difference Analysis, the strategies for procurement and supplier management can be generated. Then, the Balance Scorecard and the Strategy Map can be introduced to <b>draft</b> and <b>link</b> each perspective goal of procurement and supplier management. Finally, the Perspective Analysis of Architecture of Integrated Information System (ARIS) is used for deployment from the business management perspective to the operational perspective. In conclusion, the reengineering method is linked to the enterprise core competitiveness, and then, down to the procurement and supplier management operation system in order to continually improve an enterprise’s performance. In order to verify the practicability of the proposed methodology, an Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) notebook company in Taiwan is used to apply the reengineering methodology...|$|R

(The Kidd brothers designed Buffalo's Rand Building, built in 1929 and located at Lafayette Square.) In May 1938, the brothers were hired as architects for the music hall. However, their designs were criticized by Esther Link, who had been shown the Kidd drawings by Buffalo Foundation lawyer, Edward P. Letchworth. Link, without any formal architectural education, was a high school music teacher who had travelled in Europe, and had a strong familiarity with architects and artists. She was an admirer of architect Eliel Saarinen, particularly for his design of the central railroad terminal in Helsinki.

Although several knee-specific instruments exist, no patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure correlates function with improved stability, motion, satisfaction, and confidence. ObjectiveTo address both the above limitations by developing a PRO measure to assess the phenomenon of a “normal” knee after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). MethodsA <b>draft</b> conceptual model <b>linking</b> the impact of clinical mechanics to hypothesized functional outcomes was generated after a literature review of available assessment tools. Participants aged 18 to 80 years having undergone TKA within the past 10 to 18 months were identified and screened by clinical sites to participate in phase  1 focus groups or phase 2 in-depth interviews. Participants were asked to describe their TKA experiences, including how their knee feels now, followed by cognitive debriefing of Patient’s Knee Implant Performance (PKIP) draft items. ResultsPhase 1 results indicated that concepts of confidence, stability, and satisfaction in patients’ replacement knee when performing certain activities were distinct and important in the patients’ {{assessment of}} their TKA. Phase 2 efforts yielded a final version of the PKIP measure containing nine items assessing the broader concepts of stability, confidence, and satisfaction in association with activities. Presurgical and postsurgical versions of the measure were created. ConclusionsResults of this qualitative study support use of the PKIP as a complementary PRO measure to assess performance after primary TKA. Psychometric evaluation of the PKIP is planned...|$|R
