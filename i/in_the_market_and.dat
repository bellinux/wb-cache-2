5|$|Several ethnic {{minority}} communities have centred on Whitechapel Road. The road was {{a focal point}} of the Jewish Community from the 1850s to the 1930s, with many Jewish shops and market stalls. Towards {{the latter part of the}} 20th century, the street became an established settlement of the British Bangladeshi community, who now sell a range of authentic Asian food and clothes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> on shop fronts. Altab Ali Park sits on the site of the original church at the western end of Whitechapel Road, and is a memorial to an Asian worker who suffered a fatal racial attack in 1978.|$|E

5|$|In 2014 under {{chairman}} Tom Wheeler, the FCC {{began to}} increase its scrutiny {{regarding the use of}} such agreements—particularly joint sales—to evade its policies. On March 31, 2014, the commission voted to make joint sales agreements count as ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time for its partner, and to ban coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the top four stations in a market. Wheeler indicated that he planned to address local marketing and shared services agreements in the future. The change in stance also prompted changes to then-proposed acquisitions by Gray Television and Sinclair Broadcast Group, who, rather than use sharing agreements to control them, moved their existing programming and network affiliations to digital subchannels of existing company-owned stations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> then relinquished control over them by selling the stations to minority-owned broadcasters intending to operate them independently.|$|E

5|$|On 2 April 2002, SAS and Braathens split all {{the routes}} between them. SAS started flying on the main-haul routes from Oslo to Trondheim, Bergen and Stavanger, {{with only a}} few flights to Stavanger flown by Braathens to get planes to the {{technical}} base there. From Oslo and Trondheim to Northern Norway, all routes were taken over by Braathens, with exception of a few flights made by SAS to Tromsø and Bodø. SAS also withdrew their flights from Oslo to Kristiansand and Ålesund, and Braathens increased their frequency on the route. Braathens retained the routes it had flown where SAS had not formerly flown. Braathens also kept the international flights to Barcelona, Nice, Málaga and Alicante. This reduced the overcapacity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> allowed the SAS Group to save between NOK600 and 900 million.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 2014, Gray Television {{announced}} that it would shutter six stations and consolidate existing programming onto subchannels of Gray-owned stations in their respective market. Unlike Sinclair, however, Gray stated that it would sell the licenses of the shuttered stations to minority-owned broadcasters in collaboration with the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council – under the condition that they would operate them independently from other stations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> without the use of any sharing agreements. All six of the stations were owned by companies other than Gray, but their non-license assets are either owned by Gray, or were operated by stations now owned by Gray under agreements. Gray would operate the affected stations under LMAs until the sales and consolidation are complete. Aside from one, most of the stations involved in these changes were related to Gray's acquisition of stations from Hoak Media. Three of these stations were immediately shut down the same day, while the remainder remained operated by Gray until the sales were completed. Gray announced buyers for the stations on August 27, 2014.|$|E
