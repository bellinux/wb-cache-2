25|$|Because {{the leather}} is natural {{as well as}} delicate, the wearer must take {{precaution}} as to not damage them. The constant handling of damp or wet surfaces will discolor lighter-colored gloves and stiffen the leather of any glove. The wearer will often unknowingly damage or stain their gloves while doing such tasks as twisting a wet <b>door</b> <b>knob</b> or wiping a running nose with a gloved hand.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{several of}} hide's {{friends and colleagues}} stated that they {{believed}} the auto-strangulation {{to have been an}} accident, among them X Japan co-founder Yoshiki and former X bassist Taiji. This notion is supported by the fact that no suicide note was left and Taiji theorizes in his autobiography, that at the night of his death, hide may have been practicing a technique to relieve upper back and neck pains which guitarists can suffer from continuous use of a shoulder strap. The technique involved was practiced by the X Japan members during their touring days and required the use of a towel and a <b>door</b> <b>knob</b> or handle. According to Taiji, hide may have fallen asleep in his intoxicated state, becoming caught and strangling himself.|$|E
500|$|Germans {{entered the}} home that Creger and Slape were using as an {{observation}} post. Slape {{climbed into the}} attic, while Creger only had time to hide behind a door. He pulled the pin on a grenade as the <b>door</b> <b>knob</b> jammed into his ribs. Bullets from the I&R platoon struck the building, and the Germans suddenly left. Creger and Slape exited {{by the back door}} and ducked into a nearby cowshed. They crossed a field and then found themselves in a minefield. Picking their way forward, they circled through the woods until they encountered a handful of Germans. Opening fire, they killed them. Creger and Slape spotted Bouck and Milosevich across the road and sprinted towards them, drawing German fire. They made it back to their ridge-top position and Bouck called Regimental Headquarters. He requested artillery support, but when he reported the German column advancing on his position, the {{voice on the other end}} of the radio told him [...] "he must be seeing things". Bouck told them he had 20-20 vision and demanded artillery fire on the road in front of his unit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an underactuated gripper designed to unlatch <b>doors</b> <b>knobs</b> and handles. The challenge was to create a mechanism that could manipulate a variety of <b>door</b> <b>knobs</b> and handles while using only one motor {{in order to create a}} low cost device. The final design evolved by exploring the limitations in the performance of an initial gripper prototype. In this paper, the cause of failure for the first prototype is discussed along with rationale for the changes made in the second design. The final design was capable of twisting <b>door</b> <b>knobs</b> and handles in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. It had a collet-cone shape for compliance gripping and centering, and it utilized one motor for both gripping and twisting actions. The discussed gripper was developed for the assistive technology domain; however, this gripper mechanism could be utilized in a wide variety of robotic domains that exist today. 1...|$|R

60|$|Wolfenden did {{not answer}} her. As she passed through the doorway she glanced up at him; he was not even looking at her. His eyes were fixed upon Mr. Sabin.

She was not angry any longer. Instinctively {{some idea of the}} truth flashed in upon her; she passed out thoughtfully. Wolfenden closed the door and turned to Mr. Sabin.|$|E

The fellow was athletic and his quick side-movement indicated he {{was something of a}} boxer; the policeman was embarrassed by his handcuffs and young. Shillito seized him and threw him against the rails, close to the gap where the steps went down. The trooper gasped, his grasp got slack, and his body slipped along the rails. It looked as if Shillito would throw him down the steps, and Lister jumped.|$|E

60|$|The air seemed {{filled with}} the rush of something. The house quivered and vibrated, and they heard the {{thrumming}} of a mighty note of sound. The windows rattled. Two panes crashed; a draught of wind tore in, striking them and making them stagger. The door opposite banged shut, shattering the latch. The white <b>door</b> <b>knob</b> crumbled in fragments to the floor. The room's walls bulged like a gas balloon {{in the process of}} sudden inflation. Then came a new sound like the rattle of musketry, as the spray from a sea struck the wall of the house. Captain Lynch looked at his watch. It was four o'clock. He put on a coat of pilot cloth, unhooked the barometer, and stowed it away in a capacious pocket. Again a sea struck the house, with a heavy thud, and the light building tilted, twisted, quarter around on its foundation, and sank down, its floor at an angle of ten degrees.|$|E
