5000|$|New stamps were {{required}} because The Customs and Inland Revenue Act of 1881 necessitated stamps that were also valid as revenue stamps. Therefore, the Penny Lilac issued that year was inscribed [...] "POSTAGE AND INLAND REVENUE" [...] and the Lilac and Green stamps were inscribed [...] "POSTAGE & REVENUE", whereas the previous 1880 stamps (known as the Provisional Issue) were only inscribed [...] "POSTAGE". The colours were used because the authorities {{were concerned that}} the existing stamps were being soaked off envelopes and reused, and they wished to use fugitive inks that would wash away if immersed in water; the only <b>fugitive</b> <b>ink</b> colours {{available at the time}} were lilac and green.|$|E
40|$|Microstructured {{composite}} beams {{reinforced with}} complex three-dimensionally (3 D) patterned nanocomposite microfilaments are fabricated via nanocomposite infiltration of 3 D interconnected microfluidic networks. The manufacturing of the reinforced beams {{begins with the}} fabrication of microfluidic networks, which involves layer-by-layer deposition of <b>fugitive</b> <b>ink</b> filaments using a dispensing robot, filling the empty space between filaments using a low viscosity resin, curing the resin and finally removing the ink. Self-supported 3 D structures with other geometries and many layers (e. g. a few hundreds layers) could be built using this method. The resulting tubular microfluidic networks are then infiltrated with thermosetting nanocomposite suspensions containing nanofillers (e. g. single-walled carbon nanotubes), and subsequently cured. The infiltration is done by applying a pressure gradient between two ends of the empty network (either by applying a vacuum or vacuum-assisted microinjection). Prior to the infiltration, the nanocomposite suspensions are prepared by dispersing nanofillers into polymer matrices using ultrasonication and three-roll mixing methods. The nanocomposites (i. e. materials infiltrated) are then solidified under UV exposure/heat cure, resulting in a 3 D-reinforced composite structure. The technique presented here enables the design of functional nanocomposite macroscopi...|$|E

The ability to incorporate microvascular networks in functional materials systems is therefore both scientifically and technologically important. In this PhD thesis, the direct-write assembly of planar and 3 D biomimetic microvascular networks within polymer and hydrogel matrices is demonstrated. In addition, the influence of network design of fluid transport efficiency is characterized. 	Planar microvascular networks composed of periodic lattices of uniformal microchannels and hierarchical, branching architectures are constructed by direct-write assembly of a fugitive organic ink. Several advancements are required to facilitate their patterning, including pressure valving, dual ink printing, and dynamic pressure variation to allow tunable control of ink deposition. The hydraulic conductance is measured using a high pressure flow meter {{as a function of}} network design. For a constant vascular volume and areal coverage, 2 - and 4 -generation branched architectures that obey Murray's Law exhibited the highest hydraulic conductivity. These experimental observations are in good agreement with predictions made by analytic models. 	 3 D microvascular networks are fabricated by omnidirectional printing a fugitive organic ink into a photopolymerizable hydrogel matrix that is capped with fluid filler of nearly identical composition. Using this approach, 3 D networks of arbitrary design can be patterned. After ink deposition is complete, the matrix and fluid filler are chemically cross-linked via UV irradiation, and the ink is removed by liquefication. Aqueous solutions composed of a triblock copolymer of polyethylene oxide (PEO) -polypropylene oxide (PPO) -PEO constitute the materials system of choice due to their thermal- and concentration-dependent phase behavior. Specifically, the <b>fugitive</b> <b>ink</b> consists of a 23 w/w% PEO-PPO-PEO (Pluronic F 127) solution, while matrix (25 w/w%) and fluid filler (20 w/w%) are composed of an acrylate-modified form of the Pluronic F 127 that can be subsequently photopolymerized. The ink and matrix concentrations exceed the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 22 w/w% and thus reside in a physical gel state. At their respective concentrations, they possess an elastic plateau modulus G' > 104 Pa needed for ink filament formation, shape retention, and support during the printing process. By contrast, the fluid filler is formulated below the CMC to facilitate its flow into void spaces created as the nozzle translates through the matrix during printing. After printing is completed, photopolymerization is carried out to yield a chemically cross-linked matrix from which the <b>fugitive</b> <b>ink</b> is removed leaving behind the desired 3 D microvascular network. 	 Due to the potential application of 3 D microvasularized hydrogels in tissue engineering, dye diffusion through the cured Pluronic F 127 -diacrylate matrix is investigated via fluorescent microscopy. Image analysis is used to extract diffusion profiles of the dye as a function of time. Extraction of the 1 -D Gaussian fitting parameters is used to determine the spatial peak variance ÔÅ≥ 2 and plotted as a function of time to determine the dye diffusivity...|$|E

In addition, some countries have used water-soluble materials known as <b>fugitive</b> <b>inks</b> to prevent postage stamp reuse. Stamps of this type may be much lighter in color after being soaked.|$|R
5000|$|... 1883 and 1884 saw {{experimentation}} with stamps using <b>fugitive</b> <b>inks</b> with the 'Lilac and Green Issue'. These were rather plain designs, low values in lilac and high values in green, because {{those were the}} only colours available. They succeeded in their purpose - relatively few of the stamps survived usage, their colours fading away when soaked from the envelope - {{but they were not}} liked by the public.|$|R
5000|$|Fugitive {{pigments}} are [...] pigments that lighten, darken, {{or otherwise}} {{change in appearance}} or physicality over time when exposed to certain environmental conditions, such as light, temperature, humidity, or pollution. [...] Fugitive pigments are present in types of paint, markers, inks etc., which are used for temporary applications. <b>Fugitive</b> <b>inks</b> which washed away when soaked in water were sometimes used deliberately to prevent postage stamps being removed from envelopes by soaking, and reused (e.g., the Queen Victoria Lilac and Green Issue).|$|R
5000|$|The {{variety of}} colours and designs was partly in {{response}} to the much-disliked [...] "Lilac and Green" [...] issues of 1883-1884. The 1884 Stamp Committee was formed to make decisions about improved replacements. After several meetings, and considering a number of essays by De La Rue (many of which survive in the marketplace), they produced a report recommending the use of surface printing, two colours in <b>fugitive</b> <b>inks,</b> coloured paper, and the dropping of the corner letters that had distinguished stamps on the sheet.|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} 3 -dimensional (3 D) {{bioprinting}} have enjoyed rapid {{development in the}} past few years for the applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this review, we summarize the most updated developments in 3 D bioprinting for the applications in the tissue engineering with a focus on the printable biomaterials used as bioinks. These developments include 1) novel printing regimes have been enabled by the use of <b>fugitive</b> <b>inks</b> for the creation of intricate structures e. g. vascularized tissue constructs; 2) mechanical strength of printed constructs can be enhanced by co-printing soft and hard biomaterials; 3) bioprinted in-vitro models for drug testing applications are closer to reality. We conclude that the research and application of new bioinks will remain the key highlights of the future developments in 3 D bioprinting for tissue engineering...|$|R
5000|$|The Venetian Red {{had a short}} run, and was {{replaced}} by the Penny Lilac in July 1881. Its displacement is attributed to a change in government postal policy: the Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1881 necessitated {{the creation of a new}} provision of revenue stamps. A new inscription was therefore needed, and the new Penny Lilacs featured the words [...] "POSTAGE AND INLAND REVENUE" [...] and [...] "ONE PENNY", instead of [...] "POSTAGE" [...] and [...] "ONE PENNY" [...] that its predecessors bore. It was decided that a new colour would also be desirable to defend against improper re-use; a <b>fugitive</b> lilac <b>ink</b> was used that would run and spoil the stamp if one attempted to wash off the cancellation. The Lilacs broke the tradition of using corner letters and instead had either fourteen or sixteen dots in each corner.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an automated robotic technique called direct-dispense to fabricate a polymeric platform that supports optical sensor arrays. Direct-dispense, {{which is a}} type of the emerging direct-write microfabrication techniques, uses <b>fugitive</b> organic <b>inks</b> in combination with cross-linkable polymers to create microfluidic channels and other microstructures. Specifically, we {{describe an}} application of direct-dispensing to develop optical biochemical sensors by fabricating planar ridge waveguides that support sol-gelderived xerogel-based thin films. The xerogel-based sensor materials act as host media to house luminophore biochemical recognition elements. As a prototype implementation, we demonstrate gaseous oxygen (O 2) responsive optical sensors that operate on the basis of monitoring luminescence intensity signals. The optical sensor employs a Light Emitting Diode (LED) excitation source and a standard silicon photodiode as the detector. The sensor operates over the full scale (0 %- 100 %) of O 2 concentrations with a response time of less than 1 second. This work has implications for the development of miniaturized multisensor platforms that can be cost-effectively and reliably mass-produced...|$|R
40|$|Abstract ‚Äì The {{integration}} of electronic components on miniaturised systems has become challenging as the generated power {{can hardly be}} dissipated. A new approach is being investigated to use micro heat pipes (MHPs) directly over the printed circuit boards (PCBs) for high heat dissipation. The MHPs will be manufactured by direct-write assembly, an approach compatible with electronic fabrications processes. This approach consists of the extrusion of a <b>fugitive</b> organic <b>ink</b> through a micronozzle under constant pressure combined with a layer-by-layer robotic deposition on a substrate. The deposited pattern is then removed after infiltration and curing of a polymer matrix. A high velocity and accurate robotic platform with four degrees of freedom combined to a scanning system allowed the deposition of two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2 D/ 3 D) microchannel networks over PCBs with complex surface topography. Depending on the deposition pattern, the writing process was precisely achieved at speeds ranging from 40 to 100 mm/s. This platform will eventually {{be used for the}} fabrication and {{integration of}} MHP networks directly on microelectronic devices for efficient thermal coupling with the heat source. The developed high-performance deposition platform shows promises for the mass production of efficient and compact thermal mechanisms for the electronic industry.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to adapt the fabrication of cylindrical microchannels by directed assembly for industrial purposes. The directed assembly consists of the extrusion of a <b>fugitive</b> organic <b>ink</b> through a micro-nozzle under constant pressure combined with a layer-by-layer robotic deposition on a substrate for the creation of geometrically complex structures. A multi-axis motion platform has been developed in order to adapt this technique to rapid fabrication. This platform and custom-made software enable the writing of two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2 D and 3 D) ink networks at a high velocity and positioning accuracy. Improvements on the hardware, software and communication integration were accomplished on this dedicated platform in order to achieve the fast fabrication of precise 3 D microstructures. Under similar deposition conditions, the platform developed allowed maximum deposition velocities of more than one order of magnitude superior to the usual writing speeds (i. e., between 1 to 8 mm/s). The filaments deposited were characterized by laser scanning profilometry and optical microscopy. The deposition trajectories at high-speed were customized and the smooth roughness of the filament surface was preserved. Finally, the ink structures have been embedded in an epoxy and subsequently removed to create 3 D microfluidic networks in order to demonstrate the potential of such platform...|$|R
