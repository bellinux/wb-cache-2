40|$|Studies on {{household}} {{energy use}} generally focus {{on social and}} psychological factors influencing the acceptability of energy-saving measures. However, the influence of physical characteristics of energy-saving measures on their acceptability is largely ignored. In this study, preferences for different types of energy-saving measures were examined, by using an additive part-worth function conjoint analysis. Energy-saving measures differed {{in the domain of}} <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> (measures aimed at home <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> versus measures aimed at transport <b>energy</b> <b>savings),</b> energy-saving strategy (technical improvements, different use of products, and shifts in consumption), and the amount of <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> (small versus large <b>energy</b> <b>savings).</b> Energy-saving strategy appeared {{to be the most important}} characteristic influencing the acceptability of energy-saving measures. In general, technical improvements were preferred over behavioral measures and especially shifts in consumption. Further, home energy-saving measures were more acceptable than transport energy-saving measures. The amount of <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> was the least important characteristic: there was hardly any difference in the acceptability of measures with small and large <b>energy</b> <b>savings.</b> Except for respondents differing in environmental concern, there were no differences in average acceptability of the energy-saving measures between respondent groups. However, some interesting differences in relative preferences for different types of energy-saving measures were found between respondent groups. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

Secondly, it defines a typical small cell BS in the PCC architecture and derives a power model to characterize small cell BS energy consumption for the different <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> schemes.

30|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>savings</b> schemes {{based on}} sleep mode {{techniques}} can further introduce connection latencies to the UE-small cell connection procedure, {{which may have}} an impact on the achievable <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> and QoS delivered to users. Several works, such as [28] or [29], provide some analysis of potential network delays in connection setup introduced by sleep mode techniques, but this evaluation is not fully applicable in architectures with C-plane/U-plane split and centralized control of small cells by a macro BS. In addition, these studies do not quantify the impact of these delays on potential <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> and user QoS. In [4] and [5], the authors evaluate <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> for a macro-assisted database-aided <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> scheme for the PCC under different small cell and user deployment scenarios. However, these studies do not consider the impact of signalling latencies in the UE-small cell connection establishment procedure. A mathematical model to study the relationship between achievable <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> by sleep mode BSs and the impact of delays on user QoS is provided in [30], but this analysis assumes independent operation of small cells and macro cells. In this paper, we thoroughly characterize the UE-small cell connection latencies present in the <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> schemes based on sleep mode techniques considered in this paper, using typical time values for the various signalling procedures, and evaluate their impact on system performance.|$|R
