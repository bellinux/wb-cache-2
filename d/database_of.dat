Our theorem is a further step in a larger project of extending the scope <b>of</b> <b>databases</b> on which polynomial time can be captured by reasonable query languages. We then prove a general definability theorem stating that each query on a class <b>of</b> <b>databases</b> <b>of</b> bounded tree-width which is definable in monadic second-order logic is also definable in fixed-point logic (or datalog). Furthermore, for each k 1 the class <b>of</b> <b>databases</b> <b>of</b> tree-width at most k is definable in fixed-point logic.
