Subsequently, Rihanna posted on her official Twitter profile [...] "#The Wait Is Ova. Nov. 23 09". Speculation rose among fans that [...] "The Wait Is Ova", literally meaning [...] "The wait is over", would either be {{the name of a}} new single or the then-upcoming album. According to Entertainment Weekly the date looked accurate for her album release and [...] "The Wait Is Ova" [...] would not be the title of the album. Two days later, a countdown timer appeared on her website and was scheduled to end on October 20, 2009. After the timer finished counting, [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] premiered on BBC Radio 1, the singer's official website and on American radio stations.

500|$|Halperin {{described}} [...] "This Moment" [...] and [...] "Ghost" [...] as [...] "mid-tempo ballads {{that are}} closest in DNA to Perry's previous smashes". Perry stated {{that she was}} inspired to write [...] "This Moment" [...] after she heard the audio book of The Power of Now; the song's lyrics talk about [...] "living in the present"; with Perry [...] "add a romantic spin" [...] to it. Gary Trust described [...] "Ghost" [...] as a [...] "mesmerizing ballad", while Gundersen described it as [...] "powerful, dark, and haunting". Lipshutz felt that [...] "Ghost" [...] and [...] "By the Grace of God" [...] contain the album's [...] "most somber moments". While talking about each Prism track, Perry mentioned that [...] "By the Grace of God" [...] was the first song she wrote and recorded for the album back in November 2012 {{while she was in}} her [...] "dark" [...] phase. Jody Rosen from Vulture described bonus track [...] "Spiritual" [...] as an inspirational song. Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast described [...] "It Takes Two" [...] as a [...] "sweeping ballad" [...] which allowed Perry to [...] "show off a full-throated belt that so many of her more bubbly tracks mask".

500|$|... "AFRICOBRA II" [...] {{was held}} in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it {{traveled}} to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying [...] "Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues." [...] Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the cartridge belt {{is attached to the}} canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words [...] "love", [...] "black", [...] "nation", [...] "time", [...] "rest", [...] "full of shit", [...] "revolution", and [...] "beautiful" [...] burst out of her head on the canvas. The message [...] "I have given my life in the struggle. If I have to lose my life, that is the way it will be," [...] travels down <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> left arm. [...] "B", as usual, represents [...] "blackness" [...] "bad" [...] and in this painting [...] "beautiful". The work epitomizes the goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as [...] "jam-packed and jelly tight." [...] Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as [...] "a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans – with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung over her shoulder. Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art." [...] Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. [...] "B" [...] appears in the painting, as well as [...] "P"; [...] "PRINCE" [...] and [...] "BLACK" [...] which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote [...] "I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results," [...] is painted across his chest and arm. Their second show, [...] "AFRICOBRA III", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell [...] "together contradict something I have long believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all." ...|$|E

Former world No. 1 Chris Evert writes: [...] "Tennis has exploded in China. The country now has some 15 million tennis players; 116 million watched Li win the French Open. That kind of exposure is crucial to our sport, and it never would have happened without Li. At tournaments, I've seen her charm the crowds. When she smiles, everyone melts. She's just such a breath of fresh air. Her friendly on-court demeanour as well as her hilariously-witty post-match interviews brings a smile to everyone's face." [...] Li also appeared on the cover of 26 May 2014 edition of Time magazine, which featured an article titled [...] "The Passion of Li Na", in which author Hannah Beech described Li as a world class sports idol, inspiring millions of Chinese people to regard her as an icon of pursuing independent character and freedom of thought.

2500|$|The story follows Sakura, a 14-year-old princess who'd rather marry {{for love}} and make her own choices in life than be married away to someone she's never met. Her best friend is Asagiri, a cute female Mononoke (a tiny spirit) who she once saved from a life of slavery (unbeknownst to her, Asagiri is really a Yuki-Onna). Since birth, she's been engaged to Prince Oura. Not wanting to marry the prince after a {{precarious}} argument with Prince Oura's messenger, named Aoba, Sakura runs away but gets lost and accidentally looks at the full moon, which she was warned to never do.

Priestess Byakuya tells Sakura that she is in fact Princess Kaguya's granddaughter {{and is the only}} one able to destroy the demons. By drawing a pair of back-to-back crescent moons on her palm, she is able to summon the mystic sword Chizakura and kill the demon. She also discovers the word “destroy” is actually her Soul Symbol (a symbol each person possesses that best represents his or her true nature). Soon after, Sakura, Asagiri, and Aoba travel to Prince Oura's estate, where it's discovered that Aoba actually is Prince Oura, explaining {{that he wanted to be}} mischievous. Of course, the two don't get along from then on, until finally while relaxing under a tree, the two finally seem to come to an understanding, and do appear to be finding the silver lining in their arranged engagement. Unfortunately, she is soon under threat of execution, as Aoba turns on her, as he's afraid that she will eventually become a demon herself, like her mother and grandmother before her. Aoba shoots an arrow through <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> Sakura falls into a river, only to be found by a cute and sassy young ninja named Kohaku and her childhood friend Hayate, who used to be human but was accidentally turned into a frog by Kohaku (although he regains his human form during the full moon). While with Kohaku, the two form a nice friendship, and Sakura reveals that she is being hunted by Kohaku's master, who just so happens to be Aoba. Kohaku though in return admits already knowing this, and tells that she doesn't wish to harm her, and wants to protect her. The two, along with Asagiri and Hayate, soon encounter Aoba and his men, and Volume 1 ends with Sakura being affected by a youko whistle that Aoba has.|$|E
