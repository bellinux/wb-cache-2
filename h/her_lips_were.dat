She prayed [...] "speaking upon her heart," [...] {{so that no one}} else could hear, yet <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> moving. Therefore, when saying the Amidah one's voice should be audible to oneself, but not loud enough for others to hear.|$|E
60|$|Tessa's tears had ceased, and <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> pale with fright.|$|E
60|$|The anger had gone. She {{was pale}} again, and <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> trembling.|$|E
60|$|She smiled very slightly, but {{the curve}} of <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> delightful.|$|R
60|$|This {{time the}} laugh which broke from <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> {{scarcely}} natural.|$|R

60|$|She stopped him. <b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> parted in a {{smile of}} good-natured scorn.|$|E
60|$|He drew a {{catching}} breath, {{and suddenly}} <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> opening to his.|$|E
60|$|Beatrice had {{suddenly}} grown hard, <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> set together, even her attitude was uncompromising.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes seemed}} to narrow a little, and the smile upon <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> forced.|$|R
60|$|Her eyes drew his. He almost fancied {{that the}} quiver {{at the corners}} of <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> of mirth.|$|R
50|$|Her mouth {{resembles a}} {{pomegranate}} blossom, <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> cherries and <b>her</b> silver bosom curves out into breasts like pomegranates.|$|R
60|$|Her voice {{seemed to}} come from a long way off. <b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> dry and cracked.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> {{drawn in}} tight silence, {{and in her}} cheeks were little angry spots of blood.|$|E
60|$|Already her manner {{began to}} change. The fear of his refusal was hateful, <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> trembling.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>lip</b> <b>was</b> quivering, and she {{was still}} under the {{influence}} of the excitement which the visit of these people had brought about.|$|R
60|$|I {{seemed to}} have been unfortunate in my choice of a conversation. Her eyes had grown larger. The quivering of <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> almost pitiful.|$|R
60|$|Wetherell {{glanced at}} her in surprise, and saw that <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> <b>was</b> quivering, that tears were on her lashes. She laid {{her hand on his}} arm.|$|R
60|$|Armand {{rose from}} his knees. Her eyes were calling to him, <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> ready to yield.|$|E
60|$|She laughed softly. <b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> parted in dainty curves, and {{her eyes}} were lit with merriment.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with a curiosity which was almost passionate. <b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> parted, her senses strained.|$|E
60|$|The tone {{in which}} those words fell from <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> so unnaturally quiet, that Mrs. Wagner {{suddenly}} turned again with a start, and faced her.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> roses wat wi' dew, [...] O' what a feast her bonie mou'! [...] Her cheeks a mair {{celestial}} hue, [...] A crimson still diviner! ...|$|R
6000|$|Again she leapt, {{and this}} time the answer that came from <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> spoken in another voice, which said, [...] "I am present. What seek you?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{rose to her}} feet. She was pale, and <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> quivering, but she was splendidly handsome.|$|E
60|$|He put {{his hand}} over her face, to feel if <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> moving, and tore off the neckerchief.|$|E
60|$|Her {{head was}} thrown back, <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> parted. She drank {{in the breeze}} {{as though it were}} wine.|$|E
6000|$|... [Joy {{drops her}} hands, and lifts her face. MRS. GWYN looks back [...] at <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> quivering; {{she goes on}} {{speaking}} with [...] stammering rapidity.] ...|$|R
60|$|They {{watch him}} pass the window, {{and then look}} at each other dumbly, quite disconcerted. Richard, noting the quiver of <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>is</b> the first to pull himself together.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was told}} she was his sweetheart. [...] They were {{on the eve of}} marriage. [...] She was quiet as a statue, [...] But <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> <b>was</b> gray and writhen.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned to}} him from the door. She was really a very {{handsome}} woman. <b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> most expressive.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> ashen, and {{her breath}} came quickly. Madame acted with that instant {{promptness}} which I expected of her.|$|E
60|$|She turned away. <b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> moving all the time. She walked {{about a dozen}} steps, {{and then}} she returned.|$|E
60|$|I had dreamt that to kiss <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> {{ultimate}} satisfaction. But it {{was indeed}} {{only the beginning of}} desires. I told her my one ambition was to marry her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{the same}} I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion. An' as for Saxon, why, one kiss of <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>is</b> worth more'n all the {{libraries}} in the world." ...|$|R
