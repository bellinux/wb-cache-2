40|$|Two {{modes of}} {{molecular}} motion of carrier molecules can, in principle, {{lead to a}} <b>facilitated</b> transport of a substrate: translational and rotational diffusion. In the present study, which deals with the mechanism of the <b>facilitated</b> diffusion of H+ and O 2 in solutions of earthworm hemoglobin, examples for both types of facilitation are presented. Only translational, not rotational, diffusion of earthworm hemoglobin appears {{to lead to a}} <b>facilitated</b> O 2 flux. In contrast, substantial <b>facilitated</b> H+ fluxes of comparable size arise from rotational diffusion as well as from translational diffusion of this large protein. This is derived from measurements of <b>facilitated</b> H+ and O 2 fluxes in earthworm hemoglobin solutions and determinations of the rotational and translational diffusion coefficients of earthworm hemoglobin {{with the help of a}} theoretical treatment of <b>facilitated</b> diffusion by rotational carrier diffusion. H+ transport by rotational protein diffusion appears to be a case where the often-postulated mechanism of <b>facilitated</b> transport by rotation of a carrier lends itself to experimental verification...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{some practical}} issues relevant to <b>facilitated</b> conceptual modelling (CM). We consider <b>facilitated</b> CM {{as a process}} of undertaking CM primarily in <b>facilitated</b> workshops attended by a group of stakeholders. <b>Facilitated</b> workshops are a common practice in some fields of operational research (OR), System Dynamics (SD) and Problem Structuring Methods (PSM). The associated benefits of involving the stakeholders in the modelling process are reported in the literature such as enabling the mutual exploration of the problem situation and creating a strong ownership of the formulated problem. Further benefits related to CM are knowledge acquisition from domain experts, conflict resolution, fostering credibility and creativity. Reflecting on our experience, we consider the practical issues related to undertaking <b>facilitated</b> CM such as the group size and composition, team roles and the facilitator and the organization of workshops. The ideas put forward could be useful to modellers interested in undertaking <b>facilitated</b> CM. ...|$|R

40|$|The role of <b>facilitated</b> {{workshops}} {{in the development}} of information systems is widely acknowledged, but apart from some anecdotic evidence little objective information about the effectiveness of <b>facilitated</b> workshops is available. This paper describes a study within a single organization in which the effectiveness of requirements engineering in projects using <b>facilitated</b> workshops is compared with the effectiveness of past projects that used one-on-one interviews to gather requirements instead of <b>facilitated</b> workshops. In the study the duration, effort and satisfaction of 49 DSDM projects using <b>facilitated</b> workshops have been compared with 20 projects that used the Method/ 1 method, which use one-on-one interviews to gather the requirements. For small projects, Method/ 1 's one-on-one interviews are found to be more efficient, whereas for larger projects the efficiency of one-one-one interviews is surpassed by DSDM's <b>facilitated</b> workshops. Other quantitative effects were not found, and subjective ratings of stakeholders do not indicate a preference for DSDM projects either. We conjecture that these findings may be partly {{due to the fact that}} we only measured short-term effects (such as customer satisfaction immediately after a project is completed), and that the true benefits of <b>facilitated</b> workshops could require longitudinal studies...|$|R
