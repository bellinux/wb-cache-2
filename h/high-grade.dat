40|$|<b>High-grading</b> is the {{decision}} by fishers to discard fish of low value {{that allows them to}} land more valuable fish. A literature review showed <b>high-grading</b> is reported in commercial and non-commercial fisheries around the world, although the number of observations is small. <b>High-grading</b> occurs in fisheries that are restricted to land their total catch due to management, market or physical constraints. Using the mixed flatfish fishery as a model system, a dynamic state variable model simulation showed that <b>high-grading</b> of certain grades occurs throughout the year when their ex-vessel price is low. <b>High-grading</b> increases with the degree of quota restriction, while the level of over-quota discarding is unrelated to the quota level. The size composition of the <b>high-graded</b> catch differs from the landed catch. Due to the differences in the seasonal variation in size specific ex-vessel price, the effect of quota restrictions on the size composition of the discarded catch is non-linear. <b>High-grading</b> is difficult to detect for the fishery inspection as it occurs on-board during the short period when the catch is processed. We conclude that <b>high-grading</b> is under-reported in fish stocks managed by restrictive quota, undermining the quality of stock assessments and sustainable management of exploited fish stocks. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fishers in quota-regulated {{fisheries}} find it {{to their}} advantage to discard less valuable fish at sea to increase {{the value of their}} catch. A theoretical model describing the <b>high-grading</b> behavior of fishers is presented, and an empirical model is derived as well as a testing strategy to test for <b>high-grading</b> and to estimate the discarded amount of each grade. The model is applied to data for the Icelandic quota regulated cod fishery during the period September 1998 to June 2001. The results indicate that highgrading occurs in the Icelandic cod fishery for both long-line and net vessels. However, the discard rates are small, and the results clearly suggest that the ban on discards in Iceland has effectively dealt with <b>high-grading.</b> The estimated discard rates are consistent with existing estimates of <b>high-grading</b> for the same types of vessel in the same fishery. This suggests that the modeling of discarding decisions based purely on incentives is a useful alternative to classical biometric methods.

The characteristic of each study and incidence of all- and <b>high-grades</b> PT were collected. Results. A total of 2233 patients were available for meta-analysis: 989 had breast cancer, 833 had neuroendocrine tumor and 411 had metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

5|$|One {{striking}} {{difference was}} that late army doctrine (and practice) aimed at avoiding open battle with the enemy if possible, unlike the early doctrine from the Principate of seeking to bring the enemy to battle as often and as quickly as possible.

The Reef Line fishery (RLF) of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia is a large-scale multi-sector, multi-species, highly regulated hook and line fishery {{with the potential for}} high levels of discarding. We used a range of data sources to estimate discard rates and discard quantities for the two main target groups of the RLF, the coral trout, Plectropomus spp, and the red throat emperor, Lethrinus miniatus, and investigated possible effects on discarding of recent changes in management of the fishery. Fleet-wide estimates of total annual quantities discarded from 1989 to 2003 were 292 – 622 t and 33 – 95 t for coral trout and red throat emperor, respectively. Hypothetical scenarios of <b>high-grading</b> after the introduction of a total allowable commercial catch for coral trout resulted in increases in discard quantities up to 3895 t, while no <b>high-grading</b> still meant 421 t were discarded.
