500|$|Warfarin is {{more slowly}} acting than the common {{anticoagulant}} heparin, {{though it has}} a number of advantages. Heparin must be given by injection, whereas warfarin is available orally. Warfarin has a long half-life and need only be given once a day. Heparin can also cause a prothrombotic condition, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (an antibody-mediated decrease in platelet levels), which increases the risk for thrombosis. It takes several days for warfarin to reach the therapeutic effect since the circulating coagulation factors are not affected by the drug (thrombin has a <b>half-life</b> <b>time</b> of days). Warfarin's long half-life means that it remains effective for several days after it was stopped. [...] Furthermore, if given initially without additional anticoagulant cover, it can increase thrombosis risk (see below). For these main reasons, hospitalised patients are usually given heparin with warfarin initially, the heparin covering the 3–5 day lag period and being withdrawn after a few days.|$|E

Pesticides residues were quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The ability of these biological agents to detoxify and clean up these pesticide residues in both soil and plants was studied. In soil samples, the highest percentages of malathion-degradation were ≥ 60 and ≥ 90 % after 28 and 42 days, respectively. The <b>half-life</b> <b>times</b> of malathion were accounted by 24, 23, 25 and 25 days for Amaranth, Kidney bean, Lettuce and Watercress, respectively. For dimethoate, results of time course studies in soil degradation revealed that Amaranth and Kidney bean were the most effective plants in dimethoate degradation, whereas ≥ 90 % was degraded after 42 days.

50|$|Proteins are {{essential}} macromolecules of living organisms. They are continuously being degraded into their constituent amino acids {{which can be}} reused in the synthesis of new proteins.

50|$|A major hurdle to {{overcome}} is the long reaction time for complete rotation in these systems, {{which does not}} compare to rotation speeds displayed by motor proteins in biological systems. In the fastest system to date, with a fluorene lower half, the half-life of the thermal helix inversion is 0.005 seconds. This compound is synthesized using the Barton-Kellogg reaction. In this molecule the slowest step in its rotation, the thermally induced helix-inversion, is believed to proceed much more quickly because the larger tert-butyl group makes the unstable isomer even less stable than when the methyl group is used. This is because the unstable isomer is more destabilized than the transition state that leads to helix-inversion. The different behaviour of the two molecules {{is illustrated by the}} fact that the <b>half-life</b> <b>time</b> for the compound with a methyl group instead of a tert-butyl group is 3.2 minutes.|$|E

In the present study, the effect of trans-cis isomerization of both single- and double-tailed azobenzene-substituted amphiphiles on the aggregation and packing behavior has been studied. The phase transition temperature of a membrane and the thermal <b>half-life</b> <b>times</b> of the cis azobenzene-substituted amphiphiles in membranes have been measured. Furthermore, the synthesis and properties of single-tailed azobenzene-substituted phosphate amphiphiles are described and {{compared with those of}} the double-tailed analogues. The single-tailed azobenzene-substituted phosphates have a low solubility in water and form micelles, sheets, and crystals. In all cases the trans-cis isomerization leads to a disturbance of the chain packing. Both single- and double-tailed cis azobenzene-substituted phosphates lowered the main phase transition temperature of bilayer membranes. The effect increased when the azobenzene moiety was situated closer to the head group. Accordingly, the <b>half-life</b> <b>times</b> of the cis azobenzene group was shorter when the azobenzene group was positioned closer to the head group for both the single- and double-tailed amphiphiles.

The heaviest nuclei in nature, uranium 238U, are unstable, but having a half-life of 4.5 billion years, close {{to the age of}} the Earth, they are still relatively abundant; they (and other nuclei heavier than iron) may have formed in a supernova explosion [...] preceding the formation of the solar system.

50|$|Alpha {{decay energy}} follows the same trend as for other heavy elements. Lighter {{astatine}} isotopes have quite high energies of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. However, astatine-211 has {{a significantly higher}} energy than the previous isotope; it has a nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a magic number (corresponding to a filled neutron shell). Despite having a similar <b>half-life</b> <b>time</b> as the previous isotope (8.1 hours for astatine-210 and 7.2 hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.8 percent versus just 0.18 percent. The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the highest amount of energy of all astatine isotopes. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope. Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists; this happens due to the increasing role of beta decay. This decay mode {{is especially important for}} astatine: as early as 1950, it was postulated that the element has no beta-stable isotopes (i.e., ones that do not undergo beta decay at all). A beta decay mode has been found for all astatine isotopes except for astatine-213, astatine-214, astatine-215, and astatine-216m. Among other isotopes: astatine-210 and the lighter isotopes decay by positron emission); astatine-216 and the heavier isotopes undergo beta decay; astatine-212 decays via either ways; and astatine-211 decays by electron capture instead.|$|E

The well-known dechlorination reaction to a hydroxyphenylcarbamate was observed for chlorpropham. Phenisopham undergoes photo-Fries reaction to give rearranged products (hydroxybenzamides) and fragmentation products (hydroxyphenylcarbamate and N-ethylaniline). Acute and chronic toxicity tests of pesticides and their photoproducts were performed on organisms from two levels of the freshwater aquatic chain, the anostraca crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. The acute results showed that chlorpropham had median lethal concentrations for the crustacean T. platyurus and the rotifer B. calyciflorus of 10. 16 and 35. 19 mg L 1, respectively, and phenisopham did not show any acute toxicity as the derivatives up to 10 mg L 1.

The ·OH reactions would be more important at low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the 3 CDOM* processes at high DOC. In the presence of highly reactive triplet-state model compounds, the two benzotriazole forms react with similar rate constants. In this case, they would show comparable <b>half-life</b> <b>times</b> in surface-water environments. With less reactive triplet states, the rate constant of the anionic form can {{be a couple of}} orders of magnitude higher than that of the neutral one. Under these circumstances, the neutral form could be considerably more photostable than the anionic one at high DOC. Therefore, depending on 3 CDOM* reactivity, the solution pH may or may not {{play an important role in}} the photoattenuation kinetics of 1 H-benzotriazole in sunlit natural waters, especially at high DOC. Both forms of benzotriazole yield hydroxyderivatives as their main transformation intermediates under all the relevant photochemical reaction pathways. These intermediates could be formed via ·OH-induced hydroxylation, or upon electron abstraction followed by reaction with water. Differently from UVC irradiation data reported in previous studies, the concentration of aniline upon excitation of 1 H-benzotriazole under environmentally significant UV wavelengths was always below the detection limit of the analytical method used in this work (5 μmol L− 1) ...|$|R
