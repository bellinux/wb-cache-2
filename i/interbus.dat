30|$|Related work: Industrial {{communication}} {{has progressed}} enormously {{in the last}} decade with the replacement of the traditional one-to-one connections between sensors/actuators and controllers by networked connections. In wired fieldbus communication, functional safety, security, and integration have been addressed with respect to Profibus and Profinet [[6], and the references therein]. In [7], Dzung et al. present a detailed survey about the security situation in the automation domain. In [8], Jasperneite and Feld describe Profinet and the usage in automation, which serves as a good introduction to the area. In addition, they propose two different approaches for tight integration of Profibus and <b>Interbus</b> using Profinet IO.|$|E
30|$|GSDML (Generic Station Description Markup Language) and FDCML (Field Device Markup Language) [5] on the {{contrary}} are device description languages based on XML. GSDML is primarily established in the Profinet I/O domain and is again used for the configuration and commissioning of systems by engineering tools. FDCML {{on the other hand}} is a metalanguage for describing automation devices from different views, such as communication, functionality, diagnosis and mechanics. Its primary usage is to provide (human-readable) product data sheets and to enable a tool-based commissioning. Its application mainly focuses on <b>INTERBUS</b> components. FDCML is flexible for extensions such as manufacturer-specific attributes, but which on {{the contrary}} inhibits the comparability of devices due to a nonuniform vocabulary.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{reports on}} our {{experience}} in using a graphical tool for protocol specification {{based on the}} G-LOTOS language, the graphical extension of ISO LOTOS, and presents {{as a case study}} the development of a formal description of an EN 50254 (<b>INTERBUS)</b> factory communication system. The tool is an MS Windows application, thus running on commonly available PC platforms, which lets the user edit a G-LOTOS specification performing on-line checks of syntactic and static semantics rules, generate a corresponding textual LOTOS specification, and invoke an integrated syntax and static semantics analyser. Experience with the tool has shown its usefulness in making industrial protocol specification, editing and understanding an easier task. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{focused on}} the same bottom set of field devices, and {{designed}} two kinds of field-bus control system, one is PROFIBUS, and another is the <b>Interbus.</b> Applied the OPC technology to realize the information exchange between two bus systems, and applied the PC configuration software, to monitor equipments on the spot. The whole monitoring system included the monitoring program and OPC server program. The monitoring program is no longer included with the specific hardware communication part. The communication monitoring program and hardware are realized by OPC server software, when the system needs to be modified, only need to modify the OPC corresponding part. If the system needs to expand and communicate with the outside world, just need to expand the OPC. After many times field operation, proved the monitoring system of two OPC bus technologies was stable, reliable, and timely control reaction...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the interactive tactile luminous floor that was constructed {{and used as}} {{the skin of the}} playful interactive space Ada, which ran as a public exhibit for five months in 2002 and had over 550, 000 visitors. Ada’s floor was custom-built to provide a means for individual and collective user interaction. It consists of 360 hexagonal 66 cm tiles covering a total area of 136 m 2, each with analogue tactile load sensors based on force-sensitive resistors and dimmable neon red, green and blue (RGB) lamps. The tiles are constructed from extruded aluminum with glass tops. An <b>Interbus</b> factory automation bus senses and controls the tiles. Software is described for rendering fluid, dynamic visual effects on the floor, for signal processing of the load information, for real-time visitor tracking and for a variety of behavioural modes, games and interactions. Data from single tiles and from tracking are shown. This floor offers new modalities of human–computer interaction and human–robot interaction for autonomous robotic spaces. c ○ 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A Process {{is defined}} as the {{progression}} to some particular end or objective through a logical and orderly sequence of events. Various devices (e. g., actuators, limit switches, motors, sensors, etc.) {{play a significant role in}} making sure that the process attains its objective (e. g., maintaining the furnace temperature within an acceptable limit). To do these things effectively, manufacturers need to access data from the plant floor or devices and integrate those into their control applications, which maybe one of the 2 ̆ 2 off the shelf tools such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Distributed Control System (DCS), or Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). A number of vendors have devised their own Data Acquisition Networks or Process Control Architectures (e. g., PROFIBUS, DEVICENET, <b>INTERBUS,</b> ETHERNET I/P, etc.) that claim to be open to or interoperable with a number of third party devices or products that make process data available to the Process or Business Management level. In reality this is far from what it is claimed to be. Due to the problem of interoperability, a manufacturer is forced to be bound, either with the solutions provided by a single vendor or with the writing of a driver for each hardware device that is accessed by a process application. Today 2 ̆ 7 s manufacturers are looking for advanced distributed object technologies that allow for seamless exchange of information across plant networks as a means of integrating the 2 ̆ 2 islands of automation 2 ̆ 2 that exist in their manufacturing operations. OLE for Process Control (OPC) works to significantly reduce the time, cost, and effort required in writing custom interfaces for hundreds of different intelligent devices and networks in use today. The objective of this thesis is to explore the OLE for Process Control (OPC) technology in depth by highlighting its need in industry and by using the OPC technology in an application in which data from a process controlled by Siemens Simatic S 7 PLC are shared with a client application running in LabVTEW 6 i...|$|E
