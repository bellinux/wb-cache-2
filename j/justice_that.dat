5|$|Cameroon's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} French civil law with common law influences. Although {{nominally}} independent, the judiciary falls {{under the authority of}} the executive's Ministry of Justice. The president appoints judges at all levels. The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals, the court of appeal, and the supreme court. The National Assembly elects the members of a nine-member High Court of <b>Justice</b> <b>that</b> judges high-ranking members of government in the event they are charged with high treason or harming national security.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of Denmark in 1940, both Else and Aage {{were arrested for}} the latter's involvement in National Bolshevist armed cells. Christensen was released after three days' interrogation, but Aage was convicted of illegal weapons' possession and detained for six months. At that point, Christensen convinced her father's cousin, who was Minister of <b>Justice,</b> <b>that</b> Aage should be released. Following the end of World War II, the couple left Denmark for England. In 1951 they migrated to Canada, where they settled in Toronto; here, Elsa worked in various hospitals, a vocation she retained throughout her life.|$|E
5|$|It is poetic <b>justice</b> <b>that</b> a {{helicopter}} {{is now at}} the heart of the Government's embarrassment and in the centre of their dilemma. Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, we all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E

5000|$|The {{issues in}} the appeal were dealt with by varying {{majorities}} of the <b>Justices</b> <b>that</b> heard the case. Their holdings are summarized in this table: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{case was}} {{referred}} to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on 16 September 2009 {{to determine whether there}} was evidence of misconduct or negligence by the police during the original murder investigation, the handling of Lace’s confession in 1983 and the request from Hodgson’s solicitors in 1998 for forensic examination of exhibits. The head of Southampton CID, Detective Chief Superintendent Shirley Dinnell, stated that the referral was voluntarily made by Hampshire Constabulary because of the miscarriage of <b>justice</b> <b>that</b> had taken place and to ensure transparency of inquiries.|$|E
5|$|During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, {{if given}} the {{opportunity}}, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court <b>Justice.</b> <b>That</b> opportunity came {{in his first year}} in office when he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice, and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987. Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued. Bork's nomination was rejected 58–42. Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use. Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place. Along with his three Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to the United States courts of appeals, and 290 judges to the United States district courts.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} following Hard <b>Justice</b> <b>that</b> Shane Douglas was originally supposed to handle interview duties for the show, but {{came down with}} the stomach flu {{and was replaced by}} Terry Taylor. Also, that Jeff Hardy missed multiple flights causing him to arrive after the conclusion of the show. Hardy was subsequently suspended for this and past instances of no-showing events. Abyss and Ron Killings were the only ones to receive injuries at Hard Justice. Abyss was given a fairly deep cut {{on the top of his}} head from being bashed with a steel chair by Killings that required stitches. Meanwhile, Killings cracked his front teeth after falling face-first onto a steel chair.|$|E
50|$|On 17 December 2010 Garzón {{challenged}} five of {{the seven}} Supreme Court <b>justices</b> <b>that</b> could be appointed to judge him for his activities in respect of the exhumation of Franco victims.|$|R
50|$|Of the 14 <b>justices</b> <b>that</b> {{rendered}} {{a verdict}} related to taking an oath under the PCO, 12 {{had taken the}} oath themselves. However, they controversially did not apply the judgement to themselves.|$|R
50|$|The {{judgment}} cites two Chief <b>Justices.</b> <b>That</b> {{is because}} Dickson was Chief Justice {{at the time}} of the hearing but retired before the judgment and was replaced by Lamer who wrote the decision as Chief Justice.|$|R
5|$|Another film {{purported to}} have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, Deep Throat. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on {{juvenile}} <b>justice</b> <b>that</b> the film had earned $600 million; this figure {{has been the subject of}} much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount. Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film's release—showed the film had grossed over $25 million. Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.|$|E

50|$|The town {{is governed}} by a board (consisting of a supervisor, four councilpersons, a clerk, and two <b>justices)</b> <b>that</b> is elected by {{registered}} town voters. Major responsibilities can be grouped into planning & preservation, libraries & recreation, ethics & environment, trails & transportation.|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} of these notes stems from a request from the Ministry of <b>Justice,</b> <b>that</b> he annotate each article and its conformity to or divergence from laws currently in force in the country, {{as well as those}} of the major world powers.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, 24 March was {{designated}} as a public holiday in Argentina, the Day of Remembrance for Truth and <b>Justice.</b> <b>That</b> year, on the 30th anniversary of the coup, a huge crowd filled the streets to remember {{what happened during the}} military government, and ensure it did not happen again.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, {{he pursued}} {{a career in}} public {{administration}} in the Ministry of Grace and <b>Justice.</b> <b>That</b> choice prevented him from participating in the decisive battles of the Risorgimento (the unification of Italy), for which his temperament was not suited anyway, but this lack of military experience would be held against him {{as long as the}} Risorgimento generation was active in politics.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, the Supreme Court took suo motu {{actions against}} populist Imran Khan of criticising against the {{judgement}} of the Supreme Court's senior judges {{in regards to}} the elections. The case was later dropped when Attorney-General assured the Supreme Court <b>justices</b> <b>that</b> Imran Khan did not insubordinate the judiciary.|$|R
50|$|Each of the {{residence}} halls within Warren College {{is named after}} <b>justices</b> <b>that</b> sat on the U.S. Supreme Court with Chief Justice Warren during his term with the U.S. Supreme Court. Residence halls are located near the ecological reserve which is a canyon filled with eucalyptus trees and has hiking trails.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} {{has said it}} plans to leave the European Court of Justice. Prime Minister Theresa May stated unequivocally at the Conservative Party Conference in October 2016 that 'we are not leaving EU only {{to return to the}} jurisdiction of the European Court of <b>Justice.</b> <b>That’s</b> not going to happen'.|$|R
25|$|Kim Bobo founded Interfaith Worker Justice in 1991 as Chicago Interfaith Committee on Worker Issues. Bobo had {{previously}} been director of organizing at Bread for the World and an instructor at the Midwest Academy. In 1989, Bobo became involved with workers' rights campaigns for coal miners. She was startled to find that almost no religious organizations had labor liaisons. She started an informal network of religious leaders to share information about campaigns for worker <b>justice</b> <b>that</b> year.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, the College of Public and International Affairs was reorganized {{to create}} two {{free-standing}} schools: the School of International Service and the School of Public Affairs, incorporating the School of Government and Public Administration and the School of <b>Justice.</b> <b>That</b> same year, {{construction on the}} Adnan Khashoggi Sports Center completed while the Iran-Contra Affair controversy was at its height although his name remained on the building until after Khashoggi defaulted on his donation obligation {{in the mid to}} late 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The {{gap between}} rich and poor is {{enormous}} in a country that was once the most egalitarian nation in the world. In the youth movements, Zionism was seen as the Jewish way of achieving social <b>justice</b> <b>that</b> would encompass the whole world. That ideal has been shattered. Now we have the pretension of being an open and attentive socialist welfare state, but in fact, that message only comes from a single direction. The system only responds to those who shout. Those who are silent remain on the outside. The basic human element has disappeared from the system.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2013, the Ministry of <b>Justice</b> {{announced}} <b>that</b> older {{parts of}} Hull Prison will close, with {{a reduction of}} 282 places at the prison. In April 2014 the Ministry of <b>Justice</b> announced <b>that</b> these would be brought back into use as the [...] "prison population is currently above published projections".|$|R
5000|$|An {{analysis}} by FiveThirtyEight shows that, {{under the assumption}} that Scalia's vacant seat on the Court will not be filled, and taking account of the advanced age of three of the sitting <b>justices,</b> <b>that</b> a Trump presidency would move the Supreme Court [...] "rightward toward its most conservative position in recent memory".|$|R

25|$|Three {{days after}} the case was decided, Dwight Sullivan, a Colonel in the United States Marine Corps Reserve who was the Chief Defense Council for the Office of Military Commissions, noted in his CAAFlog on {{military}} <b>justice</b> <b>that</b> Congress had revised the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 2006 to add child rape {{to the list of}} offenses punishable in the military by death. None of the 10 briefs filed with the Court, and neither the majority nor dissent, mentioned the provision. On July 2, 2008, Linda Greenhouse of The New York Times highlighted Sullivan's post, bringing the issue to national attention.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of formation, the AAP said that the promise of {{equality}} and <b>justice</b> <b>that</b> forms {{a part of the}} Constitution of India and of its preamble has not been fulfilled and that the Independence of India has replaced enslavement to an oppressive foreign power with that to a political elite. It claimed that the common people of India remain unheard and unseen except when it suits the politicians. It wants to reverse the way that the accountability of government operates and has taken an interpretation of the Gandhian concept of swaraj as a tenet. It believes that through swaraj the government will be directly accountable to the people instead of higher officials. The swaraj model lays stress on self-governance, community building and decentralisation.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle's {{association}} with natural law {{may be due}} to the interpretation given to his works by Thomas Aquinas. But whether Aquinas correctly read Aristotle is in dispute. According to some, Aquinas conflates natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the Nicomachean Ethics (Book IV of the Eudemian Ethics). According to this interpretation, Aquinas's influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages in an unfortunate manner, though more recent translations render those more literally. Aristotle notes that natural justice is a species of political justice, specifically the scheme of distributive and corrective <b>justice</b> <b>that</b> would be established under the best political community; were this to take the form of law, this could be called a natural law, though Aristotle does not discuss this and suggests in the Politics that the best regime may not rule by law at all.|$|E
25|$|Attorneys Samuel Leibowitz, Walter H. Pollak and Osmond Frankel {{argued the}} case from February 15 to 18, 1935. Leibowitz showed the <b>justices</b> <b>that</b> the names of African Americans had {{been added to the}} jury rolls. The Justices {{examined}} the items closely with a magnifying glass. Thomas Knight maintained that the jury process was color blind.|$|R
5000|$|An {{analysis}} by FiveThirtyEight shows that, {{under the assumption}} that Scalia's vacant seat on the Court will not be filled and taking account of the old age of three of the sitting <b>justices,</b> <b>that</b> under a Clinton presidency, [...] "the court may quickly become the most liberal it’s been in at least 80 years." ...|$|R
