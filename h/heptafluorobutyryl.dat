40|$|Improvements in the {{analytical}} methodology {{used in the}} gas chromatographic/chemical ionization mass spectral analysis of aliphatic alcohols are described. Improved chromatographic resolution using polysil-oxane-deactivated fused silica capillary columns is shown. The trimethylsilyl, {{as well as the}} trifluoro-acetyl, pentafluoropropionyl, and <b>heptafluorobutyryl</b> O-acyl derivatives are prepared, and the reaction condi-tions discussed. The chromatographic separation of positional isomers of dodecen- 1 -ol for each derivative investigated is shown, as well as a description of the elution time shift caused by the conversion of a specific positional isomer to each of the derivatives. Positive and, where possible, negative ion chemical lonization (methane) mass spectra for all of the deriva-tives are presented, as are the relative mass spectral sensitivities...|$|E
40|$|Two gas chromatographic {{methods for}} the {{simultaneous}} quantitation of morphine and codeine {{in blood and}} bile from cases of opiate-related deaths are described. Both methods employ simple solvent extraction followed by hexanHthanol partitioning clean-up and use nalorphine as the internal standard. The first method relies on the formation of trimethylsilyl derivatives and detection with a nitrogen-phosphorous detector. The second method involves the formation of <b>heptafluorobutyryl</b> derivatives and detection with an electron capture detector. Both methods are sensitive, able to detect down to 0. 04 t~g/mL of morphine and 0. 1 ~g/mL of codeine. Their wide linear dynamic ranges cover from low therapeutic to lethal levels for both morphine and codeine. The methods are amenable to batchwise operation and each analysis can be completed within three hours. The results o...|$|E

It was consecutively converted to C 4 F 9 OCH 3 and C 4 F 9 OC 2 H 5 through the reaction with alkylating agents such as dimethyl sulfate, methyl trifluoromethane sulfonate and di-ethyl sulfate.

40|$|Presence of Stachybotrys chartarum in indoor environments {{has been}} linked to building-associated disease, however, the causative agents are unknown. Verrucarol (VER) and trichodermol (TRID) are {{hydrolysis}} products of some major S. chartarum mycotoxins, i. e. macrocyclic trichothecenes and trichodermin. We optimized gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods for detecting VER and TRID in S. chartarum-contaminated indoor environmental samples. <b>Heptafluorobutyryl</b> derivatives of both VER and TRID exhibited little MS fragmentation and gave much higher detection sensitivity (sub-picogram injected onto the GC column), both in GC-MS and GC-MSMS, than trimethylsilyl derivatives. Optimal detection sensitivity and speci. city was achieved by combining chemical ionization and negative ion (NICI) detection with MSMS. With this method, VER and TRID were detected in building materials colonized by S. chartarum and TRID was demonstrated in dust settled in the breathing zone in a house where an inner wall was colonized. In summary, we have shown that NICI-GC-MSMS can be used to demonstrate mycotoxins in house dust in S. chartarum-contaminated dwellings...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDirect {{derivatization}} of the acyl analogue of platelet-activating factor (acyl-PAF) with heptafluorobutyric anhydride {{results in}} {{replacement of the}} phosphocholine moiety with a <b>heptafluorobutyryl</b> (HFB) group. Electron capture (EC) mass spectrometric analysis of this compound that makes use of negative ion detection along with subsequent accurate mass measurement and tandem mass spectrometry studies revealed {{that in addition to}} expected fragmentation due to losses of elements of HF, ketene, and/or acetic acid, there is a rearrangement reaction between the HFB group and the substituent on carbon- 2 of the glycerol backbone. For 2 -acetyl isomers, this fragmentation yields a characteristic ion at m/z 237; for 1 -acetyl isomers, the analogous ion is observed at [M- 135]−, along with a corresponding carboxylate anion. The use of the HFB derivative is invaluable for analysis of PAF homologues and analogues because it provides detailed structural information in combination with the high sensitivity of a gas chromatography combined with EC-mass spectrometry assay...|$|E
40|$|Sensitive {{detection}} of cellular components from specific groups of microbes can be utilized as 'signatures' in {{the examination of}} microbial consortia from soils, sediments or biofilms. Utilizing capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and stereospecific derivatizing agents, D-alanine, a component localized in the prokaryotic (bacterial) cell wall, can be detected reproducibly. Enrichments of D-[15 N]alanine determined in E. coli grown with [15 N]ammonia can be determined with precision at 1. 0 atom%. Chemical ionization with methane gas and the {{detection of}} negative ions (M - HF) - and (M - F or M + H - HF) - formed from the <b>heptafluorobutyryl</b> D- 2 butanol ester of D-alanine allowed as little as 8 pg (90 fmol) to be detected reproducibly.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} the profiling of polyamines, N-acetylated polyamines and the polyamine analogues N- 1,N- 11 bis(ethyl) norspermine (BE- 3 - 3 - 3) and 1, 19 -bis(ethylamino) - 5, 10, 15 -triazanonadecane (BE- 4 - 4 - 4 - 4) in L 1210 murine leukaemia cells by capillary gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection. The method makes use of four internal standards. Prepurification comprises deproteinization, isolation with Sep-Pak silica at pH 9. 0, conversion to <b>heptafluorobutyryl</b> derivatives and postderivatization organic fluid extraction. Within-and between-series precisions (given as C. V. s) for analysis of 1 - 2 x 10 (6) cells were: putrescine 5. 5 and 29. 4 %; spermidine 1. 6 and 7. 1 %; and spermine 3. 2 and 7. 6 %, respectively. Recoveries relative to the respective internal standards, were in the 70. 6 - 104. 7 % range. Accuracy and precision of measurements of BE- 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 can probably be improved {{by the introduction of}} a separate pentamine internal standard. We conclude that the method can be used for studying the effect of BE- 3 - 3 - 3 and BE- 4 - 4 - 4 - 4, and possibly their metabolites, on polyamine homeostasis (biosynthesis, retroconversion, transport, terminal catabolism) and polyamine function.

40|$|Procedures for {{estimating}} free indoleacetic acid (IAA {{extracted from}} tissue homogenates by aqueous acetone), conjugated IAA (extracted by aqueous acetone and hydrolyzed by 1 n KOH), and diffusible IAA (diffused from the excised tissue into water), in shoots of etiolated 3 -day-old maize (Zea mays L. cv. GH 390) seedlings are described, the indolo-α-pyrone fluorescence method {{being used to}} assay IAA. The reliability of the procedure is shown by comparative IAA determinations of the extracts using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method in which the methyl ester, <b>heptafluorobutyryl</b> derivative of IAA is assayed using the selected-ion-monitoring technique with deuterated IAA as an internal standard. A 3 -millimeter-long coleoptile tip, a coleoptile with its included leaves and nodal region (whole coleoptile), and a mesocotyl each contains 0. 2, 1. 7, and 1. 5 nanograms of free IAA, respectively. The whole coleoptile and the mesocotyl contain slightly less conjugated IAA than their content of free IAA. IAA diffuses from the coleoptile tip {{at the rate of}} 1. 0 nanograms per tip per hour; {{from the base of the}} whole coleoptile and a set of leaves excised from a coleoptile, IAA diffuses at the rate of 0. 62 and 0. 17 nanogram per plant part per hour, respectively. The data obtained support the classical assumption that the coleoptile tip produces IAA. It is also suggested that some IAA is decomposed during its downward transport in the coleoptile...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a procedure for retrospective detection and quantitation {{of exposure to the}} arsenical dichloro(2 -chlorovinyl) arsine (lewisite; L 1) has been initiated. Upon incubation of human blood with [14 C]L 1 (20 nM- 0. 2 mM) in vitro, more than 90 % of the total radioactivity was found in the erythrocytes and 25 - 50 % of the radioactivity becomes associated with globin. Evidence was obtained for the presence of several binding sites. One type of binding was identified as L 1 -induced crosslinking of cysteine residues 93 and 112 of the β-globin chain. A method was developed for extraction of bound and unbound 2 -chlorovinylarsonous acid (CVAA), a major metabolite of L 1, from whole blood after treatment with 2, 3 -dimercapto- 1 -propanol (BAL). Subsequent to derivatization with <b>heptafluorobutyryl</b> imidazole, the CVAA-BAL derivative could be analysed at a 40 -fmol level by means of gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) under electron impact conditions. With this procedure, in vitro exposure of human blood to 1 nM L 1 could be determined. The same procedure was applied to the analysis of human urine samples spiked with CVAA. In vivo exposure of guinea pigs could be established at least 240 h after subcutaneous administration of the agent (0. 25 mg/kg) by the determination of bound and unbound CVAA in the blood. In the urine of these animals, CVAA could be detected for 12 h after exposure...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a sensitive, accurate method for quanti-tative determination of 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenyl-ethylene glycol (MHPG) in cerebrospinal fluid and urine. The method entails enzymatic hydrolysis of conjugated MHPG, acetylation of the phenolic group, thin-layer chromatographic purification, and estima-tion of total MHPG as the acetyl <b>heptafluorobutyryl</b> derivative by gas-liquid chromatography with elec-tron capture detection and {{with use of}} aldrin as in-ternal standard. Results obtained by this method compare favorably with those by other published procedures. Precision, calculated as the mean ± SD of the percentage differences between duplicate es-timations, was 8. 4 ± 8. 0 % for cerebrospinal fluid (3 ml) or 6. 9 ± 6. 6 % for urine (2 ml). Total MHPG in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid specimens from 49 indi-viduals ranged from 6. 1 to 19. 7 ng/ml, with no sig-nificant difference between the mean for control subjects and that for patients with affective disor-ders.

40|$|Quantification of amines in {{biological}} samples {{is important for}} evaluating occupational exposure to diisocyanates. In this study, we describe the quantification of 1, 6 -hexamethylene diamine (HDA) levels in hydrolyzed plasma of 46 spray painters applying 1, 6 -hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) -containing paint in vehicle repair shops collected during repeated visits to their workplace and their relationship with dermal and inhalation exposure to HDI monomer. HDA was detected in 76 % of plasma samples, as <b>heptafluorobutyryl</b> derivatives, {{and the range of}} HDA concentrations was ≤ 0. 02 – 0. 92 μg l− 1. After log-transformation of the data, the correlation between plasma HDA levels and HDI inhalation exposure measured on the same workday was low (N[*]=[*] 108, r[*]=[*] 0. 22, P[*]=[*] 0. 026) compared with the correlation between plasma HDA levels and inhalation exposure occurring ∼ 20 to 60 days before blood collection (N[*]=[*] 29, r[*]=[*] 0. 57, P[*]=[*] 0. 0014). The correlation between plasma HDA levels and HDI dermal exposure measured on the same workday, although statistically significant, was low (N[*]=[*] 108, r[*]=[*] 0. 22, P[*]=[*] 0. 040) while the correlation between HDA and dermal exposure occurring ∼ 20 to 60 days before blood collection was slightly improved (N[*]=[*] 29, r[*]=[*] 0. 36, P[*]=[*] 0. 053). We evaluated various workplace factors and controls (i. e. location, personal protective equipment use and paint booth type) as modifiers of plasma HDA levels. Workers using a downdraft-ventilated booth had significantly lower plasma HDA levels relative to semi-downdraft and crossdraft booth types (P[*]=[*] 0. 0108); this trend was comparable to HDI inhalation and dermal exposure levels stratified by booth type. These findings indicate that HDA concentration in hydrolyzed plasma may be used as a biomarker of cumulative inhalation and dermal exposure to HDI and for investigating the effectiveness of exposure controls in the workplace...|$|E
