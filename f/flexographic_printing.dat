40|$|An optical {{properties}} of the <b>flexographic</b> <b>prints</b> on the shrink sleeve has been experimentally investigated. Two main materials of shrink sleeve: PVC and PET {{were used for the}} research. Films were <b>printed</b> using UV <b>flexographic</b> inks. The color changes arised during shrinking of the films were analysed. Investigations were done using CMYK and PANTONE color matching systems. Color characteristics CIE L*a*b* and color difference E at different shrink level of the film was estimated. It was found that colors become darker during the shrinking of the film. In the case of rasterize image it is related to the deformation of the raster dots, decrease of the spaces between the raster dots and other factors. The biggest changes in the CMYK color system was determined in the Yellow color, while in the tested PANTONE color system – in the blue (P 290) color.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of image-formation in photopolymer <b>flexographic</b> relief <b>printing</b> plates is reviewed. In {{addition to the}} identified factors, {{it was hypothesized that}} the level of exposure could influence the plate shoulder angle. It was further hypothesized that an optimization of shoulder angle with respect to halftone dot area may reduce the dot gain of the printing process. An experiment was conducted using a novel method of plate exposure. Continuous-tone masks were placed in contact with the plate back and the halftone negative used on the plate face. The resulting shoulder angles were measured and analyzed for significant fit to a linear mathematical model. For many dot sizes the face exposure level was significant in determining shoulder angle. The plates were <b>printed</b> on a <b>flexographic</b> press, and <b>prints</b> were analyzed to identify any benefits in dot gain reduction.

50|$|Printing {{technologies}} {{divide between}} sheet-based and roll-to-roll-based approaches. Sheet-based inkjet and screen printing {{are best for}} low-volume, high-precision work. Gravure, offset and <b>flexographic</b> <b>printing</b> are more common for high-volume production, such as solar cells, reaching 10.000 square meters per hour (m²/h). While offset and <b>flexographic</b> <b>printing</b> are mainly used for inorganic and organic conductors (the latter also for dielectrics), gravure printing is especially suitable for quality-sensitive layers like organic semiconductors and semiconductor/dielectric-interfaces in transistors, due to high layer quality. If high resolution is needed, gravure is also suitable for inorganic and organic conductors. Organic field-effect transistors and integrated circuits can be prepared completely by means of mass-printing methods.|$|E
40|$|The Centre for Fine Print Research in Bristol UK {{undertakes}} {{research into}} print technologies {{from the traditional}} 19 th Century to the latest digital capture and print. Outcomes of this research are often realised in collaborative projects with well-known artists. The breadth of technologies used {{in the creation of}} printed digital art is huge, and often mixes analogue and digital techniques. At the CFPR we print artwork using digital photographic technologies that range from, fired enamel on metal for largescale public art projects, continuous tone photo-ceramic relief panels, digital moulds for glass artists. On-glaze ceramic <b>print,</b> Digital photogravure, <b>flexographic</b> <b>print</b> both intaglio and relief, Helio-relief, collotype and Woodburytype, as well as large-scale digital inkjet for Blue chip artists such as Richard Hamilton. In order to understand and quantify colour and surface print quality differences between each process, colourmetric measurement is available alongside microphotography to support and back up the subjective analytical data that is collected during a project. Examples from this data will be used to illustrate the differences between digital print techniques and explain why the artist has chosen a particular print technique.

40|$|The article {{presents}} a preliminary {{study of the}} correlation between films properties and <b>flexographic</b> <b>print</b> quality defined as the optical density of full tone. It is also an attempt {{to answer the question}} whether traditional plastic films can be replaced by biodegradable and compostable films as printing substrates and as materials for packaging. Four kinds of films were used in the experiments – two plastic films (PP and PET) and two biodegradable films (PLA and cellulose). The permeability to water vapour and oxygen, as well as the tensile strength and elongation at break of the material were investigated for all samples. The measurements of the contact angle with water, diiodomethane and printing ink were also conducted for these films, and their surface free energy was determined. All samples were printed on laboratory equipment by a flexographic technique using water-based inks and the optical density of copies was measured. It has been found that the print quality was determined by the type of film used. Furthermore, the correlation between optical density and wettability defined as the contact angle between film and water or printing ink turned out to be significant. Other important parameter is surface free energy, albeit to a little lesser extent. The barrier and mechanical properties of the material have an even weaker impact on optical density. In addition, it is possible to choose the biodegradable film with properties corresponding to conventional, commonly used films which enable high quality prints...|$|R
5000|$|... 3. PrintingA <b>flexographic</b> <b>print</b> {{is made by}} {{creating}} a positive mirrored master of the required image as a 3D relief in a rubber or polymer material. Flexographic plates can be created with analog and digital platemaking processes. The image areas are raised above the non image areas on the rubber or polymer plate. The ink is transferred from the ink roll which is partially immersed in the ink tank. Then it transfers to the anilox or ceramic roll (or meter roll) whose texture holds a specific amount of ink since it is covered with thousands of small wells or cups that enable it to meter ink to the printing plate in a uniform thickness evenly and quickly (the number of cells per linear inch can {{vary according to the}} type of print job and the quality required). To avoid getting a final product with a smudgy or lumpy look, it must be ensured that the amount of ink on the printing plate is not excessive. This is achieved by using a scraper, called a doctor blade. The doctor blade removes excess ink from the anilox roller before inking the printing plate. The substrate is finally sandwiched between the plate and the impression cylinder to transfer the image. The sheet is then fed through a dryer, which allows the inks to dry before the surface is touched again. If a UV-curing ink is used, the sheet {{does not have to be}} dried, but the ink is cured by UV rays instead.|$|R

50|$|Printing, {{means of}} {{producing}} reproductions of written material or images in multiple copies. There are four traditional types of printing: relief printing (with which {{this article is}} mainly concerned), intaglio, lithography, and screen process printing.

50|$|Prior to 1980 anilox rolls were {{produced}} {{by a variety of}} mechanical processes. These metal anilox rolls were sometimes sprayed with ceramic to prolong their life in the <b>flexographic</b> <b>printing</b> press. During the 1980s laser engraving systems {{were produced}} which used a carbon dioxide laser to engrave the required cell pattern directly into the polished ceramic surface. Since then Q-switched YAG lasers were used for a period as they provided a more focusable laser beam as well as increased pulsing frequencies capable of engraving the finer cell configuration demanded by the ever-evolving <b>flexographic</b> <b>printing</b> process. Since approximately the year 2000 the direct anilox laser engraving process has been dominated by the use of fibre lasers which provide the high powers of the carbondioxide lasers together with the finely focusable beam of the YAG lasers. Optical systems providing the rapid switching of multiple beams have allowed the fibre laser system to be dominant in this market. This technology has become known as Multi-Beam-Anilox or MBA.|$|E

40|$|Recently printed {{electronic}} field is significantly growth. Printed electronic {{is to develop}} electrical devices by printing method. Conventional printing method that has been studied {{for this kind of}} printed electronic such as <b>flexographic,</b> micro contact <b>printing,</b> screen printing, gravure and ink jet. In <b>flexographic</b> and microcontact <b>printing,</b> a printing plate is used to transfer the designed and desired pattern to substrate through conformed contact. Therefore printing plate is play a big role in this area. Printing plate making by photopolymer which used in flexographic have limitation in achieving a micro-scale of pattern size. However, printing plate of microcontact printing have an advantages in producing micro, even nano-scale size by PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane). Hence, rapid prototyping 3 D printer was used for developing a PDMS micro-scale printing plate which will be used in reel to reel (R 2 R) flexographic due to high speed, low cost, mass production of this type of printing process. The flexibility of 3 D printer in producing any shape of pattern easily, contributed the success of this study. A nickel plating and glass etching master pattern was used in this study too as master pattern mould since 3 D printer has been reached the micro size limitation. The finest multiple solid line array with 1 mm width and 2 mm gap pattern of printing plate was successfully fabricated by 3 D printer master mould due to size limitation of the FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3 D printer nozzle itself. However, the micro-scale multiple solid line array of 100 micron and 25 micron successfully made by nikel platting and glass etching master mould respectively.

40|$|The {{influence}} of UV-light, temperature, atmospheric environment and storage {{time on the}} ink detachment of water-based <b>flexographic</b> ink <b>printed</b> on model cellulose surfaces was investigated using an impinging jet cell equipment. The printed surfaces were deinked using a NaOH solution (pH = 10) and the deinking process was monitored using a microscope equipped with a CCD camera. Images were collected at different time intervals during the detachment process and image {{analysis was used to}} quantify the ink detachment from the surface. Hand sheets, (the same pulp as used for model surface preparation) were also printed and stored under the same conditions, after which they were reslushed and deinked. The deinking efficiency of the recycled sheets was evaluated using brightness and ERIC (Effective Residual Ink Concentration) values. It was shown that UV-light had a negative effect on ink detachment both from the model cellulose surfaces and from the hand sheets. At storage temperatures of 55 °C, (dark conditions were used) a large negative effect was observed for the cellulose surfaces while only a small effect on the ink detachment could be seen for the hand sheets. Ink detachment from the hand sheets became more difficult when increasing the storage temperature above 55 °C, as detected as a decrease in brightness of the recycled and deinked sheets. A further increase in the storage temperature to 105 °C gave poorer ink detachment efficiency than storage under UV-light for the hand sheets. Air had a more negative effect on ink detachment than nitrogen...|$|R
