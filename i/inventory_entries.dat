40|$|The {{inventory}} {{lists of}} private library collections may be counted {{among the most}} significant sources {{for the study of}} the history of books in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. These inventories provide a true picture of the reading material used in a given historical period and reveal their owners’ spiritual preoccupations as well as those of their contemporaries. Many books listed in the inventories had disappeared from the collections over time, so the inventories remain the sole indicators helping us to reconstruct the spiritual life of the different social environments. The inventories deserve to be treated with exceptional reverence by the book historians. Example used by the author to show the type of information that might be learned from the inventory of a private library is the inventory of books that Nikola Pavlov de Gondola of Dubrovnik gave as a gift, in 1469, to the Benedictine monastery of St. Mary’s on the island of Lokrum near Dubrovnik. The inventory list comprises sixteen titles; among them are two milestones, Boccaccio’s The Decameron and Genealogies of the Gentile Gods. The two are the oldest specimens of these books ever to be discovered in Croatia. Using the standard methodology for book inventory analysis, developed by the so-called ‘middle generation’ of book historians, the author first establishes which book the <b>inventory</b> <b>entry</b> refers to and, then, he supplies information on the book. Finally, for the most important books, he sketches for the reader a wider context of the book ownership and use. The author also stresses the importance of the numerous private library inventories kept in the archives of Dubrovnik, Split, Zadar, etc. He argues that the publication and an in-depth analysis of the surviving inventories would supply valuable information not only on the books bought and read by their owners but also on the intellectual and cultural preoccupations of the social environments (towns) in which the owners lived...|$|R

RESULTS: On all cognitive tasks Beck scores on entry, even in the range 0 - 7 indicating differences in above average contentment, affected overall levels of cognitive performance but not rates of age-related cognitive decline suggesting effects of differences in life satisfaction rather than in depression.

40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} diverse {{environmental}} impacts of land use, a standardization of quantifying land use elementary flows is needed in life cycle assessment (LCA). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to propose how to standardize the land use classification and how to regionalize land use elementary flows. Materials and methods In life cycle inventories, land occupation and transformation are elementary flows providing relevant information on the type and location of land use for land use impact assessment. To find a suitable land use classification system for LCA, existing global land cover classification systems and global approaches to define biogeographical regions are reviewed. Results and discussion A new multi-level classification of land use is presented. It consists of four levels of detail ranging from very general global land cover classes to more refined categories and very specific categories indicating land use intensities. Regionalization is built on five levels, first distinguishing between terrestrial, freshwater, and marine biomes and further specifying climatic regions, specific biomes, ecoregions and finally indicating the exact geo-referenced information of land use. Current land use inventories and impact assessment methods do not always match and hinder a comprehensive assessment of land use impact. A standardized definition of land use types and geographic location helps to overcome this gap and provides the opportunity to test the optimal resolution of land cover types and regionalization for each impact pathway. Conclusions and recommendation The presented approach provides the necessary flexibility to providers of inventories and developers of impact assessment methods. To simplify inventories and impact assessment methods of land use, we need to find archetypical situations across impact pathways, land use types and regions, and aggregate <b>inventory</b> <b>entries</b> and methods accordingly...|$|E

Recombination cloning of single DNA fragments using the Gateway system provided an advance over traditional restriction enzyme cloning due to increases in efficiency and reliability. Here we introduce a series of entry clones and a destination vector for use in two, three, and four fragment Gateway MultiSite recombination cloning whose advantages include increased flexibility and versatility. In contrast to Gateway single-fragment cloning approaches where variations are typically incorporated into model system-specific destination vectors, our Gateway MultiSite cloning strategy incorporates variations in easily generated entry clones that are model system-independent. In particular, we present entry clones containing insertions of GAL 4, QF, UAS, QUAS, eGFP, and mCherry, among others, and demonstrate their in vivo functionality in Drosophila by using them to generate expression clones including GAL 4 and QF drivers for various trp ion channel family members, UAS and QUAS excitatory and inhibitory light-gated ion channels, and QUAS red and green fluorescent synaptic vesicle markers. We thus establish a starter toolkit of modular Gateway MultiSite entry clones potentially adaptable to any model system.

40|$|An {{advance in}} {{information}} and communication technology (ICT) {{is one of the}} most important forces in reshaping the world economy. So far, research on the role of ICT development in the financial globalization process is very limited. This dissertation is composed of three essays, which aim to fill part of this gap. The first essay explores transmission mechanism between Internet development and foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing economies. The second further investigates why developing economies cannot fully benefit from Internet development and provides policy recommendations. The third studies the relationship among financial integration, ICT and macroeconomic volatility in ten Asian economies. The first essay examines three potential channels: <b>inventory</b> costs, market <b>entry</b> costs and payment of bribes, through which the Internet attracts FDI. It develops a model to explain the role of the Internet in determining inward FDI, and then empirically tests the hypotheses. The empirical findings show that the Internet development in developing economies attracts multinationals, since it reduces their costs of holding <b>inventories</b> and market <b>entry</b> costs. The Internet is found to reduce corruption, but evidence for their combined effects on FDI is mixed. In addition, this study performs Granger causality test and finds a causal relationship from the Internet to inward FDI stocks, rather than vice versa. The second essay examines how the Internet [...] -a communication network [...] -which is characterized by the presence of positive and negative externalities affects the locational choice of FDI. A two-stage model is developed: at the first stage, multinational corporations do not cooperate and determine the degree of investment in Internet technologies, whereas, at the second stage, these firms engage in a Cournot quantity competition for a homogenous product. This model predicts that positive Internet externalities stimulate FDI while negative Internet externalities discourage FDI. These hypotheses are tested by the panel data estimation and the system general method of moments (GMM) estimator. The empirical findings provide strong evidence that the presence of negative Internet spillovers in developing countries discourages inward FDI, and the presence of positive Internet externalities in developed economies attracts more FDI. The third essay looks at ten Asian economies committed to ICT development and financial integration, and presents evidence on whether or not they have experienced greater output fluctuations from 1980 to 2003. A two-country dynamic general equilibrium model is used and ICT is assumed to increase the volume and speed of capital flows. This study's model predicts that economies with a high ICT development or/and a high degree of financial integration exhibit greater output fluctuations in the face of monetary policy shocks, but lower output fluctuations in the face of fiscal policy shocks. The empirical findings estimated by using the panel vector autoregression approach support these predictions...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{following}} question: How does competition influence the inventory holdings of General Motors' dealerships operating in isolated U. S. markets? We wish to disentangle two {{mechanisms by which}} local competition influences a dealer's inventory: (1) the entry or exit of a competitor can change a retailer's demand (a sales effect); and (2) the entry or exit of a competitor can change the amount of buffer stock a retailer holds, which influences {{the probability that a}} consumer finds a desired product in stock (a service-level effect). Theory is clear on the sales effect [...] an increase in sales leads to an increase in inventory (albeit a less than proportional increase). However, theoretical models of inventory competition are ambiguous on the expected sign of the service-level effect. Via a Web crawler, we obtained data on inventory and sales for more than 200 dealerships over a six-month period. Using cross-sectional variation, we estimated the effect of the number and type of local competitors on inventory holdings. We used several instrumental variables to control for the endogeneity of market entry decisions. Our results suggest that the service-level effect is strong, nonlinear, and positive. Hence, we observe that dealers carry more inventory (controlling for sales) when they face additional competition. <b>inventory</b> competition, empirical, <b>entry,</b> supply chain management, automobile industry...|$|R

Until recently, the library was run by the Education/Collections curator and assisted by one volunteer who helped to catalogue the collection using the Library of Congress Subject Heading, did <b>inventories,</b> data <b>entry</b> and other library-related activities. In 2004, a new library, the Virginia Reid Moore (VRM) Marine Research Library was opened {{as part of the}} CMA Expansion Project and a librarian was hired full-time to administer and manage the library and two part-time assistants have been hired to assist running the library. One of the unique characteristics of the VRM Marine Research Library collection is the wide variety and quantity of grey literature and ephemera materials {{from a wide variety of}} sources: local environmental organizations, historical societies, governmental reports, other aquariums publications, etc [...] . These documents have valuable and unique information, which often is not found elsewhere. These materials are vital to the VRM collection since they are rarely collected by traditional libraries and offer a rare view of non-traditional materials by non-profit, private and community organizations with common interests with the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium mission of research and education about the marine life of Southern California. Unfortunately, these materials are inaccessible to users. The materials are spread out in different locations at the aquarium, housed in old banker's boxes without indexes or any other access point. To begin to address this problem, the library has requested to the aquarium administration to invest approximately $ 4, 500 to acquire high-density file cabinets to help preserve and provide access to this valuable research material. Our goal is not only to secure the proper storage of these materials but also to centralize and supply access to this valuable resource. To achieve this goal, a three-prong strategy will be designed and executed to give access and develop further our grey literature and ephemera collection: indexing and thesaurus development; database with online searchable capabilities to the grey literature and ephemera collection and outreaching to local and regional organizations to expand the current collection. This paper will discuss the challenges of collecting and preserving grey literature and ephemera in the marine science knowledge-domain, and the design, execution and expected outcome of this VRM library initiative.

40|$|Estimating forest {{surfaces}} in Italy: {{the uncertainties of}} the new national forest <b>inventory.</b> Following the <b>entry</b> of the Kyoto Protocol (KP) into force, a new functionality {{has been added to}} the National Forestry Inventories (NFI), which are used to account for carbon stock changes in forest carbon pools. All Countries have to select a national forest definition in accordance with the KP rules. The KP requests that minimum thresholds for area, crown coverage and tree height are set. Thus the adopted forest definition drives the accounting of any forest-related land use and land-use change activities. The new NFIs should characterize the forest variables in accordance with the new forest definitions and thus they should adopt methodologies which are able to represent forest area as defined. The Italian NFI has applied a new methodology which is not in line with its own forest definition since this method considers new criteria of homogeneity in order to classify forest area. The homogeneity criteria requires a subjective analysis of the area around each sample point; thus the sample area assignment is not carried out objectively and univocally and consequently measurements are not reproducible either in time or space. The authors suggest an improved methodology that would allow the sampling of the national territory in line with the NFI forest definition. The main characteristic of the proposed methodology is to assign and to analyze a circular area around each sample point. The size of the circular area is taken equal to the NFI forest definition minimum threshold. The application of this methodology would result in objective and univocal measurements which are reproducible either in time or space. JRC. H. 3 -Global environement monitorin...|$|R

It is not known if selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) {{have an effect on}} neuroticism that is independent of their effect on depression. Healthy individuals with a genetic liability for depression represent a group of particular interest when investigating if intervention with SSRIs affects personality. The present trial is the first to test the hypothesis that escitalopram may reduce neuroticism in healthy first-degree relatives of patients with major depressive disorder (MD). The trial used a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled parallel-group design. We examined the effect of four weeks escitalopram 10 mg daily versus matching placebo on personality in 80 people who had a biological parent or sibling with a history of MD. The outcome measure on personality traits was change in self-reported neuroticism scores on the Revised Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness-Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) and the Eysenck Personality <b>Inventory</b> (EPQ) from <b>entry</b> until end of four weeks of intervention. When compared with placebo, escitalopram did not significantly affect self-reported NEO-PI-R and EPQ neuroticism and extroversion, EPQ psychoticism, NEO-PI-R openness, or NEO-PI-R conscientiousness (p all above 0. 05). However, escitalopram increased NEO-PI-R agreeableness scores significantly compared with placebo (mean; SD) (2. 38; 8. 09) versus (- 1. 32; 7. 94), p =  0. 046), but not following correction for multiplicity. A trend was shown for increased conscientiousness (p =  0. 07). There was no significant effect on subclinical depressive symptoms (p =  0. 6).

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{discussion in the}} Web services community about how to create composite applications for business process automation. Until recently {{no one has been}} focusing on a comprehensive solution to the difficult system-level problems that arise when Web services are combined. The OASIS Web Services-Composite Application Framework (WS-CAF) specifications provide the means to solve common infrastructure related problems found in typical composite applications such as order <b>entry,</b> <b>inventory</b> management and distributed transaction support. As Web services have evolved as a means to integrate processes and applications at an inter-enterprise level, traditional transaction semantics and protocols have proven to be inappropriate. Web services-based transactions, colloquially termed Business Transactions, differ from traditional transactions in that they execute over long periods, they require commitments to the transaction to be “negotiated ” at runtime, and isolation levels have to be relaxed. A solution to this problem has to work over HTTP and include existing transaction processing technologies of all types: database management systems, application servers, message queuing systems and packaged applications. The solution needs to support a range of requirements including lightweight applications in which the major goal is to let Web services know when they’re in the same application to complicated transactions that may take days or weeks to complete across wide ranging geographies, time zones, and enterprise boundaries. In this paper we’ll look at the WS-CAF standardization effort and show how it is attempting to address this important and difficult subject. We’ll also consider how the architecture defined by WS-CAF fits into the evolving architecture of Web services and give an indication of where we think things are going in the future. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Postnatal {{depression}} (PND) is under-diagnosed {{and most}} {{women do not}} access effective help. We aimed to evaluate comparative management of (PND) following screening with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, using three best-practice care pathways by comparing management by general practitioners (GPs) alone compared to adjunctive counselling, based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), delivered by postnatal nurses or psychologists. Methods This was a parallel, three-group randomised controlled trial conducted in a primary care setting (general practices and maternal & child health centres) and a psychology clinic. A total of 3, 531 postnatal women were screened for symptoms of depression; 333 scored above cut-off on the screening tool and 169 were referred to the study. Sixty-eight of these women were randomised between the three treatment groups. Results Mean scores on the Beck Depression <b>Inventory</b> (BDI-II) at <b>entry</b> were in the moderate-to-severe range. There was significant variation in the post-study frequency of scores exceeding the threshold indicative of mild-to-severe depressive symptoms, such that more women receiving only GP management remained above the cut-off score after treatment (p =. 028). However, all three treatment conditions were accompanied by significant reductions in depressive symptoms and mean post-study BDI-II scores were similar between groups. Compliance was high in all three groups. Women rated the treatments as highly effective. Rates of both referral to the study (51 %), and subsequent treatment uptake (40 %) were low. Conclusions Data from this small study suggest that GP management of PND when augmented by a CBT-counselling package may be successful in reducing depressive symptoms in more patients compared to GP management alone. The relatively low rates of referral and treatment uptake, suggest that help-seeking remains an issue for many women with PND, consistent with previous research.

40|$|The {{rapid advance}} of {{information}} technologies largely facilitated firms' data-driven decision making. Particularly, in operations management practices, firms could continuously collect information to refine their demand knowledge, and integrate this process into their relevant operational decisions, e. g. pricing, <b>inventory,</b> and market <b>entry,</b> known as demand learning.

I study the supplier's optimal wholesale prices when the retailer is in three different situations, and find that the retailer and the supply chain may actually benefit from either myopia or censorship in contrast to the existing results, due to the supplier's different collaborative or exploitative responses to the retailer's "willingness to learn". I also identify that, with demand censorship, the collaborative behavior between the players for information acquisition may improve the system's performance. Second, I study an online retail platform's learning process and entry policies as well as the independent seller's pricing distortion behavior to slow down this process, motivated by Amazon. com's unique dual role as both a marketplace and a merchant that allows it to use the transaction data generated by its third-party sellers to decide if to sell the same product itself. I developed a Bayesian statistical model for the platform's demand learning, proposed two types of heuristic entry policies for the platform owner. The model predicts a pattern of price distortion, and describes the product offering choices made by the independent seller. These could potentially serve as testable results for empirical studies...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters on international transmission of business cycles. It constructs dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium (DSGE) models that incorporate heterogeneous agents on the producer side; entry and exit dynamics; fixed exporting costs; and iceberg trade costs. I explain simulation results along the way how the models matter for policy and empirical regularities identified in the literature. This dissertation shows how micro-founded firm-level dynamics can improve {{the performance of the}} standard international business cycle models. In the first chapter, In this paper, I propose a two-country, dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium (DSGE) model with endogenous tradability, product differentiation, variously determined physical capital, and an elastic labor supply to explore the propagation of business cycles across countries. I show that the model successfully addresses international relative price dynamics (its appreciation with positive home productivity shock) through the entry of producers and their cut-off productivities of exporting. The use of endogenous physical capital in the model induces a more realistic framework since the simulated model is compared to the investment data that covers spending on capital equipment, structures and <b>inventories</b> for producers <b>entry</b> and exit dynamics. Building the model with endogenous capital and elastic labor supply weakens the volatility of investment compared to conventional international real business cycle (IRBC) models. The model also accounts for several features of the data, such as the volatility of aggregate variables and their correlations with GDP. In the second chapter, I explore the aggregate effects of trade restrictions in a two-country, dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium (DSGE) model with firm selection and variable adjustment of markup. As a response to the trade collapse in the global crisis of 2008 and 2009, temporary trade restrictions have emerged in several countries. With analyzing the dynamics of a negative macroeconomic shock in the home economy first, and the subsequent introduction of trade restrictions in the foreign economy second, I show that both economies are in a worse position than they were during the economic downturn. The follow-ups to the recession and trade restrictions are investigated through three mechanisms: a) variable markup as a new avenue of increasing competitive pressure for producers (e. g. more competitive firms lower their markups.); b) average individual firms 2 ̆ 7 specific productivity cut-off, which induces their optimum export choice (e. g. an increase in the export productivity cut-off means exporting becomes more difficult than before.); and c) the movement of international relative prices (e. g. the real exchange rate and terms of trade). In the final chapter, I examine the effects of adding non-traded sector and trade in intermediate goods sector, and their impact on the `Backus-Smith 2 ̆ 7 (BS) puzzle and the features of the non-traded output. Conventional IRBC models show that the real exchange rate and the terms of trade is positively correlated to the relative consumption movement between the home and foreign economies when there is a total factor productivity shock, while the correlation in the data is negative. I develop a two-country, dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium (DSGE) model with staggered price setting in non-tradable sector and international trade in intermediate goods sector due to product differentiation in a high asset market frictions situation. When the world economy has positive country-specific productivity shock, the benchmark model successfully solves the BS puzzle and is able to match several features of the data. The dynamic responses to productivity shock show that integrating product differentiation is necessary to generate a more volatile and countercyclical non-traded output...|$|R
40|$|Over {{two years}} of {{research}} including, policy review, field inspections and focus group sessions the Inspectorate has examined the Garda Síochána’s crime investigation practices and informed this inspection. The Inspectorate has also described in detail, the processes involved in the everyday investigation of crime in Ireland, {{in order to show}} the significant challenges and complex inter-relationships involved in these processes. Introduction Part 1 Crime Prevention Part 2 Divisional Policing Part 3 First Response Part 4 Incident Recording Part 5 Crime Management Part 6 Investigating Crime Part 7 The Victims Experience Part 8 Intelligence Led Policing Part 9 Investigation and Detention of Suspects Part 10 Offender Management Part 11 Detecting and Prosecuting Crime Addendum to Crime Investigation Report: Guerin Report Appendices Examples of drug or alcohol related findings P. 36 Victims of crime who have consumed alcohol may be sent away, with the onus on the victim to contact the gardaí later if they want to report a crime; (see also p. 337 & 351) P. 38 In other jurisdictions police services drug test people arrested for specific crimes; P. 46 Divisions and districts have conducted audits of drug cases and found large numbers of cases where drugs have been seized and no proceedings have been taken; • There is no adult caution system for possession of drugs; P. 66 The Inspectorate recommends that the Garda Síochána provides clarity about the crime investigation role of divisional specialist units, such as drugs and other tasking units, traffic units and community policing units. (Medium term). P. 73 Develop a national drugs register to ensure consistent <b>inventory</b> and data <b>entry</b> by all drugs units; Consider mandatory drug testing of persons detained for “trigger offences” including but not limited to burglary and robbery; P. 77 The Inspectorate recommends that the Garda Síochána engages key partner agencies to develop an effective drug arrest referral scheme for those detained in garda stations. (Medium term). P. 79 The Inspectorate recommends that the Department of Justice and Equality convene a working group to consider extending the legislation governing the adult cautioning scheme to include possession of drugs and other suitable offences. (Medium term). P. 93 Develop an early arrest referral scheme for those prolific offenders who are drug users. P. 104 Whilst drug offences are not one of the main crimes that feature in this report, the Inspectorate recognises that many of the volume crimes committed are carried out by those who may commit crime to fuel a drug habit. As part of this report, the Inspectorate will specifically look at that category of offender and identify opportunities to divert them away from crime. The Inspectorate examined cases of possession of drugs and the outcomes of those cases. P. 108 Develop a divisional approach for the deployment of specialist units i. e. drugs units, traffic and community policing; P. 118 & 119 Deployment of Gardaí in operational divisions chart P. 177 Garda PULSE records can be changed by altering the spelling of a person’s name or a person’s date of birth. Many reasons for changing data were offered, including that PULSE intelligence records cannot be deleted but can be changed to remove the association of that intelligence from an individual. Specific examples were provided when young people are stopped and searched under the Misuse of Drugs Act. The association of a young person stopped by a drug unit, albeit if no drugs were found, will remain on garda records. This can have serious connotations for the person’s records on the PULSE system. P. 184 Where a crime has taken place, but a victim refuses to give a statement, it can be recorded in Attention and Complaints; • Most worrying, that cases of rape, where victims have consumed alcohol, can be placed into this category, until a victim’s statement is obtained. P. 187 Currently in Ireland, there is no provision under stop and search powers to search people who may be in possession of stolen property. Consequently, this results in stop and searches being conducted under the Misuse of Drugs Act legislation. The Inspectorate has received negative feedback from within the Garda Síochána at all ranks about the use of stop and search, and that in many cases the power under the Misuse of Drugs Act is used in the absence of other powers. When a search is conducted under this legislation in Ireland, and no drugs are found, it is still recorded on PULSE and classified as a search under the Drugs Act. Each division has a drugs unit and further inference is often drawn from searches conducted by drugs unit members. If someone is stopped by the gardaí, an inference might be drawn from the data recorded arising from a previous search. Clearly, a person not found with any stolen property or drugs should not be stigmatised or otherwise disadvantaged in the future. The Inspectorate is aware that the new Vetting Act will provide some safeguards for what is and what is not disclosed in the future. P. 236 Local Specialist Units - A number of local specialist units operate in the divisions visited. All divisions outside of the DMR and all districts within the DMR have dedicated drugs units. These units conduct proactive operations based on local intelligence and investigate crimes that arise from their activity. The main focus of drugs units is on more serious drug offences and they have a clear remit to reduce drugs possession and the supply of drugs. 4 In some divisions, principally in the DMR, drug units are also used on intelligence led operations aimed at targeting prolific burglary offenders who commit crime to sustain their drug addiction. The Inspectorate viewed these deployments as good use of resources to tackle associated crimes. Investigations by drugs units are not usually allocated to them but are self generated, arising from operations and arrests for drug offences. P. 399 Integrated offender management – One of the key aims of IOM is to break the cycle of persistent or prolific offending, particularly where drug or alcohol addiction is a factor in offending behaviour...|$|R
