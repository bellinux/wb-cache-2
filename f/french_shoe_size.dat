50|$|<b>French</b> <b>Shoes</b> was a {{shoe chain}} {{headquartered}} in Montreal, Quebec. It began in 1956 and its last location {{closed in the}} 1990s. <b>French</b> <b>Shoes</b> featured very stylish women shoes at an affordable price and grew to 30 locations located mostly in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. The founder of <b>French</b> <b>Shoes</b> was Seymour (Sonny) Lubin (1932-2009). In the early years, he was joined by Gerard Gingras and the two were an excellent team in the Canadian ladies shoe fashion industry. The company was sold in 1979 to Bata Shoes which made the purchase to enter a higher grade of shoe market. However, the acquisition was not successful and the brand was sold again {{a few years to}} later to Calderone Shoes, a large Toronto shoe company. Calderone Shoes eventually fell into hard times, and the <b>French</b> <b>Shoes</b> legend and name died. However, <b>French</b> <b>Shoes</b> was an exciting place to be in Montreal from the early 1960s to late 1970s and will always be remembered fondly.|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{describe}} population {{reference values}} for <b>shoes</b> <b>size,</b> {{and to identify}} possible disproportional foot growth during GH therapy. Materials and methods Construction of percentile chart based on 3, 651 controls (male: 1, 838; female: 1, 813). The GH treated group included 13 children with idiopathic short stature (ISS) and 50 children with normal height, but with height prediction below their target height; male: 26 and female: 37 mean ± SD age 13. 3 ± 1. 9 and 12. 9 ± 1. 5 years, respectively. GH (0. 05 mg/kg/day) was used for 3. 2 ± 1. 6 years, ranging from 1. 0 - 10. 3 years. Height expressed as SDS, target height (TH) SDS, self-reported <b>shoes</b> <b>size</b> and target <b>shoes</b> <b>size</b> (TSS) SDS were recorded. Results Reference values were established showed as a foot SDS calculator available online at www. clinicalcaselearning. com/v 2. Definitive <b>shoes</b> <b>size</b> was attained in controls at mean age of 13 y in girls and 14 y in boys (average values 37 and 40, respectively). In the study group, <b>shoes</b> <b>size</b> was - 0. 15 ± 0. 9 and - 0. 02 ± 1. 3 SDS, with target feet of 0. 08 ± 0. 8 and - 0. 27 ± 0. 7 SDS in males and females, respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between <b>shoes</b> <b>size</b> and familial TSS, between <b>shoes</b> <b>size</b> and height and between TSS and TH. There was no correlation between duration of GH treatment and <b>shoes</b> <b>size.</b> Our data suggest that during long-term treatment with GH, patients maintain proportional growth in <b>shoes</b> <b>size</b> and height, and the expected correlation with the familial target. Conclusions We conclude {{that there is no}} excessive increase in the size of foot as estimated by the <b>size</b> of <b>shoes</b> in individuals under long term GH therapy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Knowing {{the timing}} of the pubertal growth spurt of the spine, {{represented}} by sitting height, is essential for the prognosis and therapy of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. There are several indicators that reflect growth or remaining growth of the patient. For example, distal body parts have their growth spurt earlier in adolescence, and therefore the growth of the foot can be an early indicator for the growth spurt of sitting height. <b>Shoe</b> <b>size</b> is a good alternative for foot length, since patients can remember when they bought new <b>shoes</b> and what <b>size</b> these <b>shoes</b> were. Therefore the clinician already has access to some longitudinal data at the first visit of the patient to the outpatient clinic. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the increase in <b>shoe</b> <b>size</b> during adolescence and to determine whether {{the timing of}} the peak increase could be an early indicator for {{the timing of the}} peak growth velocity of sitting height. Methods Data concerning <b>shoe</b> <b>sizes</b> of girls and boys were acquired from two large shoe shops from 1991 to 2008. The longitudinal series of 242 girls and 104 boys were analysed for the age of the "peak increase" in <b>shoe</b> <b>size,</b> as well as the age of cessation of foot growth based on <b>shoe</b> <b>size.</b> Results The average peak increase in <b>shoe</b> <b>size</b> occurred at 10. 4 years (SD 1. 1) in girls and 11. 5 years (SD 1. 5) in boys. This was on average 1. 3 years earlier than the average peak growth velocity of sitting height in girls, and 2. 5 years earlier in boys. The increase in <b>shoe</b> <b>size</b> diminishes when the average peak growth velocity of sitting height takes place at respectively 12. 0 (SD 0. 8) years in girls, and 13. 7 (SD 1. 0) years in boys. Conclusions Present data suggest that the course of the <b>shoe</b> <b>size</b> of children visiting the outpatient clinic can be a useful first tool for predicting the timing of the pubertal growth spurt of sitting height, as a representative for spinal length. This claim needs verification by direct comparison of individual <b>shoe</b> <b>size</b> and sitting height data and than a step forward can be made in clinical decision making regarding adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{purposes}} {{to formulate}} 3 D <b>shoe</b> <b>size</b> by using scanning camera and link to CAD modeling. Design/methodology/approach: The research design {{is divided into}} four groups with differentages and sex. The first group is boys and girls with 6 - 10 years old. The second group is teenagerswith 11 – 20 years old. The third group is university students and working people with 21 - 30 year olds. The last group is professional working people group with 31 – 48 years old. The sample populations are selectedand measured their feet both left and right sides. Each group contains ten to eighteen people except the childgroup which contains three to five children. The sampling sizes are 97 people. The 3 D scanning camerais used {{in order to obtain}} the all sides of the feet. The process contains five steps in five foot positions;the middle foot, the 45 ° left foot, the 90 ° left foot, the 45 ° right foot, 90 ° right foot.
