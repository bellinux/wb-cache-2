40|$|In {{the period}} in question, {{the family in the}} Czech Lands was usually {{comprised}} of between five and seven members – father, mother and children. Founding a family was subject to the agreement of the lord of the manor (in the countryside) or the municipal authority (in the town). „Confirmation of probity” was requested from the seigniorial authorities in Catholic parishes even after the abolition of serfdom in the Habsburg monarchy (1781), while the approval of the couple’s legal representatives (parents) was also required {{in the case of the}} marriage of people younger than twenty-four (the age of maturity). Partners were chosen by parents according to their property and social standing. People to be married were generally not only from the same social class, but also from the same place or nearby in the surrounding area. No lower age limit for marriage was stipulated by the law, though grooms younger than twenty were the exception, while around a fifth of brides were younger than twenty. The family represented a small social group comprised of individuals joined by marriage, consanguinity or adoption. It was seen as an institution to which the greatest regard was given. Its integrity was protected by a number of laws and traditions. In the first half of the nineteenth century, women usually got married between the ages of twenty and twenty-five, and men between the ages of twenty-five and thirty. The upper age limit, however, approached a figure of as much as fifty, or even exceeded it, for men living in towns. The age of brides was also higher in town families, among which couples being engaged for many years was also not unusual. This was particularly common among clerical workers, who had to attain a certain standing in order to be able to found a family. What’s more, according to the imperial decree of 1800, every state or municipal official needed the agreement of his superior if his pay had not reached a certain financial „ceiling”. A marriage licence was also conditional to the attainment of a certain service position for policemen, soldiers, <b>financial</b> <b>guards</b> and teachers. People entered into marriage earlier in Moravia than in Bohemia. Around ten percent of the population of the Czech Lands remained unmarried. As far as women were concerned, these were maids and the daughters of less affluent tradesmen, clerical workers or poor aristocratic families that did not have a sufficiently large dowry. In the first half of the nineteenth century, there was an increasing number of „deferred weddings”, particularly in the towns, when a couple became married only when they already had a number of illegitimate children; this was particularly evident in the border areas inhabited by a German population...|$|R

50|$|Headlines were {{generated}} after delays in construction and considerably higher {{costs for the}} museum than originally proposed {{to the city of}} Bentonville, Arkansas led to concerns about the favorable tax exemptions granted to the museum from the state in 2005 to secure its construction.

The total amount of tax loss is estimated to have become considerably higher since then, but may never be disclosed due to the museum's <b>guarded</b> <b>financial</b> practices, including its decision not to disclose the amount spent since 2008 to secure collections, major art pieces, and lesser known works.

This thesis analyzes the potential of business process reengineering (BPR) to dramatically improve the Military Pay Document Process (MPDP) for the United States Army and the United States Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>financial</b> communities. Based on Nissen's methodology the MPDP is analyzed and three redesign alternatives are developed, which are capable of yielding order of magnitude improvements in cycle time and cost. This thesis includes process simulation and intelligent systems analysis of the Army and Coast Guard's baseline MPDP to generate and evaluate the three redesign alternatives. Simulation runs demonstrate that cycle time and cost can be reduced substantially by redesigning the MPDP. The redesign alternatives take a comprehensive look at transformation enablers and information technology (IT) capable of eliminating the Personnel Administrative Clerks (PAC) and the finance office functions as they pertain to pay transaction processing. The research concludes that the Army and Coast Guard's MPDP can be dramatically improved by eliminating middlemen functions (PAC and finance office) and shortening the value chain using IT along with other transformation enablers[URL] United States Army.

40|$|The {{forensic}} {{value of}} the environmental engineer in the environmental field is related to a working knowledge {{in a wide variety}} of disciplines and to a validated problem solver capability. This paper analyzes some specific case studies developed by environmental engineering research team of University Parthenope and introduces a proposal of new procedures and technologies in the monitoring of contaminated site that are not usual for the domain of the environmental engineering and, particularly, for the forensics field. The main novelty of this proposal lies in the specific procedure that involves aerial infrared thermography, specific information technology tools and combines the data collected at different altitudes with those grabbed by standard methods. In the examination of investigated scenario our procedures involve the use of the aerial platforms and in some cases also "special" aerial platforms like a specialized Drone/UAV. In the localization of environmental criticalities our techniques involve IR Thermography, in particular Quantitative Infra-Red Thermography.

40|$|Environmental {{violation}} is {{an illegal}} act that harms {{the environment or}} endangers public health, offending federal, state or local laws. When the environmental violation is excessive or the violator is a repeat offender, it evolves into environmental crime. Environmental crime {{is a relatively new}} concept and is ever changing. To guarantee the safety and security of the public, environmental laws regulate all activities that {{have a negative effect on}} human health, harm a community or the environment. The citizens' exposure to pollution and/or to dangerous wastes is a major public health problem; therefore, public authorities must act as quickly as possible to identify such environmental issues. An early identification of environmental criticalities would reduce citizens' exposure risks and remediation costs. The most suitable solution to detecting environmental criticalities and preventing environmental crime is targeted and effective environmental monitoring. In this paper it will be shown how our integrated system, which includes aerial platforms and ad-hoc sensors (e. g. infrared cameras, multispectral sensors, etc.), can be an effective tool to ensure environmental and human safety and security. Our monitoring and measurement protocol has been developed to answer the needs of environmental enforcement. Thus the technique demonstrated here can ensure a wide coverage area, is cost effective, in terms both of time and money, and provides highly precise measurements with few false alarms. The proposed procedures, techniques and technologies were tested and validated in environmental police actions directed by Italian government bodies (Public Prosecutor, Environmental Protection Agency, Coast <b>Guard,</b> <b>Financial</b> Police, Forest Rangers etc.) in real, in the field operations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Inflation {{targeting}} (IT) arrangements rose {{to prominence}} in the early 1990 s, when a couple of advanced countries adopted IT as their formal monetary policy framework. Over the years, IT arrangements have also been implement by {{a growing number of}} emerging economies, including Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, all of which adopted IT frameworks soon after the Asian crisis. Although formally following IT regimes, the central banks of these four countries have continued to manage their exchange rates against the dollar. While generally low inflation rates during the period of "great moderation" made inflation targeting a relatively easy job and gave central banks leeway to manage exchange rates without compromising their inflation targets, there have been episodes during which conflicts arose between explicit internal inflation targets and informal external exchange rate targets. Conflict, however, may not only arise between inflation and exchange-rate targeting, but also when taking into account the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability. After the Global Financial Crisis clearly exposed the problems that can arise for financial stability when central banks focus too narrowly on inflation rates, a consensus is currently emerging that central banks ought to include financial stability in their policy reaction functions. Against this backdrop, the chapter discusses the trilemma faced by East Asian central banks in targeting inflation rates {{while at the same time}} <b>guarding</b> <b>financial</b> market stability and managing exchange rates. It reviews the experience of East Asian countries with inflation targeting to date and discusses the challenges for incorporating macroprudential regulation into monetary policy frameworks while keeping an eye on the exchange rate...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{nationwide}} {{survey of}} approximately 25, 000 working Americans revealed that, {{at any point}} in time, 25 percent experience some type of chronic pain complaint. Chronic pain is a universal problem, as an estimated 80 percent of the U. S. population will suffer from back pain at least once, which makes it the second most common reason for seeing a doctor, following coughs and other respiratory infections. Given medical expenses to treat pain complaints, disability payments, and lost productivity and time at work, the costs of back pain add up to more than $ 100 billion per year. Pain complaints are so pervasive in primary medicine that many health care accreditation organizations require pain ratings as the “fifth vital sign ” during medical visits. Prior to the appearance of psychological approaches to chronic pain 20 years ago, the field of pain treatment was inordinately biomedical and dominated by subspecialties such as neurology, neurosurgery, anesthesiology, and orthopedic surgery. The biomedical approach to chronic pain historically has been an intensely parochial undertaking, with millions of dollars in revenues accruing to hospital specialists for what are now widely regarded as non-evidence-based procedures. As an example of this closely <b>guarded</b> <b>financial</b> turf, a project in the early 1990 s by the formerly named Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to develop an evidence-based practice guideline for the treatment of chronic back pain was gutted in part because of intense congressional lobbying by the American Medical Association. The reason for this intense opposition was that the initial evidence-based reviews of the clinical literature showed that neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, trigger point injections, and other commonly used biomedical procedures were no more effective than chiropractic treatment in improving long-term outcomes. We are now witnessing similarly comparable effects between surgery an...|$|R
40|$|As homeowner equity {{continues}} to disappear, {{there is a}} growing consensus that losses on all mortgages will exceed $ 1 trillion, with financial losses spreading far beyond real estate. Mortgage rates are spiking and, more generally, interest rate spreads remain wide, as financial players shun private debt in the rush to safe Treasury securities. Labor markets continue to weaken as firms shed jobs, and state tax revenues have plummeted. In March, the dollar fell to new record lows against the euro and other currencies. Commodities prices have boomed, fueling inflation and adding to consumer distress. What's a central bank to do? So far, the Federal Reserve has met or exceeded the market's anticipations for rate cuts. It has allowed banks to offer securitized mortgages as collateral against borrowed reserves, and opened its discount window to a broad range of <b>financial</b> institutions to <b>guard</b> against future liquidity problems (remember Bear Stearns?). It helped to formulate a rescue plan for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and Chairman Ben Bernanke even supported the fiscal stimulus package that will increase the federal budget deficit—something that is normally anathema to central bankers. Most importantly, Fed officials have consistently argued that, while they are carefully monitoring inflation pressures, they will not reverse monetary easing until the fallout from the subprime crisis is past. Unfortunately, the policy isn't working [...] the economy {{continues to}} weaken, the financial crisis is spreading, and inflation is accelerating. The problem is that policymakers do not recognize the underlying forces driving the crisis, in part because they operate with an incorrect model of how our economy works.
