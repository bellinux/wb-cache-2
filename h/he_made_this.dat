5|$|As the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of {{decreased}} {{involvement with}} his firm. The staff {{had begun to}} shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> change, however, he set {{to work on his}} last major project as active partner: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of high culture as the Louvre and US National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to low culture. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. As in the past, Pei accepted the commission {{in part because of the}} unique challenge it presented.|$|E
5|$|At {{this crucial}} juncture, Abe chose {{to abandon the}} mission and depart the area. Several reasons are conjectured as to why <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> decision. Much of the special {{bombardment}} ammunition had been expended in the battle. If the bombardment failed to destroy the airfield, then his warships would be vulnerable to CAF air attack at dawn. His own injuries and the deaths {{of some of his}} staff from battle action may have affected Abe's judgement. Perhaps he was also unsure as to how many of his or the U.S. ships were still combat-capable because of communication problems with the damaged Hiei. Furthermore, his own ships were scattered and would have taken some time to reassemble for a coordinated resumption of the mission to attack Henderson Field and the remnants of the U.S. warship force. For whatever reason, Abe called for a disengagement and general retreat of his warships, although Yukikaze and Teruzuki remained behind to assist Hiei. Samidare picked up survivors from Yūdachi at 03:00 before joining the other Japanese ships in the retirement northwards.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Gulf War in 1990–91, {{when the}} Intifada's {{intensity}} began to wear down, Arafat supported Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and opposed the US-led coalition attack on Iraq. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> decision {{without the consent}} of other leading members of Fatah and the PLO. Arafat's top aide Abu Iyad vowed to stay neutral and opposed an alliance with Saddam; On 17 January 1991, Abu Iyad was assassinated by the Abu Nidal Organization. Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported the US-led coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace. After the end of hostilities, many Arab states that backed the coalition cut off funds to the PLO and began providing financial support for the organization's rival Hamas and other Islamist groups. Arafat narrowly escaped death again on 7 April 1992, when an Air Bissau aircraft he was a passenger on crash-landed in the Libyan Desert during a sandstorm. Two pilots and an engineer were killed; Arafat was bruised and shaken.|$|E

25|$|Florida State {{continued}} to hold their touchdown lead through the third quarter when the Crimson Tide scored their first points on a 44-yard Berrey field goal. With just 1:27 left in the game, Seminoles head coach Darrell Mudra elected to take an intentional safety instead of attempting a punt out of the endzone. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> decision as Alabama had been close {{on a couple of}} previous attempts to block punts during the game, and did not want a block to occur in the endzone. Down now 7–5, the Crimson Tide drove into field goal territory and Berrey hit the game winner from 36-yards out with only 0:33 left in the game. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Florida State to 2–0–1.|$|E
25|$|The fall {{came when}} Fratianno became the second American Mafioso to turn state's {{evidence}} and testify against the Mafia in court. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> decision upon {{learning from the}} F.B.I. that Dominic Brooklier ordered his death. Brooklier, who didn't trust Fratianno, ordered the hit because Fratianno was presenting himself as boss {{of the family and}} felt {{that he was trying to}} usurp him. Fratianno testified against mobsters not only in Los Angeles, but across the country. Although the Justice Department thought it finally crippled the Mafia in Los Angeles, a Federal Judge gave Brooklier, Sciortino, Michael Rizzitello, Dragna, and Jack LoCicero light sentences ranging from two to five years in 1981 for racketeering and extortion. Brooklier still ran the family from his prison cell until he died of a heart attack in 1984. With Brooklier's imprisonment, capo Peter Milano quickly stepped up and began running the family in 1981.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Mills {{decided to}} speak about his inner experiences, but only if asked to do so. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> {{agreement}} after he received the same message from two different sources: “You must learn to speak the Word again.” Then, people began seeking him out - sometimes arriving unexpectedly on his doorstep - asking about their deepest questions and concerns. Mills found himself speaking spontaneously to these seekers. When their number became too large to speak with individually, Mills began giving lectures. He defined his spontaneous speaking, which he called Unfoldment, as “an impromptu performance under the impelling of divine ideas. It is a projection from another dimension or plane of consciousness, causing those prepared to hear to awaken to the higher or greater possibilities of living {{beyond the limits of}} three dimensions and translating {{what seems to be the}} ordinary into another level of consideration.” He also often spoke in poetry, offering some 3,000 extemporaneous poems during his lifetime.|$|E

25|$|On 19 November the Red Army began {{a counter}} offensive, named Operation Uranus. Within days, the Soviets had encircled some 300,000 German, Italian, Romanian and Hungarian {{soldiers}} {{in the city of}} Stalingrad. It was decided by Hitler and the OKL to supply the Axis forces by air. Richthofen was horrified. He telephoned Berchtesgaden and tried to get through to Hitler, but none of his aides would put him through. He tried to convince Göring that his air fleet did not have the resources to sustain an air lift, and that the best option would be to attempt a breakout before the Soviet forces entrenched. He flew to Manstein's headquarters, and the Field Marshal agreed a breakout must take place. With the Sixth Army preserved, the initiative could be regained later. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> request to Hitler. The Soviet divisions were smaller than their German counterparts: but they had 97. Holding Stalingrad was now impossible.|$|E
25|$|Revere's {{father died}} in 1754, when Paul was legally too young to officially be {{the master of the}} family silver shop. In February 1756, during the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War), he enlisted in the provincial army. Possibly <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> {{decision}} because of the weak economy, since army service promised consistent pay. Commissioned a second lieutenant in a provincial artillery regiment, he spent the summer at Fort William Henry {{at the southern end of}} Lake George in New York as part of an abortive plan for the capture of Fort St. Frédéric. He did not stay long in the army, but returned to Boston and assumed control of the silver shop in his own name. On August 4, 1757, he married Sarah Orne (1736–1773); their first child was born eight months later. He and Sarah had eight children, but two died young, and only one, Mary, survived her father.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the war and {{his release}} from Japanese captivity, Toovey stuck by his wartime aim of playing cricket for Queensland by making his {{first-class}} debut for the state against South Australia in the 1949–50 Sheffield Shield.

25|$|On 2 December 1968, Ne Win, Chairman of the Union Revolutionary Council (RC), {{established}} a 33-man 'Internal Unity Advisory Board' (IUAB; known more informally as 'the thirty-three') of former politicians {{some of whom}} he had jailed (or put in protective custody) several years earlier. The Board was assigned {{with the task of}} advising the RC for possible suggestions to enhance internal unity and to make suggestions for possible political changes. U Nu was one of the 'thirty-three'. In February 1969, U Nu submitted an 'interim report' recommending that Ne Win hand over power back to him; that the Parliament abolished by Ne Win in March 1962 be reconvened. He proposed that the Parliament would meet and formally appoint Ne Win as president. In his proposal he stated that he made these suggestions in good faith after repeatedly mulling over alternative arrangements. He also stated that <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> proposal in absolute sincerity so that the Revolutionary Council not remain as 'usurpers' ('those who came to power through force') and the 'taint of illegality' of Ne Win's takeover be erased. (The English translation of U Nu's 'interim report' or proposals could be read in the 3 June 1969 issues of the Rangoon Guardian and the Working People's Daily).|$|E
25|$|In its mature version, Vico's {{conception}} of sensus communis {{is defined by}} him as “judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race”. Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by Plato, Tacitus, Francis Bacon and Grotius. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, {{is to find the}} common sense shared by different people and nations. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss Natural Law, improving upon Grotius, John Selden, and Pufendorf who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond looking for one single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a detailed view of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths formed under the influence of them. This is comparable to both Montesquieu's Spirit of the Laws, as well as much later Hegelian historicism, both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.|$|E
