The large grained columnar poly crystalline Silicon obtained via Directional Solidification Systems (DSS) {{was found to be}} a convenient alternative to the expensive mono crystal obtained via Czochralski: production costs are much lower and the solar cells efficiency is significantly increased in comparison with the ones obtained via traditional growth. Among the main manufacturers of DSS systems the traditional resistance heating is used both in the phase of melting the raw Silicon and in the phase of re-crystallization {{in order to maintain the}} proper temperature gradient between the top and the bottom of the crucible. The induction heating technology could be a valid option, but only few manufacturers use it. In the paper a comparison between the two different technologies used in DSS for the production of columnar poly Si ingots will be presented and discussed: electric resistors and induction furnaces. The former is a well known and widely used technology. The latter is increasing in the last years. Pros and cons are considered for both systems: energy consumption during the whole process, <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> <b>time,</b> melting time, controlled cooling strategies, process regulation and global efficiencies are evaluated using electromagnetic and thermal simulations.

These values determine the sizing and power requirements of the system and also impact the number and operational phasing of reaction chambers. In this paper, a Nusselt number correlation analysis is performed to determine the heat transfer rates and regolith <b>heat</b> <b>up</b> <b>times</b> in a fluidized bed reactor heated by a central heating element (e. g., a resistively heated rod, or a solar concentrator heat pipe). A coupled chemical and transport model has also been developed for the chemical reduction of regolith by a continuous flow of hydrogen. The regolith conversion occurs on the surfaces of and within the regolith particles. Several important quantities are identified {{as a result of the}} above analyses. Reactor scale parameters include the void fraction (i. e., the fraction of the reactor volume not occupied by the regolith particles) and the residence time of hydrogen in the reactor. Particle scale quantities include the particle Reynolds number, the Archimedes number, and the time needed for hydrogen to diffuse into the pores of the regolith particles.

40|$|To {{meet the}} needs of forward {{deployed}} soldiers and disaster relief personnel, a mobile water distillation system was designed and tested. This system uses waste engine heat from the exhaust flow of an internal combustion engine to vaporize water for the purpose of removing impurities. The vapor is condensed back down to water in a finned condenser that experiences forced convection. The system pumps heat transfer oil through a 0. 61 meter long, cross flow, annulus-type heat exchanger installed over a section of exhaust pipe where the oil experiences a AT of 7 °C. The hot heat transfer oil is then piped to a boiler where it releases its heat to the water and returns to the exhaust heat exchanger to be reheated. Testing demonstrated that the system has a <b>heat</b> <b>up</b> <b>time</b> of 30 minutes, and a steady state distillation rate of 2 gallons per hour.

Therefore, LLNL in collaboration with Cal Poly has designed and built a Mini High Temperature Testing Unit (MHTTU) to recreate conditions observed during a fire and to test different materials in an effective, inexpensive, regulated and reliable method. The existing prototype was unable to achieve the ideal testing conditions of 1000 °F air at the low flow rates of 1. 25 - 12 ACFM; therefore, this project looks to optimize previous efforts on building a portable and reliable MHTTU to collect more information and perform different tests in various materials utilized {{in the construction of}} ceramic HEPA filters. Based on previous teams’ inputs, our team performed a heat transfer analysis to determine critical heat loss points and to optimize the design of the MHTTU. After several idea generation sessions, it was decided to modified the geometry of the testing chamber and the insulation of the system. The MHTTU also lacks a robust control system and a user interface; therefore, a more reliable interface and more versatility during the tests were implemented in the system.

Aim and Objectives: To determine whether such bands could be successfully decontaminated with Glass bead sterilization so that they could be re-used without a cross-infection risk. Materials: Custom made molar bands were taken and buccal tubes,lingual sheath and lingual cleat were welded under strict aseptic conditions. Methods: Samples were divided into 2 groups i. e.

In this study, microwave plasma gasification was used to compensate this problem. The objectives {{of this paper is}} to investigate the CO 2 microwave gasification of EFB and OPS biochar, and optimizing the char reaction rate through the addition of activated carbon as the microwave absorber. A microwave plasma gasification test rig was designed to produce syngas from oil palm biochar. From the study, it was found that EFB char performed better than OPS char as gasification fuel due to its high porosity and surface area that increased the char reactivity towards CO 2. The temperature increment promoted by the addition of MW absorber using activated carbon (AC) has increased the CO composition. The optimum condition for microwave plasma char gasification of EFB was 3 lpm with 25 wt% AC that produced syngas with 1. 23 vol% CH 4, 20. 88 vol% CO 2, 43. 83 vol% CO, 34. 06 vol% H 2 and 9. 40 MJ/kg gas CV.

40|$|We are {{developing}} a solar process for producing magnesium (Mg) from magnesium oxide (MgO) via electrolysis in a molten salt. Magensium is a valuable commodity with an increasing demand currently produced in fossil fuel and electric energy intensive processes that significantly contribute to global climate change. Our process reduces the electric energy required by operating at high temperature and also displaces electric energy with solar thermal energy, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. In order to effectively deliver the solar thermal energy to the MgO electrolysis process, we propose the Active Reflux Sodium Heat Pipe Receiver. In this concept, sodium is evaporated by high-flux solar radiation {{at the top of}} a power tower. The sodium vapor then flows to the ground to the electrolytic cells where it condenses, liberating the heat of vaporaziation to heat the cells. The condensed sodium is then pumped back to the tower and reused for continued heating. We are testing the concept of the Active Reflux Sodium Heat Pipe Receiver using a laboratory-scale 5 kW receiver and the VALPO solar furnace. Our tests focus on developing the heat pipe-electrolytic cell interface. We thus are using conventional sodium heat pipes in which the sodium flows by gravity to avoid the need to actively pump the sodium. In this study, we develop a numerical model for the heat transfer in the solar reciver. The model uses a finite volume method to solve for the distribution of temperature throughout the receiver. The purpose of this model is to determine (1) the time it takes the heat pipes to reach operating temperature of 1400 K, (2) the rate of heat transfer through the heat pipes, and (3) the thermal efficiency of the receiver. The model predicts a <b>heat</b> <b>up</b> <b>time</b> of three minutes for the heat pipes to reach 1400 K. The resulting rate of heat transfer through the heat pipes to the outside air is 298 W.

It is often overlooked, however that such gravitational instabilities of the gas disks have {{severe implications for the}} overall stability of the gas and star disks of spiral galaxies. I show by numerical simulations of the evolution of a combined gas and star disk that the violation of the stability condition induces violent dynamical evolution of the combined system.

40|$|The waste {{produced}} from processing spent fuel from the EBR II reactor must be processed into a waste form suitable for long term storage in Yucca Mountain. The method chosen produces zeolite granules mixed with glass frit, which must then {{be converted into}} a solid. This is accomplished by loading it into a can and heating to 900 C in a furnace regulated at 915 C. During heatup to 900 C, the zeolite and glass frit react and consolidate to produce a sodalite monolith. The resultant ceramic waste form (CWF) is then cooled. The waste is 52 cm in diameter and initially 300 cm long but consolidates to 150 cm long during the heating process. After cooling it is then inserted in a 5 -DHLW/DOE SNF Long Canister. Without intervention, the waste takes 82 hours to <b>heat</b> <b>up</b> to 900 C in a furnace designed to geometrically fit the cylindrical waste form. This paper investigates the reduction in heating times possible with four different methods of additional heating through a center hole. The hole size is kept small to maximize the amount of CWF that is processed in a single run. A hole radius of 1. 82 cm was selected which removes only 1 % of the CWF. A reference computation was done with a specified inner hole surface temperature of 915 C to provide a benchmark {{for the amount of}} improvement which can be made. It showed that the heatup time can potentially be reduced to 43 hours with center hole heating. The first method, simply pouring high temperature liquid aluminum into the hole, did not produce any noticeable effect on reducing <b>heat</b> <b>up</b> <b>times.</b> The second method, flowing liquid aluminum through the hole, works well as long as the velocity is high enough (2. 5 cm/sec) to prevent solidification of the aluminum during the initial front movement of the aluminum into the center hole. The velocity can be reduced to 1 cm/sec after the initial front has traversed the ceramic. This procedure reduces the formation time to near that of the reference case. The third method, flowing a gas through the center hole, also works well as long as the heat capacity times the velocity of the gas is equivalent to that of the flowing aluminum, and the velocity is high enough to produce an intermediate size heat transfer coefficient. The fourth method, using an electric heater, works well and heater sizes between 500 to 1000 Watts are adequate. These later three methods all can reduce the heatup time to 44 hours...|$|R
40|$|High-temperature, natural {{gas-fired}} furnaces, {{especially those}} fired with preheated air, produce {{large quantities of}} NO{sub x} per ton of material processed. Regulations on emissions from industrial furnaces are becoming increasingly more stringent. In addition, competition is forcing operators to make their furnaces more productive and/or efficient. Switching from preheated air to industrial oxygen can increase efficiency and reduce NO{sub x}, but oxygen is significantly more costly than air {{and may not be}} compatible with the material being heated. What was needed, and what was developed during this project, is a technology that reduces NO{sub x} emissions while increasing furnace efficiency for both air- and oxy-fired furnaces. Oscillating combustion is a retrofit technology that involves the forced oscillation of the fuel flow rate to a furnace. These oscillations create successive, fuel-rich and fuel-lean zones within the furnace. Heat transfer from the flame to the load increases due to the more luminous fuel-rich zones, a longer overall flame length, and the breakup of the thermal boundary layer. The increased heat transfer shortens <b>heat</b> <b>up</b> <b>times,</b> thereby increasing furnace productivity, and reduces the <b>heat</b> going <b>up</b> the stack, thereby increasing efficiency. The fuel-rich and fuel-lean zones also produce substantially less NO{sub x} than firing at a constant excess air level. The longer flames and higher heat transfer rate reduces overall peak flame temperature and thus reduces additional NO{sub x} formation from the eventual mixing of the zones and burnout of combustibles from the rich zones. This project involved the development of hardware to implement oscillating combustion on an industrial scale, the laboratory testing of oscillating combustion on various types of industrial burners, and the field testing of oscillating combustion on several types of industrial furnace. Before laboratory testing began, a market study was conducted, based on the attributes of oscillating combustion and on the results of an earlier project at GTI and Air Liquide, to determine which applications for oscillating combustion would show the greatest probability for technical success and greatest probability for market acceptability. The market study indicated that furnaces in the steel, glass, and metal melting industries would perform well in both categories.

Here we present the first analysis of the global structure and evolution of non-ideal MRI-driven T-Tauri disks on million-year timescales. We accomplish this in a 1 + 1 D simulation by calculating magnetic diffusivities and utilizing turbulence activity criteria to determine thermal structure and accretion rate without resorting to a 3 -D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulation. Our major findings are as follows. First, even for modest surface densities {{of just a few}} times the minimum-mass solar nebula, the dead zone encompasses the giant planet-forming region, preserving any compositional gradients. Second, the surface density of the active layer is nearly constant in time at roughly 10 g cm− 2, which we use to derive a simple prescription for viscous heating in MRI-active disks for those who wish to avoid detailed MHD computations. Furthermore, unlike a standard disk with constant-α viscosity, the disk midplane does not cool off over time, though the surface cools as the star evolves along the Hayashi track. Instead, the MRI may pile material in the dead zone, causing it to <b>heat</b> <b>up</b> over <b>time.</b> The ice line is firmly in the terrestrial planet-forming region throughout disk evolution and can move either inward or outward with time, depending on whether pileups form nea...|$|R

We model the thermal evolution of Jupiter, including its evolving helium distribution following results of ab initio simulations for helium immiscibility in metallic hydrogen. After 4 Gyr of homogeneous evolution, differentiation establishes a thin helium gradient below 1 Mbar that dynamically stabilizes the fluid to convection. The region undergoes overstable double-diffusive convection (ODDC), whose weak heat transport maintains a superadiabatic temperature gradient. With a generic parameterization for the ODDC efficiency, the models can reconcile Jupiter's intrinsic flux, atmospheric helium content, and radius at the age of the solar system if the Lorenzen et al. H-He phase diagram is translated to lower temperatures. We cast the evolutionary models in an MCMC framework to explore tens of thousands of evolutionary sequences, retrieving probability distributions for the total heavy element mass, the superadiabaticity of the temperature gradient due to ODDC, and the phase diagram perturbation. The adopted SCvH-I equation of state favors inefficient ODDC such that a thermal boundary layer is formed, allowing the molecular envelope to cool rapidly while the deeper interior actually <b>heats</b> <b>up</b> over <b>time.</b> If the overall cooling time is modulated with an additional free parameter to imitate the effect of a colder or warmer EOS, the models favor those that are colder than SCvH-I.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} is to develop an understanding of the Direct Coal Liquefaction process at the molecular level. Many approaches have been used to study this process including kinetic studies, study of the liquefaction products, study of the effect of reaction variables, such as temperature, solvent type and composition, the changing nature and composition of the coal during liquefaction, and the distribution in the liquefaction products of the hydrogen consumed. While all these studies have contributed to our growing knowledge of the liquefaction process, an adequate understanding of direct liquefaction still eludes us. This is due to many reasons including: the complexity and variable nature of coal itself and the many different chemical reactions which are occurring simultaneously during direct coal liquefaction.
