40|$|Bibliography: leaves 324 - 333. The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to analyse the definitional rules of <b>fiscal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> {{as well as the}} tax consequences resulting from the application of these rules, as implemented in the national tax law of the chosen jurisdictions. In essence, there are two main rules, which give content to the chosen theory of <b>fiscal</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> mainly source and residence. It is trite that globalisation of the world's economies poses certain problems for international tax policy. Companies and individuals are becoming more mobile and therefore are able to exploit tax differences between states. In consideration of the natural concern of governments that they should get an acceptable share of the profits generated by international businesses, this research study analyses the bases through which a country could claim the right to tax. The plasticity of these two key concepts (source and residence) may well subvert a country's ultimate tax objective because of the potential for exploitation of ambiguity in the search for effective avoidance. The residence tax system and its implications have been analysed mainly from the South African perspective, and where necessary, the analysis has sought reference in other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and the United States. The source principle of taxation and its effects have also been studied from the South African context, with a comparative approach from Hong Kong. It has been found that the countries considered in this research have, in various ways, adopted different combinations of subjective factors for tax liability in their domestic tax laws. At the same time, the relentless search of additional tax revenue, has led countries to implement in their tax laws, stringent anti-avoidance measures designed to prevent the deferral of tax, for instance on foreign source income. Factors such as the increasing complexity of modem business and the greater sophistication of tax planning techniques have contributed to this state of affairs. Thus, this dissertation highlights that competition between governments, in the face of international economic integrity, may lead countries to adopt tax rules, which though they follow the usual international standards, are nevertheless very complex in application and administration. This can maintain the problem of international double taxation and lead to excessive or unpredictable compliance burdens. It is shown how countries in the exercise of their <b>fiscal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> can move towards harmonisation of rules and common interpretation of the tax base in the application of their national tax legislation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} matrix {{version of the}} Lowry model to generatespatially {{disaggregated}} employment and population impacts.

The relocation of a given number of basic jobs from Los Angeles to peripheral Orange County has a marked impact on jobs, population, and public expenditures in individual cities, depending on their relative proximity to the sources of basic-employment change. Although the relationship between the central city and the suburbs is highly competitive, the central city may gain from spatial-multiplier impacts if the suburbs (especially close-in suburbs) attract jobs from outside the region. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Do {{individual}} preferences towards alternative globalization strategies vary across different public-finance regimes? In {{the absence of}} tax and spending policies, freer immigration and trade for a country would often be supported by similar groups thanks to similar impacts on labor demand and thus labor income. Government policies that redistribute income may, however, alter the distributional politics. In particular, immigrants may pay taxes and receive public services. Imports, obviously, can do neither of these. This suggests quite different political coalitions may organize around trade and immigration. In this paper we develop a framework for examining how pre-tax and post-tax cleavages may differ across globalization strategies and also <b>fiscal</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> We then apply this framework {{to the case of}} individual immigration and trade preferences across U.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis {{has caused the}} need for a stronger positioning of the European Court of Justice in the new model of economic governance in the European Union. The Jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice contributes in creating the optimal legal control mechanism of budget spending in the European monetary law and ensure maintenance of euro-zone fiscal framework. The role of the European Court of Justice in the EMU in earlier periods was secondary, but in times of crisis, it points to the growing need of Jurisdiction's extending in the field of monetary relations between member states and respect of convergence rules.

40|$|The {{validity}} of permanent establishment (PE) as the decisive condition for source state jurisdiction for business profits {{depends on the}} practical and normative importance of an enterprise’s physical presence on foreign markets. E-commerce enterprises can operate in foreign markets without physical presence there. It is therefore necessary to assess alternatives to PE {{and to do so}} in accordance with appropriate normative and policy criteria. The historical context does not illuminate criteria because the PE rule is a product mainly of now obsolete economic and political conditions and the fiscal self-interest of capital exporting nations. Any normative principle of <b>fiscal</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> must explain power to tax and how to avoid overlapping powers to tax. Benefit theory does so best. Benefit theory supports source-based taxation of business profits generally and particularly provides that a country hosting a consumer market has jurisdiction for income of non-resident e-commerce enterprises that is attributable to the sales functions involved in e-commerce transactions. This requires a ‘virtual’ PE fiction in tax treaties. Neutrality and administrative considerations might militate against that in treaty relations between developed nations. However, inter-nation equity affects relations involving developing countries. ‘Inter-nation equity’ is an ethical concept of fairness requiring that allocation of taxing rights should benefit developing countries. Accordingly, as changes to the OECD Model have reduced source-based taxation of e-commerce compared to equivalent ‘traditional’ commerce and as most developing countries will remain ‘source’ countries vis-à-vis e-commerce, so the PE rule infringes inter-nation equity. Inter-nation equity overrides neutrality and administrative considerations. It is for developing nations to decide whether to tax e-commerce at source. Collection of revenue by the residence country followed by transfer of the revenue to source countries would best achieve that. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|By Hansjörg Blöchliger and Claire Charbit Fiscal {{equalisation}} is {{a transfer}} of <b>fiscal</b> resources across <b>jurisdictions</b> to offset disparities in revenue raising capacity or public service cost. It covers on average 2. 5 % of GDP or 5 % of total government expenditure across OECD countries. Equalisation reduces fiscal disparities by two-thirds on average and in some countries levels them virtually out. Strong equalisation comes at a price: on average, around 70 % of a jurisdiction’s additional tax income must be dedicated to an equalisation fund. The equalisation rate is generally higher for <b>jurisdictions</b> with low <b>fiscal</b> capacity, reducing their tax effort and likely to slow down regional economic convergence. Cost equalisation is larger than revenue equalisation in terms of GDP despite smaller cost disparities, pointing at inefficiencies in the distribution formulae. Fiscal equalisation can be pro-cyclical but most countries succeed in reducing fluctuations of entitlements, sometimes {{at the cost of}} sub-central budget needs. Fiscal equalisation is very country specific, and data and analysis must be taken with care. ...|$|R

We propose a simple model in which is possible describe different scenarios: Brain Gain (when BD may increase average productivity in the source economy); Brain Drain (when there is unidirectional flow of highly skilled workers that is welfare-deteriorating in the source economy); Migration Competition (when the regions have not high differences in the productivity and they compete attracting educated workers); <b>Fiscal</b> Competition (when <b>jurisdictions</b> compete either to attract a mobile tax base), This simple model help us to explain several policies implemented by European regions.

40|$|The first essay proposes {{potential}} benefits from monitoring as important determinants of institutional block holding, where the measures for monitoring benefits are identified {{from the information}} asymmetry problem. Using U. S. data, I find that firms’ agency problems attract large institutional holdings for monitoring purpose, and provide evidence that the large institutions are indeed doing monitoring. The study thus {{contributes to the literature}} on investor activism, which is usually limited to studying the effect of an existing large investor. In the second essay, we use the introduction of the US 1996 Telecommunications Act as our empirical setting to examine the dynamics of the role of peer performance in managerial compensation. We adopt a difference-in-differences design using size- and performance matched manufacturing firms as the benchmarks. The results indicate that, relative to the benchmark firms, telecommunications firms strengthened the tie between managerial compensation and peer performance after the Act. The results suggest that relative performance evaluation became more valuable for telecommunication firms after the Act. The third essay analyzes the response of state spending to windfall revenues using tobacco settlements in the U. S. in the late 1990 s as a natural experiment. The “flypaper effect” in the public finance literature refers to an empirical puzzle that an increase in lump-sum grants from the higher level government boosts spending of a lower level government more than an equivalent increase in private income. Most of the early work relies on policy variations in <b>fiscal</b> grants across <b>jurisdictions</b> over time, and is subject to price or policy endogeneity problem. This study overcomes these limitations by exploiting the tobacco settlements between the U. S. states and tobacco manufactures in the late 1990 s as a natural experiment. We find that state direct spending increases by about $ 1 on average in response to one dollar increase in the settlement funds and by about 8 cents to one dollar increase in private income, strong evidence for the “flypaper effect”. Results suggest that states with the higher adult smoking rate or those with heavy reliance on the tobacco manufacturing industry for economic growth have lower spending propensity from the windfall revenue...|$|R
