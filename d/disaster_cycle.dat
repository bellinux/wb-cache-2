40|$|In {{the wake}} of the global {{financial}} and Eurozone upheavals this timely book argues that the <b>disaster</b> <b>cycle</b> – a framework normally used in the context of natural disasters – is equally applicable to the analysis of other types of catastrophe. Employing {{a modified version of the}} <b>disaster</b> <b>cycle</b> framework to compare and analyse a range of catastrophes in different spheres, the author draws on ideas from a variety of disciplines including economics and economic history, disaster studies, management, and political science. This unique comparative approach presents case studies of several important disasters: Hurricane Katrina, the First World War, the depression of the early 1930 s, Welsh coal mining accidents, the deadly effects of smoking tobacco, and the Global Financial Crisis and Eurozone catastrophe of the early twenty first century. The author argues that economists and economic policy makers routinely misuse the term crisis to describe episodes that ought to be called disasters...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. During {{the early}} 1970 s {{increase}} in disaster events {{lead to the}} emergence of a "new concept" within the field of disaster management. This concept was called the <b>Disaster</b> Management <b>Cycle.</b> The cycle was designed to illustrate the ongoing process by which governments, businesses, and civil society plan for and reduce the impact of disasters, react during and immediately following a disaster, and take steps to recover after a disaster has occurred. The <b>Disaster</b> Management <b>Cycle</b> concept has not remained static over the past 40 years and some changes and variations have occurred in how the cycle is illustrated, and how it is applied in different organisations. Furthermore, it is also not clear how the concept of managing disasters and their impacts in a cyclical fashion originated. Consequently it was the purpose of the research study to determine how the cycle originated, what changes occurred in the cycle concept, and how <b>Disaster</b> Management <b>Cycles</b> were applied in different contexts. To answer the research questions posed for the study two tools were used. A review of literature was undertaken in order to provide a base from which further analysis could be conducted. In this regard, a wide spectrum of literature was reviewed which included training material, policies, international organisation documentation, peer reviewed articles, research reports and case studies. Semi-structured interviews with knowledgeable individuals in the field of disaster and risk management were also used to triangulate the finding of the literature review. The data gathered from the literature review process was than analysed by the application of general systems theory concepts such as ecquifinality, open systems, feedback arrangements an isomorphism. Through the application of these general systems theory concepts the interaction between the <b>Disaster</b> Management <b>Cycle</b> and the environment in which it was created or applied was explored, which in turn provided insight into the origins and differing applications of the cycle. The study found that although <b>Disaster</b> Management <b>Cycles</b> only appeared in illustrative format in the 1970 s, the origins of the <b>Disaster</b> Management <b>Cycle</b> {{can be traced back to}} early disaster phase research. In this regard studies into linear disaster phases conducted by Prince (1920), Carr (1932), Powell (1954), Chapman (1962) and Stoddard (1968), established phase ideas like emergency, relief, recovery and rehabilitation. All of which could be observed in subsequent <b>Disaster</b> Management <b>Cycles.</b> Consequently it is argued that the origins of the <b>Disaster</b> Management <b>Cycle</b> can be traced back as far back as the 1920 study conducted by Prince. It was found that much of the changes that occurred in the <b>Disaster</b> Management <b>Cycle</b> concept, over several decades, could be ascribed to the specific context in which the cycle was created as well as the open system nature of <b>Disaster</b> Management <b>Cycles.</b> In this regard it was established that the context in which a <b>Disaster</b> Management <b>Cycle</b> was created and applied greatly affected the composition of the specific cycle. Furthermore, it was found that the open system nature of <b>Disaster</b> Management <b>Cycles</b> allowed many context specific changes to occur and as consequence many different variations of the <b>Disaster</b> Management <b>Cycle</b> appeared.

40|$|AbstractThe {{implementation}} of the European Flood Directive 2007 / 60 /EC requires the establishment of public participation mechanisms to ensure citizens’ involvement in the flood management cycle. This raises questions on how {{to achieve this goal}} and successfully translate the directive into meaningful and effective participation. Innovative means, such as citizen observatories enabled by information and communication technologies, have the potential to provide citizens with a substantially new role in decision-making. In this paper, we present a framework developed for analysing the potential for participation via ICT-enabled citizen observatories and undertake a comparative analysis of the UK, the Netherlands and Italy. Expository and qualitative research was undertaken in the three case study areas, with the aim of identifying and comparing the transposition of the EU Flood directive and the mechanisms in place for citizens’ participation during different phases of the <b>disaster</b> <b>cycle</b> (prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery). Our analysis of the transposition of legal obligations for citizen participation shows that implementation is limited when examining both the respective roles and types of interactions between citizen and authorities and the impact of citizen participation on decision-making. Different authorities have differing perceptions of citizen participation in flood risk management in terms of their roles and influence. Our results also indicate that these perceptions are related to the importance that the authorities place on the different stages of the <b>disaster</b> <b>cycle.</b> This understanding is crucial for identifying the potential of citizen observatories to foster greater citizen engagement and participation...|$|E
30|$|Since {{definitions}} of resilience and vulnerability have been covered extensively elsewhere (Brand and Jax 2007; Lewis and Kelman 2010; Zhou et al. 2010; Bara and Brönnimann 2011; Garschagen 2013; Lorenz 2013), we cover {{the variability of}} definitions only briefly (Sect. 2). In this article, we use the term “resilience and vulnerability concepts” {{to refer to the}} whole range of resilience and vulnerability theories, frameworks, conceptual components, methods, and data that are used in DRM, as well as in disaster risk reduction (DRR) and CCA research and policy fields. Regarding the potential applications of resilience and vulnerability concepts, we mainly consider risk reduction measures, risk management plans and actions, and climate change adaptation measures in this article. We use “benefits” as a broad term encompassing ideas such as usefulness, improvement, or positive impacts. Under the term “challenges” we address limitations, problems, abuses, trade-offs, and other related terms. We understand disasters to be major instances of negative change, whether acute or gradual; disaster risk reflects the possibility of negative change; and disaster risk management describes the process of dealing with possible negative changes. We therefore use DRM as an umbrella term for the agenda used by multiple actors and defined in various ways. Companies, disaster and emergency authorities, media, NGOs, citizens, scientists, and many others have various capabilities and assets for handling disaster risks. We conceive DRM as embracing (1) all types of technological and “natural” hazards and risks, and (2) all phases of the temporal <b>disaster</b> <b>cycle</b> model (Alexander 2000, p. 3) both before and after disaster, as well as alternative conceptions of the <b>disaster</b> <b>cycle</b> (that is, spiral, evolutionary, and so on).|$|E

40|$|Disaster law {{promises}} {{to become an}} increasingly important subject {{over the course of}} this century. Climate change will increase the frequency of extreme weather events, while more people and property will be at risk due to population growth, coastal development and economic growth. Depending on the extent of climate change, the risks vary from serious to catastrophic. In dealing with these increased levels of risk, the entire <b>disaster</b> <b>cycle</b> must be considered, from pre-disaster risk mitigation to emergency response, followed by insurance and compensation, and rebuilding (and then by another potential disaster). This article provides a framework for considering these issues and sets forth five grand challenges for scholars and policymakers.

40|$|Disaster {{response}} {{activities are}} generally well funded but {{do little to}} break communities out of disaster cycles.

40|$|Purpose of this paper: With {{increased}} {{natural and}} man-made disasters disrupting {{the supply chain}} and logistics network, it has become vital for disaster relief operations to proactively identify and mitigate the risks. Mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery are four stages during any disaster management. Each stage faces different challenges in terms of information gathering, interpretation and dissemination for the quick relief operations. In the modern internet era, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) {{is proving to be}} critical throughout the disaster management cycle. Systems thinking concepts are applied in this research for capturing various activities involved during disaster management cycle. ICT based applications are identified for each stage to propose a conceptual model for disaster risk management. The research attempts to provide a holistic, systematic and technology driven risk mitigation approach for robust disaster management. Design/methodology/approach: The extent of relief operations is very much dependent on the information availability and sharing. Challenges within disaster management do not only depend upon the nature of disaster but also on the activities involved in different stages of the relief operation. In order to develop new strategies for disaster management, understanding of different activities and up-to-date information regarding modern tools and techniques is vital. In this research natural and man-made disaster data for past decade is holistically studied to understand different set of activities involved during each stage of the <b>disaster</b> <b>cycle.</b> These activities are further classified based on sources of disaster and speed of occurrence. Appropriate ICT techniques are identified for each stage following recent disaster cases. Following systems thinking approach, a conceptual ICT based disaster management model is proposed for robust relief operations. The research intends to test the viability of model during future disaster events. Findings: The systems concepts for modelling <b>disaster</b> <b>cycle</b> activities and mitigation strategies provide answers to the complex behaviour of risks. By combining holistic and structured approaches for conceptual modelling, the research provides a unique platform for Information based disaster risk management. ICT approach provides real time networking for participation, coordination, planning and monitoring during disaster management. Value: The outcomes of this research will help academicians and practitioners in closing the gap of understanding the complex behaviour of entities interacting during disaster management. Research limitations/implications: The model will be further developed and tested during future disasters. Practical implications: The ICT based approach to disaster management is expected to help supply chain and logistics practitioners in providing robust relief operations...|$|E
