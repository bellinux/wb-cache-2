5|$|Schnaufer {{was taken}} {{prisoner}} of war by the British Army in Schleswig-Holstein in May 1945. According to Schumann, {{he was taken to}} England for interrogation. In this account British authorities were <b>especially</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> knowing whether his achievements had been made under the influence of methamphetamine or other stimulating psychoactive drugs which induce temporary improvements in either mental or physical functions or both. He was released later that year in November following a bout of diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|Some of Escher's many {{tessellation}} drawings {{were inspired}} by conversations with the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter on hyperbolic geometry. Escher was <b>especially</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The Platonic solids—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in Order and Chaos and Four Regular Solids. These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.|$|E
5|$|Blaine and Harrison {{wished to}} see American power and trade {{expanded}} across the Pacific and were <b>especially</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> securing rights to harbors in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Pago Pago, Samoa. When Blaine entered office, the United States, Great Britain, and the German Empire were disputing their respective rights in Samoa. Thomas F. Bayard, Blaine’s predecessor, had accepted {{an invitation to}} a three-party conference in Berlin aimed at resolving the dispute, and Blaine appointed American representatives to attend. The result was a treaty that created a condominium among the three powers, allowing all of them access to the harbor.|$|E

5|$|Numerous colleges showed {{interest}} and recruited Heyward, including UCLA, which offered a full-ride scholarship {{due in part}} to the family connection. Heyward was also <b>especially</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Clemson and Georgia Tech. Concurrently, the hometown Atlanta Braves had followed and scouted him for years, while attempting to conceal their excitement. They made him the 14th overall selection in the 2007 Major League Baseball draft. Despite signing a National Letter of Intent with UCLA, Heyward chose professional baseball over college and signed a contract with them worth $1.7 million – $170,000 more than MLB's slot recommendation of $1.53 million on the following August 12. It was the same as the 2006 14th-slot amount that the Toronto Blue Jays gave Travis Snider.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Bamford Cott, (6 July 1900 – 18 April 1987), was a British zoologist, an {{authority}} on both natural and military camouflage, and a scientific illustrator and photographer. Many of his field studies took place in Africa, where he was <b>especially</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the Nile crocodile, the evolution of pattern and colour in animals. During the Second World War, Cott worked as a camouflage expert for the British Army and helped to influence War Office policy on camouflage. His book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940), popular among serving soldiers, was the major textbook on camouflage in zoology of the twentieth century. After the war, he became a Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge. As a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, he undertook expeditions to Africa and the Amazon to collect specimens, mainly reptiles and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1873, a United States {{military}} commission recommended attempting to obtain Ford Island {{in exchange for}} the tax-free importation of sugar to the U.S. At that time Major General John Schofield, U.S. commander of the military division of the Pacific, and Brevet Brigadier General Burton S. Alexander arrived in Hawaii to ascertain its defensive capabilities. U.S. control of Hawaii was considered vital for the defense of the west coast of the United States, and they were <b>especially</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Pu'uloa, Pearl Harbor. The sale of one of Hawaii's harbors was proposed by Charles Reed Bishop, a foreigner who had married into the Kamehameha family, had risen in the government to be Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and owned a country home near Pu'uloa. He showed the two U.S. officers around the lochs, although his wife, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, privately disapproved of selling Hawaiian lands. As monarch, William Charles Lunalilo, was content to let Bishop run almost all business affairs but the ceding of lands would become unpopular with the native Hawaiians. Many islanders thought that all the islands, rather than just Pearl Harbor, might be lost and opposed any cession of land. By November 1873, Lunalilo canceled negotiations and returned to drinking, against his doctor's advice; his health declined swiftly, and he died on February 3, 1874.|$|E

25|$|Human iron {{metabolism}} is the set {{of chemical}} reactions that maintain human homeostasis of iron at both the systemic and cellular level. The control of this necessary but potentially toxic metal {{is an important part}} of many aspects of human health and disease. Hematologists have been <b>especially</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> systemic iron metabolism because iron is essential for red blood cells, where most of the human body's iron is contained. Understanding iron metabolism is also important for understanding diseases of iron overload, such as hereditary hemochromatosis, and iron deficiency, such as iron deficiency anemia.|$|E
25|$|Later on, Egypt and Mitanni became allies, and King Shuttarna II {{himself was}} {{received}} at the Egyptian court. Amicable letters, sumptuous gifts, and letters asking for sumptuous gifts were exchanged. Mitanni was <b>especially</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Egyptian gold. This {{culminated in a}} number of royal marriages: the daughter of King Artatama I was married to Thutmose IV. Kilu-Hepa, or Gilukhipa, the daughter of Shuttarna II, was married to Pharaoh Amenhotep III, who ruled in the early 14th century BC. In a later royal marriage Tadu-Hepa, or Tadukhipa, the daughter of Tushratta, was sent to Egypt.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the concept of}} <b>interest</b> and <b>especially</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> science. An empirical study, which is based on theoretical considerations {{of the concept of}} interest and its relation to motivation and engagement, is described. The empirical study consists of life history interviews with six individuals, who all are engaged in nature and/or science as part of their job or hobby. The results from these interviews point to the need of a broader understanding of interest than is generally accepted in the traditional psychological sense. It is suggested that in terms of expressed interest, the notion of interest should be viewed partly as interest based on attitude and partly as interest based on action. The results also point to the need of clarifying the meaning of <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> science as it covers both interest in nature and being <b>in</b> nature, <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> science as a school subject, and <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> science itsel...|$|R

25|$|Đaja {{began to}} {{research}} hypothermia in 1935 and from 1940 {{it became the}} focal point of his scientific work. He was <b>especially</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the ways it can be achieved. With his treatise State similar to the winter sleep of the hibernators achieved in rat by the means of barometric depression, published on 15 January 1940, he began researching the physiology of the deeply cooled homeothermous organisms. He was interested in thermogenesis, gas circulation in organisms, adaptation to cold, defense role of hypothermia and metabolism in deep hypothermia. His results from this period have found a wide application in medical physiology.|$|E
25|$|By most accounts, Löhe was {{an ideal}} pastor who interacted {{well with a}} variety of {{different}} classes of people. He focused his theological studies on the Lutheran Confessions and put considerable thought into the celebration of Holy Communion as the center of congregational life. Löhe was <b>especially</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> old Lutheran liturgies. Löhe was also noted for his ontological view of the pastoral office, which he believed existed independently of congregational call but as a direct appointment from Jesus Christ through ordination in opposition to C.F.W. Walther. He combined all these ideas with a heavy insistence on social renewal.|$|E
