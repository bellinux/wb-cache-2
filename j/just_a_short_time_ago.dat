Executive summary Australia’s health system faces many challenges related to chronic and complex health conditions. Major advances in biomedicine mean that {{children and young people}} are now surviving conditions that would have meant early death <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago.</b> This has major implications for Australia’s education systems.   A troubling side effect of this success in medicine is the number of children and young people who manage their chronic health conditions, but who can easily remain overlooked in education. In many ways this is a new frontier for teachers, schools and education systems. Never before have so many students been present in our classrooms, who have survived major health challenges, but who are not yet systematically supported to thrive in education.   This report provides a detailed summary of education, health and demographic information about Australian children and young people who live with significant health conditions. This study closely examined an important national database of 2360 such individuals.   This study is contextualised within recent international literature from the fields of education, medicine, oncology, public health, paediatric nursing, psychology, counselling, psychiatry and social policy. Socio-economic indexes developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics were employed in the analysis of data.   As Australian government figures are not available about these young people as an educational cohort, the major {{purpose of this study was}} to provide an empirical base for policy recommendation and further investigation. An important secondary aim of the study was to contribute to the growing body of evidence about pressing educational issues related to these children and young people.

40|$|An {{escalating}} international imbalance, necessarily {{including both}} real and financial aspects, {{has become the}} outstanding failing of U. S. macroeconomic performance in the 1980 s. The half-again real appreciation of the dollar exchange rate {{since the beginning of}} the decade has severely impaired the ability of U. S. producers to compete for export sales abroad, or even to protect their traditional domestic markets against foreign imports. The resulting devastation of the economy’s internationally exposed sectors, especially agriculture and manufacturing, has in turn led to lost profits, lost jobs, and a continuing rash of actual and/or threatened bankruptcies. At the same time, the financing of a record trade gap by exporting assets instead of goods and services has sharply altered traditional U. S. financial relationships. The United States has now dissipated its net international investment position and, on the current trajectory, will soon become the world’s leading debtor nation. Correspondingly, foreign investors and foreign financial institutions now play a far larger role in the U. S. financial markets than they did <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago.</b> These problematic developments, at least in rough outline, have been the predictable (and much predicted) consequences of the macroeconomic policy course followed by the United States since 1981. The extraordinary combination of personal tax cuts, accelerated build-up of military spending, and resistance to reductions in major nonmilitary government spending programs such as Social Security and Medicare has led to federal budget deficits far beyond the nation’s prior peacetime experience. Meanwhile, the basic priority of monetary policy has been first to lower, and then to contain, the economy’s rate of price inflation. This fundamental fiscal—monetary imbalance has led to unprecedentedly high real interest rates, and has thereb...|$|E

I'm {{going to talk}} about the social circumstances in which hate arises, and particularly about the issues we're facing in our country and in the world right now, on a morning when dozens more people have been killed in Iraq, and when American warplanes are routinely bombing civilian neighborhoods in a manner that would have seemed utterly impossible—shocking and barbaric—to many of us, I think, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago.</b> The newspapers are dreadful in what they don't tell us every day. The New York Times reported yesterday, "American armored vehicles roared through the villages surrounding Falluja, the western town at the heart of the Sunni insurgency in Iraq, on Friday, as warplanes pounded rebel positions and ground forces ratcheted up their preparations for what appeared to be an imminent assault on the city. " 1 This is sheer propaganda, because already in the first line is the idea that our warplanes are pounding "rebel positions," not bombing civilian neighborhoods. We learned last week from The Lancet magazine, which published the most serious epidemiological study that has been undertaken regarding the casualties in Iraq since the war began, that there are by best estimates—though admittedly this is with high uncertainty— 100, 000 deaths in excess of what would have been expected based on prewar circumstances, and that the vast majority of those deaths have come through violent attacks by U. S. forces, principally bombing by our aircraft. 2 and so we enact Guernica every day, and our newspapers report it as "warplanes pounding rebel positions. " The Associated Press this morning said the same thing, that Marines fired a barrage of artillery at "rebel positions" inside Falluja; U.

40|$|In Florida v. HHS, {{a lawsuit}} brought {{on behalf of}} 26 states {{challenging}} {{the constitutionality of the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), the Supreme Court will determine the future direction of health care reform in the United States. During the unprecedented 5 - 1 / 2 hours of oral arguments, the Court will hear 4 issues: the individual purchase mandate, severability, the Medicaid expansion and the Anti-Injunction Act. The states challenging the ACA maintain that the purchase mandate uniquely penalizes individuals for failing to purchase insurance. Uninsured individuals, however, rarely do nothing. Instead, they self-insure, rely on family, and cost-shift to hospitals, the insured, and tax payers. Because most uninsured people will eventually require uncompensated care, they impose costs on everyone through higher taxes and insurance premiums. Further, although the ACA’s mandate is unusual, it is not unprecedented. Mandatory worker contributions to Medicare, for example, are a compelled purchase of health insurance. The necessary and proper clause, which permits Congress to pass laws rationally related to the exercise of federal powers, may be the best argument in favor of the mandate because the mandate is necessary for the other insurance market reforms to work. If the Court were to strike down the mandate, it would then have to determine whether the mandate is severable {{from the rest of the}} ACA. Although the ACA did not explicitly state that if part of the act were deemed unconstitutional the rest would survive, most ACA reforms are severable because they are unrelated to the mandate, such as funding for public health and community health centers. The more difficult question is whether the mandate is so intertwined with the ACA’s still unimplemented market reforms that the Court must strike them down. The Court will also review the constitutionality of expanding Medicaid to all individuals with household incomes below 138 % of the federal poverty level. The states argue that Medicaid expansion is unduly coercive because they could lose all Medicaid funding and not just the funding related to the expansion. The Court, however, is unlikely to uphold the coercion theory because state participation in Medicaid has always been optional and some states have openly discussed exercising their option to discontinue the program. Finally, the Court will hear technical arguments concerning the Anti-Injunction Act (AIA), which prohibits lawsuits “for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax. ” The Court is unlikely to invoke the AIA because neither the administration nor the states contend that it applies. The ACA will achieve near universal coverage, something that seemed unimaginable <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago.</b> Health reform envisages a social contract in which everyone shares the cost, recognizing that virtually everyone will become ill one day. The ACA and its individual mandate are not unjustified limits on freedom, but rather are vital to a decent society...|$|E
