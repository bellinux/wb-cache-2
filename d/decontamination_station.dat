40|$|The {{following}} bachelor thesis desribes general {{classification of}} fire brigade units and their {{location in the}} South Bohemia region. The units not only protect lives and possesions of the citizens but are also helpful in protection of the environment. Likewise, their assistance is significant in a possible accident resulting in the spread of radioactive materials. One of the potential risks to the Czech Republic population is ionizing radiation. In {{order to deal with}} such an accident effectively, the units must be fully equipped and trained. The work outlines procedures to be followed in the aforementioned situation as well as lists equipment used by the units in the region. The investigative part of the work reports on the ways of handling various apparatus, and desribes protective equipment and <b>decontamination</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an effective, {{reusable}} {{solution for}} modeling and simulation. The {{approach is to}} develop a Software Product Line (SPL) architecture that explicitly captures the commonality and variability in a family of similar simulation systems. First responders and incident management personnel need better training resources to prepare for possible catastrophic events, including natural disasters and terrorist attacks. Live exercises are often very expensive to organize and conduct. With modeling and simulation technology, simulation-based exercise and training models could be developed. The SPL technology enables the simulation system to easily adapt to multiple contexts and allows the simulation system to reconfigure quickly. SPL models can be developed at different levels of scope and depth to suit the emergency responder’s needs. By reusing the system requirement analysis, software architectures, and design, the development time is shorter, the development cost is lower, and the quality is easily maintained. This paper focuses on the application of SPL technology to simulation systems of emergency facilities, such as hospital emergency rooms, on-site emergency triage <b>stations,</b> <b>decontamination</b> <b>stations,</b> first-aid stations, and ambulances. The paper also introduces a prototype simulation of the SPL member system – a hospital emergency room simulation system that has been developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The detailed modeling of a family of emergency response facility simulation systems is performed based on the Product Line Unified Modeling Language (UML) -based Software engineering (PLUS) method...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{energy consumption}} constantly requires new energy sources. One {{of the energy}} sources are nuclear power plants. We can suppose {{that the number of}} nuclear power plants will increase {{as a consequence of the}} exhaustion of fossil fuels. Therefore it is crucial to enhance the nuclear power plants security which corresponds with the risks related to the nuclear power plant operation. It is compulsory for each nuclear power plant to have an external and internal emergency plans ready. In the nuclear power plant surroundings satefy measure including decontamination are planned. A suitable layout of the <b>decontamination</b> <b>station</b> is crucial for the quality decontamination. It is also necessary to check up the functionality of such stations. I took part in one of such rescue unit drills (ZONA 2007) on 25 October as an observer. The participation in it made me more familiar with nuclear power plant safety issues and therefore it was very useful for my thesis. The current situation is very complicated because special units that have been in charge of the decontamination zones (MSO) until recently are being dismissed or transformed. In spite of this fact the objective of my thesis was to design the layout of the decontamination zone which will meet such an area requirements. I set this hypothesis: I am convinced that the current preparedness and parameters of the decontamination zone as a component of the rescue system are more advanced than they used to be before. " This hypothesis was confirmed as far as the technological and material progress is concerned. I was also dealing with difficult questions such as ethics at the procedure of decontamination in men and women, conditions in winter etc. I think the hypothesis of my thesis has been confirmed and I have managed to make the reader acquainted with the questions I dealt with. I also wanted to express my attitude to the disestablishment of the rescue unit in Jindřichův Hradec which had provided the decontamination service so far. In my thesis I analyse the decontamination measures in the surroundings of the nuclear power station in detail. The thesis may be used as a tutorial text and it is possible to elaborate on it after 1. October 2008 trying to answer the question: Who is going to replace the 153 th Jindřichův Hradec rescue unit?`...|$|E
40|$|This Corrective Action Plan {{has been}} {{prepared}} for Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 366, Area 11 Plutonium Valley Dispersion Sites, {{in accordance with the}} Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO, 1996 as amended). CAU 366 consists of the following six Corrective Action Sites (CASs) located in Area 11 of the Nevada National Security Site: · CAS 11 - 08 - 01, Contaminated Waste Dump # 1 · CAS 11 - 08 - 02, Contaminated Waste Dump # 2 · CAS 11 - 23 - 01, Radioactively Contaminated Area A · CAS 11 - 23 - 02, Radioactively Contaminated Area B · CAS 11 - 23 - 03, Radioactively Contaminated Area C · CAS 11 - 23 - 04, Radioactively Contaminated Area D Site characterization activities were performed in 2011 and 2012, and the results are presented in Appendix A of the Corrective Action Decision Document (CADD) for CAU 366 (U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office [NNSA/NSO], 2012 a). The following closure alternatives were recommended in the CADD: · No further action for CAS 11 - 23 - 01 · Closure in place for CASs 11 - 08 - 01, 11 - 08 - 02, 11 - 23 - 02, 11 - 23 - 03, and 11 - 23 - 04 The scope of work required to implement the recommended closure alternatives includes the following: · Non-engineered soil covers approximately 3 feet thick will be constructed at CAS 11 - 08 - 01 over contaminated waste dump (CWD) # 1 and at CAS 11 - 08 - 02 over CWD # 2. · FFACO use restrictions (URs) will be implemented for the areas where the total effective dose (TED) exceeds the final action level (FAL) of 25 millirems per Occasional Use Area year (mrem/OU-yr). The FAL is based on an assumption that the future use of the site includes occasional work activities and that workers will not be assigned to the area on a regular basis. A site worker under this scenario is assumed to be on site for a maximum of 80 hours per year for 5 years. The FFACO UR boundaries will encompass the areas where a worker would be exposed to 25 millirems of radioactivity per year if they are present for 80 hours per year. These boundaries will be defined as follows: – It is assumed that radiological contaminants are present at CAS 11 - 08 - 01 and CAS 11 - 08 - 02 within CWDs # 1 and # 2 at levels exceeding the FAL. Therefore, UR boundaries will be established around the perimeters of the soil covers that will be constructed at CWD # 1 and CWD # 2. A geophysical survey revealed buried metallic debris outside the fence and adjacent to CWD # 1. Therefore, the UR boundary for CWD # 1 will be expanded to include the mound containing buried material. – It is assumed that radiological contaminants are present at CAS 11 - 23 - 02, CAS 11 - 23 - 03, and CAS 11 - 23 - 04, within the three High Contamination Area (HCA) boundaries associated with the 11 b, 11 c, and 11 d test areas at levels exceeding the FAL. Therefore, the UR boundaries will be established around the perimeters of the HCAs. The TED at an area of soil impacted by radiological debris outside the fence and adjacent to the 11 c test area HCA exceeds the FAL of 25 mrem/OU-yr. Because the radiological impact from the debris at this location is visible on the aerial flyover radiological survey, all other areas within this isopleth of the flyover survey are conservatively also assumed to exceed the FAL. Therefore, the UR boundaries for the 11 b, 11 c, and 11 d test areas will be expanded to include the areas within this isopleth. · The FFACO URs will all be located within the large Contamination Area (CA) that encompasses Plutonium Valley. Because access to the CA is limited and entry into the CA for post-closure inspections and maintenance would be impractical, UR warning signs will be posted along the existing CA fence. In accordance with the Soils Risk-Based Corrective Action Evaluation Process (NNSA/NSO, 2012 b), an administrative UR will be implemented as a best management practice for the areas where the TED exceeds 25 millirems per Industrial Area year. This limit is based on continuous industrial use of the site and addresses exposure to industrial workers who would regularly be assigned to the work area for an entire career (250 days per year, 8 hours per day, for 25 years). Establishing an administrative UR will prevent inadvertent exposure of workers to radioactivity if a more intensive use of the site were to be considered in the future. As a precautionary measure, the administrative UR boundary will be expanded to include the areas where removable contamination is present that exceeds the criterion for a CA. This will further ensure that workers will not perform future activities within this area without being notified of the presence of site contaminants. Therefore, the administrative UR boundary will be established around the perimeters of the large CA that encompasses the site and the CAs associated with the <b>decontamination</b> <b>station</b> and hot park...|$|E
