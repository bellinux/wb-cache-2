50|$|James D. <b>Feeter</b> (June 28, 1840 - March 20, 1903) was an American {{banker and}} {{politician}} from New York.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} on June 28, 1840, in Little Falls, Herkimer County, New York, the son of Assemblyman James <b>Feeter</b> (1806-1892) and Cynthia (Small) <b>Feeter</b> (died 1878). He {{attended}} the common schools and then engaged in the grocery business with his father. In 1880, he began {{to work for the}} Little Falls National Bank, first as Assistant Cashier, then as Cashier, and finally became President of the bank. In 1881, he married Ella Craig.|$|E
50|$|<b>Feeter</b> was {{a member}} of the New York State Senate (33rd D.) from 1899 to 1902, sitting in the 122nd, 123rd, 124th and 125th New York State Legislatures.|$|E

With the increased sensor resolution of recent and future satellites new possibilities emerge for high resolution risk modeling and risk mapping. Methods: A SPOT 5 satellite image, taken during the rainy season 2009 was used for calculating indices by combining the image's spectral bands. Besides the widely used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) other indices were tested for significant correlation against field observations. Multiple steps, including the detection of surface water, its breeding appropriateness for Anopheles and modeling of vector imagines abundance, were performed. Data collection on larvae, adult vectors and geographic parameters in the field, was amended by using remote sensing techniques to gather data on altitude (Digital Elevation Model = DEM), precipitation (Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission = TRMM), land surface temperatures (LST). Results: The DEM derived altitude as well as indices calculations combining the satellite's spectral bands (NDTI = Normalized Difference Turbidity Index, NDWI Mac <b>Feeters</b> = Normalized Difference Water Index) turned out to be reliable indicators for surface water in the local geographic setting. While Anopheles larvae abundance in habitats is driven by multiple, interconnected factors - amongst which the NDVI - and precipitation events, the presence of vector imagines was found to be correlated negatively to remotely sensed LST and positively to the cumulated amount of rainfall in the preceding 15 days and to the Normalized Difference Pond Index (NDPI) within the 500 m buffer zone around capture points. Conclusions: Remotely sensed geographical and meteorological factors, including precipitations, temperature, as well as vegetation, humidity and land cover indicators could be used as explanatory variables for surface water presence, larval development and imagines densities. This modeling approach based on remotely sensed information is potentially useful for counter measures that are putting on at the environmental side, namely vector larvae control via larviciding and water body reforming...|$|R
