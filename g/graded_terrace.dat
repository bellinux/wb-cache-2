40|$|The {{terracing}} {{of agricultural}} land {{is the most}} widespread mechanical practice used among farmers in the control of water erosion. The objective {{of this paper was}} to carry out a comparative analysis between mixed terraces and level and graded terraces. The dimensioning of level terraces was carried out based on the surface runoff volume, while the <b>graded</b> <b>terrace</b> dimensions were based on the maximum runoff flow rate. For the mixed terraces, the dimensioning was carried by considering two surface runoff hydrographs, one for the determination of the terrace channel capacity and another to estimate the flow rate at the extremity of the terrace channel. Therefore, in order to contain and transport the excess volume, an additional value was calculated and added to the depth of the channel. A case study was performed for the Uberaba, Minas Gerais State (Brazil) rainfall conditions, considering events with return periods of 10, 30, and 50 years. The obtained results provided quantitative evidence that mixed terraces have a lower height than level terraces and a higher level than the graded terraces, resulting in direct consequences for the soil movement for the terrace construction. ...|$|E
40|$|Installation of a zero-discharge, runoff-control {{system is}} one method for solving {{potential}} water pollution problems from many feedlot operations. Even though the zero-discharge system {{is required by}} regulation in several states, this approach may be economically prohibitive for many small operations. An alternative is to install a vegetative filter system to adequately control the runoff so that violations of water quality standards will not occur during storm runoff. Vegetative filters are systems in which a vegetative area such as pasture, grassed waterways, or even cropland is used for treating feedlot runoff by settling, filtration, dilution, adsorption of pollutants and infiltration. Generally, vegetative filters have either channelized or overland flow. Channelized-flow systems have various configurations such as a <b>graded</b> <b>terrace</b> channel or grassed waterways, but are simply systems in which flow is concentrated in a relatively narrow channel. In overland flow systems flow occurs as sheet flow less than 30 mm (1. 2 in.) deep, with widths ranging from 5 to 6 m (16 or 20 ft) up to possibly 30 m (98 ft). LITERATURE REVIEW Much early use of vegetative filter treatment was for the disposal of canning-industry wastes. Mather (1969) reported removal of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) from cannery wastes of 94 to 99 percent during overland flow in a disposal area, although Bendixen et al. (1969) reported only 66 percent BOD removal. Nitrogen removals of 61 to 94 percent and phosphorus removals of 39 to 81 percent were also reported in these two studies. Sievers et al. (1975) used a grassed waterway filter to treat anaerobic swine lagoon effluent. Willrich and Boda (1976) also treated swine lagoon effluent with sloping grass strips. Open feedlot runoff-treatment systems have been reported by Sutton et al. (1976) and Swanson et al. (1975). While the degree of treatment varied, these studies indicated that vegetative tilters were effective and potentially acceptable treatment alternatives. No uniform criteria evolved from these studies, however, and variable performance has made environmental authorities hesitate to give blanket approval to this concept. Lybecker (1977) showed that vegetative filters are generally more economical than zero-discharge systems, making them an attractive alternative to small feedlots with minimum capital...|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} SiGe virtual substrates, by solid-source {{molecular}} beam epitaxy (SS-MBE), using a new germanium grading technique has been studied. It is proposed that the grading of germanium using a series of linearly graded/uniform layers (<b>terrace</b> <b>grading)</b> prevents the dislocation pile-ups, associated with strain relief, from penetrating the entire epilayer. Since the dislocation pile-ups cause threading dislocations to become trapped and increase the roughness of the surface, the control of these pile-ups reduces both the threading dislocation density and the RMS surface roughness. Si 0. 50 Ge 0. 50 virtual substrates of 2 µm thickness using the <b>terrace</b> <b>grading</b> technique have been studied and compared to conventional linear graded and step graded virtual substrates of the same thickness. Substantial reductions in both the RMS roughness and threading dislocation densities {{are found in the}} <b>terrace</b> <b>graded</b> structure, compared with the conventional techniques. Electrical properties have been measured in layers grown on virtual substrates using the <b>terrace</b> <b>grading</b> and show promisingly high hole mobilities. The mechanism by which the <b>terrace</b> <b>graded</b> virtual substrates relax has been examined in order to optimise the growth conditions. It is found that the lowest layers of the virtual substrates do not relax until sufficient strain energy is accumulated by the growth of the following layers, leading to dislocation pile-ups that extend through several layers. The use of in-situ anneals has been shown to greatly improve the relaxation of the lower layers, with a corresponding decrease {{in the size of the}} pile-ups, and consequently lower threading dislocation densities have been found...|$|R

40|$|Growth of <b>terrace</b> <b>graded</b> virtual substrates, {{pioneered by}} Capewell (2002), has been {{conducted}} utilising solid-source molecular beam epitaxy (SS-MBE) to produce structures of higher germanium composition (up to pure germanium) and greater thickness (up to 20 ?m) than previously investigated. <b>Terrace</b> <b>grading</b> offers a number of advantages over more conventional grading techniques which include the reduction of surface threading dislocation density, reduction of surface roughness {{and the possibility of}} the complete elimination of threading dislocation pile-up. The closely spaced pile-up of threading dislocations is believed to {{have a significant impact on}} the electrical properties of processed devices, and its elimination is a key goal in this work. Numerous <b>terrace</b> <b>graded</b> virtual substrate compositions have been grown and characterised during the course of this work and, where appropriate, comparison made with more conventional structures. The complete elimination of threading dislocation pile-up has been demonstrated at compositions of 30 % and 40 %, with a reduced threading dislocation density in comparison to equivalent liner graded structures. A major reduction in threading dislocation density has been accomplished though post growth ex-situ annealing at 900 ?c for an extend period of time, though the exact mechanism remains uncertain. The possible role of surface precipitates enabling reduction of dislocation pile-up and/or density is considered along with the effects of unwanted particulate contamination during growth.

40|$|Silicon {{germanium}} alloy layers can {{be grown}} epitaxially on a silicon substrate to provide a means of adjusting the lattice parameter of the crystal. Such a platform, known as a virtual substrate, {{has a number of}} potential applications. For instance, it allows for subsequent overgrowth of highly strained layers of silicon, or germanium, that could enable very high speed transistors, similarly it could be used as the starting point of a range a silicon-based optoelectronic devices. In this work, a novel adaptation has been made to a recently proposed reverse grading technique to create high Ge composition SiGe virtual substrates. The proposed structures consist of a relaxed, highly defected, pure Ge underlayer on a Si (001) substrate prior to reverse grading where structures have final compositions of Si 0. 2 Ge 0. 8. Additionally, two grading schemes are studied, reverse linear <b>grading</b> and reverse <b>terrace</b> <b>grading.</b> All buffers are grown by reduced pressure chemical vapour deposition. The relaxation, defect levels and surface roughness of the fabricated buffers have been quantified whilst varying the grading rate. An ideal grading rate has been found where the quality of the buffer is very high, due to the highly defected Ge underlayer and that the buffer relaxes under tensile strain. Outside of this ideal grading rate three dimensional growth, stacking fault formation and crack generation can occur. Cracking of the buffer has been modelled and some conditions where the buffer is stable have been found. This study experimentally investigates this proposed solution and a crack-stable high quality buffer is fabricated. Comparisons have been drawn with other more popular buffer fabrication techniques and it is found that this technique has very competitive qualities.

Until recently, little direct evidence has been available to demonstrate correlations between Milankovitch cycles and large-scale terrestrial landforms produced during worldwide glaciations. In central Alaska large areas of loess and sand fill valleys and basins near major outwash streams. The streams themselves are bordered by sets of outwash terraces, and the <b>terraces</b> <b>grade</b> up valley into sets of moraines. The discovery of the Stampede tephra (approximately 175, 000 yr ago) reworked within push moraines of the Lignite Creek glaciation suggests that this event correlates with the glaciation of marine isotope stage 6.

40|$|The Frome Embayment, in {{the south}} of the Eromanga Basin, is the southernmost lobe of an intracontinental basin that formed as a result of epeirogenic motion during the Late Jurassic through to the Early Cretaceous. In the {{contemporary}} landscape, for the most part, the Mesozoic landscape has been buried by the Lake Eyre Basin. However, in the hinterland regions of the embayment, and sporadically within the embayment, remnants of the Mesozoic landscape are exposed, at least in part in their original context. Many marine shore lines, sedimentary surfaces and <b>graded</b> erosional <b>terraces</b> have remained exposed around the margins of the basin since the Mesozoic. These exposures have undergone weathering and erosion, and slight modification from contemporary regolith, such as colluvium and alluvium. Other exposures have been uplifted and exhumed such that they are now prominent features of the landscape. Localised sedimentological and structural studies indicate that the hinterland landscape at the time of basin formation consisted of erosional hills and rises surrounded by relatively flat low lying plains. In the west of the basin, shorelines, sediment profiles and structural relationships indicate uplift in access of 300 m in the basin bounding ranges during the duration of sediment deposition. Throughout basin formation, this landscape, previously thought to be a 'peneplain', was deformed by syndepositional tectonics, which controlled the sedimentological distribution and characteristics. Localised tectonics resulted in variations in the basin evolution on different sides of the embayment, as greater tectonically controlled sediment accommodation in the west provided for deeper and more continuous sediment profiles. Regional studies across the embayment indicate that the syn-depositional tectonism was prevalent in the basin margins where episodic reactivation of structures formed localised depocentres around the Flinders and Barrier Ranges. In these areas, the tectonic offset on structures exceeded 200 m. In places where there are surficial exposures of these structures, it is evident that they have been reactivated post-dating sediment deposition, such that overall throw on the structure exceeds 500 m. In contrast, syn-deposition tectonism basin-ward at the northern edge of the embayment was calm with open folding and tectonic offset on large structures typically less than 50 m. Core and rock mineralogical analysis provides evidence of some minor syn-deposition erosion and reworking of sediments. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The redox {{behaviour}} {{of several}} couples on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and graphene {{has been studied}} using both micro- and macroscopic measurements supported by detailed analysis. The ET kinetics of Ru(NH 3) 6 3 +/ 2 +, (ferrocenylmethyl) trimethylammonium (FcTMA 2 +/+), and ferrocenylcarboxylic acid (FcCOO-/ 0) was found fast, on the time-scale of voltammetric measurements, on a freshly cleaved HOPG surface, but on “aged” one, Ru(NH 3) 6 3 +/ 2 + exhibited sluggish ET, showing quite unusual macroscopic cyclic voltammograms. The other two couples retained their fast response on an “aged” surface. The surface of “aged” HOPG is proposed to consist of graphene layers of different thicknesses, which, from graphite to monolayer graphene, have progressively diminishing capacity to support fast ET specifically for Ru(NH 3) 6 3 +/ 2 +. Such a redox-selectivity correlates with the position of formal potentials of the three redox couples relative to the band structure of graphene, with Ru(NH 3) 6 3 +/ 2 + being most close to the minimum in density of states (DOS) of undoped monolayer graphene. Based on macroscopic voltammetry, low grade HOPG, whose surface is abundant with step edges, was found not to be redox-selective in the sense described above, meaning that its “aged” surface {{was as good as}} fresh one. It is highly likely that step edges being a type of crystal lattice defects, retain their capacity for fast ET, which correlates with their elevated DOS, and, thus, secure fast voltammetric response of low grade HOPG in macroscopic experiments on these complex “aged” surfaces. IrCl 6 2 -/ 3 -, Fe(CN) 6 3 -/ 4 - and the three couples discussed above were all found to have fast electrochemistry on freshly cleaved surfaces of high grade HOPG. Estimated heterogeneous rate constants were > 0. 1 cm s- 1 for Ru(NH 3) 6 3 +/ 2 + and > 1. 7 cm s- 1 for IrCl 6 2 -/ 3 -and Fe(CN) 6 3 -/ 4. This suggests that basal planes of graphite have, though low, but sufficient DOS to perform ET at a rate comparable with that on some metals. Furthermore, these results unarguably defy those opinions, that have been long circulating in the published literature, stating that basal plane of HOPG (and also sidewalls of carbon nanotubes) are nearly inert towards ET and that the defects were solely responsible for the observed electrochemical activity of this material. The study of adsorption of three ferrocene derivatives on HOPG revealed FcTMA+ and FcCOO- adsorb weakly and approximately equally whereas zero-charged FcCH 2 OH adsorbs notably more strongly. The adsorption was studied with cyclic voltammetry and quantitative information was extracted from the experimental data basing on a simple dedicated theory developed in this thesis. The “aged” surface of high grade HOPG exhibited enhanced adsorption as compared to fresh one, but low grade HOPG did not show the difference. It is suggested that the highly flat surface of high <b>grade</b> HOPG (large <b>terraces</b> widths) facilitates formation of airborne contaminating film made of hydrocarbons on, which serves as a “trap” for ferrocene derivatives owing to their largely non-polar ferrocene moieties. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{semiconductor}} materials both in {{the form}} of heteropitaxial and homoepitaxial structures, offer huge potentialities due to a large variety of band energy structures which can be exploited in microelectronics (FET, HBTs) and optoeletronic (lasers, LEDs) devices. However, epitaxial integration of different semiconductors for device development present several issues regarding mainly the minimization of the defects within the heterostructures. To achieve this, materials with similar lattice constant should be used, so that the induced elastic strain in the overgrown film is minimized. Other than the physical constraints however, the choice of the high quality substrate must yield to a cost-effective solution to develop the devices. In the field of microelectronics, the silicon has remained the unparallel material of choice for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices due to its large availability and relative low cost of the raw material. Born in the late 1950 s and having since grown into an industry with annual revenues currently in excess of 200 bilion, the modern Si-based semiconductor microelectronics industry is an amazing technical and financial accomplishment. The continuous increase in devices performance requirements have highlighted the main limitation of the silicon device employment. The carrier mobility for both electrons and holes is relatively small respect to the III V alloys, which instead combine high electrical performance with equally high radiation interaction efficiency. Furthermore, the maximum velocity that these carriers can attain under high electric fields is also small, and this limits the cut off frequency of the Si-based microelectronic devices. Due to indirect bandgap also, light emission and absorption is fairly inefficient, making impractical its employment in optoelectronics devices. On the other hand, the higher physical and electrical properties of the III V alloys respect to silicon, are also coupled with relatively high costs. Furthermore, these compounds offer an high application flexibility as the relative composition of these alloys can be also tuned in order to obtain a specific optical or electrical properties. By employment of the Germanium however, the properties of the silicon can be enhanced drastically. SiGe compounds infact exhibit higher electron and hole mobility even if small relative Ge fraction is added to the silicon. Moreover, the application of strain engineering in microelectronic devices using strain-relaxed SiGe buffer layer have brought a drastic enhancement in electrical properties of silicon. These alloys offers in addition the possibility to integrate the high efficiency III V alloys with low cost silicon substrate. The generally large lattice mismatch between these materials and the silicon, give rise to several issue regarding epitaxy integration. High mismatched heterostructure infact, relax plastically the elastic strain by an uncontrollable process which lead to a high density of induced defects in the grown layers. Several methods have been developed to growth high quality Ge layers onto silicon substrate with only a small dislocation content, such as constant composition thin buffer layers, linearly graded buffer layer and <b>terrace</b> <b>graded</b> buffer layers. On the other hand, in case a pure Ge can be directly integrated into the silicon wafer, a subsequent overgrown of III V alloys can be performed generating a low density of induced dislocations. Also the technique employed for deposition play a determinant role on the final quality of the grown layer. Classical CVD techniques, are able to growth high quality epitaxial layers but suffers generally of a low growth rate. Furthermore, the high thermal budgets required for precursor cracking can lead to several defect generation processes which finally degrade the electrical properties of the grown layer. In this work, high quality pure Ge virtual substrate (VS) have been grown onto silicon substrate using the low energy plasma enhance chemical vapor deposition (LEPECVD) technique. The innovative epitaxial reactor have been developed at the Physics Department of the University of Ferrara in collaboration with Dichroic Cell, and have been installed in the clean room facilities. A very high growth rates, as high as 3 nm/s, can be obtain while maintaining an high crystallographic quality of the epilayers. Furthermore, the substrate temperature have been proved to play a determinant role on the epitaxial processes. Thus a numerical approach have been developed to assess the temperature profile during the epitaxial process within the LEPECVD reactor. The finite element analysis have highlighted several feature useful for the design improvement of the LEPECVD heating stage. Finally, pure Ge VS buffer layers have been obtain with a induced TDD as low as 105 cm- 2. The low surface roughness and the high relaxation of the VS buffer layers obtained, put the basis for a cost-effective integration of the high efficient III-V alloys with Silicon substrates...|$|R
