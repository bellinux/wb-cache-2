5000|$|The uracil may be excised by uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG), {{resulting}} in an abasic site. This abasic site (or AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic) may be copied by a translesion synthesis DNA polymerase such as DNA polymerase eta, {{resulting in}} random incorporation {{of any of the}} four nucleotides, i.e. A, G, C, or T. Also, this abasic site may be cleaved by apurinic endonuclease (APE), creating a break in the <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate</b> backbone. This break can then lead to normal DNA repair, or, if two such breaks occur, one on either strand a staggered double-strand break can be formed (DSB). It is thought that the formation of these DSBs in either the switch regions or the Ig variable region can lead to CSR or GC, respectively.|$|E
50|$|DNA Ligase I {{functions}} to ligate single stranded DNA {{breaks in the}} final step of the base excision repair (BER) pathway. The nitrogenous bases of DNA are commonly damaged by environmental hazards such as reactive oxygen species, toxins, and ionizing radiation. BER is the major repair pathway responsible for excising and replacing damaged bases. Ligase I {{is involved in the}} LP-BER pathway, whereas ligase III is involved in the major SN-BER pathway(2). LP-BER proceeds in 4 catalytic steps. First, a DNA glycosylase cleaves the N-glycosidic bond, releasing the damaged base and creating an AP site- a site that lacks a purine or pyrimidine base. In the next step, an AP endonuclease creates a nick at the 5' end of the AP site, generating a hanging <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate</b> (dRP) residue in place of the AP site. DNA polymerase then synthesizes several new bases in the 5' to 3' direction, generating a hanging stretch of DNA with the dRP at its 5' end. It is at this step that SN-BER and LP-BER diverge in mechanism - in SNBER, only a single nucleotide is added and DNA Polymerase acts as a lyase to excise the AP site. In LP-BER, several bases are synthesized, generating a hanging flap of DNA, which is cleaved by a flap endonuclease. This leaves behind a nicked DNA strand that is sensed and ligated by DNA Ligase. The action of ligase I is stimulated by other LP-BER enzymes, particularly AP-endonuclease and DNA polymerase.|$|E

It was previously shown that human cells harbor <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate</b> aldolase activity but the protein responsible of this activity has never been formally identified. This study provides the first experimental evidence that DERA, which is mainly expressed in lung, liver and colon, is the human <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate</b> aldolase. Among human cell lines, the highest DERA mRNA level and <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate</b> aldolase activity were observed in liver-derived Huh- 7 cells. DERA was shown {{to interact with the}} known stress granule component YBX 1 and to be recruited to stress granules after oxidative or mitochondrial stress. In addition, cells in which DERA expression was down-regulated using shRNA formed fewer stress granules and were more prone to apoptosis after clotrimazole stress, suggesting the importance of DERA for stress granule formation. Furthermore, the expression of DERA was shown to permit cells in which mitochondrial ATP production was abolished to make use of extracellular deoxyinosine to maintain ATP levels. This study unraveled a previously undescribed pathway which may allow cells with high deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase activity, such as liver cells, to minimize or delay stress-induced damage by producing energy through deoxynucleoside degradation...|$|E

The two major pentose phosphates, ribose- 5 -phosphate and ribose- 1 -phosphate, can be readily interconverted by phosphopentomutase. Ribose- 5 -phosphate is also the direct precursor of 5 -phosphoribosyl- 1 -pyrophosphate, which is used for both de novo and salvage synthesis of nucleotides. On the other hand, the phosphorolysis of deoxyribonucleosides is {{the major source of}} <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphates.</b> While the destiny of the nucleobase stemming from nucleoside phosphorolysis has been extensively investigated, the fate of the sugar moiety has been somehow neglected. However, extensive advances have been made in elucidating the pathways by which the pentose phosphates, arising from nucleoside phosphorolysis, are either recycled, without opening of their furanosidic ring, or catabolized as a carbon and energy source. Nevertheless, many aspects of pentose phosphate metabolism, and the possible involvement of these compounds in a number of cellular processes still remain obscure.

40|$|ALTHOUGH the {{importance}} of the nucleobases in the DNA double helix is well understood, the evolutionary significance of the <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate</b> backbone and the contribution of this chemical entity to the overall helical structure and stability of the double helix is not so clear. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) 1 - 7 is a DNA analogue with a backbone consisting of N-(2 -aminoethyl) glycine units (Fig. 1) which has been shown to mimic DNA in forming Watson-Crick complementary duplexes with normal DNA 7. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy we show here that two complementary PNA strands can hybridize to one another to form a helical duplex. There is a seeding of preferred chirality which is induced by the presence of an L- (or D-) lysine residue attached at the carboxy terminus of the PNA strand. These results indicate that a (deoxy) ribose phosphate backbone is not an essential requirement for the formation of double helical DNA-like structures in solution...|$|E

The system {{was used to}} analyze a tryptic digest of Escherichia coli uracil DNA glycosylase (Ung; Mr = 25, 563), a DNA-binding protein that initiates the uracil-excision DNA repair process by catalyzing the release of uracil from the <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate</b> backbone of DNA. Both on-line and off-line approaches to analyzing peptides produced by in-gel digestion of Ung are demonstrated. The on-line approach uses nano-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) /micro-electrospray MS to assign peptide masses. The off-line approach uses matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and nano-electrospray/collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem mass spectrometry, to analyze fractions (2 – 3 μL) collected manually from the nano-LC system.

Phosphorolysis of deoxyribonucleosides is the main source of <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphates,</b> which are interconvertible, through the action of phosphopentomutase. The pentose moiety of all nucleosides can serve as a carbon and energy source. During the past decade, extensive advances have been made in elucidating the pathways by which the pentose phosphates, arising from nucleoside phosphorolysis, are either recycled, without opening of their furanosidic ring, or catabolized as a carbon and energy source. We review herein the experimental knowledge on the molecular mechanisms by which (a) ribose- 1 -phosphate, produced by purine nucleoside phosphorylase acting catabolically, is either anabolized for pyrimidine salvage and 5 -fluorouracil activation, with uridine phosphorylase acting anabolically, or recycled for nucleoside and base interconversion; (b) the nucleosides can be regarded, both in bacteria and in eukaryotic cells, as carriers of sugars, that are made available though the action of nucleoside phosphorylases. In bacteria, catabolism of nucleosides, when suitable carbon and energy sources are not available, is accomplished by a battery of nucleoside transporters and of inducible catabolic enzymes for purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and for pentose phosphates. In eukaryotic cells, the modulation of pentose phosphate production by nucleoside catabolism seems to be affected by developmental and physiological factors on enzyme levels...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: DNA {{polymerase}} (pol) β {{is a small}} eukaryotic DNA polymerase {{composed of}} two domains.

Pol β has been an excellent model enzyme for studying the nucleotidyl transferase reaction and substrate discrimination at a molecular level. In this review, recent crystallographic studies of pol β in various liganded and conformational states during the insertion {{of right and wrong}} nucleotides as well as during the bypass of damaged DNA (apurinic sites and 8 -oxoguanine) are described. Structures of these catalytic intermediates provide unexpected insights into mechanisms by which DNA polymerases enhance genome stability.

OsPol λ had activities of DNA polymerase, terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase and <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate</b> lyase, a marker enzyme for base excision repair. It also interacted with rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen (OsPCNA) in a pull-down assay. OsPCNA increased the processivity of OsPol λ. Northern blot analysis showed that the level of OsPol λ expression correlated with cell proliferation in meristematic and meiotic tissues, and was induced by DNA-damaging treatments. These properties suggest that plant Pol λ is a DNA repair enzyme which functions in plant meristematic and meiotic tissues, and that it can substitute for Pol β and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase...|$|E

The solution {{structure of}} the decamer was calculated by an iterative hybrid relaxation matrix method combined with NOESY-distance restrained molecular dynamics. The distances from the 2 D NOESY spectra were calculated from the relaxation rate matrix which were evaluated from a hybrid NOESY volume matrix comprising elements from the experi-ment and those calculated from an initial structure. The hybrid matrix-derived distances were then used in a restrained molecular dynamics procedure to obtain a new structure that better approxi-mates the NOESY spectra. The resulting partially refined structure was then used to calculate an improved theoretical NOESY volume matrix which is once again merged with the experimental ma-trix until refinement is complete. JH 3 ′–P coupling constants {{for each of the}} phosphates of the decamer were obtained from 1 H- 31 P J-resolved selective proton flip 2 D spectra. By using a modified Karplus relationship the C 4 ′-C 3 ′-O 3 ′-P torsional angles (ε) were obtained. Comparison of the 31 P chemical shifts and JH 3 ′–P coupling constants of this sequence has allowed a greater insight into the various factors responsible for 31 P chemical shift variations in oligonucleotides. It also provides an important probe of the sequence-dependent structural variation of the <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate</b> backbone of DNA in solution. These correlations are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in local helical structure perturb the <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate</b> backbone. The variation of the 31 P chemical shift, and the degree of this variation from one base step to the next is proposed as a potential probe of local helical conformation within the DNA double helix. The pattern of calculated ε and ζ torsional angles from the restrained molecular dynamics refinement agrees quite well with the measured JH 3 ′–P coupling constants.

Principal Findings: Here, we described a novel natural allelic variant of human Poll (hPoll) characterized by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), C/T variation in the first base of codon 438, resulting in the amino acid change Arg to Trp. In vitro enzyme activity assays of the purified W 438 Poll variant revealed that it retained both DNA polymerization and <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate</b> (dRP) lyase activities, but had reduced base substitution fidelity. Ectopic expression of the W 438 hPoll variant in mammalian cells increases mutation frequency, affects the DSB repair NHEJ pathway, and generates chromosome aberrations. All these phenotypes are dependent upon the catalytic activity of the W 438 hPoll. Conclusions: The expression of a cancer-related natural variant of one specialized DNA polymerase can be associated to generic instability at the cromosomal level, probably due a defective NHEJ.

A purine base is always bound to its corresponding pyrimidine base through hydrogen bonds (A binds to T and C binds to G).

We report anion desorption yields from a thin solid film of the oligonucleotide GCAT induced by the impact of 3 – 15 eV electrons. All observed anions (H–, O–, OH–, CN–, and OCN–) are produced by dissociative electron attachment to the molecule, which results in desorption peaks between 6 and 12 eV.

By comparing the shapes and relative intensities of the anion yield functions from GCAT physisorbed on a tantalum substrate with those obtained from isolated DNA basic subunits (i. e., bases, <b>deoxyribose,</b> and <b>phosphate</b> groups) from either the gas phase or condensed phase experiments, it is possible to obtain more details on the mechanisms involved in low energy electron damage to DNA, particularly on those producing single strand breaks...|$|R

Primarily, uridine competitively inhibits thymidine phosphorylase (E. C. 2. 4. 4), and thereby prevents {{the degradation of}} thymidine to thymine which is not incorporated into normally growing E. coli. Uridine also inhibits induction of the enzyme by thymidine. It prevents the actual inducer, probably a <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate,</b> from being formed rather than competing for a site on the repressor. The inhibition of thymidine phosphorylase by uridine also accounts for inhibition by uracil compounds of thymine incorporation into thymine-requiring mutants. Deoxyadenosine also increases the incorporation of thymidine, by competitively inhibiting thymidine phosphorylase. Deoxyadenosine induces the enzyme, in contrast to uridine. But this is offset by a transfer of deoxyribose from deoxyadenosine to thymine. Thus, deoxyadenosine permits incorporation of thymine into DNA, even in cells induced for thymidine phosphorylase. This incorporation of thymine {{in the presence of}} deoxyadenosine did not occur in a thymidine phosphorylase-negative mutant; thus, the utilization of thymine seems to proceed by way of thymidine phosphorylase, followed by thymidine kinase. These results are consistent with the data of others in suggesting that wild-type E. coli cells fail to utilize thymine because they lack a pool of deoxyribose phosphates, the latter being necessary for conversion of thymine to thymidine by thymidine phosphorylase...|$|E
40|$|Selenium can be metabolized for protein {{synthesis}} by two major pathways in vivo. In a specific pathway {{it can be}} inserted into polypeptide chains as the amino acid selenocysteine, as directed by the UGA codon. Alternatively, selenium can be substituted for sulfur to generate the free amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine, and these are incorporated nonspecifically into proteins in place of cysteine and methionine, respectively. A mutant strain of Escherichia coli was constructed that is deficient in utilization of inorganic selenium for both specific and nonspecific pathways of seleno{{protein synthesis}}. Disruption of the cysK gene prevented synthesis of free cysteine and selenocysteine from inorganic S and Se precursors. Inactivation of the selD gene prevented synthesis of selenophosphate, the reactive selenium donor, required for the specific incorporation pathway. As expected, the double mutant strain, RL 165 ΔselD, when grown anaerobically in LB + glucose medium containing 75 SeO 32 −, failed to synthesize selenium-dependent formate dehydrogenase H and seleno-tRNAs. However, it incorporated 24 % as much selenium as the wild-type strain. Selenium in the deficient strain was bound to five different proteins. A 39 -kDa species was identified as glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase. It is possible that selenium was bound as a perselenide derivative to the reactive cysteine residue of this enzyme. A 28 -kDa protein identified as <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate</b> aldolase also contained bound selenium. These 75 Se-labeled proteins may have alternate roles as selenium delivery proteins...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} optimal thymine and {{deoxythymidine}} (dThd) growth {{requirements of the}} thymineless mutants of Escherichia coli 15, E. coli 70 – 462 (strain 70), and a variant, E. coli 70 V 3 – 462 (strain 70 V 3), showed that for maximal turbidity (growth) strain 70 required 10 -fold greater concentrations of thymine or dThd than did strain 70 V 3. On suboptimal concentrations of thymine or dThd, growth of strain 70 was greater on dThd than on thymine. In contrast, maximal growth of strain 70 V 3 was the same on equimolar concentrations of thymine and dThd. Growth rate of strain 70 V 3 was the same on equimolar concentrations of thymine and dThd up to 4 μm; at concentrations of 5 μm and greater, the “ 4 -hr” growth was lower on dThd than on corresponding concentrations of thymine. Cultures of both thymineless mutants synthesized equal maximal amounts of DNA. Whereas strain 70 V 3 incorporated a maximum of 90 % of the thymine or dThd in the media, strain 70 incorporated a maximum of only 10 %. This poor utilization by strain 70 was neither a result of thymine or dThd conversion to a low-molecular-weight thymine derivative nor {{the production of a}} nonthymine inhibitory substance. Since strains 70 and 70 V 3 exhibited no thymidylate synthetase activity, the first mutation (strain 15 to strain 70) resulted in the loss of this activity. The second mutation (strain 70 to strain 70 V 3) probably brought about the loss of an enzyme(s) that catabolizes <b>deoxyribose</b> <b>phosphate,</b> permitting a greater net synthesis of dThd from thymine...|$|E
25|$|DNA usually {{exists as}} a {{double-stranded}} structure, with both strands coiled {{together to form}} the characteristic double-helix. Each single strand of DNA is a chain of four types of nucleotides. Nucleotides in DNA contain a <b>deoxyribose</b> sugar, a <b>phosphate,</b> and a nucleobase. The four types of nucleotide correspond to the four nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, commonly abbreviated as A, C, G and T. Adenine and guanine are purine bases, while cytosine and thymine are pyrimidines. These nucleotides form phosphodiester bonds, creating the phosphate-deoxyribose backbone of the DNA double helix with the nuclei bases pointing inward (i.e., toward the opposing strand). Nucleotides (bases) are matched between strands through hydrogen bonds to form base pairs. Adenine pairs with thymine (two hydrogen bonds), and guanine pairs with cytosine (stronger: three hydrogen bonds).|$|R
5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called <b>deoxyribose</b> and a <b>phosphate</b> group. The nucleotides are joined {{to one another in}} a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to shed light on}} the {{mechanism}} by which gaseous samples of negatively charged oligonucleotides undergo extremely slow (i. e., over 1 - 1000 s) charge loss, we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations on an oligonucleotide anion, T 53 -, containing five thymine, <b>deoxyribose,</b> and <b>phosphate</b> units in which the first, third, and fifth phosphates are negatively charged. The study is aimed at determining the rate at which an electron is detached from such a trianion by way of an internal Coulomb repulsion induced event. In this process, the intrinsic 5. 0 - 5. 1 eV electron binding strength of each phosphate site is reduced by the repulsive Coulomb potentials of the other two negative sites. As geometrical fluctuations cause the distances among the three negative phosphate sites to change, this causes the Coulomb repulsion energies at these sites to fluctuate. Once the Coulomb potential at any phosphate site exceeds ca. 5 eV, the electron on that site is able to undergo autodetachment. Although such an electron must tunnel through a barrier to escape, it is shown that the tunneling rate is not the rate-limiting step in electron loss; instead, it is the rate at which geometrical fluctuations cause the Coulomb potentials to exceed 5 eV that determines the rate of electron loss. Because these rates are extremely slow, special techniques had to be introduced to allow results of dynamics simulations on more flexible models of T 53 - to be extrapolated to predict the behavior of the actual T 53 -.
