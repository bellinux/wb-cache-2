The surrogate compound can be a precursor of dioxin formation or others organic molecules in flue gas, as, for instance, a single dioxin. For a good estimation of dioxin concentrations (I-TEQ value), it is necessary to have a good correlation between surrogate concentration and I-TEQ value.

However, the receiving water’s ecological aspects are disregarded with this conventional approach. European legislation (i. e.

Furthermore, the WFD urges {{the adoption of a}} combined analysis of <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> <b>values</b> and physical-chemical and ecological aspects of the receiving waters and encourage the availability and use of decision support tools for water management such as simulation models. Croatia has signed agreements to join the European Union (EU) and thus taken up the obligation to coordinate its legislation with EU standards, such as the implementation of the WFD for its investments in the construction and upgrading of WWTPs. Thus, Croatia needs a simulation tool that allows assessing the impact of WWTPs discharges on the water quality of rivers, considering physical–chemical and ecological aspects. During the last decade the water quality of the Drava river in Croatia has been affected by an increased demand of electricity production and its misuse as receiving aquatic ecosystem of controlled and uncontrolled discharges of waste from agricultural, urban or industrial activities. This paper presents an integration of wastewater treatment, river water quality and quantity and ecological assessment models to study the effect of upgrading a WWTP in the city of Varazdin and its ecological effects for the receiving river, the Drava river. The paper explains the integrated modelling framework and provides some illustrations of its application. Three scenarios for pollution control in the study area were evaluated with the integrated model. The scenario assessment showed that the upgrading of the WWTP, with Nitrogen and Phosphorous removal, is not enough to reach good ecological water quality in this river, therefore, other point and diffuse pollution sources should be controlled in the area. The integrated modelling framework is flexible enough to be used in conjunction with different approaches/models and can be applied to any river basin.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the production technology of oil-furnace carbon black, {{as well as}} the selected solution for preventing the emissions of this process from contaminating the environment. The products of industrial oil-furnace carbon black production are different grades of carbon black and process tail gases. The qualitative composition of these tail gases during the production of oil-furnace carbon black are: carbon(IV) oxide, carbon(II) oxide, hydrogen, methane, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor. The quantitative composition and lower caloric value of process tail gases change {{depending on the type of}} feedstock used in the production, {{as well as the}} type of process. The lower caloric value of process tail gases is relatively small with values ranging between 1500 and 2300 kJ m– 3. In the conventional production of oil-furnace carbon black, process tail gases purified from carbon black dust are freely released into the atmosphere untreated. In this manner, the process tail gases pollute the air in the town of Kutina, because their quantitative values are much higher than the prescribed <b>emissions</b> <b>limits</b> for hydrogen sulfide and carbon(II) oxide. A logical solution for the prevention of such air pollution is combustion of the process tail gases, i. e. their thermal oxidation. For this purpose, a specially designed flare system has been developed. Consuming minimum amounts of natural gas needed for oxidation, the flare system is designed to combust low caloric process tail gases with 99 % efficiency. Thus, the toxic and flammable components of the tail gases (hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, carbon(II) oxide, methane and other trace hydrocarbons) would be transformed into environmentally acceptable components (sulfur(IV) oxide, water, carbon(IV) oxide and nitrogen(IV) oxide), which are in compliance with the <b>emissions</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> prescribed by law. Proper operation of this flare system in the production of oil-furnace carbon black would solve the air pollution problem in the town of Kutina, especially the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide in the troposphere. Together with the development of this flare system, a continuous air-pollutant (hydrogen sulfide and carbon(II) oxide) monitoring system shall be established and linked with the Environmental Protection Agenc...|$|R

As emission of N 2 O represents {{a very serious problem}} due of its huge contribution to global warming, certain measures focused on its maximum reduction should be undertaken. Minimization of N 2 O emission in {{nitric acid production}} can be achieved {{in different parts of the}} process flow, depending on the applied available technologies. For the abatement of N 2 O emissions in Petrokemija's nitric acid production processes from the list of the best available technologies chosen were primary and secondary abatement technologies. The mentioned ensures reduction of N 2 O by use of improved selective heterogeneous catalysts in the step of gaseous ammonia oxidation. Precious metals in the shape of gauzes are used as selective heterogeneous catalyst in primary technology, while in the case of secondary technology the Fe 2 O 3 catalyst on Al 2 O 3 support in the shape of spherical pellets is chosen. Shown is the application of primary technology for the abatement of N 2 O in both nitric acid production facilities and their comparison with classical heterogeneous catalyst and preparation for the installation of secondary selective catalyst. N 2 O emissions with the application of primary technology in both production facilities were reduced from 12 kg of N 2 O to 7 kg of N 2 O per ton of pure HNO 3. With the primary reduction in N 2 O emissions the foundation was established for further reduction with the secondary technology to the final value of 0. 7 kg of N 2 O per ton of pure HNO 3, which represents mass concentration in the tail gas below 200 mg m - 3 (at n. c.).

40|$|In {{most modern}} waste {{incinerators}} selective non catalytic reduction (SNCR) {{is applied to}} remove NOx from the combustion gas to reach the European <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> (ELV) of 200 mg/Nm³. If however the NOx-ELV for waste incinerators would be lowered to e. g. 100 mg /Nm³, SNCR, with a typical NOx removal efficiency of around 50 %, would not suffice to reach the new ELV. In that case, selective catalytic reduction (SCR), with a NOx removal efficiency of up to 90 % in tail-end configuration could be an interesting alternative. However, from a life cycle perspective, the production, construction and operation of SCR equipment including the catalyst, also involve indirect (i. e. not from the process itself but related {{to other parts of}} the life-cycle) pollutant emissions and resource consumption with resulting environmental impacts. By means of a case study of a typical hazardous waste incinerator it is illustrated that replacing SNCR by tail-end SCR reduces the direct environmental impact of the incinerator (i. e. environmental impact of the NOx emitted at the stack) in the impact categories acidification, eutrophication and photo-oxidant formation, as expected from the lower NOx emissions in case of SCR. However, mainly due to the need to reheat the combustion gas, SCR has higher indirect impacts than SNCR, most notably in the impact category global warming. Because of these indirect impacts, the mentioned direct environmental impact reductions of SCR in the impact categories acidification, eutrophication and photo-oxidant formation are no net environmental benefits; when e. g. fuel oil is used as an energy source to reheat the flue gas, the indirect impact in the impact categories acidification and photo-oxidant formation is higher than the direct impact reduction related to the lower NOx concentration in the flue gas emitted at the stack of the installation. In this case, there is only a net environmental benefit in the impact category eutrophication. Overall it can be concluded that in the hazardous waste incinerator under study, which is representative in its field, replacing SNCR by SCR to reach a new, lower ELV, increases the net overall environmental impact of the incinerator, particularly in the impact category global warming. From an environmental point of view optimizing existing SNCR should be preferred over installing tail-end SCR for existing installations such as the considered hazardous waste incinerator. status: publishe...|$|R

(Environmental Science) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 On a {{per capita}} basis, cement {{is the second most}} widely {{consumed}} product in the world and its demand is increasing globally due to population growth and urbanisation. Manufacturing plants produce cement kiln dust (CKD) as one of the by-products while coal provides the dominant energy source in the manufacturing process. Various meta ls are found in CKD and some of these are micro nutrients with potentially toxic effects. If these are present in large quantities, they pose a direct threat to vegetation, animals and humans. The aim o f this study was to quantify a selected number of trace metal concentrations in vegetation, soil, dust and water samples near a cement manufacturing pl ant in the North West Province. Thirty-one samples at various distances from approximately 500 m to 2700 m from where the cement factory is situated, were collected. In addition, similar samples (except for water) were taken from a control site situated 72 kilometres in a north-western direction from the factory. The water control sample was collected from the Ditsobotla municipal water supply. Soil. plant and dust samples as well as the sediment from the water sample were acid digested to obtain total metal concentrations. The acid digested samples were analyzed for selected metal concentrations using the ICP-MS. The relationship between soil metal concentrations and particle size distribution as well as the relationship between dust concentrations and Ca concentrations was established to determine the link with the presence on a CMP in the area. The control samples, reference standards and results from similar research performed were used to compare with metal concentrations found in this study. The study revealed that Ni and Cu concentrations are higher in the silt fraction of the soil whilst V, Co, Zn and Pb in the silt fraction are only marginally higher than the complete soil sample. Only Cr and Mn concentrations were higher in soil samples than the control and reference values, while metal concentrations for Cr, Cu, Pb and Mn were higher in the dust samples than the control and the <b>Emission</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>Value</b> (EL V). Moreover, metal concentrations in the vegetation samples are not a concern as the concentrations a re lower than reference values. Cadmium and As levels are of no concern in this study area especially since dust samples had undetectably low levels. The condition of the environment m relation to pollution from the cement factory was established. Although some metals revealed lower concentrations, the study demonstrated the potential of metal contamination particularly Ni, Mn and Cr to the environment vis-a vis on the surrounding vegetation, animals and possibly on humans. It was therefore recommended that ELV limits for South Africa should be established and monitored for cement factories in South Africa coupled with sustainable land management policies. Master...|$|R

Results are presented for three groups of countries: (i) the 15 old Member States of the European Union, Norway and Switzerland, (ii) the 10 new Member States, and (iii) the other countries in Europe including the European area of Russia and Turkey. The analysis concludes that primary emissions of PM are expected to decline in the future due to current legislation, between 2000 and 2020 by approx. 40 - 45 percent in the EU- 25 and by 8 - 9 percent in the non-EU countries. Tightened <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> in a potential revision of the Heavy Metals and Gothenburg Protocols would have a relatively small effect on total PM emissions in 2020, especially if the protocols would not receive ratifications from additional Parties. In the EU- 25, PM 2. 5 emissions would decline in 2020 at maximum by an additional 7 percent if the most advanced technical measures were implemented. A significantly larger reduction potential could be harvested through ratification and subsequent implementation of the Heavy Metals and Gothenburg Protocols by additional Parties. This could reduce PM 2. 5 emissions in the non-EU countries by up to 25 percent in 2020 compared to the current legislation situation. While the Heavy Metals and Gothenburg Protocols contain obligations for PM emissions from certain emission sources, in 2020 the majority of PM emissions is expected to originate from sources for which these protocols do not specify <b>emission</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values.</b> For the EU- 25, about 80 percent of the identified technical potential for further PM reductions emerges from sources that are not covered in the Protocols. In the non-EU countries, more than 60 percent of the technical reduction potential relates to these sources. Approximately two thirds of this technical reduction potential from the non-protocol sectors emerge from small non-industrial combustion sources, especially wood and coal stoves...|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} {{protection of water}} bodies in Europe {{is based on the}} Water Framework Directive, which combines the so called <b>Emission</b> <b>Limits</b> <b>Value</b> and the Water Quality Objective (QO) approaches. The first one sets limits to particular type of emissions, for example the Nitrate Directive, while the second establishes Quality Standards for Biological, Chemical and Hydromorphological Quality Elements, in order to ensure the functioning of freshwater and marine ecosystem and the sustainable use of water bodies. To this regard, mathematical models are valuable tools for reconciliating these approaches, since they allow one to establish a causal link between emission levels and the Quality Standards ("direct problem") and vice-versa ("inverse problem"). In general, Quality Elements are variables or proper combination of variables which define the "status" of a water body. For example, the "chemical status" can be defined by a set of concentrations of chemicals which are potentially harmful for the ecosystem and humans, or the biological status may be based on Quality Elements which include the density of phytoplankton, the presence/absence of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation, the presence/absence of sensitive species etc. In many instances, the Quality Standards can then be expressed as threshold values, below or above which the functioning of the ecosystem is compromised and/or the risk for human health is not acceptable. If this is the case, management policies should be aimed at improving the state of the system and meet those Standards in the near future. In order to be carried in a cost-effective manner, such interventions should be based on a quantitative understanding of the relationships between the Pressures on the system and its State. This task could be very complex in large water bodies, where transport processes {{play a major role in}} creating marked gradients and pollution sources may be spatially distributed and/or not well identified. From the scientific point of view, the problem can be stated as follows: a mathematical model should enable one to "map" the spatial distribution of inputs (emissions) into the spatial distribution of the requested output, namely the "indicator" or "metric", which is subjected to a given constraint, the Quality Standard (QS), within the computational dominion. Such analysis may reveal that the QS are not respected only in a given fraction of the water body and, in the most favorable circumstances, identify the pollution sources which cause the problem. In such a case, a selective intervention, aimed at lowering the emission levels of those sources, would probably be more cost effective than the general reduction of the emission levels in the whole area. The spatial distribution of emission sources may also affect the pollution level and, in some instances, a proper redistribution of those sources in a given area, which leaves unchanged the total load, could have positive effect on the pollution level. In this paper, we are going to investigate the above problems in the simplest possible setting, in order to provide a clear interpretation of the results in relation to the most relevant parameters. The paper is organized as follows: in the "methods" section, we present the basic equations and provide insights for solving the problem in the general case as well as in the specific one here presented. The analytical solutions are presented and discussed in the next two sessions and some concluding remarks are then summarized in the conclusive section...|$|R
