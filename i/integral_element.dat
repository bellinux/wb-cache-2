[...] In 2006, Gilmour commented on his playing technique: [...] " [...] fingers make a distinctive sound... aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows". Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis.|$|E
500|$|Razer's {{weapon is}} a {{piercing}} arm which exerts approximately three tonnes of pressure {{per square inch}} (465kg/cm2, [...] ) at its tip. The arm was designed to pierce opponents' armour plating and break their internal components, rendering them impaired or immobile.

The arm is also an <b>integral</b> <b>element</b> of Razer's winged self-righting mechanism, which rolls the robot back onto its wheels if inverted. In later series of Robot Wars, an interchangeable hook was attached to the arm to lift robots immune from being pierced. The popularity of crushing and piercing weaponry in robot combat events is attributed to Razer, which inspired many imitations.|$|E
