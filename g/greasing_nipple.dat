5000|$|A <b>grease</b> fitting, <b>grease</b> <b>nipple,</b> Zerk fitting, or Alemite fitting is a {{metal fitting}} used in {{mechanical}} systems to feed lubricants, usually lubricating grease, into a bearing under moderate to high pressure using a grease gun.|$|R
5000|$|Suspension {{consists}} of 4 semi-elliptic springs on rubber bushes damped by Luvax hydraulic shock absorbers. Cars after 1931 replaced the rubber bushes with bronze bushes and <b>grease</b> <b>nipples.</b> Wheels {{were of the}} Magnum type with 5 studs fitted with 4.50×19-inch pneumatic tyres. The car had a track of 3 ft [...] in and a wheelbase of 7 ft 8 in.|$|R
50|$|Powered by an 1842 cc 4-cylinder overhead-valve Alvis engine, {{it had an}} {{aluminium}} body on an {{ash wood}} frame. As with other Alvis cars, the Firebird was built as a rolling chassis then sent to the coachbuilders Cross & Ellis, to be finished to the customer's requirements, so all Alvis Firebirds are different. The Firebird had an all-synchromesh gearbox, and the chassis was lubricated by <b>grease</b> <b>nipples</b> under the bonnet.|$|R
50|$|Under {{operational}} conditions, the Alouette II often {{proved to}} be a relatively maintenance-intensive rotorcraft. It required a high level of regular lubrication, the main rotorhead alone featuring 20 <b>grease</b> <b>nipples</b> that had to be re-lubricated after every five flight hours, while the drive shaft for the tail rotor was similarly demanding. Due to its high susceptibility to dust ingestion, some operators would have to remove the Alouette's rectangular sand filters after every landing in order to clean them.|$|R
5000|$|Turner had {{intended}} to introduce the sprung hub with Triumph's 1940 motorcycles, but {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War prevented this; the sprung hub was ultimately introduced in 1946. [...] The Mk. 2 version replaced the original in 1951. While the original version was provided with a <b>grease</b> <b>nipple,</b> the Mk. II version had no provision for greasing, with the factory grease packing expected to last for 20000 mi. The sprung hub was the only rear suspension offered with Triumph's parallel-twin motorcycles until 1955.|$|R
5000|$|A {{grease gun}} {{is a common}} {{workshop}} and garage tool used for lubrication. The purpose of the grease gun is to apply lubricant through an aperture to a specific point, usually on a grease fitting or 'nipple'. The channels behind the <b>grease</b> <b>nipple</b> lead to where the lubrication is needed. The aperture may be of a type that fits closely with a receiving aperture on any number of mechanical devices. The close fitting of the apertures ensures that lubricant is applied only where needed. There are three types of grease gun: ...|$|R
5000|$|The noisy {{two-cylinder}} 600 cc [...] {{engine was}} {{located at the}} back where it drove the rear wheels, initially via a [...] "crash" [...] gearbox. Later versions gained a four-speed all-synchromesh gearbox. Contemporaries were impressed by the brevity of the maintenance schedule, with the engine, gear box and final drive operating as a single chamber and all lubricated by means of oil, added through a filler in the rocker box cover. There were just two <b>grease</b> <b>nipples</b> requiring attention, positioned on the steering kingpins. The engine was also commended in contemporary reports for its fuel economy and longevity. Although noisy, the engine offered impressive flexibility, recalling NSU's strengths as a motorcycle manufacturer.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a 649 cc 360° parallel-twin with a 74 mm bore and an 80 mm stroke. The {{cylinder}} barrels and individual heads for each cylinder {{were made from}} cast iron. The crankcase was split vertically and held an oil tank with a capacity of 7 imppt L. Unlike Page's single cylinder designs for Triumph, which had double-plunger oil pumps and were the first Triumph motorcycles with enclosed valve gear, the 6/1 had a single-plunger oil pump and exposed valve gear with double-coil valve springs and rocker shaft with <b>grease</b> <b>nipples.</b> Induction was through a single 1" [...] Amal Type 276 carburettor on a Y-shaped manifold The flywheel was positioned outside the left case, and the camshaft was positioned behind the cylinder bank. The engine was positioned offset to the right in the frame.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} barrels had {{cast iron}} liners. The valve gear, brake gear and the hubs on the coupled wheels were fitted with soft <b>grease</b> lubricating <b>nipples</b> while the bronze axle boxes and connecting and coupling rods had hard grease lubrication. The leading and trailing wheels were fitted with roller bearings. The axle boxes and motion {{were similar to}} those of the Classes 15CA and 23 and were interchangeable in most cases. The weight of the reciprocating parts on each side of the engine was 1273 lb, of which 20% was balanced to ensure that the hammer blow per wheel would not exceed 1 lt 12 lcwt t at 55 mph and with the overbalance equally divided on all the coupled wheels.|$|R
40|$|The work thesis was {{performed}} at Assalub a company which {{is situated in}} Åtvidaberg. The company works with developing, manufacturing and marketing equipment for handling of lubricants for light and heavier industry. The work thesis {{it is based on}} a inquiry Assalub got from MacGregor which is a company within cargo solution, from port to offshore system. For unloading grain and other material from the ship cargo it is used combined inlet feeder and screw conveyor, there the inlet feeder is drilling down through the cargo and feed the screw conveyer with material to further destination. At the bottom of the screw conveyer and the inlet feeder there is a bearing that keep the parts together. However the lubrication of the bearing must be made manually. Until now the bearing was lubricated manually through a <b>grease</b> <b>nipple</b> {{from the bottom of the}} drill once a day.   The purpose of the thesis was the construction of a lubricating system namely a pump with a grease container which should be placed inside the space of the screw conveyer, so the bearing will be continually lubricated and able to work several days without any stoppage. After receiving drawings and operating data for the screw conveyer, the details for the construction was designed in CAD system Solid Edge. The solid mechanics calculations on the weakest point on the construction was made by hand and afterwards the drawings for respectively details was made. The construction was completed, but because of the time limit for this work thesis, the manufacturing, mounting and testing were not included in these weeks. The grease containers capacity is approximately seventy-two hours, although desirable should be up to seven days. According to the solid mechanics calculations, the construction should have no problem to resist the stresses it would be exposed to. Since this is a prototype there is probably some adjustments and improvements to do, but the estimating is that the system should work properly as it is now...|$|R
