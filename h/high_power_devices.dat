Their Janus laser started operation in 1974, and validated the approach of using Nd:glass lasers to generate very <b>high</b> <b>power</b> <b>devices.</b> Focusing problems were explored in the Long path laser and Cyclops laser, {{which led to the}} larger Argus laser. None of these were intended to be practical ICF devices, but each one advanced {{the state of the art}} to the point where there was some confidence the basic approach was valid. At the time it was believed that making a much larger device of the Cyclops type could both compress and heat the ICF targets, leading to ignition in the [...] "short term". This was a misconception based on extrapolation of the fusion yields seen from experiments utilizing the so-called [...] "exploding pusher" [...] type of fuel capsules. During the period spanning the years of the late '70s and early '80s the estimates for laser energy on target needed to achieve ignition doubled almost yearly as the various plasma instabilities and laser-plasma energy coupling loss modes were gradually understood. The realization that the simple exploding pusher target designs and mere few kilojoule (kJ) laser irradiation intensities would never scale to high gain fusion yields led to the effort to increase laser energies to the 100 kJ level in the UV and to the production of advanced ablator and cryogenic DT ice target designs.|$|E
