5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of any form of mass transit besides bus prior to 2008, the Phoenix Metropolitan Area has {{remained}} a very automobile-dependent city, with its first freeway opening in 1958—a year preceding most cities' first freeway openings. Coupled with the <b>explosive</b> <b>growth</b> of the region and adequate funding, the result is one of the nation's most expansive freeway networks.|$|E
5|$|After 1970, as Fort Lauderdale became {{essentially}} built out, {{growth in}} the area shifted to suburbs to the west. As cities such as Coral Springs, Miramar, and Pembroke Pines experienced <b>explosive</b> <b>growth,</b> Fort Lauderdale's population stagnated, and the city actually shrank by almost 4,000 people between 1980, when the city had 153,279 people, and 1990, when the population was 149,377. A slight rebound brought the population back up to 152,397 at the 2000 census. Since 2000, Fort Lauderdale has gained slightly over 18,000 residents through annexation of seven neighborhoods in unincorporated Broward County.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century Sully {{was almost}} entirely {{agricultural}} {{in nature and}} the population fluctuated between only 150 to 200 individuals. By 1920 this had still only increased to 550 despite the <b>explosive</b> <b>growths</b> of nearby Penarth and Barry. However, {{in just the past}} forty years Sully has grown steadily along the various commercial plastics factory developments and with the wider spread of private car ownership. Sully is now mainly a middle income dormitory suburb of Cardiff with a still expanding population of just over 5,000.|$|R

5|$|After the war area {{economic}} diversification {{brought on by}} the war effort helped in the transition to a peacetime economy. NASA's Johnson Space Center was established in 1963 helping to spur <b>explosive</b> <b>growth</b> in the mid-20th century, especially the 1970s and 1980s. The remainder of the communities on the southwestern shore urbanized and development connected the area to Houston. Tourism and recreation re-emerged and blossomed particularly around the Clear Lake area and the nearby shoreline.Barrington (2008), p. 266.Antrobus (2005), p. 57.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen {{has long}} been {{associated}} with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises {{on the border between}} the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and {{has long been}} almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an <b>explosive</b> <b>growth</b> in the number of microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like Nørrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to eat on the premises.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable <b>explosive</b> <b>growth</b> of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.|$|E

5|$|In the 2000s, churches {{teaching}} prosperity theology saw significant {{growth in}} the Third World. According to Philip Jenkins of Pennsylvania State University, poor citizens of impoverished countries often find the doctrine appealing because of their economic powerlessness and the doctrine's emphasis on miracles. One region seeing <b>explosive</b> <b>growth</b> is Western Africa, particularly Nigeria. In the Philippines, the El Shaddai movement, part of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, has spread prosperity theology outside Protestant Christianity. One South Korean prosperity church, Yoido Full Gospel Church, gained attention in the 1990s by claiming to be the world's largest congregation.|$|E
5|$|The Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation, {{otherwise}} known as the IMC, started out small, in natural resource extraction industries, under the name Hammond Engineering. Increasing demand for Titan manufacturing materials, combined with Hammond's market-cornering planetary survey technology and map database rights, contributed to <b>explosive</b> <b>growth</b> for the company. Over {{the course of a}} century, a series of acquisitions, mergers, and re-brandings lead to the transformation of Hammond Engineering into the ruthless commercial empire that is the IMC. With the Frontier’s valuable shipping lanes and vast planetary resources ripe for exploitation, the IMC is dedicated to maximizing profits and shareholder wealth, using the legal application of force when necessary.|$|E
5|$|A large {{petroleum}} reservoir {{was discovered}} {{just west of}} the city of Burkburnett, a small town in Wichita County, Texas in 1912. Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became boomtowns, experiencing <b>explosive</b> <b>growth</b> of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative oil field, and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and mineral rights deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.|$|E

40|$|Cyanobacterial blooms (see the figure) present {{health risks}} {{worldwide}} for humans and livestock that drink or use contaminated water, and also represent substantial economic costs to communities due to water treatment, lost tourism and recreation revenue, and declining property values (1). These <b>explosive</b> <b>growths</b> occur in fresh and marine water, {{and may be}} increasing globally. One recommendation is that water managers must address the {{effects of climate change}} when combating cyanobacterial blooms (2). However, recent studies suggest that controlling nutrients may be more important in increasing aquatic ecosystem resilience to these blooms. Justin D. Brookes and Cayelan C. Care...|$|R

5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} <b>explosive</b> <b>growth</b> of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E
5|$|NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) was {{established}} in the area in 1963. That and the <b>explosive</b> <b>growth</b> of neighboring Houston in the mid-20th century, especially the 1970s and 1980s, caused the remainder of the communities on the southwestern shore to urbanize. The Clear Lake City community was created by the Friendswood Development Company, a venture of Humble Oil and Dell E. Webb Corporation, to support residential growth near the new NASA facility. The communities around Clear Lake rapidly reoriented toward aerospace related industries, and the region's economy diversified further. Urban development spread solidly between Houston and the Bay Area communities. Houston formally annexed most of Clear Lake City in 1977 with Pasadena annexing most of the rest. Most of the other communities around the bay, however, had already incorporated, or incorporated soon afterward, and thus were independent of the metropolis. Texas State Historical Association.|$|E
5|$|Sales of plug-in {{passenger}} cars, excluding imports, totaled 207,380 {{units in}} 2015, making China the world's best-selling plug-in electric car country market in 2015. The plug-in electric passenger car segment market share rose to 0.84% in 2015, up from 0.25% in 2014. The top selling passenger models in 2015 were the BYD Qin plug-in hybrid with 31,898 units sold, {{followed by the}} BYD Tang (18,375). As a reflex of the <b>explosive</b> <b>growth</b> of the Chinese plug-in electric car market in 2015, BYD Auto ended 2015 as the world's best selling manufacturer of highway legal light-duty plug-in electric vehicles, with around 60,000 units sold, ahead of Tesla (50,580).

A graphical representation for these programs has the advantage of lending to efficient analysis compared to code based textual analysis. The Class Dependence Graph (ClDG) is insufficient to capture the features of real time safety critical object oriented program. We extend the basic ClDG to incorporate features like control flow and exception handling, timing, criticality, method sequences and sate information.

40|$|The {{domain of}} {{neuroscience}} has {{had one of}} the most <b>explosive</b> <b>growths</b> in recent decades: within this development there has been a remarkable and renewed interest {{in the study of the}} relations between behaviour and the central nervous system. Part of this new attention is connected with the contribution of new technologies (PET, fMRI) permitting more precise mapping of neural structures responsible for cognitive functions and the development of new theoretical models of mental activities. The diffusion of new pathologies (for example the pattern of cognitive impairment associated with AIDS) has further enlarged the field of clinical neuropsychology. Finally there has been an expanding clinical interest in the understanding and management of age-related cognitive changes...|$|R

5|$|Academics {{estimate}} that the Court of Chancery formally split from and became independent of the curia regis in the mid-14th century, at which time it consisted of the Lord Chancellor and his personal staff, the Chancery. Initially an administrative body with some judicial duties, the Chancery experienced an <b>explosive</b> <b>growth</b> in its work during the 15th century, particularly under the House of York, which academics attribute to its becoming an almost entirely judicial body. From the time of Elizabeth I onwards the Court was severely criticised for its slow pace, large backlogs, and high costs. Those problems persisted until its dissolution, despite being mitigated somewhat by reforms, particularly during the 19th century. Attempts at fusing the Chancery with the common law courts began in the 1850s, and finally succeeded with the 1873 and 1875 Supreme Court of Judicature Acts, which dissolved the Chancery and created a new unified High Court of Justice, with the Chancery Division – one of three divisions of the High Court – succeeding the Court of Chancery as an equitable body.|$|E
