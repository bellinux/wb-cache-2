5|$|At {{the time}} of her birth, Louise's <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> yet the ruler of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (he would not succeed his brother as Duke until 1794), and {{consequently}} she was not born in a court, but rather in a less formal home. Charles was field marshal of the household brigade in Hanover, and soon after Louise's birth he was made Governor-General of that territory by his brother-in-law George III, king of the United Kingdom and Hanover (husband of his sister, Queen Charlotte). The family subsequently moved to Leineschloss, the residence of Hanoverian kings, though during the summer they usually lived at Herrenhausen.|$|E
5|$|Bok began {{a ten-year}} period of slavery {{at the hands}} of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's herds of livestock. He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{going to be able to}} save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|Close {{to the end}} of the war, H.D. met {{the wealthy}} English novelist Bryher (Annie Winifred Ellerman). They lived {{together}} until 1946, and although both took numerous other partners, Bryher remained her lover for the rest of H.D.'s life. In 1919, H.D. came close to death when she gave birth to her daughter Frances Perdita Aldington—although the <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> Aldington, but Gray—while suffering from war influenza. During this time, her father, who had never recovered from Gilbert's death, died. In 1919, H.D. wrote one of her few known statements on poetics, Notes on Thought and Vision, which was unpublished until 1982. In this, she speaks of poets (herself included) as belonging to a kind of elite group of visionaries with the power to 'turn the whole tide of human thought'.|$|E

5|$|Coronel confronts Manrique {{during a}} {{campaign}} meeting, and {{explains that he}} intends to arrest Pacheco; however, Manrique warns Coronel that Pacheco's indictment will cause their downfall, as Manrique is one of Pacheco's clients. Acosta relays Mario's composite sketch to the police to be broadcast on television. Frustrated of his father-in-law's involvement with Pacheco, Coronel decides to work with Acosta, who informs him that his <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> corrupt, but was in fact killed while trying to expose corruptionAcosta himself was demoted for his part in working to weed out corruption. When Coronel discovers Mario's identity, he visits Lulette, who is with her lover, Boy. Coronel informs Acosta of Lulette's affair, and he attempts to use it as leverage while interrogating Mario. He is unsuccessful, but Mario later expresses to Daniel a sense of betrayal by his family's abandonment.|$|E
5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to think. He sees old photographs, including one of himself as a child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> even there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E
5|$|David Hattner {{was born}} to Louis and Joan Hattner, {{residents}} of Toledo, Ohio. His <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a musician but owned an extensive record collection which included classical music, which influenced David at a young age. Prior to college, Hattner attended the Interlochen Arts Camp in 1980 and from 1982–1984. He then spent three years at the Interlochen Arts Academy where he studied with Richard MacDowell and Frank Kowalsky, graduating in 1986. He has stated that his experiences at Interlochen inspired {{him to become a}} professional musician and conductor. In the summer of 1987, following his freshman year at Northwestern University where he studied clarinet performance under Robert Marcellus, Hattner was selected to perform at the Spoleto Music Festival in Italy. In 1988 he placed second in the International Clarinet Association's Young Artist Competition and was selected {{to be a member of}} the American-Soviet Youth Orchestra. Hattner earned a music degree with honors from Northwestern in 1990. Following his graduation, Hattner returned to Toledo and presented a clarinet recital at the University of Toledo's Center for the Performing Arts.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{positively}} reviewed by critics, but {{contained within the}} reviews were often criticism on {{the execution of the}} story and plot. A review in the The Moving Picture World was positive to the moral lesson the film asserted and found the acting to be satisfactory. Walton of the The Moving Picture News criticized the type of film as invoking sudden and unnatural changes in character {{for the sake of a}} moral lesson. The child's influence and ability to bring sense to her father was seen as cheap theatrics, but ended with the assertion that the film was not second rate for employing such theatrics. The New York Dramatic Mirror was positive, but said that the scene upon which the little girl follows her <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> believable because she was unaware of her father's intentions to kill himself. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Victoria's {{youngest}} son, Leopold, {{was affected}} by the blood-clotting disease haemophilia B and two of her five daughters, Alice and Beatrice, were carriers. Royal haemophiliacs descended from Victoria included her great-grandsons, Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, and Infante Gonzalo of Spain. The presence of the disease in Victoria's descendants, but not in her ancestors, led to modern speculation that her true <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the Duke of Kent but a haemophiliac. There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria's mother, and as male carriers always suffer the disease, even if such a man had existed {{he would have been}} seriously ill. It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria's father was over 50 {{at the time of her}} conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers. Spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|After {{fighting}} his {{way back}} to the top of the temple, Ryu encounters Bloody Malth, whom Ryu defeats. While dying, Malth reveals that he was the one who dueled with Ryu's father, that his father is still alive and that Ryu will meet him as he presses onward. When he reaches the temple's inner chambers, he discovers that his <b>father</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> killed but was instead possessed by an evil figure. He destroys the evil figure, which releases Ken from its hold. Jaquio, enraged from Ken's release from the possession, shows himself; he immediately tries to kill Ryu with a fiery projectile, but Ken throws himself in front of Ryu and takes the hit. Jaquio is killed during the ensuing fight by Ryu, but then a lunar eclipse occurs, causing the demon statues to transform into Jashin. After Ryu defeats the demon, Ken tells him he does not have much longer to live due to Jaquio's attack. He tells Ryu to leave him behind in the temple while it collapses and to take the young woman with him. Afterwards, Foster, communicating via satellite, orders the girl to kill Ryu and steal the demon statues; she chooses to be with Ryu instead of carrying out the order. The two kiss, and the girl tells Ryu her name, Irene Lew; the two watch as the sun rises.|$|E

At one point he arranged a political marriage between Yasmah-Adad to Beltum, the princess of his ally in Qatna. Yasmah-Adad already had a leading wife and put Beltum in a secondary position of power. Shamshi-Adad I did not approve and forced his son to keep Beltum in the palace in a leading position.|$|E
