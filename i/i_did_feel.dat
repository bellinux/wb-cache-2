500|$|In {{his last}} full {{season with the}} Indians in 1955, Doby was {{selected}} for his seventh consecutive and final All-Star Game. Doby's leg injuries affected him severely {{at this point in}} his career and he did not enter the game. He finished the 1955 season with 26 home runs and 75 RBIs while hitting [...]291 in 131 games, his fewest played since 1948. Not all in Cleveland were disappointed to see Doby leaving. Wrote one Plain Dealer columnist, Franklin Lewis: [...] "He has been a controversial athlete. Highly gifted, he was frequently morose, sullen, and upon occasion, downright surly to his teammates... He thought of himself, at the beginning, as the symbol of the Negro in his league." [...] Doby responded, [...] "I was looked on as a Black man, not as a human being. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> a responsibility to the Black players who came after me, but that was a responsibility, basically, to people, not just to Black people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Danny Glover as Man with Black Eye Patch. Glover {{described}} his character: [...] "The Man with the Black Eye Patch comes {{into this new}} world of blindness already half blind, so I think he understands where he is within his own truth, within himself. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> like this character was very much like Saramago because he is completely unapologetic—he is {{who he is and}} he accepts who he is." [...] Glover explained his involvement with the role, [...] "When you are blind you try to adopt another kind of sensitivity, so this role is definitely a challenge from a physical point of view." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an April 2011 {{interview}} Lenihan {{claimed the}} European Central Bank forced Ireland into taking a bailout and rejected claims by a senior ECB figure {{that the bank}} warned Ireland in mid-2010 of the dangers it faced. He has also accused members of the ECB executives of briefing against Ireland and of [...] "betrayal". Lenihan criticised some of the 17 governing board members of the bank for the [...] "damaging" [...] {{manner in which they}} had briefed some media about Ireland. He said, [...] "On the betrayal issue, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> that some bank governors should not be speaking out of turn and that only the president should speak for the bank." [...] The position of the ECB on Ireland's seeking of assistance was {{different from that of the}} European Commission, said Mr. Lenihan. [...] "I don't think the commission were anxious to bounce member states into a programme. [...] "That was my strong impression from my discussions with Commissioner Rehn." [...] he said, adding that [...] "the ECB clearly subscribed to a different view." [...] He gave a graphic description of his feelings when the bailout talks were concluded. [...] "I've a very vivid memory of going to Brussels on the final Monday to sign the agreement and being on my own at the airport and looking at the snow gradually thawing and thinking to myself, this is terrible. No Irish minister has ever had to do this before." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2004, Moulitsas and Daily Kos {{became the}} focus of {{controversy}} over a statement that he posted in the comments section of a blog post about Blackwater USA employees who were killed and mutilated in Fallujah:"Let the people see what war is like. This isn't an Xbox game. There are real repercussions to Bush's folly. That said, I feel nothing over the death of merceneries [...] They aren't in Iraq because of orders, or because they are there trying to help the people make Iraq a better place. They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them." [...] In a blog post the next day, Moulitsas defended and clarified his remarks:"My language was harsh, and, in reality, not true. Fact is, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> something. That's why I was so angry. I was angry that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts. I was angry that 51 American soldiers paid the ultimate price for Bush's folly in Iraq in March alone. I was angry that these mercenaries make more in a day than our brave {{men and women in uniform}} make in an entire month. I was angry that the US is funding private armies, paying them $30,000 per soldier, per month, while the Bush administration tries to cut our soldiers' hazard pay. I was angry that these mercenaries would leave their wives and children behind to enter a war zone on their own violition [...] So I struck back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{original}} album's lukewarm sales and reception, Rowland re-entered recording studios to collect new songs for a reissue of Ms. Kelly, including production by Stargate, Jeff Dawson, CKB and Mark Feist. She was {{also expected to}} record with producer Danja, but deadline pressure prevented from happening; a new track by J. R. Rotem {{did not make the}} final cut. [...] "The sales weren't as good as I wanted them to be and to be honest, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> sad about that for a little while", Rowland stated in 2008, still blaming the final track listing for too many midtempos and ballads. [...] "I didn't realize it while I was recording it. After it was released [...] many fans said the songs would rock if they were more upbeat." [...] Branded with the title Ms. Kelly: Diva Deluxe, the United States re-release received a digital download release only on March 25, 2008, containing seven tracks — five new songs and two remixes of songs found from the standard edition of the album. The international edition of the Ms. Kelly re-release was released physically and digitally in May 2008, retitled as Ms. Kelly: Deluxe Edition. It removed eight tracks from {{the original}} release and replaced them with six of the seven Diva Deluxe tracks, as Rowland [...] "wanted to have another view on the record and close the Ms. Kelly chapter" [...] with the re-release. Previously unreleased song [...] "Daylight", a Bobby Womack cover and collaboration with Travie McCoy of Gym Class Heroes, served as the reissue's new lead single.|$|E
