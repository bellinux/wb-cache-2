40|$|Age-dependent {{studies show}} that the amount of {{inorganic}} polyphosphate in rat brain strongly increases after birth. Maximal levels were found in 12 -months old animals. Thereafter, the concentration of total polyphosphate decreases to about 50 %. This decrease in the concentration of total polyphosphate is due to a decrease in the amount of insoluble, long-chain polyphosphates. The amount of <b>soluble,</b> long-chain <b>polyphosphates</b> does not change significantly in the course of ageing. In rat embryos and newborns, mainly <b>soluble</b> <b>polyphosphates</b> could be detected. In rat liver, the age-dependent changes are less pronounced. The changes in polyphosphate level are accompanied by changes in exopolyphosphatase activity, which degrades the polymers to orthophosphate; highest enzyme activities were found when the polyphosphate level was low, Induction of apoptosis in the human leukemic cell line HL- 60 by actinomycin D results in degradation of long polyphosphate chains. The total polyphosphate content does not change significantly in apoptotic cells...|$|R
40|$|Polyphosphate is an {{inorganic}} polymer {{that can}} potentiate several interactions {{in the blood}} coagulation system. Blood platelets contain polyphosphate, and the secretion of platelet-derived polyphosphate {{has been associated with}} increased thrombus formation and activation of coagulation factor XII. However, the small polymer size of secreted platelet polyphosphate limits its capacity to activate factor XII in vitro. Thus, the mechanism by which platelet polyphosphate contributes to thrombus formation remains unclear. Using live-cell imaging, confocal- and electron microscopy, we show that activated platelets expose polyphosphate on their cell surface. The apparent polymer size of membrane-associated polyphosphate largely exceeds that of secreted polyphosphate. Ultracentrifugation fractionation experiments revealed that membrane-associated platelet polyphosphate is condensed into insoluble spherical nanoparticles with divalent metal ions. In contrast to <b>soluble</b> <b>polyphosphate,</b> membrane-associated polyphosphate nanoparticles potently activate factor XII. Our findings identify the presence of membrane-associated polyphosphate in a nanoparticle state on the surface of activated platelets. We propose that these polyphosphate nanoparticles mechanistically link the procoagulant activity of platelets with the activation of coagulation factor XII...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} role of inorganic polyphosphates in {{the response}} of algal cells to osmotic stress was investigated. We show that changes in polyphosphate metabolism of algae induced by osmotic stress can be easily determined by measuring the metachromatic shift of toluidine blue produced by polyphosphate and by analysing {{the size of the}} extracted polyphosphate on urea/polyacrylamide gels. The amount and size of polyphosphate were found to differ considerably among different algal species. It is demonstrated that the alga Phaeodactylum tricornutum responds to hyperosmotic stress with a marked elongation of polyphosphate molecules and a decrease in the total amount of extractable polyphosphate, while exposure to hypoosmotic stress results in an increase in <b>soluble</b> shorter-chain <b>polyphosphates</b> and a rise in total polyphosphate content...|$|R
50|$|The {{catalytic}} {{domain of}} Inositol-Trisphosphate 3-Kinase contains a catalytic domain which varies from the protein kinase superfamily, {{as well as}} a novel four-helix substrate binding domain. In this kinase, the two domains are in an open conformation, which indicates that the two domains are both accessible at the same time. This suggests that substrate recognition and catalysis by Inositol-Trisphosphate 3-Kinase involves a dynamic conformational cycle. Additionally, this unique helical domain of Inositol Trisphosphate 3 Kinase blocks access to the active site by membrane-bound phosphoinositides, explaining the structural basis for <b>soluble</b> inositol <b>polyphosphate</b> specificity. Another feature of the catalytic core is the ATP binding site. Here, one molecule of ADP is bound in the cleft of the major domain, which indicates the active site of the kinase.|$|R

40|$|Water ice {{has been}} {{discovered}} on the moon by radar backscatter at the North Pole and by spectrometry at the South Pole in the Cabeus crater with an extrapolated volume for both poles of conservatively 109 metric tons. Various exogenic and endogenic sources of this water have been proposed. This paper focuses on endogenic water sources by fumaroles and hot springs in shadowed polar craters. A survey of theoretical and morphological details supports a volcanic model. Release of water and other constituents by defluidization over geological time was intensified in the Hadean Eon (c. a. 4600 to 4000 My). Intensification factors include higher heat flow by now-extinct radionuclides, tidal flexing and higher core temperatures. Lesser gravity would promote deeper bubble nucleation in lunar magmas, slower rise rates of gases and enhanced subsidence of lunar caldera floors. Hadean volcanism would likely have been more intense and regional in nature as opposed to suture-controlled location of calderas in Phanerozoic Benioff-style subduction environments. Seventy-seven morphological, remote sensing and return sample features were categorized into five categories ranging from a volcano-tectonic origin only to impact origin only. Scores for the most logical scenario were 69 to eight in favor of lunar volcanism. Ingredients in the Cabeus plume analysis showed many volcanic fluids and their derivatives plus {{a large amount of}} mercury. Mercury-rich fumaroles are well documented on Earth and are virtually absent in cometary gases and solids. There are no mercury anomalies in terrestrial impact craters. Volcanic fluids and their derivatives in lunar shadow can theoretically evolve into protolife. Energy for this evolution can be provided by vent flow charging intensified in the lunar Hadean and by charge separation on freezing fumarolic fluids in shadow. Fischer-Tropsch reactions on hydrothermal clays can yield lipids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and amino acids. <b>Soluble</b> <b>polyphosphates</b> are available in volcanic fluids as well as vital catalysts such as tungsten. We conclude that the high volume of polar water resources supports the likelihood of lunar volcanism and that lunar volcanism supports the likelihood of protolife...|$|R

40|$|Waste {{stabilisation}} ponds (WSP) are {{an important}} wastewater treatment technology used by thousands of communities around the world. Unfortunately, phosphorus removal in WSP is generally low and inconsistent. The aim of this work was to investigate biological phosphorus removal by microalgae in WSP. Luxury uptake of phosphorus, which is the accumulation of polyphosphate, is known to occur in microalgae in natural systems such as lakes; however, this mechanism has not previously been studied under WSP conditions. Three methods {{were used in the}} laboratory to investigate luxury uptake and it was shown {{for the first time that}} luxury uptake of phosphorus can occur in microalgae under typical WSP conditions. Acid-insoluble polyphosphate (AISP) is a form of phosphorus storage and acid <b>soluble</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> (ASP) is used for synthesis of cellular constituents. However, the findings of this thesis indicate that ASP may also act as a form of short term storage. The environmental factors influencing luxury uptake were investigated using laboratory experiments conducted under controlled conditions. The key environmental factors were the phosphate concentration in the wastewater, light intensity and temperature. A higher phosphate concentration increased the amount of ASP accumulation and also resulted in AISP being stored within the cells instead of being consumed for growth. Higher light intensity increased ASP accumulation, but as a consequence of elevated growth, the ASP was rapidly consumed. Temperature influenced the rate of AISP accumulation and little if any was accumulated at low temperatures. The fate of polyphosphate in the sludge layer was also studied and it was shown that polyphosphate was degraded resulting in phosphate release. Therefore, to maximise phosphorus removal the microalgae needs to be harvested. Field work showed that at times the biomass contained almost four times the amount of phosphorus required for growth which confirms that luxury uptake does indeed occur in full-scale WSP. To improve phosphorus removal in WSP both luxury uptake and the biomass concentration need to be maximised simultaneously. With this new understanding of biological phosphorus removal in WSP and the key environmental factors required it may be possible to develop a new phosphorus removal process utilising luxury uptake by microalgae...|$|R

In addition, their substrate specificities remain largely unknown. Here we develop a useful method to examine substrate specificities of PATs using a yeast expression system with six distinct model substrates. We identify 17 human DHHC proteins as PATs.

The dynamin PH domain specifically interacted with liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate [PI(4, 5) P 2] and, more weakly, with liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol- 4 -phosphate [PI(4) P]. This correlates with phosphoinositide {{activation of the}} dynamin GTPase. The functional GTPase of a dynamin mutant lacking the PH domain, however, cannot be activated by PI(4, 5) P 2.

We show here that Skp 2, a component of a ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates the degradation of several proteins that inhibit proliferation, is upregulated when increased mechanical tension develops in intact smooth muscle and that its upregulation is critical for the smooth muscle proliferative response to increased mechanical tension. Notably, whereas growth factors regulate Skp 2 at the level of protein stability, we found that mechanical tension regulates Skp 2 at the transcriptional level. Importantly, we demonstrate that the calcium-regulated transcription factor NFATc 1 is a critical mediator of the effect of increased mechanical tension on Skp 2 transcription. These findings identify Skp 2 as a node at which signals from mechanical tension and growth factors are integrated to regulate proliferation, and they define calcium-NFAT-Skp 2 signaling as a critical pathway in the mechanoregulation of proliferation.

40|$|We have {{identified}} a putative signalling feature of the cytoplasmic domains of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family members based on available amino acid sequence data. A casein kinase I (CKI) consensus sequence is conserved in the cytoplasmic domain of six of 15 members of the type II integral membrane TNF ligand family. We examined the phosphorylation state of transmembrane tumour necrosis factor-alpha (mTNF) with [32 P]orthophosphate labelling and in vitro kinase assays, in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264. 7 cells. A dimeric form of the type <b>I</b> <b>soluble</b> TNF receptor (sTNFR) was found to dephosphorylate mTNF. This effect could be prevented by treatment with phosphatase inhibitors. Recombinant CKI was able to phosphorylate mTNF that had been dephosphorylated by sTNFR ligation in vivo, and this was less effective if phosphatase inhibitors {{had been used to}} prevent mTNF dephosphorylation. A mutated form of mTNF, lacking the CKI recognition site, cannot be phosphorylated by the enzyme. Binding of sTNFR to mTNF induced an increase in intracellular calcium levels in RAW 264. 7 cells, implying the presence of an associated signalling pathway. We predict that this CKI motif is phosphorylated in other TNF ligand members, and that it represents a new insight into the mechanism of 'reverse signalling' in this cytokine family...|$|R

It has three general states: (<b>I)</b> <b>soluble</b> in water or (II) bound {{to the surface of}} a lipid bilayer as an unstructured monomer, and (III) inserted across the bilayer as a monomeric α-helix. We used fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry to study the interactions of pHLIP with a palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipid bilayer and to calculate the transition energies between states. We found that the Gibbs free energy of binding to a POPC surface at low pHLIP concentration (state I–state II transition) at 37 °C is approximately − 7 kcal/mol near neutral pH and that the free energy of insertion and folding across a lipid bilayer at low pH (state II–state III transition) is nearly − 2 kcal/mol. We discuss a number of related thermodynamic parameters from our measurements. Besides its fundamental interest as a model system for the study of membrane protein folding, pHLIP has utility as an agent to target diseased tissues and translocate molecules through the membrane into the cytoplasm of cells in environments with elevated levels of extracellular acidity, as in cancer and inflammation.

40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) {{infection is}} {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals and a leading cause of birth defects after congenital infection. Herpesvirus cell tropism is determined by gH/gL glycoprotein complexes in the viral envelope. The gH/gL complexes mediate virus entry into host cells through binding to host cell receptors and promote fusion of viral envelopes with cellular membranes. HCMV encodes two alternative gH/gL complexes, gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/pUL (128, 130, 131 a) which both shape the broad cell tropism of HCMV. However, their respective host cell receptors have not been identified. HCMV shows a broad cell tropism and readily produces infectious supernatant virus in cell culture. HCMV lacking the gH/gL/gO complex hardly produces infectious virus and spreads mainly cell-associated. By studying the binding of HCMV particles and recombinant gO-IgG Fc fusion proteins to fibroblasts, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) could be identified as an HCMV entry receptor recognized by the gH/gL/gO complex. It could be shown that only gH/gL/gO-positive HCMV infects cells in a PDGFRα-dependent manner: <b>i)</b> <b>Soluble</b> PDGFRα receptor and the natural ligand PDGF-BB could inhibit infection with wildtype virus, but not infection with gO-knockout mutants. ii) Overexpression of PDGFRα enhanced infection with wildtype virus, but not infection with gO-knockout virus.

The results of the present study reveal a strong correlation between the catalytic efficiency of three family I PPases (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli and rat liver) and one family II PPase (from Streptococcus mutans) in ATP and tripolyphosphate (P(3)) hydrolysis in the presence of Mg(2 +), Mn(2 +), Zn(2 +) and Co(2 +) on the one hand, and the phosphate-binding affinity of the enzyme subsite P 2 that interacts with the electrophilic terminal phosphate group of ATP on the other. A similar correlation was observed in S. cerevisiae PPase variants with modified P 1 and P 2 subsites. The effect of the above metal ion cofactors on ATP binding to S. cerevisiae PPase paralleled their effect on phosphate binding, resulting in a low affinity of Mg-PPase to ATP. We conclude that PPase mainly binds ATP and P(3) through the terminal phosphate group that is attacked by water. Moreover, this interaction is critical in creating a reactive geometry at the P 2 site with these bulky substrates, which do not otherwise fit the active site perfectly. We propose further that ATP is not hydrolysed by Mg-PPase, since its interaction with the terminal phosphate is not adequately strong for proper positioning of the nucleophile-electrophile pair...|$|R

However, they may actually be localized {{on the surface of}} the chromaffin granule. We have used the detergent digitonin to permeabilize the plasma membrane of cultured adrenal chromaffin cells to investigate the subcellular localization of TyrOHase and PMTase. A digitonin titration of the release of proteins and catecholamines revealed the existence of at least three subcellular compartments that are distinguished by their digitonin sensitivity: (<b>i)</b> <b>soluble</b> proteins, which were released upon treatment of the cells with low digitonin concentrations (5 microM), (ii) a "digitonin-sensitive" cytoplasmic protein pool, which required higher concentrations of digitonin for release (10 microM) and included TyrOHase and PMTase, and (iii) the chromaffin granule, which was insensitive to digitonin. Analysis of the rates of release of all of these proteins revealed that the rate of TyrOHase and PMTase release was slower at 10 microM than at 40 microM digitonin, while the rates of release of the other proteins were similar at both concentrations and varied in proportion to their respective sizes. Treatment with cytoskeletal disrupting agents had no effect on TyrOHase or PMTase efflux. These data suggest that TyrOHase and PMTase are in a detergent-labile association in the cell.

(ii) Nevertheless, after virus adsorption to Georgia bovine kidney cells, heparin was partially capable of removing adsorbed virus.

(iv) Radiolabeled purified BHV- 4 bound to wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells, whereas binding of the virus to mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that where deficient in either all glycosaminoglycans or only heparan sulfate was significantly impaired. (v) Using heparin-affinity chromatography, gp 8 glycoprotein was shown to bind specifically to immobilized heparin and to elute in the presence of soluble heparin. These data together showed that the gammaherpesvirus BHV- 4, like alphaherpesviruses and one betaherpesvirus, adsorbs to cells by binding to cell surface heparin-like moieties.

These issues were addressed using type <b>I</b> <b>soluble</b> tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNF-RI) as a model system. Changes in solution viscosity established that a truncated form of sTNF-RI bound free PEG in a pH-dependent manner. Above pH 5. 3, the viscosity escalated as the pH increased, while no effect occurred below pH 5. 0. Conjugation of 2 kD, 5 kD, or 20 kD PEG to the N terminus attenuated the viscosity at the higher pH values. Tryptophan phosphorescence spectroscopy correlated changes in the protein structure about Trp- 107, at the C terminus, with the pH-dependent and PEGylation-dependent attenuation of the viscosity. The results indicate that specific interactions between PEG and the truncated form of sTNF-RI are elicited by an increased flexibility of the truncated protein combined perhaps with removal of steric or charge barriers. Covalently bound PEG at the N terminus reduced the protein affinity for the free polymer and induced a more rigid and polar configuration around Trp- 107. Deprotonation of His- 105, which is perpendicular to Trp- 107, was integral to the binding mechanism producing a pH-dependent switching mechanism.

40|$|Protein {{phosphorylation}} regulates numerous cellular processes. Identifying the substrates {{and protein}} kinases involved {{is vital to}} understand how these important posttranslational modifications modulate biological function in eukaryotic cells. Pyrophosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of inorganic phosphate (PPi) to inorganic phosphate Pi, driving biosynthetic reactions; they are essential for low cytosolic inorganic phosphate. It was suggested recently that posttranslational regulation of Family <b>I</b> <b>soluble</b> inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPases) may affect their activity. We previously demonstrated that two pollen-expressed sPPases, Pr-p 26. 1 a and Pr-p 26. 1 b, from the flowering plant Papaver rhoeas were inhibited by phosphorylation. Despite the potential significance, there is a paucity of data on sPPase phosphorylation and regulation. Here, we used liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry to map phosphorylation sites to the otherwise divergent amino-terminal extensions on these pollen sPPases. Despite the absence of reports {{in the literature on}} mapping phosphorylation sites on sPPases, a database survey of various proteomes identified a number of examples, suggesting that phosphorylation may be a more widely used mechanism to regulate these enzymes. Phosphomimetic mutants of Pr-p 26. 1 a/b significantly and differentially reduced PPase activities by up to 2. 5 -fold at pH 6. 8 and 52 % in the presence of Ca 2 + and hydrogen peroxide over unmodified proteins. This indicates that phosphoregulation of key sites can inhibit the catalytic responsiveness of these proteins in concert with key intracellular events.

A combination of a β-blocker (BAB) with a diuretic (D) (bisoprolol 2. 5, 5, 10 mg and indapamid 1. 5 – 2. 5 mg/day) was prescribed to 102 patients with essential hypertension of 1 – 3 grades, 30 to 65 years old (mean age – 54. 54 ± 0. 91 years), who previously had not been receiving regular antihypertensive therapy. The daily dose of bisoprolol was administered by continuous slow titration, starting with low doses of 1. 25 mg/day. Of the patients 82 were women and 20 men, the duration of disease averaged 9. 0 ± 0. 71 years. The control group included 16 healthy subjects matched for age and sex. The level of stable terminal metabolites of nitric oxide NO (nitrite NO 2 – and nitrate NO 3 –), the concentration of S-nitrosothiol and NO-synthases (NOS), SOD, and catalase activity was determined biochemically. The contents of serum 8 -iso-PgF 2 α (8 -isoprostane), TNF-alpha and its type <b>I</b> <b>soluble</b> receptor (sTNF-αRI) were determined in all subjects using the “ 8 -isoprostane ELISA” (Usbiological,USA), “ProCon TNFα” (ProteinContour,Russian Federation) and “sTNF-RI EASIA” (BioSource Europe SA,Belgium) ELISA kits, respectively. During the course of combined antihypertensive therapy we observed a significant decrease of S-nitrosothiols levels, i-NOS activity, reduction of TNF-α type <b>I</b> of its <b>soluble</b> receptor (sTNF-αRI), and oxidative stress marker – 8 -iso-PgF 2 α in the examined patients. Nitrites and nitrates serum levels, activity of e-NOS, superoxide dismutase and catalase, by contrast, were increased in patients with hypertension and concomitant obesity. These changes may reflect the fact that against the background of the therapy there was a reduction in tension of oxidative stress, which leads to an improvement in endothelial function. Significant reduction ratio of TNF-α/sTNF-αRI shows suppression of autoimmune and apoptotic activity in patients under treatment. Thus, the improvement of endothelial function, a significant decrease in autoimmune activation due to lower tension of oxidative stress in the examined patients optimizes use of a combination of bisoprolol and indapamid for differentiated therapy in hypertensive patients with obesity...|$|R
40|$|The complement-fixing antigens {{present in}} tissue {{cultures}} infected with varicella-zoster virus were separated into four components. There were (<b>i)</b> a cell-free <b>soluble</b> antigen, (ii) a cell-associated soluble antigen, (iii) a cell membrane-associated antigen, and (iv) a virion antigen. All four antigens were reactive with sera from patients with varicella or zoster, and about 90 % {{of the total}} complement-fixing activity {{was found to be}} nonvirion associated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA finite group G {{is said to}} be a PST-group {{if every}} {{subnormal}} subgroup of G permutes with every Sylow subgroup of G. We shall discuss the normal structure of soluble PST-groups, mainly defining a local version of this concept. A deep study of the local structure turns out to be crucial for obtaining information about the global property. Moreover, a new approach to <b>soluble</b> PT-groups, <b>i.</b> e., <b>soluble</b> groups in which permutability is a transitive relation, follows naturally from our vision of PST-groups. Our techniques and results provide a unified point of view for T-groups, PT-groups, and PST-groups in the soluble universe, showing that the difference between these classes is quite simply their Sylow structure...|$|R

Pase <b>I</b> is a <b>soluble</b> enzyme that is inhibited by the membrane fractions from lactose-grown cells and is insensitive to activation by S 46 D HPr, an analog of HPr(ser-P) {{of the sugar}} phosphotransferase system.
