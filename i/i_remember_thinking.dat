5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. He said something to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E

And we get there and it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. I thought that was so funny because I thought there were going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads you into the coolest parts of the finale episode." ...|$|E

DeWitt {{was given a}} recurring role in the season as Don's mistress, which lasted for six episodes. She initially felt out of place while playing out her character. DeWitt stated, [...] "They were {{at the end of}} casting, and hadn't found the right Midge yet. Originally they had a scene where she opens the door wearing a red kimono, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> 'I'm not that', so I wasn’t sure I was right for the part.

500|$|In a 1995 interview, Guitar World writer Jeff Gilbert {{described}} Vitalogy as [...] "strange" [...] and [...] "very eclectic." [...] McCready agreed, saying, [...] "There is {{some weird}} stuff on there." [...] McCready attributed the album's sound {{to the group}} recording it on tour. During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said, [...] "Vitalogy {{is the first one}} where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'This is so different. Is anyone going to like this?'...It had a more punk feel to it. Simple songs recorded really quickly." [...] The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said, [...] "Vitalogy is not really a 'solo' album. I don't think the songs demanded solos; {{it was more of a}} rhythmic album." ...|$|E

I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for {{a lot of money to}} him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.' But I never got around to making it."

Ament said, [...] "When we made Vs., our second record, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Man, I wish our first record sounded like this.' I thought it was more direct, more powerful." [...] Besides the heavier songs, the album features two acoustic ballads in [...] "Daughter" [...] and [...] "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town". A few of the songs incorporate elements of funk, including [...] "Animal", [...] "Blood", and [...] "Rats". McCready stated that it wasn't that the band [...] "sat down and decided to be funky," [...] but rather {{it came from the}} band [...] "exploring different directions and combining our influences." [...] Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said [...] "'Animal', 'Daughter' and 'Blood'... are songs of a kind of ritual passion, tapping into something truly wild."

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Charles to make a funny [...] "dark-themed" [...] episode, using {{elements}} that were unusual in sitcoms. Sets for the episode were built, and Bobbi Jo Lathan was cast as flight attendant Lucy Merrit and Ernie Sabella was cast as gun salesman Mo Korn, who was described in the script as [...] "overweight, greasy, slow and low-key". The table reading of the episode was held on December 12, 1990. Louis-Dreyfus stated, [...] "I read the script and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> 'we're {{not going to do}} this'." [...] According to Alexander, when she read a scene in which she holds the gun to her head stating [...] "where do you want it Jerry? The Kennedy? [...] The McKinley?" [...] (referencing the assassination of the two American presidents), Louis-Dreyfus turned to Alexander, stating [...] "I'm not doing this." [...] Both Alexander and Cherones, who would direct the episode, felt that the gun content in the story was too provocative.

500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, and I brought it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lefèvre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after signing}} a record deal with Lava Records, {{aspiring}} English singer Jessie J commenced {{to work on}} her debut album. She collaborated with songwriters and producers Dr. Luke and Claude Kelly in her first writing session, where [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] was conceived {{with the intention of}} being performed by Jessie J. However, she decided not to record the song, believing it was not edgy enough for her to perform. She explained, [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> this song is amazing, but I don't know if it's me 110 percent, you know. You can kind of feel it." [...] The song reached Cyrus while she was creating an EP with Dr. Luke. The writing team then reworked the lyrics, intending to write an accompanying theme for Cyrus' joint clothing line with Max Azria, exclusively sold in Wal-Mart stores. In order to please audiences, Dr. Luke, Kelly and Jessie J fixated on composing a fun, upbeat song that narrated reflections of Cyrus' personality. [...] "They feel they're buying into a great experience but also buying into the artist," [...] Kelly said of the song's fans. To write his contributions to the song, Kelly said he desired to mimic Cyrus' songwriting: [...] "It's the same song from a different point of view, you just have to find that unique perspective." [...] To record the song's instrumentation, they decided to mingle computerized sound with [...] "the warmth of live instrumentation", using live electric guitars and drums. Cyrus was pleased with the song and selected it partially due to a need of tracks for The Time of Our Lives. This is the first of two collaborations between Dr. Luke and Cyrus. Dr. Luke would later co-produce Cyrus' 2013 smash hit single [...] "Wrecking Ball".|$|E

40|$|The opening {{moments of}} a phone call reveal how a father informs his son, for the 1 st time, that his mom’s tumor is malignant. An {{extended}} phone opening reveals how delaying talk about the mom’s condition allows for important interactional work: Displaying resistance to announce the bad news directly, projecting and anticipat-ing the valence of forthcoming news prior to its announcement, and delicately shar-ing ownership of a serious health condition {{at the outset of}} a family cancer journey. Enacting a biomedical demeanor, replete with technical language and withholdings of emotional and personal reactions, subsequent delivery and reception of the bad news is managed stoically–a normalized resource employed by consequential fig-ures when managing and coping with dreaded news events. By closely examining how family members talk through cancer on the telephone, the scope of health com-munication research is extended beyond clinical settings into home environments, progress is made on the noticeable absence of interactional studies in psycho-oncol-ogy, and diverse implications arise for understanding how lay persons diagnose and manage illness dilemmas.

This album features an array of instruments normally associated with roots music including banjos, dobros and pedal steel guitars.

We were in a certain channel already, and <b>I</b> do <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> if we mixed it organically, and we kept chasing that sound, it probably would sound dated. I wasn’t interested in making a throwback record from the 60's or 70's. I didn’t have any interest in doing that.
