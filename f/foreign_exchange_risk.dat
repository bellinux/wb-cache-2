5|$|The unbiasedness {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} given conditions of rational expectations and risk neutrality, the {{forward exchange rate}} is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Without introducing a <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> premium (due to the assumption of risk neutrality), the following equation illustrates the unbiasedness hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{empirical}} {{rejection of}} the unbiasedness hypothesis is a well-recognized puzzle among finance researchers. Empirical evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and the future spot rate is mixed. Researchers have published papers demonstrating empirical failure of the hypothesis by conducting regression analyses of the realized changes in spot exchange rates on forward premiums and finding negative slope coefficients. These researchers offer numerous rationales for such failure. One rationale centers around the relaxation of risk neutrality, while still assuming rational expectations, such that a <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> premium may exist that can account for differences between the forward rate and the future spot rate.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E

40|$|Our study {{examines}} {{whether there are}} systematic differences in standard leverage determinants for a sample of Japanese multinational (MNCs) and domestic corporations (DCs). We find that on a univariate basis Japanese MNCs differ significantly on most variables relative to Japanese DCs. These variables include leverage, age, collateral value of assets, free cash flows, <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>risks,</b> growth, non-debt tax shields, political risks, profitability and size. Business risks are {{not found to be}} significantly different between the two groups of organizations. When modeling capital structure and the determinants of capital structure we find that Japanese multinationals have significantly less leverage than Japanese DCs, and that multinationality is an important aspect of leverage for Japanese firms. We find that business risks are not significant for modeling capital structure of domestic firms but they are for multinationals and <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>risks</b> are not significant for multinationals but are significant for domestic firms. Business risks are negatively related to leverage for multinationals and we document that significant positive leverage effects of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>risks</b> and size are subsumed by the negative effect of business risks to explain the lower leverage experienced by Japanese multinationals relative to Japanese DCs. The lack of significance of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>risks</b> for DCs can be explained by economies of scale in risk management, such as derivatives. Domestic firms seem to manage increased <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>risks</b> through lower leverage rather than derivative use. On the other hand, the larger multinationals can take advantage of economies of scale in <b>risk</b> management. Consequently, <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>risks</b> of multinationals can be managed through derivatives and other risk management operations and not reduced leverage.

5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E

25|$|One way to {{deal with}} the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> is to engage in a forward transaction. In this transaction, money does not {{actually}} change hands until some agreed upon future date. A buyer and seller agree on an exchange rate for any date in the future, and the transaction occurs on that date, regardless of what the market rates are then. The duration of the trade can be one day, a few days, months or years. Usually the date is decided by both parties. Then the forward contract is negotiated and agreed upon by both parties.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} equation represents covered {{interest rate}} parity, a condition under which investors eliminate exposure to <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) {{with the use}} of a forward contract [...] the exchange rate risk is effectively covered. Under this condition, a domestic investor would earn equal returns from investing in domestic assets or converting currency at the spot exchange rate, investing in foreign currency assets in a country with a different interest rate, and exchanging the foreign currency for domestic currency at the negotiated forward exchange rate. Investors will be indifferent to the interest rates on deposits in these countries due to the equilibrium resulting from the forward exchange rate. The condition allows for no arbitrage opportunities because the return on domestic deposits, 1+id, is equal to the return on foreign deposits, (1+if). If these two returns weren't equalized by the use of a forward contract, there would be a potential arbitrage opportunity in which, for example, an investor could borrow currency in the country with the lower interest rate, convert to the foreign currency at today's spot exchange rate, and invest in the foreign country with the higher interest rate.|$|E

We also ask whether the most informative monetary aggregates include dollar assets. Based on an analysis of five countries, we conclude inter alia that broader aggregates that include dollar assets perform better than those that do not.
