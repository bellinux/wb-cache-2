5|$|After serving {{twelve years}} as a prosecutor, Thorne-Begland was {{nominated}} for an open seat on the General District Court of Richmond in 2012, but the Virginia House of delegates rejected him for the position for <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> advocacy on homosexual issues. The Richmond Circuit Court judges granted him a temporary appointment to the post on June 14, 2012. On January 15, 2013, he was confirmed in the position by both houses of the Virginia General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} a capable passer, Lin has {{established}} himself as a strong, fast-paced offensive player who attacks the basket and excels at the pick-and-roll. He improved his outside shooting from early in his career, and became a threat from three-point range. He has also been considered difficult to defend at times because of his ability to get to the free-throw line. An admitted risk taker, he has been criticized for his tendency to commit turnovers, as well as <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> lack of effectiveness on defense.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{continued}} {{campaigning in}} Iowa and New Hampshire visiting {{up to four}} different cities in one day. Political commentator Bill O'Reilly slammed Dodd after he appeared on The O'Reilly Factor in August, characterizing him as a kool-aid drinker and blind follower of the far left. O'Reilly chastised Dodd and branded him a traitor for <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> betrayal of fellow Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman during the 2006 Senatorial election.|$|E
60|$|The exclamation {{was caused}} by <b>his</b> <b>perceiving</b> {{that some of the}} searchers, having got into the orchard, and begun stooping and {{creeping}} hither and thither, were pausing in the middle, where a tree smaller than the rest was growing. They drew closer, and bent lower than ever upon the ground.|$|R
6000|$|With {{the mention}} of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was {{impossible}} for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, when Cibber first rose to be Rich's right-hand man at Drury Lane, <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> opportunism and brash, thick-skinned personality gave rise to many barbs in print, especially against his patchwork plays. The early attacks were mostly anonymous, but Daniel Defoe and Tom Brown are suggested as potential authors. Later, Jonathan Swift, John Dennis and Henry Fielding all lambasted Cibber in print. The most famous conflict Cibber had was with Alexander Pope.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} his {{athletic}} record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired {{a reputation as a}} clumsy, likable, and simple-minded Everyman. An incident in 1975, when he tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by Chevy Chase, cementing Ford's image as a klutz. Pieces of Ford's common Everyman image have also been attributed to Ford's inevitable comparison to Nixon, as well as <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> Midwestern stodginess and self-deprecation.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Baghdad, Bahá'u'lláh tried to revive the Bábí community, mostly through correspondence, writing {{extensively}} to give the Bábís {{a new understanding of}} the Bábí religion, while keeping <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> station as the one promised by the Báb and a Manifestation of God hidden. He was soon recognized by the Bábís, as well as government authorities, as the foremost Bábí leader, and there was {{a growing number of people}} joining the Bábí movement. He also gained sympathy from government officials and Sunni clerics. Bahá'u'lláh's rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community, gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian government. The Persian government asked the Ottoman government to extradite Bahá'u'lláh to Persia, but the Ottoman government refused and instead chose to move Bahá'u'lláh from the sensitive border region to Constantinople.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I am sure he {{does not}} mean that, Mr. Hawtrey,' Danvers laughed, 'though {{it may be that}} the action is {{expressive}} of a passing doubt in his mind, or rather of <b>his</b> <b>perceiving</b> some point that is unfavourable to the cause he is retained to defend. I hope you have come here to say that you agree with our view in the matter.' ...|$|R
60|$|He paused, {{once more}} engrossed in deep and melancholy thought. After a long interval, he was roused from his {{abstraction}} {{by the sound}} of footsteps on the marble floor. He looked up. The door had been opened without <b>his</b> <b>perceiving</b> it, and an old man was advancing with slow and trembling steps towards his silken couch. It was the bereaved and broken-hearted Numerian.|$|R
5|$|After the {{conflict}} ended, Themistocles continued his pre-eminence among Athenian politicians. However, he aroused the hostility of Sparta by ordering the re-fortification of Athens, and <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> arrogance began to alienate {{him from the}} Athenians. In 472 or 471BC, he was ostracised, and went into exile in Argos. The Spartans now saw an opportunity to destroy Themistocles, and implicated him in the alleged treasonous plot of 478 BC of their own general Pausanias. Themistocles thus fled from Greece. Alexander I of Macedon (reigned 498-454 BC) temporarily gave him sanctuary at Pydna before he traveled to Asia Minor, where he entered {{the service of the}} Persian king Artaxerxes I (reigned 465-424 BC). He was made governor of Magnesia, and lived there {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{at the age}} of thirteen, he {{was allowed}} to enter the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who {{monitored}} Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him. Shostakovich studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev after a year in the class of Elena Rozanova, composition with Maximilian Steinberg, and counterpoint and fugue with Nikolay Sokolov, with whom he became friends. Shostakovich also attended Alexander Ossovsky's history of music classes. Steinberg tried to guide Shostakovich {{in the path of the}} great Russian composers, but was disappointed to see him 'wasting' his talent and imitating Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Shostakovich also suffered for <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> lack of political zeal, and initially failed his exam in Marxist methodology in 1926. His first major musical achievement was the First Symphony (premiered 1926), written as his graduation piece {{at the age of}} nineteen.|$|E
5|$|In May 2016, Pogba {{was named}} by {{national}} side manager Didier Deschamps to France's 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016, {{to be played}} on home soil. Although much was expected of Pogba at the upcoming European Championships, in France's opening match of the tournament, a 2–1 win over Romania on 10 June, he endured criticism for <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> negative performance after being played out of position, and was subsequently left on the bench by Deschamps for his nation's second group match, later coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2–0 win over Albania. In the round of the 16, he was once again the target of media scrutiny for conceding an early penalty against Ireland, prompting former England international Gary Lineker to tweet: “Is Pogba the world’s most overrated player?”; France eventually came from behind to win the match 2–1.|$|E
60|$|Only by {{an almost}} undignified haste, for the vicar was remarkably agile, Sheila managed {{to unlock the}} bedroom door without {{apparently}} <b>his</b> <b>perceiving</b> it, and with a warning finger she preceded him into the great bedroom. 'Oh, yes, yes,' he was whispering to himself; 'alone--well, well!' He hung his hat on his umbrella and leaned it in a corner, and then he turned.|$|R
60|$|She could not, {{even had}} she wished it, easily check her {{progress}} without rendering {{the chance of}} <b>his</b> <b>perceiving</b> her still more certain. But she did not wish any such thing, and it made little difference, for he had already seen her in taking his survey round, and {{came down from the}} door to her side. It was impossible for anything formal to pass between them now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Threaten?" [...] sneered Sakr-el-Bahr. [...] "I prophesy." [...] And on that he turned, {{and stalked}} {{away down the}} gangway to the vessel's waist. There was no purpose in his going other than <b>his</b> <b>perceiving</b> that here {{argument}} were worse than useless, and that the wiser course were to withdraw at once, avoiding it and allowing his veiled threat to work upon the Basha's mind.|$|R
5|$|In addition, Bo placed second-last in the {{confirmation}} vote {{for membership in}} the 15th Central Committee. As he placed in the bottom 5% of candidates, Bo was denied entry into the elite council, suffering a major political embarrassment. Bo's failure to get elected was attributed to a general opposition to nepotism within the Party. Moreover, during his tenure in Dalian, Bo caused resentment for the amount of 'special favours' that he procured for the coastal city {{at the expense of the}} rest of the province. <b>His</b> <b>perceived</b> partisan interests locked Bo's kin in a factional struggle against Li Tieying, one of China's central leadership figures, who may have created obstacles to his promotion.|$|E
5|$|In the pre-war years, Göring enjoyed {{widespread}} personal {{popularity among}} the German public because of <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> sociability, colour and humour. As the Nazi leader {{most responsible for}} economic matters, he presented himself {{as a champion of}} national interests over allegedly corrupt big business and the old German elite. The Nazi press was on Göring's side. Other Nazi leaders, such as Hess and Ribbentrop, were envious of his popularity. Even in the political circles of Britain and the United States, there were those who viewed Göring as more acceptable than the other Nazis, and as a possible mediator between the western democracies and Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Three {{successful}} seasons followed, with Messi winning {{three consecutive}} FIFA Ballons d'Or, including an unprecedented fourth. His personal best campaign statistically to date was the 2011–12 season, {{in which he}} set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer in official competitions in March 2012. He again struggled with injury during the following two seasons, twice finishing second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> career rival. Messi regained his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, breaking the all-time goalscoring records in both La Liga and the Champions League in November 2014, and led Barcelona to a historic second treble.|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} the novelty of his own situation, and every painful feeling {{connected}} with it, Halbert felt his curiosity interested in the female, who sate by the chimney unnoticed and unregarded.

5|$|A leading {{member of}} the Yorkshire team which {{achieved}} {{a high level of}} success in the time he played, Macaulay was a volatile character who played aggressively. He left a job at a bank to become a professional cricketer, making his first-class debut aged 23 as a fast bowler. Meeting limited success, he altered style to deliver off spin in addition to his pace bowling. This proved so effective that he was chosen to play for England in Test matches. However, <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> poor attitude towards the game, and an unsuccessful match in the 1926 Ashes probably prevented him playing more Tests. His form slumped following injuries in the late 1920s, but a recovery in the early 1930s led to a recall by England, although he broke down in his second match back. Another injury in 1934 made cricket difficult for him and his first-class career ended in 1935, although he continued playing club cricket until the Second World War. A pilot officer in the Royal Air Force, he died of pneumonia on active service in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|At the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children, Bart feels out {{of place}} among the other {{students}} with advanced academic skills. Meanwhile, Marge attempts to stimulate Bart with a little culture by taking the family to the opera. However, this proves disastrous as Bart and Homer are quite disruptive, much to Lisa's joy. Ostracized by his brilliant classmates, Bart visits his former school, where his old friends reject him because of <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> intelligence. On the bright side, he enjoys newfound attention from Homer and he covers for them when Marge makes another attempt to stimulate Bart's brain by taking them to a film festival. After Bart's chemistry experiment explodes, filling the school lab with green goo, he confesses to Dr. Pryor that he switched tests with Martin. Dr. Pryor realizes that he was never a genius and has him readmitted to Springfield Elementary.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} four months of his premiership, Brown enjoyed a {{substantial}} lead in the polls. His popularity amongst the public may have been because his handling of numerous serious events during his first few weeks as Prime Minister, including two attempted terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow at the end of June 2007. However, between the end of 2007 and September 2008, his popularity fell significantly; two contributing factors were believed to be <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> change of mind over plans to call a general election in October 2007 and his handling of the 10p tax rate cut in 2008, which led to allegations of weakness and dithering. His unpopularity led eight Labour MPs to call for a leadership contest in September 2008, less than 15 months into his premiership. The threat of a leadership contest receded due to <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> strong handling of the global financial crisis in October, but his popularity hit an all-time low and his position became increasingly untenable after the May 2009 expenses scandal and Labour's poor results in the 2009 Local and European elections. Brown's cabinet began to rebel; there were several key resignations in the run up to local elections in June 2009. However, Brown was backed by his party. He faced a second attempt to launch a leadership challenge by former Cabinet colleagues Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt in January 2010, but the plot failed to gather momentum and Brown remained as both Labour leader and Prime Minister to lead his party into the 2010 General Election. The election resulted in a hung parliament, with the Conservative Party winning the largest number of seats. Brown remained as Prime Minister while the Liberal Democrats entered separate negotiations with Labour and the Conservatives with a view to forming a coalition government. He announced his intention to resign on 10 May 2010 to help broker a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. However, this became increasingly unlikely and on 11 May, Brown announced his resignation as Prime Minister and as Leader of the Labour Party.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} before Abraham Lincoln took office, parties in the seceding states {{disagreed}} over the proper course of action concerning the forts within their domains. In Florida, three forts remained {{in the possession of}} the United States Army: Fort Zachary Taylor at Key West, Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas, and Fort Pickens near Pensacola. Some of the most strident secessionists proposed that they be taken over immediately, by force if needed, beginning with Fort Pickens. Cooler heads hoped to avoid bloodshed and gain possession by negotiation; they made much of the conciliatory words of William H. Seward, already selected to be Secretary of State in the incoming administration. Mallory and Florida's other Senator, David L. Yulee, and the two Senators from Alabama sent telegrams to their respective governors urging caution. Other Southern Senators lent their support, and President-elect Jefferson Davis seemed to agree. In the end, the moderates won out, and no attack was made on Fort Pickens. Although Mallory was hardly alone, his political opponents later used <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> pro-Union stance as an excuse to attack him.|$|E
5|$|Judge Kevin McNulty {{heard the}} case on remand. After {{considering}} the parties' motions for summary judgment again, he ruled in the city's favor in 2014. Heffernan, he ruled, had not engaged in any protected speech or expressive conduct. Judge McNulty also ruled that Heffernan could not prevail on claims that <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> speech was protected, per Ambrose v. Robinson Township, a previous case on that issue in the Third Circuit, or that his actions were protected since they aided and abetted speech. Judge McNulty also rejected similar claims for freedom of association. He decided that Dye v. Office of the Racing Commission, {{a case in which}} the Sixth Circuit had held that the First Amendment reached perceived political association, was not a precedent he could rely on since Dye itself explicitly rejected Ambrose, and as a district judge he could not reject circuit precedent.|$|E
5|$|The more skin left {{unarmoured}} and exposed, {{the lower}} a gladiator's {{status and the}} greater <b>his</b> <b>perceived</b> effeminacy. Likewise, the engulfing net may {{have been seen as}} a feminine symbol. The light arms and armour of the retiarius thus established him as the lowliest, most disgraced, and most effeminate of the gladiator types. Helmets allowed both gladiators and spectators to dehumanise the fighters; when an arena combatant had to kill a comrade-at-arms, someone he probably lived and trained with every day, his opponent's helmet added an extra layer of separation. However, the retiarius was allowed no head protection; his face was visible to all. The emperor Claudius had all net-fighters who lost in combat put to death so that spectators could enjoy their expressions of agony. The retiariuss fighting style was another strike against him, as reliance on speed and evasion were viewed as undignified in comparison to the straightforward trading of blows. The retiarii lived in the worst barracks. Some members of the class trained to fight as Samnites, another gladiator type, in order to improve their status.|$|E
