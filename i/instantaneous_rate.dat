40|$|We have {{developed}} a procedure for preparing monodispersed, fluorescently labeled bacteria (FLB), which {{may be used to}} measure virtually <b>instantaneous</b> <b>rates</b> of protozoan bacterivory in natural waters. FLB can be prepared both from natural bacterioplankton assemblages and from clonal isolates and can be stored in frozen suspension or freeze-dried without apparent loss of fluorescence intensity. They are not toxic to protozoa and can be metabolized to support bacterivorous protozoan growth rates equal to those on the same strain of unstained, viable bacteria. In experiments comparing uptake of FLB with uptake of fluorescent latex microspheres by protozoan assemblages in a salt marsh tidal creek, we found that both pelagic oligotrichous ciliates and phagotrophic flagellates ingested FLB with a frequency 4 - to 10 -fold greater than they ingested the microspheres. Consequently, it appears that the use of latex microspheres leads to underestimation of protozoan bacterivory and that the FLB technique is superior for estimating <b>instantaneous</b> <b>rates</b> of in situ protozoan grazing on bacterioplankton...|$|R

Auditory {{pattern recognition}} by the CNS is a fundamental process in acoustic communication. Because crickets communicate with stereotyped patterns of constant frequency syllables, they are established models to investigate the neuronal mechanisms of auditory pattern recognition. Here we provide evidence that for the neural processing of amplitude-modulated sounds, the <b>instantaneous</b> spike <b>rate</b> rather than the time-averaged neural activity is the appropriate coding principle by comparing both coding parameters in a thoracic interneuron (Omega neuron ON 1) of the cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) auditory system. When stimulated with different temporal sound patterns, {{the analysis of the}} <b>instantaneous</b> spike <b>rate</b> demonstrates that the neuron acts as a low-pass filter for syllable patterns. The <b>instantaneous</b> spike <b>rate</b> is low at high syllable rates, but prominent peaks in the <b>instantaneous</b> spike <b>rate</b> are generated as the syllable rate resembles that of the species-specific pattern. The occurrence and repetition rate of these peaks in the neuronal discharge are sufficient to explain temporal filtering in the cricket auditory pathway as they closely match the tuning of phonotactic behavior to different sound patterns.
