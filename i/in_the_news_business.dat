50|$|In 1951 and 1952, most American {{households}} did {{not have}} television receivers, and ABC was a distinctly minor network compared to NBC and CBS, so After the Deadlines was not a major factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overall <b>news</b> <b>business,</b> and <b>the</b> identity of the anchor or anchors of After the Deadlines may be lost to history.|$|R

50|$|TXN was a money-losing proposition. In mid-June 2000, it restructured, {{cutting a}} third of its 120 staffers.

40|$|In 1998, Reuters {{committed}} resources to exploring {{the use of}} XML (Extensible Markup Language) {{as the foundation for}} their next-generation news content management system. This was in response to changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> industry <b>business</b> model resulting from changing value webs and content delivery methods. The result was ReutersNewsML, an XML vocabulary for "wrapping " news content items from multiple sources into a single package. In 1999 Reuters submitted the concept to the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC), which managed the development of the NewsML specification. NewsML was ratified as an IPTC standard for <b>the</b> entire global <b>news</b> media industry in 2000. This paper explores the development of NewsML as an illustration of how XML standards can be exploited within complex business webs...|$|R

5000|$|The Guardian {{gave the}} {{documentary}} {{three out of}} five stars. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote: [...] "The film... has a maddeningly short attention span, delving just far enough into one subject to whet your appetite before flitting on to the next. That approach extends to a secondary theme: whether the pot beat is just a gimmick, a desperate effort to attract attention and readers. That possibility is raised but never really examined... So the two most likely audiences for this documentary — people interested in marijuana and people interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>business</b> — will probably find it shallower than they’d hoped. It's full of discussion points but lets them go by undiscussed." ...|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after Viewtron's launch, Vice President Reid Ashe {{circulated}} a memo noting {{slower than}} expected sales and infrequent usage patterns. The memo drew {{the conclusion that}} people saw the service as a [...] "toy" [...] and weren't integrating Viewtron into their daily news routine. A [...] statement in the memo discussed {{the differences between the}} newspaper business and online information delivery, noting the latter's lower cost of entry, lower profit margins, and likely increased competition. The act of crossing out this statement has been taken as a sign of Knight Ridder's unwillingness to recognize the changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>business</b> that new technology was bringing and called into question Knight Ridder's intentions for Viewtron.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{noticeable}} downturn <b>in</b> print advertising {{indicates a}} need for change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> industry <b>business</b> model. College media is not immune to this decline and need for change. A change in business model calls for transitioning to an alternative system that does not primarily rely on print products and advertising — a digitally focused business model. Many college media organizations around the United States have started to pursue this type of model, changing the way they produce and present <b>news</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. Taking into account the state of print focused business models <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general and collegiate news industry and what some college media organizations have done to transition to a digitally focused business model, this study presents best practices for college media attempting to make this change in their own organizations...|$|R

[...] While {{covering the}} election, he expressed his opinion that Fox News was unfairly criticized by people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>business</b> (including some at CNN), saying: [...] "It’s been a crutch CNN staffers to say that Fox has done well due to the ideology. It’s an easy out to say, 'Oh, we’re not picking sides and that’s why we don’t have an audience.'" ...|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> 1977, <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>news</b> {{block was}} {{gradually}} eliminated, making {{way for the}} addition of a few more second-hand classic sitcoms. It also phased out English dubs of Japanese programs. By this time, the station had evolved into a more conventional general entertainment independent, but its viewership was far behind that of established independent KPLR-TV (channel 11), as KDNL's big disadvantage that at the time was it was the only UHF station in St. Louis.|$|R
