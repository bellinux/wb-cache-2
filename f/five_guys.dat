25|$|Frying French fries in beef tallow, lard, {{or other}} animal fats adds {{saturated}} fat to the diet. Replacing animal fats with tropical vegetable oils, such as palm oil, simply substitutes one saturated fat for another. Replacing animal fats with partially hydrogenated oil reduces cholesterol but adds trans fat, {{which has been}} shown to both raise LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol. Canola/Rapeseed oil, or sunflower-seed oil are also used, as are mixes of vegetable oils, but beef tallow is generally more popular, especially amongst fast food outlets that use communal oil baths. Accordingly, many restaurants now advertise their use of unsaturated oils; for example, both <b>Five</b> <b>Guys</b> and Chick-fil-A advertise that their fries are prepared with peanut oil.|$|E

He {{believes}} that an actor with a [...] "proven track record" [...] would likely have been chosen if another network had broadcast the show. He went through numerous auditions; each time he explained to the casting directors what he could bring to the character, if given the part. Alan Taylor and Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner initially thought Hamm was too handsome for the role but ultimately decided, [...] "it was perfect to cast sort of the perfect male in this part".
