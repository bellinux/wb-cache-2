5|$|Lawrencium is {{the final}} member of the {{actinide}} series and is sometimes {{considered to be a}} group 3 element, along with scandium, yttrium, and lutetium, as its filled f-shell is expected to make it resemble the 7th-period transition metals. In the periodic table, it is located {{to the right of the}} actinide nobelium, to the left of the 6d transition metal rutherfordium, and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties. Lawrencium is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.58), similar to its lighter congener lutetium, though this is not yet known experimentally. The enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352kJ·mol−1, close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 6d electrons delocalized, a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of vaporization, bulk modulus, and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium. Specifically, lawrencium is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> trivalent, silvery metal, easily oxidized by air, steam, and acids, and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent metallic radius of 171pm. It is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rather heavy metal with a density of around 15.6 to 16.6g·cm−3. It is also predicted to have a melting point of around 1900K (1627°C), not far from the value for lutetium (1925K).|$|E

An August 2010 poll showed that 70 {{percent of the country}} supports NATO membership, but results were very different in the two constituent entities. While 90 percent of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina supported NATO membership, only 33 percent in Republika Srpska did.|$|E

5|$|An early {{plan for}} STS-8, {{released}} in April 1982, had scheduled it for July 1983. It was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> three-day mission with four crew members, and would launch INSAT-1-B, an Indian satellite, and TDRS-B, a NASA communications relay satellite. However, following {{problems with the}} Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) used to deploy TDRS-A on the STS-6 mission, it was announced in May 1983 that the TDRS {{was not going to}} be flown. It was replaced in the manifest by the Payload Flight Test Article. After re-development of the IUS, TDRS-B was eventually re-manifested for the STS-51-L mission, and was lost along with the Space Shuttle Challenger and its crew when the launch failed in January 1986.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> solid {{under normal}} {{conditions}} and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.62), similar to its lighter congener rhenium. It {{should be a}} very heavy metal with a density of around 37.1g/cm3, {{which would be the}} third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only meitnerium (37.4g/cm3) and hassium (41g/cm3), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} game, Arizona and Nevada {{were two of}} the top offenses in the country, ranking 7th and 10th in yards per game respectively. There was also {{significant}} hype surrounding the game because it featured two of the best running backs in the country, Ka'Deem Carey for Arizona, and Stefphon Jefferson for Nevada. Carey was ranked number one in the country in total rushing yards, while Jefferson was ranked number two. The duo were also prolific scorers; Jefferson was second in the country in rushing touchdowns with 25 and Carey was third with 24. The game was widely <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> shoot-out, as both teams were in the top-20 scoring offenses in the regular season.|$|E

5|$|Darmstadtium is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> solid {{under normal}} {{conditions}} and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, {{because it is}} expected to have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|Dave Pear, the Buccaneers' first Pro Bowl {{selection}} and most popular player, {{was traded to}} the Oakland Raiders for two draft picks.

Dave Green, the punter and kicker through the first three seasons, had to be replaced when he tore his achilles tendon stepping over a tackling dummy in training camp.|$|E
5|$|From {{as early}} as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{distinguished}} war leader, and was depicted with trophy heads hanging from his belt.

The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books.|$|E

5|$|In August 2017, the Sounds and Nashville SC, an {{expansion}} soccer {{team of the}} United Soccer League, reached a one-year agreement for Nashville SC to play its inaugural 2018 season at First Tennessee Park.

If the city was to be awarded an MLS team, First Tennessee Park {{would not be a}} viable location as the league requires soccer-specific stadiums for new franchises. Instead, the team would play at a new stadium, such as the 30,000-seat facility proposed for the Nashville Fairgrounds. Nashville SC is expected to play its first home game as early as March 2018.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element. Hassium {{is a member of}} the 7th period and belongs to the group 8 elements: it is thus the sixth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that hassium behaves as the heavier homologue to osmium in group 8. The chemical properties of hassium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 8 elements. In bulk quantities, hassium is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> silvery metal that reacts readily with oxygen in the air, forming a volatile tetroxide.|$|E
5|$|In {{the solid}} state, flerovium is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> dense metal {{due to its}} high atomic weight, with a density {{variously}} predicted to be either 22g·cm−3 or 14g·cm−3. The electron of the hydrogen-like flerovium ion (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Fl113+) is expected to move so fast {{that it has a}} mass 1.79 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like lead and tin are expected to be 1.25 and 1.073 respectively. Flerovium would form weaker metal–metal bonds than lead and would be adsorbed less on surfaces.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by Super Mario 64, {{the team}} {{set out to}} create a 3D game that {{ultimately}} exceeded {{the capabilities of the}} platform.

Upon the commercial failure of the 64DD, the game was converted to the cartridge-only format. Itoi developed the game's concept during Mother 2 development and built a 12-chapter story with player-characters that rotated between chapters.

5|$|Meitnerium is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> solid {{under normal}} {{conditions}} and assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure, similarly to its lighter congener iridium.
