5|$|The first {{performance}} of Falstaff was at La Scala in Milan on 9 February 1893, nearly {{six years after}} Verdi's previous premiere. For the first night, official ticket prices were thirty times greater than usual. Royalty, aristocracy, critics and leading figures from the arts all over Europe were present. The performance was a huge success under the baton of Edoardo Mascheroni; numbers were encored, {{and at the end}} the applause for Verdi and the cast lasted an <b>hour.</b> <b>That</b> was followed by a tumultuous welcome when the composer, his wife and Boito arrived at the Grand Hotel de Milan.|$|E

Twelve eventually came ahead of the peloton, with seven in the lead and five chasing between the leaders and the peloton. The third group on the road eventually dwindled to a select contingent of overall favorites, which included race leader Danilo Di Luca. Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this group on the day's first climb and got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points on it and on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification {{at the end of}} the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.|$|E

Zorrino is saved from harm when Tintin gives him Huascar's medallion, but Tintin and Haddock are sentenced to death by the Inca prince for their sacrilegious intrusion.

5|$|The {{second session}} started several minutes late {{due to the}} damp {{conditions}} from the earlier rain.

In GT1 the No. 008 Larbre Aston Martin took the class lead on the final lap with a 3:50.761. The LMP2 and GT2 classes saw very little improvement; the class leading teams remained the same.|$|E

5|$|Through {{the night}} to the morning of September 22, Eisenhower and Nixon aides {{arranged}} the speech. The RNC worked to raise the $75,000 needed to buy the half hour of television time, while the Eisenhower staff secured sixty NBC stations to telecast the speech, with radio coverage from CBS and Mutual. The Nixon staff initially advocated a half <b>hour</b> <b>that</b> evening, Monday, September 22, to follow the immensely popular I Love Lucy show, but when the candidate indicated {{he could not be}} ready that soon, settled for 6:30pm Tuesday night, 9:30pm in the East, following the almost equally popular Texaco Star Theater, starring Milton Berle. The campaign arranged to use the El Capitan Theatre, in Hollywood, where several NBC variety shows were then broadcast, since its lighting was superior to that of NBC Studios. Nixon told the press that he would be addressing the nation on television, but refused to take any questions about what he might say.|$|E
5|$|With Canadian {{industry}} reorganized {{to supply}} the British war effort, Howe decided he needed to journey to Britain to discuss matters with the customers. He embarked on the S.S. Western Prince in December 1940. This was an intensely dangerous trip; Germany was attempting to blockade Britain {{and there were many}} German submarines in the North Atlantic. One of those submarines sank the Western Prince on 14 December. Howe survived the sinking and eight hours in a lifeboat. Gordon Scott, his aide, was killed trying to climb from the lifeboat to the rescuing ship. Howe professed coolness in the incident, but later told the Manchester Guardian that he considered every <b>hour</b> <b>that</b> he lived from that day onwards to be borrowed time.|$|E

25|$|The English Catholic exiles {{eventually}} {{split into}} two parties, the one, called the Spanish faction, supporting {{the claims of the}} Infanta of Spain to the English crown, while the other, denominated the Scottish faction, advocated the right of James VI of Scotland. Paget was the acknowledged head of the Scottish faction, and in 1599 he threw up his employment under the King of Spain, and returned to Paris. Among the State Papers is a letter from a Catholic in Brussels to his friend, a monk at Liege, giving a detailed account of Paget and his 'practices'. The writer says that from the first <b>hour</b> <b>that</b> his years permitted him to converse with men, he has been tampering in broils and practices, betwixt friend and friend, man and wife, and, as his credit and craft increase, betwixt prince and prince.|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{studies the}} relation between the well-being of fathers and the number of <b>hours</b> <b>that</b> their wives work outside the home. Two groups of fathers were involved in the investigation: the modern, caring fathers, and the more traditional fathers, who are often in full-time employment outside the home. It would appear to be true for both groups that the amount of hours their wives work, correlates negatively with the well-being of fathers both physically and mentally. Two hypotheses were compared: does the well-being of fathers correlate mainly with the actual absence of the wife, measured by the absolute number of <b>hours</b> <b>that</b> she works? Or does it correlate more with ‘symbolic’ factors, measured by her relative share in the family income or the relative number of <b>hours</b> <b>that</b> she works (her working hours compared with his). Confirmation was found for both hypotheses, but the unfulfilled husband hypothesis had the most support. Financial factors play a rather less important role. Finally, it must be observed that the number of <b>hours</b> <b>that</b> men themselves work still has a positive correlation with their well-being...|$|R

25|$|At {{an early}} date mystical {{reasons for the}} {{division}} of the day were sought. St. Cyprian sees in the hours of Terce, Sext and Nones, which come after a lapse of three hours, an allusion to the Trinity. He adds that these hours already consecrated to prayer under the Old Dispensation have been sanctified in the New Testament by great mysteriesTerce by the descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles; Sext by the prayers of St. Peter, the reception of the Gentiles into the Church, or yet again by the crucifixion of Christ; Nones by the death of Christ. St. Basil merely recalls that it was at the ninth <b>hour</b> <b>that</b> the Apostles Peter and John were wont to go to the Temple to pray. St. John Cassian, who adopts the Cyprian interpretation for Terce and Sext, sees in the Hour of Nones the descent of Christ into hell. But, as a rule, it is the death of Christ that is commemorated at the Hour of Nones.|$|E
