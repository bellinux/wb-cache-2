The Garter is a buckled dark-blue (originally light-blue) velvet strap, and bears the motto in gold letters. The garters of Stranger Knights and Ladies were once set with several jewels. Two styles have been used: one is a working garter where the end slips through the buckle and then <b>is</b> <b>tucked</b> in a specific way and the other style is a 'pre-made' one that has the buckled and tucked end pre-fashioned and is fastened with a clip attachment.|$|E

25|$|Somers {{is perhaps}} best known for its yacht club and sailing facilities. The waters {{offshore}} from Somers, neighbouring Balnarring and Merricks Beaches, Flinders and Shoreham, and the body of water between the Mornington Peninsula and Philip Island {{are some of the most}} ideal and safest regions for sailing of all types in Australia. On most days many sailboats, mainly catamarans, can be seen in the waters of Western Port Bay participating in several races that are held during good sailing conditions, usually on weekends. The tidal inlet of Merricks Creek at low tide is one of the best places around Melbourne and the Mornington Peninsula for skiffle boarding, while the South Beach (actually to the east of the main beach) <b>is</b> <b>tucked</b> away behind the belt of foreshore bushland that is Somers Foreshore Reserve, and is enjoyed mainly by local residents, while the main beach, Somers Beach, is home to one of the major yacht clubs in Western Port, Somers Yacht Club. Walking is also popular in Somers as good quality sealed and unsealed pathways exist along roadsides and in parklands, where walkers enjoy native bush land, wildlife and views of Western Port.|$|E

500|$|Within the Dvorak {{satellite}} strength {{estimate for}} tropical cyclones, {{there are several}} visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define {{the upper and lower}} bounds on its intensity.

500|$|Also in The Daily Telegraph, Ed West {{gave the}} book a {{favourable}} review, writing [...] "Sentimentality, in which crude emotion replaces dispassionate analysis, affects {{all aspects of}} public life, such as the debates over education, prison places and overseas aid. As Dalrymple points out, no country has ever escaped poverty via international aid—but never mind, since what matters is not actually doing anything about state education or crime or Africa, but being seen to be caring about the 'vulnerable'". [...] The book was listed as a non-fiction choice by Steven Poole in The Guardian, who wrote, [...] "Dalrymple alternates vague ranting with surgical demolition (he is excellent on the fatuity of 'family impact statements' in court), and exhibits impressive thrift, in these uncertain times, with his research, getting tens of pages out of a single visit to WHSmith and the purchase of two newspapers. Perhaps the most suggestive sentence <b>is</b> <b>tucked</b> away in an endnote about tattoos: 'I wish I had the space to elaborate on the dermatological semiotics of violence in England'.

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910. It states: [...] "Marie is the tiny daughter of a well to do farmer. On Halloween her father, to amuse her, picks a pumpkin that she selects, and fashions a jack-o-lantern out of it. Her new toy pleases the child immensely, and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her dollie. So it is natural {{that she should be}} thinking about the two of them when she <b>is</b> <b>tucked</b> into bed and falls asleep. Perhaps that was why the queen of the fairies came to her and invited her to a Halloween party that her loyal subjects were giving in their woodland retreat. And so that Marie would be perfectly happy, not feel embarrassed among strangers, the queen asked Dollie and Pumpkin to be her guests also. And, as a further mark of favor, she waved her hand, and Dollie and Pumpkin could run around and talk as well as Marie could. It certainly made it more enjoyable for the little girl. A fairy Halloween party is one of the finest things going in the amusement line, and only very nice and very good little girls are invited to them. As Marie filled these requirements, she had a perfectly glorious time, but was inclined to weep when she woke up later in her own little bed, and found that her toys had lost their miraculous gift of life. But it consoled her somewhat to have them, for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening. And perhaps the fairies will ask her to attend another party later. If they do, she has decided that Pumpkin and Dollie must have their shares of the good times as before." ...|$|E
