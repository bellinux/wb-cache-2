40|$|Environmental {{impacts of}} {{airports}} {{are similar to}} those of many industries, though their operations expand over a very large area. Most international impact assessment studies and environmental management programmes have been giving less focus on the impacts to soil and groundwater than desirable. This may be the result of the large attention given to air and noise pollution, relegating other environmental descriptors to a second role, even when the first are comparatively less relevant. One reason that contributes to such ‘‘biased’’ evaluation is the lack of systematic information about impacts to soil and groundwater from airport activities, something the present study intends to help correct. Results presented here include the review of over seven hundred documents and online databases, with the objective of obtaining the following information to support environmental studies: (i) which operations are responsible for chemical releases?; (ii) where are these releases located?; (iii) which contaminants of concern are released?; (iv) what are the associated environmental risks?

40|$|AbstractThe {{variability}} of flow regimes in on demand pressurized irrigation systems induces uncertainty in pressure {{head at the}} <b>hydrants</b> affecting the <b>system</b> hydraulic performance. However, the on-farm networks operating downstream are designed for a fixed upstream pressure head that usually corresponds to their best achievable performance. Based on these considerations, an on demand irrigation system was optimized using the Reliability based model accounting for the {{variability of}} flow regimes, the minimization of cost and the maximization of the reliability, and {{the interaction between the}} variability at hydrant level and the uniformity of on farm sprinkler systems operating downstream was analyzed. The analysis shows that on farm uniformity strongly varies in space and time and low uniformity levels were achieved despite the consideration of the reliability of the on demand distribution network during the optimization process, which may have drastic effects on crop yield. This study clearly shows that accounting for the interaction between the distribution system and the on farm irrigation network is a must in the modernization/rehabilitation processes, often promoted as tools to produce more agriculture goods with less water input at moderate investments and operational costs...|$|R

The company passed to Polk & Hubbell, and in 1880 to a joint-stock company, where a stockholder-elected board of five directors appointed a president, secretary, and one member, with the exclusive rights to operate the company for 40 years. The Water Company was built on Walnut Street in Des Moines using Holly <b>system</b> <b>hydrants,</b> which could throw six streams at a time. The city demanded 10 miles of pipe within 10 months and [...] "hydrants were placed for citizens or passersby to draw water for purposes of drinking". Pumps discharged about 2 million gallons per day (mgd). In its first year from June 1872 through June 1873, the Water Works´ operating costs were $5,770 and consumers paid no city taxes for water use.Water came from an iron filtering tank in the gravel and sand of the Raccoon River near the water’s edge, 12 feet in diameter and 14 feet high, open {{at the bottom and}} closed at the top with perforations to let water in. The iron filters constantly plugged and after 10 years, in 1883, an infiltration gallery system to use groundwater along the river was planned, {{the first of its kind}} in the U.S. From 1884-1885, 750 feet of a wooden gallery were constructed, and the iron filters were abolished. A small primitive dam on the Raccoon River increased the water level near the gallery. In 1880, the name was changed to Des Moines Water Works Company. In 1891, the first water tower was constructed, holding 530,000 gallons of water, used until 1931, and torn down in 1939.|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{previous}} studies have modelled the impact of climate change on crop water requirements and hence future water resource needs for irrigated agriculture. Fewer have considered the impacts {{on the performance of}} irrigation systems and the required engineering and managerial adaptations. This study considers the impacts and adaptations for a typical pressurized pipe irrigation system. The dry years of the baseline period (1970 - 90) {{in the southern part of}} Italy are expected to become the average or even wet year by the 2050 s, according to HadCM 3 projections. Under these conditions, the large water distribution systems designed to satisfy the baseline dry years will fail unless appropriate engineering or managerial adaptations are made. The resilience of District 8 of the Sinistra Ofanto to the possible future increase in irrigation demand has been assessed. A stochastic weather generator was used to generate future weather under the IPCC A 1 and B 1 emissions scenarios, taking into consideration the outputs of the HadCM 3 model. A daily water balance model was used to quantify the actual and future peak water demand of the district. The reliability of each hydrant under baseline and future demand was calculated using a stochastic hydraulic model and the failure zones identified. Under the current design, the system can tolerate a peak demand discharge up to 1, 500 l. s (- 1), which is below the 2050 s' average (1, 720 l. s(- 1)). Above that value, the performance of the system will fall drastically as the number of unreliable hydrants will increase. In the future, assuming the same cropping pattern, the threshold discharge (1, 500 l. s(- 1)) will be exceeded 80 % of the time and, as an average, 20 % of the <b>system's</b> <b>hydrants</b> will be failing during the peak demand periods.
