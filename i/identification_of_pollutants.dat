We present a case study where GSA-QHTS allowed for the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the main pharmaceutical pollutants (and their interactions), driving biological effects of low-dose complex mixtures at the microbial population level.

This paper {{presents}} a framework for identifying pollutants to be included in a cumulative risk assessment approach. To account for the possibility of simultaneous exposure to chemicals with common toxic modes of action, the first step of the traditional risk assessment process, i. e. hazard identification, is structured in three sub-steps: (1 a) <b>Identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> people {{are exposed to}}, (1 b) identification of effects and mechanisms of action of these pollutants, (1 c) grouping of pollutants according to similarity of their mechanism of action and health effects. Based on this exposure-based grouping we can derive "multi-pollutant" toxicity reference values, in the "dose-response assessment" step. The approach proposed in this work is original in that it is based on real exposures instead of a limited number of pollutants from a unique chemical family, as traditionally performed. This framework is illustrated by the case study of semi-volatile organic compounds in French dwellings, providing insights into practical considerations regarding the accuracy of the available toxicological information. This case study illustrates the value of the exposure-based approach as opposed to the traditional cumulative framework, in which chemicals with similar health effects were not always included in the same chemical class...|$|E

40|$|Background: This paper {{describes}} {{a conceptual framework}} for solutions-focused management of chemical contaminants built on novel and systematic approaches for identifying, quantifying and reducing risks of these substances. Methods: The conceptual framework was developed in interaction with stakeholders representing relevant authorities and organisations responsible for managing environmental quality of water bodies. Stakeholder needs were compiled via a survey and dialogue. The content of the conceptual framework was thereafter developed with inputs from relevant scientific disciplines. Results: The conceptual framework consists of four access points: Chemicals, Environment, Abatement and Society, representing different aspects and approaches to engaging in the issue of chemical contamination of surface waters. It widens the scope for assessment and management of chemicals in comparison to a traditional (mostly) perchemical risk assessment approaches by including abatement- and societal approaches as optional solutions. The solution-focused approach implies an identification of abatement- and policy options upfront in the risk assessment process. The conceptual framework was designed for use in current and future chemical pollution assessments for the aquatic environment, including the specific challenges encountered in prioritising individual chemicals and mixtures, and is applicable {{for the development of}} approaches for safe chemical management in a broader sense. The four access points of the conceptual framework are interlinked by four key topics representing the main scientific challenges that need to be addressed, i. e. : identifying and prioritising hazardous chemicals at different scales; selecting relevant and efficient abatement options; providing regulatory support for chemicals management; predicting and prioritising future chemical risks. The conceptual framework aligns current challenges in the safe production and use of chemicals. The current state of knowledge and implementation of these challenges is described. Conclusions: The use of the conceptual framework, and addressing the challenges, is intended to support: (1) forwarding sustainable use of chemicals, (2) <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> of priority concern for cost-effective management, (3) the selection of optimal abatement options and (4) the development and use of optimised legal and policy instruments...|$|E
40|$|The {{understanding}} of the source <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> is of great interest in environmental studies today due to the health impact caused by airborne pollutants (SO 2, NO, NO 2, CO and RSPs, etc). A study of concentrations of SO 2 and RSP has been performed in Hong Kong. The work reported here develops an improved circular pollution wind map, and combines with both the principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques to analyze the pollutant data recorded in 14 air quality monitor stations from 2000 to 2002 using hourly winds measured at Tap Shek Kok (TSK). The variations of SO 2 over Hong Kong were discussed {{from the standpoint of}} monthly variations, inter-annual variabilities and spatial distributions and wind effects. The PCA result is able to identify two dominant modes of SO 2 variations. The first mode is associated with weak southerlies and southwesterlies, and is localized around the Kowloon peninsula. This may be a consequence of the surrounding complex terrain. Analysis of speciated PM 10 data shows that this mode is associated with local SO 2 emissions by residual oil combustion from marine sources at or near the container terminal in Kwan Chung (KC). The second mode is associated with moderate to strong northwesterlies, and is affected most of the area in Hong Kong. Analysis of speciated PM 10 data suggests that this mode is associated with a mixture of various sources, and mainly related to the regional transport from the northwest. In addition, the proportion of the total SO 2 concentrations contributed by each of the source regions was quantitatively estimated by SVD. It is found that residual oil combustion from marine vessels at or near Kwai Chung terminal container port and power plant are responsible for 36 % and 7 % of the total SO 2 concentrations in the urban air of Hong Kong, respectively. It means that the contribution of marine sources from container port is five times more than power plants. We also find that the seasonal variation of element carbon in PM 10 species is high in summer and low in winter from the container port, which helps us further understand its characteristics over Hong Kong...|$|E

Fe, Pb, Zn, Mn, and Cu may be considered of contaminated soil origin, while As, Ni, Cd, and Cr are very much enriched with respect to contaminated soil, indicating another possible source attributed to the adjacent industrial plants...|$|R
30|$|The NORMAN WG on EDA {{identified}} several gaps that hamper the broad and successful application of EDA for the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> new toxicants in the environment. These gaps include a comprehensive compilation of tools and approaches in EDA for scientists and practitioners, a common mass spectra database particularly for LC-MS/MS data, and interdisciplinary-trained young {{scientists in the}} field of EDA. Thus, the first major contributions of the NORMAN EDA WG to close these gaps were: (i) the publication of a handbook on EDA providing an overview of important approaches and techniques to relate observed effects to causing chemicals[13], (ii) the creation of NORMAN MassBank as a tool to support the analytical <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> emerging <b>pollutants</b> all over Europe, and (iii) the launch of a new Marie Curie Action – Initial Training Network (ITN) called EDA-EMERGE, with 14 partners all over Europe.|$|R
40|$|Biomonitoring <b>of</b> air <b>pollutants</b> by {{moss and}} lichen transplants {{has been widely}} used over the past years, {{especially}} to monitor trace elements, since it gives useful information on their deposition, particularly in those urban and industrial areas lacking of indigenous moss and lichen species. Moreover, this technique provides information on contaminants associated to airborne particles which in European urban areas are not routinely checked, hindering the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> sources crucial to undertake effective policies to knock down air pollutants. Nevertheless, the current lack of standardization at international level, and the scarce knowledge on the factors influencing element uptake make this technique still open to criticism. In this experiment moss and lichen were exposed for 17 weeks at four urban {{air quality monitoring stations}} of Naples city. Trace element uptake was evaluated in moss material before and after different devitalisation treatments (acid washing, oven drying and the novel water boiling) and in lichen exposed with and without the nylon bag. A major uptake was overall recorded in moss materials. Uptake differences among moss materials were not significant (P = 0. 378), as well as the difference between lichen exposed with and without nylon bag (P= 0. 532). The ordination of sites/materials in relation to element uptake indicates a contamination gradient of the investigated sites, but element profiles did not differentiate substantially in the different areas of the city suggesting that atmospheric deposition in Naples urban area is qualitatively homogeneous only differing quantitatively in diverse monitoring sites. The overall high and significant correlations observed among and between geogenic and antropogenic elements suggest that polluted urban soil could represent a massive source for most elements. The implementation of devitalized moss bag could represent a ready-to-use robust tool for routine monitoring <b>of</b> air <b>pollutants...</b>|$|R
40|$|Respiratory {{effects of}} air pollution: the {{importance}} of a multidisciplinary approach to conduct research P. Paoletti*, U. Costabel** Investigation of the respiratory effects of air pollution were started in the late fifties after the important "air pollution episodes " in London, UK (1952) and in Donora USA (1948) [1, 2], when daily mortality increased on days with high levels of air pollution. These episodes clearly pointed out that urban air pollution may influ-ence human health. This evidence encouraged research to focus on the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pollutants</b> respon-sible, and to start experimental studies aimed at identi-fying the mechanisms by which pollutants may act in the different parts of the respiratory tract. In addition, epidemiological studies were set up with the goal o...|$|R
