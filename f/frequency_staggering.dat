40|$|Abstract. Double suction {{centrifugal}} pumps are widely employed in large water supply projects. In the present study, a double suction centrifugal pump with the staggered arrangement impeller in a domestic water supply {{project has been}} mapping and modeling, and then the symmetrical arrangement impeller of a double suction centrifugal pump has been designed for comparison. The commercial code was used to investigate the pump efficiency and the time variation of pressure at the zone of volute tongue. This unsteady flow feature was investigated by the large eddy simulation (LES) method with the sliding mesh technology. The analysis indicated that the pump efficiency of the double suction centrifugal pump with staggered arrangement impeller is lower than that with the symmetrical one. The frequency of pressure pulsation at the volute tongue {{is consistent with the}} blade passing <b>frequency.</b> The <b>staggered</b> arrangement impeller can reduce the levels of pressure pulsation significantly...|$|R
40|$|The {{unsteady}} {{response of}} an {{axial flow fan}} rotor to steady, circumferential inflow velocity and stagnation pressure distortions is assessed by two different methods. These are: (1) investigation of the unsteady normal force and pitching moment on a chordwise element of a rotor blade; and (2) investigation of the variation of the stagnation pressure distortion between the inlet and exit of the rotor. Experimental measurements of these unsteady characteristics are presented {{as a function of}} the geometry of the rotor [...] stagger angle, solidity and steady angle of incidence [...] for sinusoidally varying circumferential distortions with different numbers of distortion cycles. These measurements are compared with several theoretical analyses. While these comparisons indicate some of the deficiencies which exist in the theories, the existence of an unsteady cascade effect and the ability of the theories to adequately predict the trend of the unsteady response due to variations in reduced <b>frequency,</b> rotor <b>stagger</b> angle, solidity and mean incidence angle is clearly demonstrated...|$|R

This paper proposes a triplexers designed with common dual mode resonator sections have been proposed. By exploiting the variable frequency response of the stepped-impedance resonator, resonators can be shared by the three filter channels of the desired triplexer if their fundamental and the first spurious resonant frequency are properly assigned. Triplexer design method for suppressing spurious responses in the stopband by choosing the constitutive resonators with the same fundamental <b>frequency,</b> but <b>staggered</b> higher order resonant frequencies. The design concept is demonstrated by three of third order parallel-coupled bandpass filters. The bandpass filter is composed of three different stepped impedance resonators for which a general design guideline had been provided in order have the same fundamental frequency and different spurious frequencies. The measured results are in good agreement with the simulated predictions, whereby the spurious responses in the upper stopband can be suppressed below- 25 dB up to 14 GHz, which can be quite useful for multiband and multiservice applications in future wireless communication systems...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{need for}} methods to predict the {{unsteady}} air loads associated with flutter of turbomachinery blading at transonic speeds. The results of such an analysis in which the steady relative flow approaching a cascade of thin airfoils is assumed to be transonic, irrotational, and isentropic is presented. The blades in the cascade are allowed to undergo a small amplitude harmonic oscillation which generates a small unsteady flow superimposed on the existing steady flow. The blades are assumed to oscillate with a prescribed motion of constant amplitude and interblade phase angle. The equations of motion are obtained by linearizing about a uniform flow the inviscid nonheat conducting continuity and momentum equations. The resulting equations are solved by employing the Weiner Hopf technique. The solution yields the unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on the cascade at Mach number equal to 1. Making use of an unsteady transonic similarity law, these results are compared with the results obtained from linear unsteady subsonic and supersonic cascade theories.

30|$|Pressure {{fluctuation}} {{may cause}} high amplitude of vibration of double-suction centrifugal pumps, but {{the impact of}} impeller stagger angles is still not well understood. In this paper, pressure fluctuation experiments are carried out for five impeller configurations with different stagger angles by using the same test rig system. Results show that the stagger angles exert negligible effects {{on the characteristics of}} head and efficiency. The distributions of pressure fluctuations are relatively uniform along the suction chamber wall, and the maximum pressure fluctuation amplitude is reached near the suction inlet tongue region. The pressure fluctuation characteristics are affected largely by impeller rotation, whose dominant frequencies include impeller rotation frequency and its harmonic frequencies, and half blade passage <b>frequency.</b> The <b>stagger</b> angle exerts a small effect on the pressure fluctuations in the suction chamber while a great effect on the pressure fluctuation in volute casing, especially on the aspect of decreasing the amplitude on blade passage frequency. Among the tested cases, the distribution of pressure fluctuations in the volute becomes more uniform than the other impeller configurations and the level of pressure fluctuation may be reduced by up to 50 % when the impeller stagger angle is close to 24 ° or 36 °. The impeller structure pattern needs to be taken into consideration during the design period, and the halfway staggered impeller is strongly recommended.|$|R
40|$|For dynamic {{closed loop}} control of a {{multilevel}} converter with a low switching frequency, natural sampled PWM is the best form of modulation. However previous natural sampled PWM implementations have generally been analog. A digital implementation has advantages, particularly for a multilevel converter. Re-sampled uniform PWM, a modulation technique which approaches the performance of natural PWM, is implemented both in software and hardware. Results demonstrating the improvement over uniform PWM techniques are presented. 1 Multilevel Converters A multilevel converter has a multiple of the usual six switches found in a three phase inverter. The main motivation for such converters is that voltage (in VSI, current in CSI) is shared amongst these multiple switches, allowing a higher converter power rating than the individual switch VA rating would otherwise allow. This sharing is achieved by summing the outputs of several two level converters with transformers or inductors [1], or direct series connection; or by more complex topologies such as the diode clamped inverter and the flying capacitor inverter [2]. Another secondary but very important advantage is the extra degrees of switching freedom that the multiple switches permit. Each switch still has the same limited switching <b>frequency,</b> but by <b>staggering</b> the switching instants of the individual switches, the overall switching frequency of the multilevel converter effectively becomes a multiple of that of the individual switches [1]. A further gain comes since we switch between multiple voltage levels at this higher frequency rather than two, so the switching harmonics appear at a higher frequency and a lower level. This higher apparent switch frequency and improved frequency spectrum suggests a accompanying increase in controllable converter bandwidth. These combined advantages make multilevel converters suitable for implementing large active power filters. But which of the many possible ways of generating PWM waveforms is most suited to multilevel converter modulation, and specifically to ensuring an improved controllable bandwidth...|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} {{food production}} {{system is a}} head-on collision of ecology, morality, and human health, and their respective bodies of earth, animal and human. This thesis {{is an attempt to}} grapple with that damage from a theological perspective. What would it mean for a theology to answer to the degradation of American soil that sustains nothing but oil-drenched monoculture? to the horrifying conditions under which we as a nation raise, feed, and slaughter the animals for our consumption? to the dizzying array of food-related diseases that now affect our country in <b>staggering</b> <b>frequency,</b> particularly among lower socioeconomic classes? And what would that theology look like in the real world? The first chapter of this thesis surveys the damage done to earth, animal and human bodies by the industrial food system. A discussion of corn, the backbone of the entire system, and its effects on the land leads into a discussion of corn-fed animals and the conditions under which they live. In the final section, some of the health effects directly traceable to eating industrial food are overviewed. The second chapter highlights and examines three groups of people who, often for theological reasons, are growing food in alternative ways: ways that not only do not harm bodies, but sustain them and help them to thrive. The third chapter is a set of theological reflections on the first two, in which I try to pin down some essential theological differences between the first two chapters, and bring in theologians who are helpful in this enterprise. The four theological points I discuss are taking bodies seriously, a panentheistic approach to the world, interrelatedness and the presence of complexity, and mutuality and relational power...|$|R
40|$|A {{collection}} of computer programs {{has been developed}} that implements a procedure for predicting multiple-pure-tone (MPT) noise generated by fan blades of an aircraft engine (e. g., a turbofan engine). MPT noise arises when the fan is operating with supersonic relative tip Mach No. Under this flow condition, {{there is a strong}} upstream running shock. The strength and position of this shock are very sensitive to blade geometry variations. For a fan where all the blades are identical, the primary tone observed upstream of the fan will be the blade passing frequency. If there are small variations in geometry between blades, then tones below the blade passing <b>frequency</b> arise MPTs. <b>Stagger</b> angle differences as small as 0. 1 can give rise to significant MPT. It is also noted that MPT noise is more pronounced when the fan is operating in an unstarted mode. Computational results using a three-dimensional flow solver to compute the complete annulus flow with non-uniform fans indicate that MPT noise can be estimated in a relatively simple way. Hence, once the effect of a typical geometry variation of one blade in an otherwise uniform blade row is known, the effect of all the blades being different can be quickly computed via superposition. Two computer programs that were developed as part of this work are used in conjunction with a user s computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code to predict MPT spectra for a fan with a specified set of geometric variations: (1) The first program ROTBLD reads the users CFD solution files for a single blade passage via an API (Application Program Interface). There are options to replicate and perturb the geometry with typical variations stagger, camber, thickness, and pitch. The multi-passage CFD solution files are then written in the user s file format using the API. (2) The second program SUPERPOSE requires two input files: the first is the circumferential upstream pressure distribution extracted from the CFD solution on the multi-passage mesh, the second file defines the geometry variations of each blade in a complete fan. Superposition is used to predict the spectra resulting from the geometric variations...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} large-eddy {{simulations of}} the flow over a series of three-dimensional (3 D) dunes at laboratory scale. The bedform three-dimensionality was imposed by shifting a standard two-dimensional (2 D) dune shape in the streamwise direction according to a sine wave. The turbulence statistics were discussed in Part 1 of this article (Omidyeganeh & Piomelli, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 721, 2013, pp. 454 – 483). Coherent flow structures and their statistics are discussed concentrating on two cases with the same crestline amplitudes and wavelengths but different crestline alignments: in-phase and staggered. The present paper shows that the induced large-scale mean streamwise vortices are the primary factor that alters {{the features of the}} instantaneous flow structures. Wall turbulence is insensitive to the crestline alignment; alternating high- and low-speed streaks appear in the internal boundary layer developing on the stoss side, whereas over the node plane (the plane normal to the spanwise direction at the node of the crestline), they are inclined towards the lobe plane (the plane normal to the spanwise direction at the most downstream point of the crestline) due to the mean spanwise pressure gradient. Spanwise vortices (rollers) generated by Kelvin–Helmholtz instability in the separated shear layer appear regularly over the lobe with much larger length scale than those over the saddle (the plane normal to the spanwise direction at the most upstream point of the crestline). Rollers over the lobe may extend to the saddle plane and affect the reattachment features; their shedding is more frequent than in 2 D geometries. Vortices shed from the separated shear layer in the lobe plane undergo a three-dimensional instability while being advected downstream, and rise toward the free surface. They develop into a horseshoe shape (similar to the 2 D case) and affect the whole channel depth, whereas those generated near the saddle are advected downstream and toward the bed. When the tip of such a horseshoe reaches the free surface, the ejection of flow at the surface causes ‘boils’ (upwelling events on the surface). Strong boil events are observed {{on the surface of the}} lobe planes of 3 D dunes more frequently than in the saddle planes. They also appear more frequently than in the corresponding 2 D geometry. The crestline alignment of the dune alters the dynamics {{of the flow}} structures, in that they appear in the lobe plane and are advected towards the saddle plane of the next dune, where they are dissipated. Boil events occur at a higher <b>frequency</b> in the <b>staggered</b> alignment, but with less intensity than in the in-phase alignment...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThis Master s Thesis goal is {{to present}} {{fundamental}} physical aspects of Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) of marine risers, and outline methods for suppression of VIV. Main emphasis {{has been given to}} the use of strakes, and relevant theories connected to strakes influence on excitation of riser, riser response and drag is presented. Variation of outer diameter of the riser is also studied. The theory has been put to test through case studies of two Aker Solutions in-marine workover systems of 321 and 1300 m water depth. The computer program VIVANA has been used. Several analyses have been performed for various different riser configurations. For the 321 m water system, the following configurations have been studied:-	Base configuration, i. e. no use of strakes-	Staggered configuration, staggered bare and buoyant joints-	Bottom strakes configuration, bottom section of riser covered with strakes-	Middle strakes configuration, middle section of riser covered with strakes-	Top strakes configuration, top section of riser covered with strakesFor the 1300 m water depth system, the following configurations have been evaluated:-	Base configuration, i. e. no use of strakes-	Staggered configuration, staggered bare and buoyant joints-	Middle strakes configuration, middle section of riser covered with strakes-	Top 50 _ 150 strakes configuration, top 150 m of riser bare, then coverage of strakes-	Top stakes configuration, top section of riser covered with strakesFor each water depth a total of 4 different current profiles have been applied. The current profiles include both measured current profiles from the relevant oil fields, as well as several other more theoretical current models. The main findings from the 321 m analyses were:-	Staggered configuration gives generally lower VIV amplitudes of the dominating frequency compared to base configuration. -	Staggered configuration gives generally lower maximum stress amplitudes compared to base configuration. -	No clear trends when comparing fatigue life of staggered and base configuration are found, however significantly better fatigue results found for the staggered configuration in measured current. -	Maximum accumulated damage is located at the WH/XMT interface. -	Top and middle strakes configurations give best VIV suppression results. -	Applying strakes to the top section of the riser gives significantly lower VIV amplitudes, stress amplitudes and higher fatigue lives across all current profiles. -	Top strakes configuration supress VIV completely for the sheared current profile. -	Very small riser deflections and corresponding low flex joint angles are found; thus no operational consequences for the 321 m water depth. &# 8195;The main findings from the 1300 m analyses were:-	A significant increase in active response frequencies compared to the 321 m water depth, more than 30 active frequencies calculated. -	No clear trends in VIV amplitudes of the dominating <b>frequency</b> when comparing <b>staggered</b> and base configuration. -	Highest stress amplitudes found for the base configuration in all current profiles. -	No clear trends in calculated fatigue life when comparing the staggered and base configurations. Maximum accumulated damage found in the WH/BOP interface. -	Top 50 _ 150 strakes configuration the most efficient in suppressing VIV. -	Significantly lower VIV amplitudes of the dominating response frequency for the top 50 _ 150 strakes configuration. Same result found for the maximum stress amplitudes. -	Compared to the base configuration significantly better fatigue lives found for the top 50 _ 150 strakes configuration, however for the measured current profile an increase of only 1 decade was found. -	Staggered configuration gives lowest static riser deflection for all current profiles, also after drag amplification from VIV. -	Percentage increase in riser deflection from VIV reduced by roughly 80 % when comparing the top 50 _ 150 base configuration to the base configuration. -	LFJ angles exceeded lower limits for certain drilling and workover operations, however applying the top 50 _ 150 strakes configuration will generally give a larger operational window compared to the base configuration. Some of the results from the 1300 m analyses revealed certain discrepancies linked to the dominating frequencies and frequencies inducing maximum stress amplitudes. These inconsistencies are probably related to the convergence limit given as input in the VIVANA module...|$|R
