25|$|When {{the dummy}} has been {{determined}} {{to be ready for}} testing, calibration marks are fastened {{to the side of the}} head to aid researchers when slow-motion films are reviewed later. The dummy is then placed inside the test vehicle, set to seating position and then marked on either the head and <b>knees.</b> <b>Up</b> to fifty-eight data channels located in all parts of the Hybrid III, from the head to the ankle, record between 30000 and 35000 data items in a typical 100–150millisecond crash. Recorded in a temporary data repository in the dummy's chest, these data are downloaded to computer once the test is complete.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Cushing {{was cast}} in Star Wars in the {{supporting}} part of Grand Moff Tarkin. Like {{all of the other}} actors portraying Galactic Imperial officers, he was presented with ill-fitting riding boots, which pinched his feet so much that he was given permission by director George Lucas to play the role wearing his slippers. As a result, the camera operators filmed him throughout the film only from the <b>knees</b> <b>up,</b> or else standing behind the table of the Death Star conference room set. This costuming discomfort aside, Cushing contrasted sharply with co-star Alec Guinness in that he enjoyed his experience on the film, appreciated the renewed interest in his work from young fans and only regretted that he could not appear in the sequels.|$|E
2500|$|Bündchen {{pioneered the}} [...] "horse walk", a stomping {{movement}} created when a model picks her <b>knees</b> <b>up</b> high and kicks her feet out in front.|$|E
6000|$|The chuckle-headed lad nodded rapidly. The {{wonderful}} inevitable {{idea was}} coming. He drew his <b>knee</b> <b>up</b> towards {{his chin and}} swayed in his seat with excitement. 'Why not?' he echoed, 'why not?' ...|$|R
60|$|But Jones {{might have}} been {{in the bottom of the}} canyon for all Moze heard or cared. Jones removed his coat, {{carefully}} coiled his lasso, and began to go hand and <b>knee</b> <b>up</b> the leaning pine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not, but {{the mere}} {{position}} of an English official {{gives him a}} point of view which cannot but bias his mind on this question." [...] Pagett moved his <b>knee</b> <b>up</b> and down a little uneasily as he spoke.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Bündchen {{was the first}} in a wave of Brazilian models to find {{international}} success. In 1999, Vogue noted [...] "The Return of the Sexy Model", and she was credited with ending the [...] "heroin chic" [...] era of modeling. Bündchen was one of the Victoria's Secret Angels from 2000 until mid-2007. Bündchen pioneered the [...] "horse walk", a stomping movement created when a model picks her <b>knees</b> <b>up</b> high and kicks her feet out in front. In a 2007 Vogue interview, Claudia Schiffer stated that Bündchen is the only remaining supermodel.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} water around weirs can often appear {{relatively}} calm, {{they can be}} extremely dangerous places to boat, swim, or wade, as the circulation patterns on the downstream side—typically called a hydraulic jump— can submerge a person indefinitely. This phenomenon is so well known to canoeists, kayakers, and others who spend time on rivers that they even have a rueful name for weirs: [...] "drowning machines". [...] If caught in this situation, the Ohio DNR recommends that a victim should [...] "tuck the chin down, draw the <b>knees</b> <b>up</b> to the chest with arms wrapped around them. Hopefully, conditions will be such that the current will push the victim along {{the bed of the}} river until swept beyond the boil line and released by the hydraulic." [...] The Pennsylvania State Police also recommends to [...] "curl up, dive to the bottom, and swim or crawl downstream". [...] As the hydraulic entrains air, the buoyancy of the water between the dam and boil line will be reduced by upwards of 30%, and if a victim is unable to float, escape {{at the base of the}} dam may be the only option for survival.|$|E
2500|$|Hunt seat or Hunter classes {{judge the}} {{movement}} and the form of horses suitable for work over fences. A typical show hunter division would include classes over fences as well as [...] "Hunter under Saddle" [...] or [...] "flat" [...] classes (sometimes called [...] "hack" [...] classes), in which the horse is judged on its performance, manners and movement without having to jump. Hunters have a long, flat-kneed trot, sometimes called [...] "daisy cutter" [...] movement, a phrase suggesting a good hunter could slice daisies in a field when it reaches its stride out. The over fences classes in show hunter competition are judged on {{the form of the}} horse, its manners and the smoothness of the course. A horse with good jumping form snaps its <b>knees</b> <b>up</b> and jumps with a good bascule. It should also be able to canter or gallop with control while having a stride long enough to make a proper number of strides over a given distance between fences. Hunter classes differ from jumper classes, in which they are not timed, and equitation classes, in which the rider's performance is the focus. Hunter style is based on fox hunting, so jumps in the hunter division are usually more natural colors than the jumps in a jumper division.|$|E
5000|$|Raise {{the left}} <b>knee</b> <b>up</b> and twist the body 45 degree to the right, {{the left hand}} rises into jodan shuto uke and then the body rotates to the left 45 degrees into kiba dachi facing the front with the left arm out at 45 degrees.|$|R
50|$|When {{starting}} the dance, the {{man should be}} kneeling {{on the floor with}} his left knee on the floor and his right <b>knee</b> <b>up</b> and grabbing the woman's hand. The woman walks in step with the beat of the drums around the kneeling man while holding his hand.|$|R

6000|$|He {{pulled his}} <b>knees</b> <b>up,</b> plucked {{at the grass}} with his hand, stared, blushed a little. [...] "You are talking French," [...] said Mr. Mixter.|$|E
60|$|Jim laughed. It {{really was}} funny {{to see the}} old man wound round and round with coils of rope from his <b>knees</b> <b>up</b> to his chin.|$|E
60|$|Tip's trouser-legs {{and shoes}} were {{thoroughly}} soaked; but the Saw-Horse had floated so perfectly that from his <b>knees</b> <b>up</b> {{the boy was}} entirely dry. As for the Pumpkinhead, every stitch of his gorgeous clothing dripped water.|$|E
5000|$|Min Sithu (မင်းစည်သူ, [...] ) {{is one of}} the 37 nats in the Burmese {{pantheon of}} nats. He is the nat {{representation}} of King Alaungsithu of Pagan, who was assassinated by his son Narathu in 1167. He is portrayed sitting on a throne with one <b>knee</b> <b>up</b> and his foot on the seat, wearing royal garments.|$|R
50|$|This is an uppercut {{using the}} wrestler's knee {{in which a}} wrestler brings their <b>knee</b> <b>up</b> to hit the {{opponent}} under the chin. This can either be performed in mid clinch or with the attacking wrestler charging at a kneeling or bent over opponent, lifting their knee upwards to strike underneath the jaw or the side of their head.|$|R

60|$|Jeff, feeling uncomfortably {{large in}} Miss Mayfield's presence, painfully seated {{himself on the}} edge of a very low stone, which had the effect of {{bringing}} his <b>knees</b> <b>up</b> on a level with his chin, and affected an ease glaringly simulated.|$|E
6000|$|... "You were saying, at Mrs. Needham's, that {{we ought}} to have an old farm-house," [...] he remarked, while she snuggled before the fire, her back against a log, her round <b>knees</b> <b>up</b> under her chin, her arms {{clasping}} her legs. [...] "Let's build one right here." ...|$|E
60|$|At length {{they came}} {{in view of the}} place where the more miserable remains of the savages' army lay, where there {{appeared}} about one hundred still: their posture was generally sitting upon the ground, with their <b>knees</b> <b>up</b> towards their mouth, and the head put between the hands, leaning down upon the knees.|$|E

50|$|Romero {{was invited}} to spring training, where he walked 10 batters over 9 innings. He was sent to minor league camp on March 19, 2014. In June, he {{underwent}} season-ending knee surgery and could require a second surgery on his other <b>knee.</b> <b>Up</b> to the surgery, he had posted an 0-3 record with a 5.50 ERA and 42 walks through 37 innings pitching for the Buffalo Bisons.|$|R
6000|$|The {{second mate}} {{had found his}} way into the {{wheelhouse}} some time before. He had fixed himself in a corner with his <b>knees</b> <b>up,</b> a fist pressed against each temple; and this attitude suggested rage, sorrow, resignation, surrender, with a sort of concentrated unforgiveness. He said mournfully and defiantly, [...] "Well, it's my watch below now: ain't it?" ...|$|E
60|$|When he {{had some}} roguish trick to play, he would down with his <b>knees,</b> <b>up</b> with his eyes, and fall to prayers though {{in the midst of}} the kennel. Then it was that those who {{understood}} his pranks would be sure to get far enough out of his way; and whenever curiosity attracted strangers to laugh or to listen, he would of a sudden bespatter them with mud.|$|E
60|$|There was no {{one with}} the wounded man but the pale photographer, small, frail, bloodthirsty, the hater of capitalists, perched on a high stool near {{the head of the}} bed with his <b>knees</b> <b>up</b> and his chin in his hands. He had been fetched by a comrade who, working late on the wharf, had heard from a negro {{belonging}} to a lancha, that Captain Fidanza had been brought ashore mortally wounded.|$|E
50|$|Turret mills are {{generally}} {{considered by some}} to be more versatile of the two designs. However, turret mills are only practical as long as the machine remains relatively small. As machine size increases, moving the <b>knee</b> <b>up</b> and down requires considerable effort and it also becomes difficult to reach the quill feed handle (if equipped). Therefore, larger milling machines are usually of the bed type.|$|R
5000|$|Breeches with grippy {{material}} from the <b>knee,</b> <b>up</b> the inner thigh, and across the buttocks. These breeches are primarily seen in dressage competition, where the [...] "sticky" [...] seat helps riders stay quiet and deep in the saddle as they sit the gaits of their horses. However, they are also worn by eventers and other riders. They {{are designed to be}} worn with tall boots or half chaps.|$|R

60|$|Pretty {{soon she}} had to duck her head to pass under the fence that {{separated}} the meadow from the pasture lot; but she got through all right, and then kept on down the stream, until she came close to the deep pool. She couldn't wade through this, as I have explained; so she got on dry land and crept {{on her hands and}} <b>knees</b> <b>up</b> {{to the edge of the}} bank, so as not to scare the fishes, if any were swimming in the pool.|$|E
60|$|She {{dipped into}} the book, {{lounging}} on her window-seat, with her slim, lisle-stockinged legs crossed, and her <b>knees</b> <b>up</b> under her chin. She stroked a satin pillow while she read. About {{her was the}} clothy exuberance of a Blodgett College room: cretonne-covered window-seat, photographs of girls, a carbon print of the Coliseum, a chafing-dish, and a dozen pillows embroidered or beaded or pyrographed. Shockingly out of place was a miniature of the Dancing Bacchante. It was the only trace of Carol in the room. She had inherited the rest from generations of girl students.|$|E
60|$|The {{man made}} no reply, but ate ravenously, {{as if he}} had been starving. When he had finished, he lighted his pipe, and drew his <b>knees</b> <b>up</b> to his chin as he warmed his hands before the blaze. Little {{information}} of any kind could be drawn out of this taciturn wanderer. To Ned's questions, he replied that he had been at the diggings on the Yuba River, which he described as being rich; that he had made enough gold to satisfy all his wants, and was on his way to San Francisco, where he intended to ship for England. His name, he said, was Smith.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} during production, Ballard noted {{he was eager}} to avoid the cinematic idiosyncrasies of recent dance films, such as Nijinsky (1980), which had filmed its dancers mostly from the <b>knee</b> <b>up.</b> [...] "I think it's important to see the whole dancer … Where we have a great performance, you'll see it all," [...] he said. [...] "I want to avoid movie trickery. It's a helluva lot tougher to shoot than I thought it would be." ...|$|R
