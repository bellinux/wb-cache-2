2500|$|Both naval {{construction}} and naval strategizing became intense, {{prompted by the}} development of torpedoes and submarines (from 1901), which challenged traditional ideas about the power of battleships. [...] At the same time the Dreadnought committed to the [...] "big gun only" [...] concept and caused a shift in thinking around the world, giving Britain the undisputed lead. This ship had ten 12inch guns with a top speed of 21.5 knots. The British were aided in this development by having Naval Observers aboard the Japanese fleet at the battle of Tsushima straits in 1904 where the Japanese decisively defeated the Russian fleet. They had concluded that during an engagement, 12 inch guns proved the most decisive, possessing the greatest range and <b>firing</b> <b>power.</b> Homogeneous batteries had the added advantage of facilitating the more accurate salvo firing method.|$|E

The largest externalities, for which damages range from 0.8 to 5.6 times value added, arise from coal-fired electric generation.|$|E
