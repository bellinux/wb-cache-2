5|$|A {{much larger}} star, however, is massive {{enough to create}} {{temperatures}} and pressures needed to cause the carbon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> to begin to fuse when the star contracts {{at the end of}} the helium-burning stage. The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions as progressively heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center, with an outermost layer of hydrogen gas, surrounding a layer of hydrogen fusing into helium, surrounding a layer of helium fusing into carbon via the triple-alpha process, surrounding layers that fuse to progressively heavier elements. As a star this massive evolves, it undergoes repeated stages where fusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> stops, and the core collapses until the pressure and temperature are sufficient to begin the next stage of fusion, reigniting to halt collapse.|$|E

40|$|We study non-thermal {{emissions}} from cool cores in galaxy clusters. We adopted a recent model, in which cosmic-rays (CRs) prevail <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> and stably heat them through CR streaming.

Comparison between the theoretical predictions and radio observations shows that the overall CR spectra must be steep, and most of <b>the</b> CRs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> are low-energy CRs.

5|$|Stars {{far more}} massive than the sun evolve in more complex ways. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> of the star, {{hydrogen}} is fused into helium, releasing thermal energy that heats the sun's core and provides outward pressure {{that supports the}} sun's layers against collapse in {{a process known as}} stellar or hydrostatic equilibrium. The helium produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> accumulates there since temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> are not yet high enough to cause it to fuse. Eventually, as the hydrogen at the core is exhausted, fusion starts to slow down, and gravity causes the core to contract. This contraction raises the temperature high enough to initiate a shorter phase of helium fusion, which accounts for less than 10% of the star's total lifetime. In stars with fewer than eight solar masses, the carbon produced by helium fusion does not fuse, and the star gradually cools to become a white dwarf. White dwarf stars, if they have a near companion, may then become Type Ia supernovae.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System {{will remain}} roughly {{as we know}} it today until the {{hydrogen}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>core.</b> The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sunâbut now enriched with heavier elements like carbonâto the interstellar medium.|$|E

5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} fuel {{at the core}} of the progenitor of IK Pegasi B was consumed, it evolved into a red giant. The inner core contracted until hydrogen burning commenced in a shell surrounding the helium core. To compensate for the temperature increase, the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star. When the core reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion this star contracted and became what is termed a horizontal branch star. That is, it belonged to a group of stars that fall upon a roughly horizontal line on the H-R diagram. The fusion of helium formed an inert core of carbon and oxygen.
