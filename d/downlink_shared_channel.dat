50|$|The {{first phase}} of HSDPA has been {{specified}} in the 3GPP release 5. Phase one introduces new basic functions and is aimed to achieve peak data rates of 14.0 Mbit/s with significantly reduced latency. The improvement in speed and latency reduces the cost per bit and enhances support for high-performance packet data applications. HSDPA is based on <b>shared</b> <b>channel</b> transmission and its key features are <b>shared</b> <b>channel</b> and multi-code transmission, higher-order modulation, short transmission time interval (TTI), fast link adaptation and scheduling along with fast hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). Further new features are the High Speed <b>Downlink</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>Channels</b> (HS-DSCH), the adaptive modulation QPSK and 16QAM and the High Speed Medium Access protocol (MAC-hs) in base station.|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the {{expected}} growth in wireless data communications and the commonly anticipated up/downlink asymmetry, we present a performance analysis of downlink data transfer over <b>downlink</b> <b>shared</b> <b>channels</b> (dschs), arguably the most efficient umts transport channel for medium-to-large data transfers. It is our objective to provide qualitative insight in the different aspects that influence the data quality of service (qos). As a most principal factor, the data traffic load affects the data qos in two distinct manners: (i) a heavier data traffic load implies a greater competition for dsch resources and thus longer transfer delays; and (ii) since each data call served on a dsch must maintain an associated dedicated channel (a-dch) for signalling purposes, a heavier data traffic load implies a higher interference level, a higher frame error rate and thus a lower effective aggregate dsch throughput: the greater the demand for service, the smaller the aggregate service capacity. The latter effect is further amplified in a multicellular scenario, where a dsch experiences additional interference from the dschs and a-dchs in surrounding cells, causing a further degradation of its effective throughput. Following an insightful two-stage performance evaluation approach, which segregates the interference aspects from the traffic dynamics, a set of numerical experiments is executed in order to demonstrate these effects and obtain qualitative insight in the impact of various system aspects on the data qos...|$|R
30|$|The {{behavior}} of the two considered scheduling algorithms {{can be observed in}} the top-right side of Figures 18 and 19. These graphs show the number of Transmission Time Intervals (TTIs), measured over 10 [*]TTI/ 20 [*]ms periods, that the UUT requests a transmission (blue line), and the number of times that these requests are accepted by the scheduler (green line) or rejected (red line). As it is expected, the MaxC/I behavior is highly dependent on the experienced channel quality: under favorable channel quality conditions all UUT's requests are accepted, while several requests are rejected when the UUT is at the cell border (time instants around 65 and 195 seconds). On the other hand, the RR policy exhibits a more homogeneous and channel-independent pattern, with an average of around 80 % transmission requests accepted (20 % rejected) under both favorable and unfavorable channel quality conditions. This behavior is also observed in the number of physical channel codes, that is, High-Speed Physical <b>Downlink</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>Channels</b> (HS-PDSCHs), which the scheduler assigns to the UUT, which is shown in the bottom-right side of Figures 18 and 19 (measured over 10 TTI/ 20 [*]ms periods). At the cell border, the number of HS-PDSCHs assigned to the UUT is limited by the maximum number of HS-PDSCHs corresponding to the reported CQI value. As a result, a low number of HS-PDSCHs is assigned to the UUT in time instants around 65 and 195 seconds with both MaxC/I and RR. On the other hand, under good channel quality conditions, data transmissions can be reliably performed using the maximum number of simultaneous codes allowed by UE's HSDPA category (5 codes for category 12). In this case, the main aspect limiting the number of HS-PDSCHs assigned to the UUT is the scheduler's policy. As it can be observed for RR under good channel quality conditions, the UUT is hardly assigned up to 40 codes every 10 [*]TTIs, that is, 4 codes per TTI in average. On the other hand, the value of this parameter for MaxC/I under similar channel quality conditions usually reaches the average of 5 codes per TTI. This {{is due to the fact}} that users experiencing favorable channel conditions tend to monopolize resources when the MaxC/I algorithm is applied.|$|R

30|$|As to channel-optimized encoders, {{the implied}} key {{assumption}} in [7] is that channel state information (CSI) {{is known to}} transmitters. In a time division duplexing (TDD) mode system, {{it is easy to}} know CSI for transmitters, because uplink and <b>downlink</b> <b>share</b> the same <b>channel.</b> But in a frequency division duplexing (FDD) mode system, it is much harder to know CSI for transmitters than the TDD mode. Generally, after CSI is estimated in the receivers, it must be fed back to transmitters through an extra reliable channel. Here, in this paper, for a binary symmetric channel, CSI only includes crossover probability ε. In other words, if the above assumption comes true, for a given channel-optimized encoder in [7], receivers absolutely know temporal ε and can judge if there exist empty cells in encoding cells and whether the receiving index belongs to empty cells or not. This is because the encoding cells are determined by ε. Once the empty cell index appears, receivers should recognize that the received index is erroneously detected. However, in [7], the index that is known to be an error is still sent to quantizer decoders.|$|R

Yet, simulation parameters of adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), MIMO processing and baseband multicarrier waveforms are not restricted to standard-compliant values. In addition, the modular simulator structure allows for easy integration of novel functionality, such as additional waveforms or modulation and coding schemes (MCSs), to investigate candidate technologies of future mobile communication systems. As an example, we have implemented FBMC transmission to support comparison with the filtered/windowed OFDM-based waveforms considered within 5 G standardizations (weighted overlap and add (WOLA), universal filtered multicarrier (UFMC), filtered OFDM (f-OFDM)).|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we are {{interested}} in characterizing the signal to interference ratio (SIR) distribution on the downlink of a cellular network. The SIR outage probability and the SIR cumulative distribution function (CDF) are important metrics for the performance evaluation of wireless communication systems. In this paper, we define the outage probability as the probability that the SIR at the input of the receiver chain is falling below a given threshold value. This performance parameter is crucial for both coverage and capacity studies. In terms of coverage, mobile stations should be able to decode common control channels (like pilots or broadcast channels) and thus to attain a certain SIR threshold on these channels with high probability. In this case, we {{are interested}} in the low SIR region of the SIR distribution in order to evaluate the cell coverage. In terms of capacity and for systems implementing link adaptation on <b>shared</b> <b>downlink</b> <b>channels</b> (such as HSPA or LTE), the whole SIR distribution is needed for performance evaluation. The ergodic capacity at a certain distance from the base station is indeed evaluated as an expectation of the Shannon classical formula over the channel variations. The cell capacity is obtained by integration over the cell area.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{performance}} of sending IP traffic over a <b>shared</b> cellular radio <b>channel</b> with a central scheduling mechanism. Using a <b>shared</b> <b>channel</b> for IP traffic increases the channel utilisation compared to using dedicated channels. There are several new techniques being developed for wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs) that employ <b>shared</b> cellular radio <b>channels</b> such as IEEE 802. 16 e and the High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) developed by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP). The work in this thesis has been focused on the <b>shared</b> <b>downlink</b> <b>channel</b> of HSDPA called HS-DSCH. All problems studied in this thesis relates to improving the performance of transmitting IP traffic over HS-DSCH. Our studies include an evaluation of changing the minimum retransmission timeout (minRTO) of TCP when exposed to varying forwarding rates provided by HS-DSCH (the minRTO problem), the impact of user behaviour {{on the performance of}} TCP over this channel (the user behaviour problem) and the performance of different scheduling algorithms for HS-DSCH in serving TCP and UDP flows (the multi-service problem). The thesis comprises three scientific papers and one technical report. The first paper addresses the minRTO problem. Through simulations, we have investigated the impact of a shortened minimum restransmission timeout (minRTO) in TCP in a wireless environment. Our study showed that the minRTO can be shortened or removed without decreasing the system throughput of the network or decreasing fairness among its users. The second paper {{focuses on the}} problem of user behaviour. Using a simple model for user behaviour and user satisfaction we investigated the effects of admission control on user satisfaction and system throughput. Our simulation results showed that using no admission control can maximise system throughput, while user satisfaction can be maximised with admission control. The third paper investigates the multi-service problem. Two different services, web traffic and voice over IP (VoIP), were configured to compete for resources in a simulated wireless environment. One important component of this network is the scheduler, which distributes resources among the users and thus between the two services. The performance of several different schedulers were evaluated based on system throughput and user satisfaction. Our results showed that the simple proportional fair scheduler outperformed the other schedulers tested. The work in this thesis has been performed using simulations. Simulation as a method offers a good trade-off between low cost and high precision. Using simulations we can test a great number of scenarios and different system scenarios in a relatively short time. A report describing our simulation environment constitutes the final part of this thesis. Godkänd; 2006; 20061126 (ysko...|$|R
