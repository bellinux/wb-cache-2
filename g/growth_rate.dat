5|$|An {{alternative}} model {{assumes that}} PrPSc exists only as fibrils, and that fibril ends bind PrPC and convert it into PrPSc. If this were all, then {{the quantity of}} prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrPSc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease. This {{can be explained by}} taking into account fibril breakage. A mathematical solution for the exponential <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found. The exponential <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> depends largely on the square root of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential <b>growth</b> <b>rate,</b> and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.|$|E

5|$|Paleontologist Gregory Erickson {{and colleagues}} {{have studied the}} growth and life history of tyrannosaurids. Analysis of bone {{histology}} can determine the age of a specimen when it died. Growth rates can be examined when the age of various individuals are plotted against their size on a graph. Erickson has shown that after a long time as juveniles, tyrannosaurs underwent tremendous growth spurts for about four years midway through their lives. After the rapid growth phase ended with sexual maturity, growth slowed down considerably in adult animals. Erickson only examined Daspletosaurus from the Dinosaur Park Formation, but these specimens show the same pattern. Compared to albertosaurines, Daspletosaurus showed a faster <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> during the rapid growth period due to its higher adult weight. The maximum <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> in Daspletosaurus was 180kilograms (400lb) per year, based on a mass estimate of 1800kilograms (2tons) in adults. Other authors have suggested higher adult weights for Daspletosaurus; this would change {{the magnitude of the}} <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> but not the overall pattern.|$|E

It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that phytoplankton in situ grows faster than measured nutrient concentrations should allow, and that microscale heterogeneity in nutrient concentration permits phytoplankton {{to maintain the}} elevated <b>growth</b> <b>rates.</b> An examination of literature data failed to reveal any significant difference between observed <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> and those predicted from steady-state N-growth kinetics. On the other hand, P kinetics may underestimate <b>growth</b> <b>rates.</b> However, it is demonstrated that a non-homogeneous nutrient supply regime should actually decrease phyto-plankton <b>growth</b> <b>rates,</b> regardless of the physical characteristics of the patches.

5|$|The <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> hypothesis, {{also known}} as the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E

5|$|Another study corroborated {{the latter}} study's results but found the <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> {{to be much}} faster, finding it to be around 1800 {{kilograms}} (4000lbs). Although these results were much higher than previous estimations, the authors noted that these results significantly lowered the great difference between its actual <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> and the one which would be expected of an animal of its size. The sudden change in <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> {{at the end of}} the growth spurt may indicate physical maturity, a hypothesis which is supported by the discovery of medullary tissue in the femur of a 16 to 20-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex from Montana (MOR 1125, also known as B-rex). Medullary tissue is found only in female birds during ovulation, indicating that B-rex was of reproductive age. Further study indicates an age of 18 for this specimen. In 2016, it was finally confirmed by Mary Higby Schweitzer and Lindsay Zanno et al that the soft tissue within the femur of MOR 1125 was medullary tissue. This also confirmed the identity of the specimen as a female. The discovery of medullary bone tissue within Tyrannosaurus may prove valuable in determining the sex of other dinosaur species in future examinations, as the chemical makeup of medullary tissue is unmistakable. Other tyrannosaurids exhibit extremely similar growth curves, although with lower growth rates corresponding to their lower adult sizes.|$|E

40|$|Literature {{review and}} {{synthesis}} of <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of aquatic protists {{focused on the}} role of temperature in the formation of massive annual algal blooms in high-latitude ecosystems. Maximal <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of herbivorous protists equaled or exceeded maximal <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of phototrophic protists at temperatures above 15 uC. Maximal <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of herbivorous protists declined more rapidly with decreasing temperature than did those of phototrophic protists, and at the very low temperatures common to high-latitude ecosystems, the maximal <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of herbivorous protists were less than half the maximal <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of phototrophic protists. <b>Growth</b> <b>rates</b> of herbivorous protists were consistently lower than those of bacterivorous protists and were unrelated to differences in cell volume between the two groups. Linear equations describing the relationship of the natural log of maximal <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of bacterivorous and herbivorous protists to temperature were generated and compared to published information for maximal <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of phototrophic protists and copepods. The three heterotrophic groups had similar slopes (0. 12 for bacterivorous protists, 0. 10 for herbivorous protists, and 0. 13 for copepods) that were approximately double that of phototrophic protists (0. 06). The massive annual algal blooms observed in high latitudes are due in part to a fundamental difference in the relationship between growth and temperature for phototrophic protists and their grazers...|$|R
