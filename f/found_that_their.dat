5|$|After the American Civil War, {{returning}} residents <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> slaves, {{livestock and}} farm equipment had been taken. Most residents relocated. However, {{in the early}} 20th century, farmers returned {{and the town of}} Green Lake modestly grew to an approximate population of 300 in 1914. At the time, much of the land in the vicinity was used for livestock grazing. The only profitable commercial uses for the lake itself included transportation of lumber and fishing. Approximately US$100,000 worth of fish were caught in the lake from 1900 to 1915. Nevertheless, the lake bed remained dry for extended periods and vegetation covered certain areas. Local residents soon began to use the bed to grow cotton.|$|E
5|$|At {{present the}} golden white-eye is very common, {{and in fact}} a 1996 study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> densities on Saipan were among the highest {{recorded}} for any bird, up to 2,095 birds/km² (8.47 per acre). It was believed that Saipan cannot sustain a larger population of this white-eye than it already does. A 2009 study, which incorporated results from a 2007 survey, found that the species had declined between 1982 and 2007, in common with two other species on Saipan, the rufous fantail and the nightingale reed warbler. All three species are insectivorous and were theorised to have declined due to habitat loss. Nevertheless, the species remained relatively abundant, and the current world population is estimated at around 71,997 birds.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus is not {{extremely}} well known, {{and as a}} consequence, its phylogenetic position is not certain. In 2012 during a redescription of the taxon by Philip Mannion et al., it was recovered, in both cladograms, to be sister species to Supersaurus vivianae and together forming the most basal diplodocines. A 2012 cladogram, published by Mannion et al. and using a modified matrix of Whitlock (2011) found that Dinheirosaurus was more primitive than Torneria and more derived than Apatosaurus. However, a cladogram from 2014 <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> group was supported, but in fact more primitive than Apatosaurus, and therefore outside Diplodocinae.|$|E

5|$|Human {{productivity}} routinely {{decreases in}} the afternoon. Power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity {{in the afternoon}} compared to the morning, the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays. One 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> productivity was 13 percent lower in the afternoon, the least productive time being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace. Another, larger study found that afternoon declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, James Dahlgren {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a small-sample pilot study assessing the project. Dahlgren {{is a doctor}} who promotes the Purification Rundown {{as a method of}} detoxification. The study claimed to find evidence both of elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the rescue workers and improvement during the regime. Two scientists from Cambridge Environmental, Inc. published a thorough critique of the study. They questioned the premise that WTC rescue workers needed detoxification, citing studies that had <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> blood concentration of toxins was no greater than normal.|$|E
5|$|Ray's regular {{film editor}} was Dulal Datta, but the {{director}} usually dictated the editing while Datta did the actual work. Because of financial reasons and Ray's meticulous planning, his films were mostly cut in-camera (apart from Pather Panchali). At {{the beginning of}} his career, Ray worked with Indian classical musicians, including Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan, and Ali Akbar Khan. He <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> first loyalty was to musical traditions, and not to his film. He had a greater understanding of Western classical forms, which he wanted to use for his films set in an urban milieu. Starting with Teen Kanya, Ray began to compose his own scores.|$|E

5|$|The Modi {{government}} {{finished the}} process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed. Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> electricity supply had stabilised, according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy {{at the expense of}} small farmers and labourers.|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and Chinese {{alligator}} extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls {{as the temperature}} drops, and they become sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> core body temperatures can descend to around , but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} demands of the arrivals, ships bearing goods from around the world came to San Francisco as well. Ships' captains <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> crews deserted to go to the goldfields. The wharves and docks of San Francisco became a forest of masts, as {{hundreds}} of ships were abandoned. Enterprising San Franciscans turned the abandoned ships into warehouses, stores, taverns, hotels, and one into a jail. Many of these ships were later destroyed and used for landfill to create more buildable land in the boomtown.|$|E

5|$|One {{result of}} the {{economic}} and political tensions was the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, in which widespread rural discontent was followed by an invasion of London involving thousands of rebels. The rebels had many demands, including the effective end of the feudal institution of serfdom and a cap on the levels of rural rents. The ensuing violence took the political classes by surprise and the revolt was not fully put down until the autumn; up to 7,000 rebels were executed in the aftermath. As a {{result of the}} revolt, parliament retreated from the poll tax and instead focused on a system of indirect taxes centring on foreign trade, drawing 80% of tax revenues from the exports of wool. Parliament continued to collect direct tax levies at historically high levels up until 1422, although they reduced them in later years. As a result, successive monarchs <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> tax revenues were uncertain, and HenryVI enjoyed less than half the annual tax revenue of the late 14th century. England's monarchs became increasingly dependent on borrowing and forced loans to meet the gap between taxes and expenditure and even then faced later rebellions over levels of taxation, including the Yorkshire rebellion of 1489 and the Cornish rebellion of 1497 during the reign of HenryVII.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{and many}} {{concerned}} reformers had been attempting {{to improve the}} housing of the working classes since the early 1830s. When Hill began her work, the model dwelling movement had been in existence for twenty years, royal and select committees had sat to examine the problems of urban well-being, and {{the first of many}} tranches of legislation aimed at improving working class housing had been passed. From Hill's point of view these had all failed the poorest members of the working class, the unskilled labourers. She <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> landlords routinely ignored their obligations towards their tenants, and that the tenants were too ignorant and oppressed to better themselves. She tried to find new homes for her charges, but there was a severe shortage of available property, and Hill decided that her only solution was to become a landlord herself. John Ruskin, who was interested in the co-operative guild, knew Hill from her work as his copyist and was impressed by her. As an aesthete and a humanitarian he was affronted by the brutal ugliness of the slums. In 1865, having inherited a substantial sum of money from his father, he acquired for £750 the leases of three cottages of six rooms each in Paradise Place, Marylebone.|$|E
5|$|The {{cooperative}} gameplay {{originated from}} players' requests and from anecdotes of players {{working together on}} the same computer or console to solve the game's puzzles. Wolpaw likened this to players working together on the same computer to solve point-and-click adventure games. The cooperative campaign was also inspired by Valve's Left 4 Dead cooperative games, in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with the game when they had finished playing it. While the single player campaign in Portal 2 is designed to avoid frustrating the player, the cooperative levels focus on coordination and communication, and Valve recognizes {{they are much more}} difficult than the single-player puzzles. Valve did not include timed puzzles in the single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, but <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> inclusion in the cooperative mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult maneuvers. Each puzzle chamber in the cooperative mode requires four portals to solve to prevent puzzles being solved by the actions of only one player. As soon as a playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals, the level was sent back to the designers for further work. Except in a few cases, Valve designed the chambers so that both players would remain in sight of each other to promote communication and cooperation. Some of the puzzle chambers were designed asymmetrically; one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow the other player to cross the room, emphasizing that the two characters, while working together, are separate entities. The designers soon realized that the ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one's partner was a necessary element, since they found this to be more effective for cooperation than simple, verbal instructions.|$|E
