[...] He had signed up for a pilot for CBS called Late Bloomers before agreeing to appear on Enterprise. One of the reasons he agreed to join the cast of Enterprise was that he had previously worked with Kerry McCluggage, one of the co-founders of UPN, on Quantum Leap.

The series, set around a fictional advertising firm, starred McCormack as Mason McGuire, the firm's newly promoted creative director, and deals with his best friend's (Cavanagh) unpredictable behavior. In an interview with USA Weekend, McCormack revealed he was not afraid of being typecast. McCormack's decision to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> was due to [...] "great writing". The show debuted on January 26, 2009, and was watched by almost 3.4million viewers. Trust Me debuted to very positive reviews, with Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle writing, [...] "...the series is surprisingly solid." [...] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times wrote that McCormack and Cavanagh [...] "manage to keep their characters sharply defined but low-key. They are opposites but not in an ash-smudged, Windex-wielding Felix and Oscar way." [...] The series, however, was cancelled after one season, due to poor ratings.|$|E

[...] Each script contained local references, such as street names and the names or depictions of local politicians and celebrities. [...] Castelli produced companies in France, Germany, Mexico and other countries, sometimes also directing the productions.

500|$|The initial cast was {{to feature}} Chevy Chase as Otter, Bill Murray as Boon, Brian Doyle-Murray as Hoover, Dan Aykroyd as D-Day, and John Belushi as Bluto, but only Belushi {{wanted to do}} it. Chase was a star from Saturday Night Live, which had {{recently}} become a cultural phenomenon. His name would have added credibility to the project, but he turned the film down to do Foul Play; Landis, who wanted to cast unknown dramatic actors such as Bacon and Allen (the first film for both) instead of famous comedians, takes credit for subtly discouraging Chase by describing the film as an [...] "ensemble". Landis has also stated {{that he was not}} interested in directing a Saturday Night Live movie and that unknowns would be the better choice. The character of D-Day was based on Aykroyd, who was a motorcycle aficionado. Aykroyd was offered the part, but he was already committed to Saturday Night Live. Belushi, who had worked on The National Lampoon Radio Hour before Saturday Night Live, was also committed to the show, but spent Monday through Wednesday making the film and then flying back to New York to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> on Thursday through Saturday. Ramis originally wrote the role of Boon for himself, but Landis felt that he looked too old for the part and Riegert was cast instead. Landis did offer Ramis a smaller part, but he declined. Landis met with Jack Webb to play Dean Wormer and Kim Novak to play his wife. Webb ultimately backed out due to concerns over his clean-cut image, and was replaced by John Vernon.|$|E
500|$|In January1994, Simon co-created with comedian George Carlin {{the sitcom}} The George Carlin Show for Fox. It aired for 27 episodes before being {{canceled}} in December1995. Simon served as showrunner throughout its run and directed several episodes. Simon persuaded Carlin to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> after writing {{it as something}} which would not be [...] "typically sitcomy." [...] He conceived the show as what Carlin's {{life would have been}} like had he never become a comedian; Carlin played a heavy drinking New York taxi driver. Simon commented: [...] "When I was doing The Simpsons, people couldn't see how smart {{it was because of the}} low moments. There's something about this show. People who like it say it's classy. They don't see how vulgar it is." [...] Carlin wrote negatively of his relationship with Simon. On his own website, Carlin wrote of the show: [...] "always check mental health of creative partner beforehand. Loved the actors, loved the crew. Had a great time. Couldn't wait to get the fuck out of there." [...] In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words (2009), Carlin elaborated: [...] "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... The biggest problem, though, was that Sam Simon was a fucking horrible person to be around. Very, very funny, extremely bright and brilliant, but an unhappy person who treated other people poorly." [...] Simon described himself as [...] "combative" [...] and said that most people see him as having a [...] "bad attitude".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Brian K. Roberts and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. Prior to writing the episode, Roberts had been an audio and visual editor on the show. Musician Ringo Starr made a guest appearance in the episode as himself. He was the first Beatle {{to appear on the}} show; both George Harrison and Paul McCartney would later guest star on the show in the season five episode [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" [...] and the season seven episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] respectively. When the story of Marge having a crush on Starr was pitched out, Roberts took the opportunity to write Starr into the script because he had always wanted to meet a Beatle. He then sent the script to Starr, who was then in Southern France. Starr agreed to do the guest appearance after only reading two lines, and he told Roberts that {{he would be able to}} do it when he visited Los Angeles a few weeks later. The staff of the show was thrilled when Roberts revealed that Starr had agreed to do it, and they immediately decided to expand Starr's role in the script. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening said of the guest appearance: [...] "We were so excited that we got Ringo Starr coming in to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> and we recorded him over at the Complex in West Los Angeles. We were given a list of rules about what we couldn't do to Ringo, such as 'Don't touch him', 'Don't approach him', and 'Don't ask for his autograph'. But of course when he shows up in this big limo, Brian brings out a big poster and asks him to sign it!" [...] Roberts explained that he had not received the memo with the rules so he showed up with a copy of the script cover and asked Starr to sign it. Groening asked Starr if he wanted to be animated the way he was in Yellow Submarine or the way he was in the cartoon series The Beatles. Starr chose Yellow Submarine because he did not like his appearance in the cartoon. In addition to Starr, the episode features a guest appearance by Jon Lovitz as Lombardo and the doughnut delivery man that delivers doughnuts to the nuclear power plant. Lombardo's physical appearance was based on an art teacher Reardon had in art school.|$|E
