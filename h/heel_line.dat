2500|$|The {{most famous}} {{surviving}} portrait of Charles Frederick Worth shows him wearing a hat, fur-trimmed cape and cravat. It appears {{that he had}} adopted this distinctive dress from the 1870s. A contemporaneous account from a visitor {{to the home of}} [...] "the Napoleon of costumiers" [...] in 1874 described Worth's entrance to meet his party in: [...] "a flowing grey robe that fell to his <b>heels,</b> <b>lined</b> with pale yellow, with a deep vest to match, and numerous other overlapping appliances that modified and gave elegance to a costume as unique as it was comfortable". The visitor, who described Worth as [...] "not a bit 'Frenchy'", also noted that he was of medium height, strongly but not stoutly built with a dark moustache and had the appearance of a man who lived temperately.|$|R
5000|$|Translated as [...] "bow stance", Gong Bu is {{also known}} as [...] "Deng Shan Bu" [...] (mountain-climbing stance) or [...] "Gong Jian Bu" [...] (bow and arrow stance). The lead foot is pointed {{straight}} ahead, with the lead leg bent slightly. The trailing foot is angled outward at a 45 degree angle, with the <b>heel</b> <b>lined</b> up with the heel of the leading foot. The trailing leg can be held straight or slightly bent. The result is a [...] "lunging" [...] pose. In southern styles, the toe is if it had stayed in Ma Bu; starting in Ma Bu, the hind leg steps forward and turns while the front leg stays in the same position. In northern styles, the toe points forward. The given weighting is 70% on the front foot and 30% on the rear.|$|R

40|$|Current {{techniques}} of rearfoot alignment measurement have been reviewed {{and a new}} clinical technique of rearfoot measurement in weight bearing stance has been developed. This technique was validated by radiographic and cadaveric anthropometric studies. The relationship between a central <b>heel</b> bisection <b>line</b> and the underlying bone structure was investigated, and showed that the <b>heel</b> bisection <b>line</b> was coincident with {{the centre of the}} x-ray image of the calcaneus at its upper margin, but appeared to be skewed to the lateral side of the image of calcaneus (to 40 % of its width) at its lower margin. A cadaveric study confirmed that this appearance arose {{as a result of a}} calcaneal tubercle that is larger medially than it is laterally. Reliability of rearfoot measurement was investigated and showed good repeatability (within the 0. 5 " resolution of the instrument) when made by an experienced podiatrist, with intratester repeatability of 0. 93 and 0. 95 (p [...] ...|$|R

25|$|In {{a steady}} downpour, 18th-ranked Maryland met North Carolina for the 17th time. North Carolina, Maryland head coach Tatum's alma mater, possessed a nine-game winning streak in the series. The first quarter {{remained}} scoreless, {{but in the}} second, North Carolina fumbled a punt by Maryland's Jack Targarona. The Terrapins' Karney Scioscia recovered {{the ball on the}} Tar <b>Heel</b> 31-yard <b>line.</b> DeStefano completed a 17-yard pass to Karnash and then connected with Augsburger on the Carolina eight-yard line. In two subsequent plays, the Terps pushed to the four-yard line. DeStefano then pitched to Shemonski who ran around end and into the end zone. Maryland managed to stop two North Carolina drives on the Terrapins' 28- and eight-yard lines. Late in the third quarter, Carolina mounted a drive into Maryland territory which continued into the fourth quarter. The Terrapins' defense held twice at their own one-yard line, but the Tar Heels' Bud Wallace pushed into the end zone on third down for the score. In the final minutes, Maryland drove to the Carolina 15-yard line. With five seconds remaining, guard Bob Dean missed on a field goal attempt, which resulted in a stalemate of 7–7.|$|R
25|$|The correct {{position}} for this discipline, {{as in all}} forms of riding, is a balanced seat. This is seen when a bystander can run an imaginary straight line that passes through the rider's ear, shoulder, hip, and heel. This means the rider's feet and legs must hang directly in balance so that the <b>heel</b> hits this <b>line,</b> with <b>heels</b> down. The rider should also be sitting as straight as possible, but with their hips under their body, sitting firmly on their seat bones, not sitting on one's crotch with an arched back. The rider should have their weight sunk into their seat and distributed through their legs. The rider's shoulders should be rolled back and their chin up {{to show that they}} are looking forward.|$|R
50|$|Intact {{stability}} calculations {{are relatively}} straightforward and involve {{taking all the}} centers of mass of objects on the vessel which are then computed/calculated to identify {{the center of gravity}} of the vessel, and the center of buoyancy of the hull. Cargo arrangements and loadings, crane operations, and the design sea states are usually taken into account. The photo at right illustrates a common misconception about vessels. In fact, {{in the vast majority of}} vessels, the center of gravity is well above the center of buoyancy. The ship is stable because as it begins to heel, one side of the hull begins to rise from the water and the other side begins to submerge. This causes the center of buoyancy to shift toward the side that is lower in the water. The job of the naval architect is to make sure that the center of buoyancy shifts outboard of the center of gravity as the ship <b>heels.</b> A <b>line</b> drawn from the center of buoyancy in a slightly heeled condition vertically will intersect the centerline at a point called the metacenter. As long as the metacenter is further above the keel than the center of gravity, the ship is stable in an upright condition.|$|R
50|$|Trikonasana {{is usually}} {{performed}} in two parts, facing left, and then facing right. The practitioner begins {{standing with the}} feet one leg-length apart, knees unbent, turns the right foot completely to the outside and the left foot less than 45 degrees to the inside, keeping the <b>heels</b> in <b>line</b> with the hips. The arms are spread out to the sides, parallel to the ground, palms facing down; the trunk is extended as far as is comfortable to the right, while the arms remain parallel to the floor. Once the trunk is fully extended to the right, the right arm is dropped so that the right hand reaches the shin (or a block or on the floor) to the front (left side) of the right foot, with the palm down if flexed. The left arm is extended vertically, and the spine and trunk are gently twisted counterclockwise (i.e., upwards to the left, since they're roughly parallel to the floor), using the extended arms as a lever, while the spine remains parallel to the ground. The arms are stretched away from one another, and the head is often turned to gaze at the left thumb, slightly intensifying the spinal twist. Returning to standing, the bend is then repeated to the left.|$|R

30|$|Treatment was {{provided}} by immediate closed reduction in the A & E department under sedation. Axial traction on the foot and <b>heel</b> in the <b>line</b> of deformity was combined with countertraction with the knee in flexion to relax the gastrocnemius muscle. Abduction of the foot and dorsiflexion of the ankle followed. After reduction, the ankle and foot were immobilized in a below-the-knee backslab followed by administration of analgesia and foot elevation. The backslab was transformed to a below-the-knee jigsaw cast 3 – 4  days post reduction {{as long as the}} swelling had subsided and non-weight-bearing (NWB) mobilization was allowed. Active ankle and foot ROM exercises were initiated {{by the beginning of the}} third week from reduction. Partial weight-bearing began after the third week, progressing to full weight-bearing (FWB) mobilization by the fifth week. Weight-bearing mobilization was assisted by the use of a below-the-knee functional brace that allowed plantarflexion and dorsiflexion but restricted inversion and eversion movements. Muscle-strengthening physiotherapy was implemented with the beginning of ROM exercises.|$|R
5|$|The {{first play}} of the drive was a six-yard run by Linton, and it was {{followed}} by an incomplete pass from Keldorf to Crumpler. Crumpler made up for the missed pass on the next play, when he caught a short pass for a first down from Keldorf. Now at the Hokies' 31, Linton ran straight ahead for a two-yard gain. Linton's run was followed by two incomplete passes by Keldorf, but rather than punt, the Tar Heels attempted to try to convert the fourth down. The fourth-down pass fell incomplete, and the Tar Heels turned the ball over on downs at the Tech 30-yard line. Clark completed a six-yard pass to Parker, then threw an incomplete pass downfield with less than a minute remaining on the clock. On third down, Clark completed a nine-yard pass to Michael Stuewe for a first down. A first-down pass attempt was batted down by the North Carolina defense, but on second down, Clark completed a pass to Stuewe for a first down at the Tar <b>Heels</b> 40-yard <b>line.</b> After a deep pass went incomplete, Clark was sacked and fumbled the ball {{for the second time in}} the first half. The loose ball was picked up by Vonnie Holliday with 13 seconds remaining, and the Tar Heels' offense returned to the field. North Carolina tried a deep pass in an attempt to get into scoring position before the end of the half, but Keldorf was sacked and the Tar Heels kneeled on the football to end the half with a 220 lead.|$|R
40|$|Further experimentations {{were made}} to improve the design and {{fabrication}} techniques of the integrated sole. The sole design is shown {{to be related to}} the foot position requirements and the actual shape of the foot including presence of neurotropic ulcers or other infections. Factors for consideration were: <b>heel</b> pitch, balance <b>line,</b> and rigidity conditions of the foot. Machining considerations were also part of the design problem. Among these considerations, widths of each contour, tool motion, tool feed rate, depths of cut, and slopes of cut at the boundary were the key elements. The essential fabrication techniques evolved around the idea of machining a mold then, using quick-firm latex material, casting the sole through the mold. Two main mold materials were experimented with: plaster and wood. Plaster was very easy to machine and shape but could barely support the pressure in the hydraulic press required by the casting process. Wood was found to be quite effective in terms of relative cost, strength, and surface smoothness except for the problem of cutting against the fibers which could generate ragged surfaces.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{computational}} model of stenotic {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) system with fluid-structure interaction (FSI) using realistic physiological conditions is introduced. Unsteady Pulsatile blood flow {{is applied to the}} wall of non-linear deformable arteries over the systolic period. In the analysis, the arbitrarily Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is used to couple the fluid region and solid domain. The method couples the equations of the deformation of the artery wall and applies them as the fluid domain boundary condition. The flow distribution and haemodynamic forces are presented in terms of velocity profiles and temporal and spatial wall shear stresses (WSSs) at the distal area. Rapid changes in the flow fields are observed {{in the early stages of}} the cardiac cycle, which alters the location of the recirculation zone from the toe to the host bed and then to the heel. The migration of the recirculation zone, considering the effect of deformability of the artery wall, indicates the same trend as the rigid wall model according to the location of low and high WSSs. However, the WSSs in the critical areas such as toe, <b>heel,</b> and suture <b>lines</b> are found to have dramatic drops in magnitudes in comparison with those of the rigid wall model.

40|$|The nearly {{epidemic}} {{expansion of}} cardiovascular diseases {{in western societies}} consist {{a serious threat to}} public health. In the last few decades, the proliferation of cardiovascular events along with the perpetual increase of life expectancy, generate the need for novel methodologies and tools in order to assist diagnostic and therapeutic management and design. The investigation of biochemical and mechanical factors within complex biological systems, such as encountered in coronary networks, merges multidisciplinary scientific fields. Although the mechanisms for the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis are not fully understood, it is well accepted that local blood flow dynamics {{play a major role in}} the localization of coronary artery disease (CAD). It has been shown that the most important risk factors for the development of CAD are low and/or high wall shear stress (WSS) regions, high pressure distributions along the vessels and long residence times of blood cells and lipoids at specific sites in vasculature. Moreover, in vivo animal models have revealed that specific sites in vascular network, such as <b>heel,</b> toe, suture <b>line</b> and walls just opposite to the junction, are most prone to CAD. The concept of total arterial revascularization (TAR) is widely accepted in modern practice of cardiac surgery, aiming at bypassing pathological conduits. This has led to the construction of composite arterial coronary grafts (CACGs) consisting mainly from different segments of internal thoracic and radial arteries. CACGs, in the routine practice of cardiac surgery, are conjugated to function either in parallel as Y, T and Π or in series as sequential graft, according to human anatomy. However, it is still unknown whether or not these CACGs can adequately meet the metabolic demands of the myocardium, especially under different loading conditions of the heart (coronary flow reserve). In the present work, a mathematical model for the simulation of blood flow within different configurations of CACGs under both steady and unsteady flow conditions is developed. The computational grids were generated based on multi-block structure in commercial CFD code, namely PHOENICS. The three-dimensional equations of fluid motion are numerically solved in a curvilinear, non-orthogonal coordinate system. The flow field is discretized by the Finite Volume Method and the solution is obtained using a guess-and-correct procedure employing a modified version of the semiimplicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLEST) algorithm. The numerical results of simulated blood flow within CACGs focus on computation of critical haemodynamic parameters such as flow rate ratios, velocity and WSS distributions and pressure drop along the arterial vessels. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal variations of haemodynamic factors under pulsatile flow conditions are numerically computed. The computational results are found in excellent agreement with in vitro experimental measurements of fluid (mixture of glycerol and water) flow for steady state conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{emotional}} body language {{has been the}} effort of many scientists for more than 200 years, from areas such as psychology, neuroscience, biology, and others. A lot of work {{has focused on the}} analysis of the kinematics, while the study of the underlying dynamics is still largely unexplored. In this thesis we model human walking as a nonlinear multi-phase optimal control problem to investigate the dynamics of full-body emotional expressions in human locomotion. Our approach is based on rigid multibody dynamics, a highly parameterized mathematical model of the human locomotion system, and the direct multiple-shooting method to analyze the dynamics of recorded kinematic motion capture data. Modeling the dynamics of a human rigid multibody model results in a set of highly complex differential algebraic equations that require automated methods to derive and evaluate. We created a new rigid multibody dynamics software package to model and numerically evaluate kinematic and dynamic quantities of rigid multibody systems expressed in generalized coordinates, including modeling of external contacts and discontinuities arising from contact events. Our package evaluates components of the equation of motion for multibody systems using recursive algorithms that are based on Featherstone's 6 -D spatial algebra notation. Our package is specifically tailored for the use in numerical optimal control and carefully designed to exploit sparsities and reduction of redundant computations by selectively reusing computed values. By doing so we are able to achieve and partially exceed performance that is otherwise only available with source code generation modeling approaches. We created a highly parameterized 3 -D meta model for the human locomotion system. This rigid multibody model is based on biomechanical data for kinematic and inertial parameters and enables us to create subject-specific dynamic models by adjusting segment dimensions, joint locations, and inertial parameters. To describe the contact between the human model and the ground, we created a non-holonomic rigid body contact model specifically for human walking movements that approximates the foot geometry using a sphere for the <b>heel</b> and a <b>line</b> segment at the ball of the foot during forefoot contact. Transforming motion capture marker data to rigid multibody motion is a difficult problem due to unknown joint centers, redundant marker movements, and non-rigid movement of markers as a result of skin and tissue movement. In this thesis, we developed and implemented a semi-automatic method in which we manually adjust the model to approximate the recorded subject and then compute joint angles by solving a non-linear least-squares optimization problem. Our approach is independent of the used motion capture marker set and directly maps onto the joint space of the model. We formulate two types of multi-phase optimal control problems for human walking: an inverse reconstruction problem and a gait synthesis problem that both have the differential equations of the rigid multibody dynamics as a constraint and can be used for different purposes. The reconstruction problem computes the unknown joint actuations from purely kinematic motion capture data. Applied to the recorded motion capture data, the reconstructed joint actuations show emotion specific features that are also found in the recorded muscle activity. This validates our model and approach to use optimal control problems as a tool to study emotional body language in a new way. Our gait synthesis formulation allows the generation of walking motions solely based on mathematical and physical principles. It can be applied in computer animation, robotics, and predictive gait analysis. We have generated a wide range of motions by adjusting objective function and gait parameters. A long-term goal of this formulation is to investigate optimality criteria of emotional walking motions. For this, we aim to use hierarchical optimal control problems in our future works...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{problems}} such as lameness, claw injuries and claw infections very commonly occur in sow housing, and are a primary cause of culling, especially among young animals. The culling of young animals is a large economic burden in pig production, and therefore it is of great importance to try to reduce problems related to claw health. In addition, claw injuries also lead to {{a significant amount of}} suffering for the animals, which is not in accordance with good animal welfare. Previous studies have shown an increased prevalence of claw health problems in housing systems where limited amounts of straw are given, and where there are slatted floors in the dung area of the pens. These conditions must be taken into consideration, since these pen types will soon be the most prevalent in modern Swedish pig production. In this study, the importance of straw for the occurrence of claw injuries, sow activity, pen hygiene, and animal well-being was studied in the pen system described above. All studies were carried out on gestating sows housed in dry sow pens of the type ” 2 rooms” (Figure 1), with liquid feed, trough feeding with trough dividers, and without being locked in during feeding times. A total of 24 pens were studied in three trials. In half of the studied dry sow pens (12 control pens, or 4 pens per trial), a small amount of straw was given (approx 200 g per sow per day), whereas {{the other half of the}} pens (12 study pens, or 4 pens per trial) received a larger amount of straw (approx 1000 g per sow per day). The straw was given after the morning feeding. The claw health of the animals was documented using claw studies carried out when they first entered the pen, and when they left the gestation unit. A total of 99 sows were examined in this study. For these studies, the sow was placed in a sow cradle (Figure 2) where the legs could be lifted individually, cleaned with a brush, water, and claw knife, and the claws examined. The observations were carried out using the same method and according to the same protocol as previously described. At the same time as the claw studies, observations were made of scratches/injuries and bites on the examined sows. In addition, the eating order of the sows was noted at three different times during their stay in the gestation unit. The sow that first left the trough at feeding times was given an eating order point of 1 (short time at the trough), while the sow that stayed the longest at the trough was given an eating order point of 3 (long time at the trough). The sows were also videotaped for 24 h to determine their activity and location in the pen. In addition, 2 h manual behaviour studies were carried out at times during their stay in these pens. In these studies, the presence of stereotypies in the group was especially noted (“chewing/biting the bars”, “chewing saliva”, “rolling the tongue”, and “licking the floor”). Hygiene level and cleanliness of the pens were evaluated using hygiene studies. Each pen was divided into 8 areas (Figure 3), and an evaluation of the amount of moisture and dirtiness were carried out using two parallel 3 -point scales. The results of the claw studies (combining all the claw injuries), bites and scratches, and the 24 -h studies of animal activity, were analysed statistically using the GLM procedure in SAS. The occurrence of claw injuries was analysed using a statistical model containing the following factors: amount of straw bedding, litter number, trial number, injuries, and eating order points at feeding. In the statistical model for the analysis of the sow activity/location during the entire day, the factors amount of straw and litter number were used. The amount of straw was the factor in the model for bites and scratches. For the other observations (occurrence of stereotypies, and the pen cleanliness studies, only the frequency and the mean were calculated. The claw studies showed the occurrence of 6 types of injuries: cracks in the claw wall, overgrown <b>heel,</b> white <b>line</b> injuries, injury to the border of the heel/toe, or toe injuries. Certain injury types occurred more often together with other types of injuries than others did. In Table 1, the significant correlations between the different injuries at entering the gestation unit are shown, and in Table 2 the significant correlations when leaving the unit. Cracks in the claw wall and white <b>line</b> injuries, and <b>heel</b> injuries and overgrown heels, respectively, appeared to occur at the same time. The statistical analyses were carried out on both the total material (that is, all sows) and on a portion of the material, consisting of those sows missing or which had minor wounds upon entering the gestation unit. The analyses of the total material (Table 3, Figure 5) showed that the older sows (litter number > 4) incurred significantly fewer claw injuries during gestation than the young animals did) In general, no other factor in the model was significant. However, it was noted that the sows having serious claw injuries already upon entering the unit did not tend to show an increase in these injuries as much as sows having no or light injuries upon entering did (Table 3, Figure 6). In pens with the larger straw ration, a nominally lower increase in the number of injuries on the sows was found in comparison to those occurring on sows housed in pens with the lower straw ration. This was true for all types of injuries (Figure 4). The results of the statistical analyses for sows with no or light injuries are presented in Table 4. When the animals with the more serious injuries were not included in the analyses, the effect of the amount of straw present was greatly increased, although not enough to reach significance, whereas the p-value for litter number increased somewhat. The incidence of bites and scratches generally decreased to some extent during the stay in the gestation unit (Table 5). This decrease was greatest on animals in the pens with the larger straw ration, but the difference in comparison with animals in the lower straw ration was not significant. The presence of a larger straw ration also appeared to have reduced the occurrence of stereotypies (Table 8) among the sows. The sows given the larger straw ration were observed to be lying down somewhat more in the dung area (Table 6), especially the older animals (Table 7). An interpretation of this result could be that the floor heated lying area with the larger amounts of straw at times was “too warm” for the sows. Generally, no differences in activity between the two groups of animals could be detected (Tables 6, 7). The effect of the amount of straw on pen moisture and cleanliness is given in Figures 7 and 8. The lying area was observed to be somewhat less damp and cleaner in pens given the larger straw ration. On the other hand, the larger amounts of straw were more difficult to press down through the slatted flooring, and as a result the pens were wetter and less clean in the dung area. In summary, the studies showed that the size of the straw bedding ration clearly had a positive effect on the prevalence of claw injuries, and that the use of plenty of straw bedding was also of importance for the welfare of the sows. The results of the studies are interpreted so that it should be possible to reduce the problem with claw injuries, which is often seen in pens with slatted floors and relatively small areas for the animal, by increasing the amount of the straw bedding. This method is also considered to be a better way of preventing problems with claw injuries than by replacing the slatted flooring in those types of pens (that is, in gestation pens for well-established sow groups) with solid flooring. In previous studies, changing the slatted floors to solid floors in gestation pens for dry sows did not show any large effect on claw health. The comparison and evaluation of housing systems is often difficult to carry out, because various factors must be considered at the same time to obtain an evaluation of the entire system. In this type of evaluation, it is common that the different parameters considered have different “weights” or importance. For example, often building costs are more important for the producer’s choice of housing system than what the system can mean for animal health and welfare, for animal handling, the working environment, the effect on the environment, etc. Different producers also have different considerations depending upon economics, their interests, and their viewpoints with respect to production and the future. Irrespective of what weight is put on the parameter animal health and welfare, it can, however, be proven that in the long-term viewpoint these factors are of great importance for production economy. A low incidence of disease and durable animals are important ingredients for a strongly competitive and enduring production. This study has shown that an abundant straw ration, as a specific factor, appears to be of great importance in ameliorating some of the animal health and welfare problems which can occur in some types of intensive housing systems. In general, the study also showed that perhaps it is not sufficient to indicate that the animal should have access to straw as a bedding material. The amount of straw available is also important and must therefore be more precisely defined...|$|R
