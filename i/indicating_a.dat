5|$|Like other Ojibwe dialects, Ottawa grammar {{includes}} animate and inanimate noun gender, subclasses of verbs {{that are}} dependent upon gender, combinations of prefixes and suffixes that are connected with particular verb subclasses, and complex patterns of word formation.

Ottawa has relatively flexible word order compared with languages such as English.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{is in the}} {{northern}} part of the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen: Cfa) However, under the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate maritime climate (Do).

5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus {{was rather}} small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, <b>indicating</b> <b>a</b> mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed on October11 {{in the central}} Atlantic Ocean, northeast of the Lesser Antilles and southeast of Bermuda. Two days later, a ship reported strong winds and a rapid pressure drop, <b>indicating</b> <b>a</b> hurricane was in the region; the tropical cyclone was given the name Jig. It moved northwestward, steadily intensifying before turning {{to the north and}} northeast. On October15, Hurricane Jig passed about 300mi (480km) east of Bermuda, and later that day its sustained winds reach peak winds of 115mph (185km/h), although the intensity was uncertain, based on estimates from the Hurricane Hunters. The hurricane began weakening on October16. Jig became an extratropical cyclone later that day and quickly dissipated, never having affected land due to its small size.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward off {{the coast}} of Africa on July 27. Initially, virgorous convection persisted throughout the wave axis, though dry air greatly diminished the convection on July 28. The wind field remained well-defined as it continued westward, and deep convection increased two days later along the northern end of the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began on July 30 in response to an increase in vertical depth and organization of the convection. On July 31 a buoy recorded a change of wind direction from northeast to west, <b>indicating</b> <b>a</b> small low pressure area formed. Convective organization rapidly increased as it turned to the northwest, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 1 while located about 235miles (375km) east-southeast of Barbuda.|$|E

The afterglow reached its peak luminosity in both bands approximately 2days after the burst was first detected—19.6±0.3 in the U-band at 02:13UTC on May11, and 19.8±0.2 in the R-band at 20:55UTC on May 10.|$|E
5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years {{around the turn of}} the millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, <b>indicating</b> <b>a</b> migration of the population.|$|E
