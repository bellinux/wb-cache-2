25|$|The {{advent of}} {{consumer}} digital cameras produced a new demand for HDR imaging {{to improve the}} light response of digital camera sensors, which had a much smaller dynamic range than film. Steve Mann developed and patented the global-HDR method for producing digital images having extended dynamic range at the MIT Media Laboratory. Mann's method involved a two-step procedure: (1) generate one floating point image array by global-only image operations (operations that affect all pixels identically, without regard to their local neighborhoods); and then (2) convert this image array, using local neighborhood processing (tone-remapping, etc.), into an HDR image. The image array generated by {{the first step of}} Mann's process is called a lightspace image, lightspace picture, or radiance map. Another benefit of global-HDR imaging is that it provides access to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>light</b> or radiance map, which has been used for computer vision, and other image processing operations.|$|E

Given a sparsely sampled reflectance field, we can effectively synthesize images {{as they would have}} been obtained from denser sampling. The processing pipeline consists of three steps: (1) segmentation of regions where <b>intermediate</b> <b>lighting</b> cannot be obtained by blending, (2) appropriate flow algorithms for highlights and shadows, plus (3) a final reconstruction technique that uses image-based priors to faithfully correct errors that might be introduced by the segmentation or flow step.

40|$|We have {{distinguished}} {{two types}} of melanocyte within the intermediate layer of the stria vascularis in the cochlea of normally pigmented mice: <b>light</b> and dark <b>intermediate</b> cells. The <b>light</b> <b>intermediate</b> cells {{are present in the}} stria from birth and have the typical appearance of a melanocyte. They are large and dendritic with electron-lucent cytoplasm containing numerous vesicles that show tyrosinase activity, and pigment granules in various stages of development. These granules have the ultrastructural and histochemical characteristics of premelanosomes and melanosomes. The <b>light</b> <b>intermediate</b> cells persist throughout life, but less frequently contain pigment in older animals. The dark intermediate cells, present only in adult mice, vary considerably in number and distribution between animals. Pigment granules, bound within an electron-dense acid phosphatase-rich matrix, form the main component of the dark intermediate cells. The intermediate cells may comprise either two distinct cell populations or different developmental stages of the same cell type; ultrastructural observations suggest the latter. In young mice, <b>light</b> <b>intermediate</b> cells contain the electron-dense matrices, which at later stages of development are found almost exclusively in dark cells. The dark intermediate cells contain few cell organelles other than pigment granules accumulated within lysosomal bodies and they often have pycnotic nuclei. These observations suggest that the dark intermediate cells are a degenerate form of the <b>light</b> <b>intermediate</b> cells. Clusters of melanosomes also occur in the basal cells, and to a much lesser extent in the marginal cells. These cells do not stain after incubation in DOPA, suggesting that they are not capable of melanin synthesis, and therefore probably acquire melanin by donation from adjacent melanocytes. Pigment clusters are also found within the spiral ligament at all stages of development...|$|R

40|$|In Mediterranean climates, {{seedlings}} {{are frequently}} shaded {{in the nursery}} to avoid heat damage and save water. However, {{the impact of this}} shading on the seedling quality and transplanting performance of Mediterranean species is not well known. We studied the effect of nursery shading on pre-planting features and post-planting performance of two Mediterranean tree species: the shade-intolerant pioneer Pinus halepensis and the shade-tolerant late-successional Quercus ilex. We grew one-year-old seedlings of both species under 100, 40 and 5 % full sunlight. Shade had a low impact on the morphology and physiology of Q. ilex seedlings. In pines, only the deep shade treatment produced low quality seedlings with poor root development. In both species, transference to high light at planting in autumn did not impose any additional stress than that caused by frosts, but initial root growth was impaired in the two shaded treatments in pine. Post-planting growth and survival of oak seedlings showed no difference between treatments.

In March 2011, recruits were incubated at 31, 41, 70, 122 and 226 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1 under ambient (493 µatm) and high PCO 2 (878 µatm). After 5 days, calcification was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated {{as the number of}} living recruits. Calcification was affected by the interaction of PCO 2 with light, and at 493 µatm PCO 2 the response to light intensity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 μatm PCO 2, {{the effect of}} light on calcification differed from that observed at 493 μatm PCO 2, with the result that there were large differences in calcification between 493 µatm and 878 µatm PCO 2 at <b>intermediate</b> <b>light</b> intensities (ca. 70 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1), but similar rates of calcification at the highest and lowest light intensities. Survivorship was affected by light and PCO 2, and was highest at 122 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1 in both PCO 2 treatments, but was unrelated to calcification. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high PCO 2 decreased calcification of P. damicornis recruits at <b>intermediate</b> <b>light</b> intensities, but not at lower or higher intensities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of PCO 2 on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory effects of high PCO 2 on calcification at <b>intermediate</b> <b>light</b> intensities that disappear at both higher and lower light intensities...|$|E
40|$|Endosymbiosis allows hosts {{to acquire}} new {{functional}} traits {{such that the}} combined host and endosymbiont can exploit vacant ecological niches and occupy novel environments [1, 2]; consequently, endosymbiosis affects the structure and function of ecosystems [3, 4]. However, for many endosymbioses, it is unknown whether their evolutionary basis is mutualism or exploitation [5 - 9]. We estimated the fitness consequences of symbiosis using {{the interaction between the}} protist host Paramecium bursaria and the algal symbiont Chlorella sp. [10]. Host fitness was strongly context dependent: whereas hosts benefited from symbiosis at high light intensity, carrying endosymbionts was costly to hosts in the dark and conferred no benefit over growing autonomously at <b>intermediate</b> <b>light</b> levels. Autonomous Chlorella densities increased monotonically with light intensity, whereas per-host symbiont load and symbiont abundance peaked at <b>intermediate</b> <b>light</b> levels and were lowest at high light intensity. This suggests that hosts controlled the costs of symbiosis by manipulating symbiont load according to light intensity. Photosynthetic efficiency was consistently lower for symbiotic compared to autonomous algae, suggesting nutritional constraints upon algae in symbiosis. At <b>intermediate</b> <b>light</b> levels, we observed the establishment of small populations of free-living algae alongside the hosts with endosymbionts, suggesting that symbionts could escape symbiosis, but only under conditions where hosts didn't benefit from symbiosis. Together, these data suggest that hosts exerted strong control over endosymbionts and that there were no conditions where this nutritional symbiosis was mutually beneficial. Our findings support theoretical predictions (e. g., [5, 9]) that controlled exploitation is an important evolutionary pathway toward stable endosymbiosis...|$|E

40|$|SummaryEarly in infection, {{adenovirus}} {{travels to}} the nucleus as a naked capsid using the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein. How the dynein complex is recruited to viral cargo remains unclear. We find that cytoplasmic dynein and its associated proteins dynactin and NudE/NudEL, but not LIS 1 or ZW 10, colocalized with incoming, postendosomal adenovirus particles. However, in contrast to physiological cargos, dynein binding to adenovirus was independent of these dynein-associated proteins. Dynein itself directly interacted through its <b>intermediate</b> and <b>light</b> <b>intermediate</b> chains with the adenovirus capsid subunit hexon in a pH-dependent manner. Expression of hexon or injection of anti-hexon antibody inhibited virus transport but not physiological dynein function.

Loosening and separation of the sheath from the protoplasmic cylinder was observed as early as 2 min after exposure to complement. Virulent leptospires of this serotype were morphologically intact after 1 hr of exposure to antibody and complement. Similarly, treatment of leptospires of the serotype patoc with normal serum and complement severely damaged the sheath structure. Removal of the sheath of both serotypes permitted lysozyme {{to act on the}} wall of the protoplasmic cylinder. Thus, morphological evidence for the location of the mucopeptide-containing structure of these leptospires was obtained. Viable leptospires with intact sheaths were resistant to lysozyme alone.
