2500|$|The lead single, had an on air, on sale release, Roberts {{stated that}} Universal Records wanted {{to release the}} track that way, {{as it was the}} way they were {{releasing}} all of their new work. The release of this nature, was due to illegal downloading, and the record label was attempting to avoid illegal downloads as much as possible as Roberts stated, [...] "it's now harder for artists". Talking of Girls Aloud, Roberts stated she was used to releasing a song after around six weeks of promotion, including radio, television and press promotion, and commented that it was [...] "very scary" [...] to release a song without this publicity. She also noted the effect of this kind of release against chart positions, she said, [...] "I think it's harder for the public now because it's always been about the chart position. I also think it takes the excitement out of the charts because it's not a competition anymore." [...] The album artwork and track-listing were confirmed on 22 August 2011 on Roberts official website, the announcement came with confirmation that fans who pre-ordered the album on Play.com would receive a signed poster, and those who pre-ordered the song from digital store iTunes would have an exclusive highlight video montage of her webisode series Through Nicola's Eyes.

For the performance Roberts wore five-foot hair extensions that touched the ground, which proved restricting for her movements, in addition to wearing shorts with [...] "big pompoms on the back". Writing as a guest blogger for site Holy Moly, Roberts discussed the event saying [...] "the crowd was incredible. I had to take my in-ears out because they were so loud I thought, ‘They’re gonna deafen me and I’m not gonna be able to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> my set’.
