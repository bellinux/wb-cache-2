Without Loxton's personal appeal, the Liberals lost the seat to the ALP upon his departure. As he continued to play first-class cricket for three years after his election to parliament, he was a busy man, and teammates described him as a hard-working representative, recalling that he often brought his political paperwork to the ground with him, going through the material while waiting in the dressing room for his turn to bat.

Scrub itch, a skin irritation caused by mite bites, was a more common but far less serious ailment. Tinea was also a problem, due to the inability of men to keep their clothes or boots dry, or to wash them. A shortage of fresh fruit and vegetables caused vitamin-deficiency-related problems.

40|$|A major {{limit to}} the {{application}} of certain vitrification techniques is the direct contact between the medium containing the embryo and the liquid nitrogen (LN 2). This may consequently {{be a source of}} infection. This report describes an attempt to overcome this problem by applying sterile conditions for the recently introduced Open Pulled Straw (OPS) vitrification method. The whole vitrification procedure is performed in a laminar hood using filtered liquid nitrogen for cooling. The embryo-containing OPS is then placed into a 0. 5 ml plastic straw pre-cooled in the vapor of liquid nitrogen. The straw is hermetically sealed and stored in non-filtered liquid nitrogen. At warming, the large straw is kept vertically and half-immersed in the liquid nitrogen, the end cut and then the OPS is quickly removed and warmed directly in the culture medium. The procedure is <b>fairly</b> simple, <b>safe</b> and does not decrease the in vitro survival rates of in vitro produced bovine blastocysts. The possibility to perform sterile OPS vitrification is a prerequisite for using this technique in accordance with the sanitary regulations and may result in a significant extension of its application...|$|R

Of these, 3 appeared to have necrotising enterocolitis; 3 had salmonella or shigella dysentery; in 3 of the remaining 4 the findings were localised to the anus, with normal mucosa above. This was attributed to a mild rectal prolapse on straining. There was no correlation between the severity of the diarrhoea and the presence of colitis. Proctoscopy is safe and valuable in the early diagnosis of necrotising enterocolitis. It is also helped in assessing the progress of the disease...|$|R

40|$|Background: Intraoperative smear {{cytology}} {{provides a}} rapid and reliable intraoperative diagnosis and guidance to the neurosurgeon during surgical resection and lesion targeting. It also helps the surgeon {{to monitor and}} modify the approach at surgery. Objectives: 1) To assess the utility of intraoperative smear cytology and correlate with the �nal histopathological diagnosis. 2) To describe the cytomorphological features of common brain tumours in smear preparation. Materials and methods: The material {{for this study was}} obtained from 100 consecutive biopsies of central nervous system neoplasms sent for intraoperative consultation. Smears were prepared from the biopsy samples sent in isotonic saline for immediate processing. The smears were stained by the rapid Haematoxylin and Eosin method. The cytomorphological features were noted and correlated with paraf�n section �ndings. Results: Of the total 100 cases, 86 showed accuracy when compared with histopathological diagnosis. This was comparable with other studies. Of the remaining, two cases were frank errors, 12 cases showed partial correlation, with �ve cases showed incomplete typing of the cell type and seven, discrepancy in grading of tumours. The error percentage was 14 %. Correlation with clinical details and radiological �ndings were helpful in improving the accuracy rate.

40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} role of image-guided, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the diagnosis of retroperitoneal and spinal lesions. Materials and Methods: Over a period of one year, ultrasonography and computerized tomography-guided FNAC was performed in 55 cases who had presented clinically with signs and symptoms related to the retroperitoneum and spine. Histopathological confirmation was available in 27 out of 55 cases. Results: Of the 55 cases, 39 were males and 16 were females. Malignant and benign lesions accounted for 58. 2 and 29. 1 &#x 0025; respectively. Among the cases on whom radiologically guided FNAC was performed, the spine contributed the largest proportion of cases (32. 7 &#x 0025;), followed by renal lesions (20 &#x 0025;). Among the malignant lesions, renal cell carcinoma {{was the most common}}ly found malignancy, followed by metastasis to the spine. In the benign and inflammatory category, tuberculosis of the spine and the lymph nodes was the most common lesion accounting for 68. 7 &#x 0025; of all cases. On correlating clinical, radiological, and cytologic features, the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of guided FNAC obtained in this study were 97. 1, 84. 2, and 92. 4 &#x 0025; respectively. Conclusions: Radiologically guided FNAC is a <b>fairly</b> accurate and <b>safe</b> procedure in diagnosing the most difficult cases in the region of the retroperitoneum and the spine...|$|R

50|$|The {{streets in}} Midtbyen are mostly narrow {{and laid out}} in a {{somewhat}} chaotic pattern. Many are closed to motorized traffic, instead serving as pedestrian zones with a lively street life and shopping opportunities. Outside of these areas, a lot of the roads are one way directed and {{it can be difficult to}} navigate or find a free parking spot, if you do not know the area well. Midtbyen has some heavy traffic during rush hours and it can also be a problem. To guide the traffic and take of the pressure, the inner city of Aarhus is surrounded by a number of ring roads. In Midtbyen, the streets of Nørre Allé (Northern Avenue), Vester Allé (Western Avenue) and Sønder Allé (Southern Avenue), works as a ring road, following the former city walls of medieval times and guiding the traffic around the narrow and most difficult streets of the inner centre. There are several large car parks in or just outside the city centre, including Magasin du Nord, Dokk1, Aarhus City Tower, Brunn's Galleri, Scandinavian Center and Storcenter Nord. Most of the yellow city buses in Aarhus pass through Midtbyen, while the blue regional and Inter-city buses terminate at the Aarhus Bus Terminal close to the Central Station. The street of Park Allé (Park Avenue) next to the City Hall, serves as a major bus hub. Even though the traffic situation can be difficult for motorized vehicles, it is <b>fairly</b> easy and <b>safe</b> to walk or bike around Midtbyen. Major roads has bike paths next to them and some streets are dedicated bike roads. It is not allowed to bike in the pedestrianised zones.|$|R
40|$|Greater {{focus is}} needed on {{improving}} patient safety in modern healthcare {{systems and the}} first step to achieving this is to reliably identify the safety issues arising in healthcare. Research has shown the accident and emergency (AandE) department to be a particularly problematic environment where safety is a concern due to various factors, such as the range, nature and urgency of presenting conditions and the high turnover of patients. As in all healthcare environments clinical incident reporting in AandE is an important tool for detecting safety issues which can result in identifying solutions, learning from error and enhancing patient safety. This tool must be responsive and flexible to the local circumstances and work for the department to support the clinical governance agenda. In this paper, we describe the local processes for reporting and reviewing clinical incidents in one AandE department in a London teaching hospital and report recent changes to the system within the department. We used the historical data recorded on the Trust incident database as a representation of the information that would be available to the department in order to identify the high risk areas. In this paper, we evaluate the internal processes, the information available on the database and make recommendations to assist the emergency department in their internal processes. These will strengthen the internal review and staff feedback system so that the department can learn from incidents in a consistent manner. The process was reviewed by detailed examination of the centrally held electronic record (Datix database) of all incidents reported in a one year period. The nature of the incident and the level and accuracy of information provided in the incident reports was evaluated. There were positive aspects to the established system including evidence of positive changes made {{as a result of the}} reporting process, new initiatives to feedback to staff, and evolution of the programme for reporting and discussing the incidents internally. There appeared to be a mismatch between the recorded events and the category allocated to the incident in the historical record. In addition the database did not contain complete information for every incident, contributory factors were rarely recorded and relatively large numbers of incidents were recorded as "other" in the type of incident. There was also observed difficulty in updating the system as there is at least a months time lag between reporting or an incident and discussion/resolution of issues at the local departmental clinical risk management committee meetings. We used Leape's model for assessing the reporting system as a whole and found the system in the department to be relatively <b>safe,</b> <b>fairly</b> easy to use and moderately effective. Recommendations as a result of this study include the introduction of an electronic reporting system, limiting the number of staff who categorise the incidents [...] using clear definitions for classifications including a structured framework for contributory factors, and a process that allows incidents to be updated on the database locally after the discussion. This research may have implications for the incident reporting process in other specialities as well as in other hospitals...|$|R
