2500|$|In September 2009, <b>Valve</b> <b>flew</b> two of {{the boycott}} group's most {{prominent}} members to Valve, in order to playtest Left 4 Dead 2; the two felt that the sequel was well done. This event, {{through a series of}} correspondences made in jest, shortly led to Valve's Gabe Newell and designer Erik Johnson flying to Australia to visit [...] "Joe W-A", a Left 4 Dead modder. Newell jokingly reported that Valve was [...] "boycotting" [...] Joe's new mod for the game when Joe asked when he would be <b>flown</b> to <b>Valve</b> {{in the same manner as}} the Left 4 Dead 2 boycotters, but whimsically offered that if Joe was to pay to fly him to the country, he would take a look at it. Joe was able to raise the required funds, US$3000, through donations through his website, though ultimately Newell paid for the trip himself, with Joe's collected donations going to the Child's Play charity.|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{breakage}} of one {{of three}} flow control valves on the previous flight, STS-126, the flow valves of all orbiters were subjected to tests to determine if Discovery was safe to <b>fly.</b> These <b>valves</b> are used to synchronize the flow of gaseous hydrogen between the external fuel tank and the Space Shuttle Main Engines, creating an even flow. Following the testing of the valves, mission managers decided to postpone the launch, and engineers were asked to replace the suspect flow valves with valves that had less flight time.|$|R
50|$|The Saxxy Awards is {{an annual}} {{competition}} for films that is hosted by video game developer, Valve. The first competition {{was held in}} 2011 and included 20 competition categories. In 2012, the number of categories was limited to five. Voting for the second annual competition ran from November 16, 2012, until November 27, and four of the winners were revealed on the 30th. The 2011 winners each received an in-game item for Team Fortress 2 which was a golden statue {{of one of the}} game's characters, Saxton Hale, who was the namesake for the awards; the item resembles an Academy Award. The 2012 finalists received an item which was simply a video camera that is used as a melee weapon, while the winners each received a saxxy statue. The winner of the 2012 'best overall' category was <b>flown</b> to <b>Valve</b> for a filmmaking session with the company's very own filmmakers. At the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards, the final winner from the Best Overall category was revealed: a short film titled Story of a Sentry.|$|R
40|$|The stage-regulated HASPB and SHERP {{proteins}} of Leishmania major {{are predominantly}} expressed in cultured metacyclic parasites that are competent for macrophage uptake and survival. The role of these proteins in parasite {{development in the}} sand fly vector has not been explored, however. Here, we confirm that expression of HASPB is detected only in vector metacyclic stages, correlating with the expression of metacyclic-specific lipophosphoglycan and providing the first definitive protein marker for this infective sand fly stage. Similarly, SHERP is expressed in vector metacyclics but is also detected at low levels in the preceding short promastigote stage. Using genetically modified parasites lacking or complemented for the LmcDNA 16 locus on chromosome 23 that contains the HASP and SHERP genes, we further show {{that the presence of}} this locus is essential for parasite differentiation to the metacyclic stage in Phlebotomus papatasi. While wild-type and complemented parasites transform normally in late-stage infections, generating metacyclic promastigotes and colonizing the sand <b>fly</b> stomodeal <b>valve,</b> null parasites accumulate at the earlier elongated nectomonad stage of development within the abdominal and thoracic midgut of the sand fly. Complementation with HASPB or SHERP alone suggests that HASPB is the dominant effector molecule in this process...|$|R
5000|$|The quick-opening [...] "pop" [...] valve was a {{solution}} to this. Their construction was simple: the existing circular plug valve was changed to an inverted [...] "top hat" [...] shape, with an enlarged upper diameter. They fitted into a stepped seat of two matching diameters. When closed, the steam pressure acted only on the crown of the top hat, and was balanced by the spring force. Once the valve opened a little, steam could pass the lower seat and began {{to act on the}} larger brim. This greater area overwhelmed the spring force and the <b>valve</b> <b>flew</b> completely open with a [...] "pop". Escaping steam on this larger diameter also held the valve open until pressure had dropped below that at which it originally opened, providing hysteresis.|$|R
40|$|Chitinases of trypanosomatid parasites {{have been}} {{proposed}} to fulfil various roles in their blood-feeding arthropod vectors but so far none have been directly tested using a molecular approach. We characterized the ability of Leishmania mexicana episomally transfected with LmexCht 1 (the L. mexicana chitinase gene) to survive and grow within the permissive sand fly vector, Lutzomyia longipalpis. Compared with control plasmid transfectants, the overexpression of chitinase was found to increase {{the average number of}} parasites per sand fly and accelerate the escape of parasites from the peritrophic matrix-enclosed blood meal as revealed by earlier arrival at the stomodeal <b>valve.</b> Such <b>flies</b> also exhibited increased damage to the structure of the stomodeal valve, which may facilitate transmission by regurgitation. When exposed individually to BALB/c mice, those flies with chitinase-overexpressing parasites spent on average 2. 4 - 2. 5 times longer in contact with their host during feeding, compared with flies with control infections. Furthermore, the lesions that resulted from these single fly bite infections were both significantly larger and with higher final parasite burdens than controls. These data show that chitinase is a multifunctional virulence factor for L. mexicana which assists its survival in Lu. longipalpis. Specifically, this enzyme enables the parasites to colonize the anterior midgut of the sand fly more quickly, modify the sand <b>fly</b> stomodeal <b>valve</b> and affect its blood feeding, all of which combine to enhance transmission...|$|R
40|$|Differentiation of {{extracellular}} Leishmania promastigotes {{within their}} sand fly vector, termed metacyclogenesis, {{is considered to}} be essential for parasites to regain mammalian host infectivity. Metacyclogenesis is accompanied by changes in the local parasite environment, including secretion of complex glycoconjugates within the promastigote secretory gel and colonization and degradation of the sand <b>fly</b> stomodeal <b>valve.</b> Deletion of the stage-regulated HASP and SHERP genes on chromosome 23 of Leishmania major is known to stall metacyclogenesis in the sand fly but not in in vitro culture. Here, parasite mutants deficient in specific genes within the HASP/SHERP chromosomal region have been used to investigate their role in metacyclogenesis, parasite transmission and establishment of infection. Metacyclogenesis was stalled in HASP/SHERP mutants in vivo and, although still capable of osmotaxis, these mutants failed to secrete promastigote secretory gel, correlating with a lack of parasite accumulation in the thoracic midgut and failure to colonise the stomodeal valve. These defects prevented parasite transmission to a new mammalian host. Sand fly midgut homogenates modulated parasite behaviour in vitro, suggesting a role for molecular interactions between parasite and vector in Leishmania development within the sand fly. For the first time, stage-regulated expression of the small HASPA proteins in Leishmania (Leishmania) has been demonstrated: HASPA 2 is expressed only in extracellular promastigotes and HASPA 1 only in intracellular amastigotes. Despite its lack of expression in amastigotes, replacement of HASPA 2 into the null locus background delays onset of pathology in BALB/c mice. This HASPA 2 -dependent effect is reversed by HASPA 1 gene addition, suggesting that the HASPAs may have a role in host immunomodulation...|$|R
