40|$|The {{repeated}} {{application of}} fluid <b>pressure</b> in a <b>vessel</b> poses a fatigue problem,which at <b>high</b> <b>pressures</b> {{can be in}} the low endurance range. Therefore for the design of <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels,</b> {{it is important to know}} the dependence of endurance on applied pressure. This involves a knowledge of the steady cyclic stress-strain state in the vessel. In the present work various models of cyclic stress-strain distribution in a thick monobloc tube (diameter ratio 3 - 7) are examined assuming different degrees of stress shakedown during cycling. It is possible to determine upper and lower bound solutions on the stress-strain state and also an intermediate solution which agrees well with expcrimental data on En 1 A steel. Once the steady stress-strain state is known, it is possible to predict the dependence of endurance on applied pressure by use of the Coffin-Manson failure criterion. Experimental fatigue tests were performed on monobloc vessels of En 1 A and the results were in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions. Fractographic studies justified the use of the Coffin-Manson law.
