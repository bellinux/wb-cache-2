40|$|In {{the highly}} {{connected}} and globalised corporate workplace, face-to-face communication is persisting and expanding, despite significant advances and investments in telecommunication. Drawing {{on interviews with}} 34 employees from an Australian company trying to reduce air travel associated with business meetings, this paper reveals how telepresence facilitates distinctly different practices of meeting and collaborating to those enabled by face-to-face encounters. The analysis {{draws attention to the}} essential role of the body in the practices of virtual and <b>in-person</b> business <b>meetings.</b> During <b>in-person</b> <b>meetings</b> the body&# 039;s physical presence conveys meanings of respect and value, provides sensorial competency and gestures, and enables physical mobility as it carries people between and within different material environments. The paper concludes by identifying some possibilities for telepresence meetings to replicate and replace <b>in-person</b> <b>meetings</b> as a normal and effective way of collaborating in the global workplace...|$|R

5000|$|Much of the {{business}} world relies on communications between {{people who are not}} physically in the same building, area, or even country; setting up and attending an <b>in-person</b> <b>meeting,</b> telephone call, or conference call can be inconvenient, time-consuming, and costly. Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set-up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{criticism}} is that [...] "social selling" [...] is an overhyped buzzword {{rather than a}} true sales methodology.

Richards debriefed Petrov, starting on the day of his formal defection.|$|E
5000|$|Since the BPDG {{was formed}} by {{companies}} from the 5C and 4C consortia, {{it is difficult to}} imagine that it would recommend that their technologies not be permitted. Subsequently, the specific technology list was removed from Table A; the current discussion draft from BPDG does not contain any specific technologies at all, though it still bans [...] "unauthorized" [...] technologies by default. But now Table A has been left blank, and a discussion has begun about a proper procedure for choosing technologies to be added. (This shift took place as a result of a discussion at the last BPDG <b>in-person</b> <b>meeting</b> in Los Angeles.) ...|$|E

Dion was so moved and impressed by O that she insisted on going backstage afterwards {{to get to know the}} performers. Franco Dragone in turn heard about Dion's favorable reception of his work, and several weeks later, wrote a letter to them to put forth the idea of an artistic collaboration. Angelil called Dragone, they arranged an <b>in-person</b> <b>meeting,</b> and A New Day... was the result.|$|E
50|$|For Prime Minister, Dekanozov {{selected}} a known leftist journalist and fellow traveler Justas Paleckis. Later, in his memoirs, Paleckis {{claimed that the}} offer came as a complete surprise. Krėvė-Mickevičius, a writer, was selected for {{the second most important}} post. He gave the new government a desired public image. He became perhaps the most controversial figure of the People's Government. He was the first to voice his objections to incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. On July 1, after an <b>in-person</b> <b>meeting</b> with Molotov, Krėvė-Mickevičius submitted his resignation, but Paleckis refused it. He then took an extended vacation and was replaced by communist Mečislovas Gedvilas. Ernestas Galvanauskas remained as Minister of Finance. Having served as Prime Minister twice, Galvanauskas was an established political leader and opponent of Smetona's regime. General Vincas Vitkauskas was a veteran of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence and Klaipėda Revolt. The government thus appeared to be left-leaning but non-communist.|$|E
