The show {{featured}} more than 60 artists from different countries, including approximately 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs, and installations. The surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act, and André Breton named Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray, Salvador Dali, and Max Ernst to help him. At the exhibition's entrance he placed Salvador Dalí's Rainy Taxi, a work consisting of a taxicab rigged to produce a <b>drizzle</b> <b>of</b> water down the inside of its windows, with a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat, and a blond mannequin covered with live snails in the back. In this way Duchamp confronted guests entering the exhibition, who were in full evening dress.|$|E
500|$|Gonzalo {{generated}} hurricane-force winds across Bermuda over {{a period}} of about six hours, at their strongest from the northwest on the backside of the storm. Tropical storm conditions persisted for up to 24hours. Elevated weather stations observed the highest winds; Commissioner's Point recorded 10-minute sustained winds of , and St. David's measured gusts as high as [...] Gusts reached [...] at the Causeway, closer to sea level. The airport recorded [...] of rain, but due to the strong winds, this was most likely an underestimation of what actually fell. The passage of the hurricane's eye was marked by diminished winds and a lack of rain, but a <b>drizzle</b> <b>of</b> ocean mist reportedly fell over the island. As Gonzalo struck at low tide, the effects of storm surge were minimal. At Esso Pier {{on the north side of}} the island, storm tides peaked at [...] above normal.|$|E
500|$|In 2010 he was {{paired with}} Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson), who was later killed-off after Stenson quit her role. This {{resulted}} in a long-running storyline for Gilly {{in which he was}} seen taking a [...] "dark journey" [...] unable to cope with grief. Another big storyline for the character occurs in 2011 when Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) accuses him of rape; the storyline subsequently received media attention. A fictional jury consisting of viewers is to decide if he is guilty or innocent. Other storylines have involved the effects of binge drinking, which was portrayed during an online spin-off drama. Gilly has sometimes proved unpopular with television critics, with one branding him a [...] "dampy <b>drizzle</b> <b>of</b> a character". Quinlan has also been nominated for minor awards for his portrayal. In 2011, it was announced that Quinlan would be leaving the serial to pursue other projects and would leave {{at the end of the}} rape storyline.|$|E

Some {{restaurants}} use an artistic <b>drizzling</b> <b>of</b> chocolate syrup to decorate servings of cheesecake or cake, along with other decorations such as cocoa powder, powdered sugar or chocolate shavings. Some brands of chocolate syrup are marketed as chocolate milk syrup (e.g., Nestle Quik). Other brands are marketed as ice cream sundae toppings.|$|R

Fresh raspberries, a <b>drizzling</b> <b>of</b> raspberry and/or chocolate sauce, and dustings of powdered sugar may be added to enhance flavor, or a sprig of mint may look more appealing as well. For a more intense chocolate taste, the baker may also add a tablespoon of strong coffee.|$|R
40|$|This {{sensitivity}} {{study examined}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>drizzle</b> on hailstorm characteristics and precipitation on the ground. A cloud-resolving mesoscale model with a two-moment bulk microphysical scheme is modified by introducing mixing ratio and number concentration <b>of</b> <b>drizzle.</b> Therefore, the cloud model integrates the mixing ratio and number concentration of the eight microphysical particles: cloud droplets, drizzle, raindrops, cloud ice, snowflakes, graupel, frozen raindrops and hailstones. We compared two microphysical schemes depending on whether drizzle particles are present or not. It can {{be noted that the}} presence <b>of</b> <b>drizzle</b> category slows the development of the rain in the hailstorm and its appearance on the ground. The increased values of radar reflectivity factor in simulations with drizzle are a result of significantly higher values of raindrop number concentration rather than their sizes and indicate the presence of hail as well. There are prominent decreases of the radar reflectivity factor in simulations with <b>drizzle.</b> The occurrence <b>of</b> heavy showers does not exist in results without <b>drizzle.</b> The absence <b>of</b> <b>drizzle</b> category leads to greater accumulations of rain and a wider area of downdrafts. The alternate case produces both weaker downdrafts and smaller area of downdraft cells due to a slower autoconversion <b>of</b> <b>drizzle</b> to rain and a smaller rain evaporation. A smaller amount of surface hail is expected in the non-drizzle case...|$|R

He was also nominated {{in the category of}} [...] "Best Serial Drama Performance" [...] at the 2011 National Television Awards. That same year he {{was nominated}} in the category of [...] "Best Actor" [...] at the British Soap Awards. Ruth Deller of Lowculture has criticised Gilly, branding him as a poor character. Commenting on Steph's death she stated: [...] "No wonder that, gazing upon his face, she realised she was better off burning to death than enduring one more day staring at him." [...] She praised Paul Marquess' cast cull of 2010, but stated that Gilly is [...] "still hanging around like that bit of dog mess you can’t get out of the grooves in your trainers." [...] She also opined: [...] "A damp <b>drizzle</b> <b>of</b> a character, Gilly hasn’t worked as Rhys’s wide boy sidekick, hasn’t worked as a loved-up hippy, hasn’t worked as a doting husband, doesn’t work on any level." [...] Also stating she wanted Hollyoaks serial killer Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle) to kill him.

2500|$|... 1938 - A new Exposition Internationale du Surréalisme {{was held}} at the Beaux-arts Gallery, Paris, with more than 60 artists from {{different}} countries, and showed around 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs and installations. The Surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act and called on Marcel Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray and others to do so. At the exhibition's entrance Salvador Dalí placed his Rainy Taxi (an old taxi rigged to produce a steady <b>drizzle</b> <b>of</b> water down the inside of the windows, and a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat and a blond mannequin crawling with live snails in the back) greeted the patrons who were in full evening dress. Surrealist Street filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various Surrealists. Paalen and Duchamp designed the main hall to seem like subterranean cave with 1,200 coal bags suspended from the ceiling over a coal brazier with a single light bulb which provided the only lighting, as well as the floor covered with humid leaves and mud. The patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art. On the floor Wolfgang Paalen created a small lake with grasses and the aroma of roasting coffee filled the air. Much to the Surrealists' satisfaction the exhibition scandalized the viewers.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} <b>of</b> <b>drizzle</b> {{formation in}} shallow stratocumulus clouds {{and the effect}} of turbulent mixing on this process are investigated. A Lagrangian–Eularian model of the cloud-topped boundary layer is used to simulate the cloud measured during flight RF 07 of the DYCOMS-II field experiment. The model contains ~ 2000 air parcels that are advected in a turbulence-like velocity field. In the model all microphysical processes are described for each Lagrangian air volume, and turbulent mixing between the parcels is also taken into account. It was found that the first large drops form in air volumes that are closest to adiabatic and characterized by high humidity, extended residence near cloud top, and maximum values of liquid water content, allowing the formation of drops as a result of efficient collisions. The first large drops form near cloud top and initiate drizzle formation in the cloud. Drizzle is developed only when turbulent mixing of parcels is included in the model. Without mixing, the cloud structure is extremely inhomogeneous and the few large drops that do form in the cloud evaporate during their sedimentation. It was found that turbulent mixing can delay the process <b>of</b> <b>drizzle</b> initiation but is essential for the further development <b>of</b> <b>drizzle</b> in the cloud...|$|R
