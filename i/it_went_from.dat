5|$|New York State Route32B (NY32B) was a {{state highway}} in the Capital District region of New York, in the United States. The western {{terminus}} of the route was at an intersection with NY32 in Queensbury. Its eastern terminus was at a junction with U.S. Route4 (US4) in Hudson Falls. NY32B, named Warren Street in Queensbury and River Street in Hudson Falls, ran {{along the banks of}} the Hudson River as <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> Glens Falls to Hudson Falls. It crossed over the Glens Falls Feeder Canal near its junction with NY32 in Queensbury.|$|E
5|$|The 2014–15 team {{needed to}} replace the losses of Nik Stauskas, Mitch McGary and Glenn Robinson III to the 2014 NBA draft and Jon Horford and Jordan Morgan to graduation. It began the season ranked in both the AP Poll (#24) and Coaches' Poll (#23). Guard Caris LeVert was named a preseason All-American {{according}} to numerous media outlets and preseason All-Big Ten according to the Big Ten media. LeVert, however, suffered a season-ending foot injury in January. At {{the end of that}} month, Derrick Walton was sidelined for the season. The team struggled without two of its leaders as <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> a 6–3 win–loss record in conference to finish 8–10. After falling in the quarterfinals of the 2015 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament the team's season ended with a 16–16 record.|$|E

25|$|The {{welfare and}} {{leaseback}} programs got an abrupt ending as well. Eventually rulings {{were made on}} the tax issues making the sale-and-lease-back model less favorable. This {{as well as the}} bad media coverage of Brixtofte meant that investors lost faith in the administration. This caused the collapse of various plans that should have kept the scheme going, such as the sale of certain building sites. On top of that came increasing rent costs from the previous sales and eventually the municipality was forced to abandon the extraordinary welfare programs and dramatically raise its taxes. <b>It</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> being one of the cheapest {{to one of the most}} expensive municipalities in Denmark.|$|E
25|$|The Bangladeshi bowlers bowled patiently, but {{the poor}} start had cost them badly, and <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> {{bad to worse}} when Nazmul limped off in his seventh over. He was {{eventually}} substituted for Tushar Imran, while Aftab Ahmed took over his bowling duties. Neither could contain the Sri Lankans, though, as the captain Marvan Atapattu and wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara took Sri Lanka past 200 with 11 overs to go. Sangakkara eventually fell to Rafique, {{and in the next}} over Syed Rasel got rid of pinch hitter Dilhara Lokuhettige for 2, only to see Mahela Jayawardene, the man of the last match, come in to partner Atapattu. The pair added 43 from the last 26 balls, Atapattu recording a whirlwind 53 while Jayawardene closed on 23.|$|E
25|$|Growth spilled {{past the}} city's {{southern}} boundary, into Groesbeckville, an unincorporated hamlet of the Town of Bethlehem. <b>It</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> almost no residents in 1845 to {{over a thousand}} ten years later. Its streets, too, were organized on a grid pattern, but one slightly offset from Albany's, a pattern still visible today. By the 1860s, residents of the hamlet were being listed in Albany's city directory and considered themselves socially and culturally {{to be part of}} the city. In 1870 their petition to make this a legal and political reality was accepted and the city's boundary was extended a mile (1.6km) to the south, to its present location along the Normans Kill, creating the area of Albany known as the First Ward.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{the camps}} were {{situated}} on German territory; {{a certain number}} were built in occupied territories, notably in northern and eastern France. They began to be developed starting in 1915 {{when the number of}} prisoners being held captive in Germany reached 652,000. According to official directives, each prisoner had to have use of 2.5 m². The camps mixed a large number of nationalities sharing the same quarters: French, Russian, British, American, Canadian, Belgian, Italian, Romanian, Serbian, Montenegrin, Portuguese and Japanese prisoners were found there, as well as Greeks and Brazilians. Equally, soldiers of various social origins rubbed elbows: workers, peasants, bureaucrats and intellectuals were among those held. The number of prisoners rose very quickly. From February to August 1915, <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> 652,000 to 1,045,232. In August 1916, it reached 1,625,000, jumping to 2,415,000 by October 1918.|$|E
25|$|Zastava {{continued}} to produce vehicles for the Yugoslav and European markets until exports were limited by sanctions {{imposed by the}} United Nations in the 1990s. In 1984, automobile entrepreneur Malcolm Bricklin tested the United States market for Zastava vehicles, now branded as Yugo. As a result, in mid-1986, Yugo America began selling cars at a starting price of $3,990 for the entry-level GV ("Good Value") hatchback equipped with the 1,100 cc overhead-cam five-main-bearing engine and four-speed manual transmission. The similar GVL offered a plusher interior, but the sporty top-line GVX was powered by the 1300 cc engine mated to a five-speed manual transmission, and included as standard equipment a number of deluxe features such as a ground-effects package, alloy wheels, and rally lights. However, though the GVX was billed as an upscale, sporty version of the base GV, <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> 0-60mph in 13.56 seconds, just a half a second faster than the GV. When the political instability in Yugoslavia intensified in early 1992, Zastava was forced to stop exports.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect on}} beaver stocks of {{competition}} between the English and the French was disastrous. The status of beavers changed dramatically as <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> being a source of food and clothing for the Aboriginals to a vital good for exchange with the Europeans. The French were constantly in search of cheaper fur and trying {{to cut off the}} Aboriginal middleman which led them to explore the interior all the way to Lake Winnipeg and the Central Plains. While some historians dispute the claims that the competition was predominantly responsible for over-exploitation of stocks, others have used empirical analysis to emphasize the changing economic incentives for Aboriginals and role of the Europeans in the matter. Innis holds that the population of beavers decreased dramatically even before the rivalry in the 1700s and stocks in far-flung western areas were increasingly being tapped before there was any serious {{competition between the}} English and the French. However, there is widespread agreement on the matter in ethnohistory literature that Aboriginals depleted the resource. Calvin Martin holds that there was a breakdown of the relationship between man and animal in the values of the Aboriginals which made them drastically accelerate the exploitation of reserves.|$|E

Randolph was put {{at the end of a}} branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. The attempt to move the county seat to Randolph was defeated [...] "by a bare majority of voters".|$|E

500|$|A special {{interview}} with Ohkawa and Kiichiro Sugawara, Clamp's editor from the Weekly Shōnen Magazines Editorial Department, took {{place after the}} story of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle had progressed past the arc from Ōto Country. Ohkawa has stated that the group is very conscious {{of the fact that}} Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle is the title in Shōnen Magazine with the youngest readership and that it is their very first foray into the shōnen demographic. Thus, the members of Clamp ensure that they employ a drawing style and dialogue appropriate for young male audiences; the manga incorporates furigana that makes reading Japanese easier. To aid in this effort, the group holds conferences with Sugawara where they discuss the plot. Ohkawa stated during the interview that the only time the story significantly changed was during Country of Jade arc; <b>It</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> a [...] "horror story with vampires" [...] to a [...] "detective mystery". Following the story in the Piffle Country, Clamp aimed to make the series darker and more complex, resulting in it receiving elements previously seen in other of their series. The Shura Country's story was written to introduce the idea that a dead person cannot be revived even if somebody travels back to the past and changes history. This theme would be further explored later in the story.|$|E
