5000|$|Once {{the main}} gang leader is {{defeated}} in either Tsuppari Wars (ツッパリウォーズ) or Tsuppari Suku (ツッパリスク) mode, the remaining {{members of the}} <b>gang</b> <b>switch</b> membership to become a gray-colored gang {{that does not have}} a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the [...] "neutral gangs." [...] These [...] "neutral gangs" [...] will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying [...] "no" [...] when asked to fight ("Struggle").|$|E
50|$|For many years, he {{supported}} the Samajwadi Party headed by Mulayam Singh Yadav, but the <b>gang</b> <b>switched</b> to Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party in mid-2000s. He has recently fought elections under Apna Dal and Peace Party of India in 2012.|$|R
5000|$|The {{little boy}} {{walks up to}} Garance and cries [...] "mummy" [...] who is then joined by Cash. The con is then explained. Maxime was working with Cash to set up Molina because she ordered Lardier to kill Cash's brother. He died because she {{realised}} he was conning {{her out of the}} money she had accumulated from skimming confiscated loot taken in her Interpol raids. When she tripped, the <b>gang</b> <b>switched</b> the jewel case. Molina now realises she's been set up for the robbery and the mercenaries are intent on killing her. The entire gang, including Letallec and Vincent, gather on the hotel terrace and toast themselves and Cash's dead brother.|$|R
50|$|Months later, {{they were}} hired by Arcade to kidnap Courtney Ross, Captain Britain's former girlfriend. In Arcade's deadly theme park Murderworld, the Crazy Gang fought Captain Britain's new group Excalibur. Crazy Gang member Tweedledope {{had created a}} device that allowed the Crazy <b>Gang</b> to <b>switch</b> bodies with Excalibur, {{but in the end}} Excalibur managed to restore {{everything}} back to normal.|$|R
50|$|The Asiatic lion {{currently}} {{exists as}} a single subpopulation, and is thus vulnerable to extinction from unpredictable events, such as an epidemic or large forest fire. There are indications of poaching incidents in recent years. There are reports that organized <b>gangs</b> have <b>switched</b> attention from tigers to these lions. There have also {{been a number of}} drowning incidents after lions fell into wells.|$|R
5000|$|By 2011 it was {{reported}} that <b>gangs</b> had <b>switched</b> from selling drugs to offering women as prostitutes. A city crackdown along Western Boulevard forced a motel to stop renting rooms by the hour, but the street, as Los Angeles Times columnist Sandy Banks reported, had long been [...] "a hub for prostitution, a money-making spot for locals and a standard stop on the circuit for statewide trafficking rings." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{returned}} with the gang to Minneapolis {{at the end of}} the year, where along with seven other men, including Bill Weaver, Doyle, Verne Miller, Karpis and the Barker brothers held up a bank for $22,000 in cash and another $92,000 in bonds on December 16. The robbery turned violent as DeVol killed Patrolmen Ira Evans and Leo Gorski outside the bank. Fred Barker also killed an innocent bystander when the <b>gang</b> were <b>switching</b> getaway cars in St. Paul.|$|R
50|$|On celebration day the Minister {{is still}} worried. Spottiswood {{tells him to}} stop worrying: she will have the sixth form girls take some suggestive {{pictures}} with the Ministry men, and agrees {{when he says that}} would be blackmail. Harry, with the intention of demanding more than the offered reward, calls Edward Noakes (Colin Gordon), the insurance assessor for the robbery, claims to know where the loot is, and offers to meet Noakes. The Parkmoor Catering Co., staffed by the gang, arrives at St. Trinian's and, as a decoy, set up the catering end of their mission. Harry, disguised, meets Noakes, but someone recognizes him, and Noakes leaves. At St. Trinian's Alfred, using a Polaroid camera that the boss has converted into a two-way radio is told that Noakes has been sighted nearby talking with an unknown man, and must be eliminated if he comes to the school. The boss sends Alfred a photo of Noakes for identification. Harry phones the police to claim the reward, but his claim is ignored. At the lunch, one of the girls recognizes Gilbert as someone who used to be at the pub with her father, but thinks no further about this. On the dais, the Minister hears some rumbling under the stage, which, Spottiswood explains, are the three Ministry men blundering around in the cellar. After lunch, as everyone goes outdoors, Alfred finds that some girl has taken his disguised radio transmitter. Backstage, the gang pries open the floorboards and begin to retrieve the loot. Outdoors, it soon begins to rain and everyone goes inside again. As the Morris Dancing (The Westminster Morris Men) takes place on stage, the gang continues to retrieve the loot. When the lead dancer notices the gang backstage, Alfred takes his place until the gang has finished retrieving the money, and they all leave in the catering truck. Meanwhile, three girls bring Alfred's radio apparatus to Harry and turn it on. The boss, thinking Alfred has contacted him, explains that the gang must eliminate the unknown man who had been with Noakes, and transmits a photo of Harry. When one of the girls tells Harry that she had recognized one of the waiters, Harry realizes the caterers are the thieves. Some of the girls go to the ballroom to catch the gang, and one of them tells Spottiswood about the disguised gang. Harry then mobilizes the girls to chase and capture them. Now Noakes calls the police and tells them the stolen money has just left St. Trinian’s. Some police head for school, and others to the local train stations. When Harry finds the train with the loot getting away, he goes to the signal box and throws a lever engaging a stop sign; while the train is stopped two girls unhitch the van with the loot. When Harry disengages the stop sign, the crooks take off, use an extra lever they brought along to switch onto the line which will take them to the boat, disengage the switch, and hide the lever by throwing it in a nearby waterhole. Then they realize the van is missing, and are forced to waste time finding the lever to throw the switch, while a large group of girls, who have taken over a train and followed the gang, annex the van, and head back to the station. Finally, the <b>gang</b> throws the <b>switch</b> and chases the girls. At a different station, the police commandeer a train and, thinking they are behind the two trains, take off in pursuit, only to realize they are in front of the two trains, and reverse direction, as do the other trains. Eventually, the girls shunt the gang, followed by the police, into a station where they are blocked by a stopped train, and the police capture the gang except for Alfred. Meanwhile, the girls have switched to a different track and take off in the opposite direction and stop at Pudham, where they are found by other policemen and credited with returning the loot and earning the reward.|$|R
