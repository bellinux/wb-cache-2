5|$|Burney was {{reluctant}} to publish the study {{for fear of being}} labeled a cryptozoologist, but eventually published the results in American Anthropologist.

He was {{released}} few years later, with the general amnesty that was proclaimed by the Young Turks; Evangelos Chatzieleftheriou, from Dovista; Vasilios Psitis, from Dovista; Anastasios Abliamis, from Dovista; Nikolaos Tsiapos, from Dovista; Nikolaos Achiniotis, from Achinos, Serres; Sotirios Siosios, <b>from</b> Subaskioy (<b>modern</b> Neo Souli, Serres); Chrysafis Patramanis (the only survivor), from Subaskioy; Ioannis Stenimachiotis, from Stenimaka; Ilias Karlikioylis, <b>from</b> Karlikioy (<b>modern</b> Chionochori, Serres); Christos Frastanlis, <b>from</b> Frastani (<b>modern</b> Oreini, Serres); Andonis Nouskalis, <b>from</b> Kato Nuska (<b>modern</b> Dafnoudi, Serres).|$|R
5|$|The {{cane toad}} {{is an old}} species. A fossil toad (specimen UCMP 41159) from the La Venta fauna of the late Miocene of Colombia is indistinguishable <b>from</b> <b>modern</b> cane toads from {{northern}} South America. It was discovered in a floodplain deposit, which suggests the R. marina habitat preferences have long been for open areas.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} great {{interest}} in human evolution. Neanderthal fossils were discovered in 1856, {{but at the time}} it was not clear that they represented a different species <b>from</b> <b>modern</b> humans. Eugene Dubois created a sensation with his discovery of Java Man, the first fossil evidence of a species that seemed clearly intermediate between humans and apes, in 1891.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{neighbouring}} principality of Smilets at Kopsis, Aldimir remained {{loyal to the}} Bulgarian government and ensured that his domain retained its ties to the capital Tarnovo. Fine describes Aldimir's lands as spanning the region <b>from</b> <b>modern</b> Sliven in the east to Kazanlak or Karlovo in the west, {{just south of the}} Balkan Mountains. His capital was the fortress of Kran in the Rose Valley.|$|E

5|$|Although {{survival}} in undisturbed sites is high, at 80–90%, the corn crake suffers <b>from</b> <b>modern</b> farming practices, since mechanised mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks {{in a given}} site. The influence of weather on corn crake chick survival is limited: although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than the}} weather, with lower {{survival in}} large broods.|$|E
5|$|By 1474, cannons {{had been}} {{introduced}} in Mdina. Other extensive preparations for an attack {{were made in the}} 1480s, when the fortifications were once again improved under the direction of Sicilian military engineers. At this point, some buildings in Rabat were demolished to clear the fortifications' line of fire. By 1522, the fortifications were being modernized with the construction of embrasures. However, the walls were still regarded as obsolete, since they lacked bastions and could not resist bombardment <b>from</b> <b>modern</b> artillery.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, the Outer Loop was {{complete}} from NY383 to US104 {{west of the}} city and <b>from</b> <b>modern</b> I-590 exit1 to the lakeshore east of Rochester. NY47 followed the loop from US104 south to NY383 and from Elmwood Avenue north to modern NY590 exit8; north of that point, the expressway was part of US104 and NY18. NY47 was extended northward along the remainder of the Sea Breeze Expressway in 1970. On March18, 1980, the NY47 designation was removed and replaced with several others, primarily I-390, I-590, NY390, and NY590.|$|E

5|$|Chromium, use of: The use of {{chromium}} {{was invented}} in China no later than 210 BC when the Terracotta Army was interred at a site not far <b>from</b> <b>modern</b> Xi'an; modern archaeologists discovered that bronze-tipped crossbow bolts at the site {{showed no sign of}} corrosion after more than 2,000 years, because they had been coated in chromium. Chromium was not used anywhere else until the experiments of French pharmacist and chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1763–1829) in the late 1790s.|$|E
5|$|Colonial orthography {{is marked}} {{by the use of}} c for /k/ (always hard, as in cic /kiik/), k for /q/ in Guatemala or for /k’/ in the Yucatán, h for /x/, and tz for /ts/; the absence of glottal stop or vowel length (apart {{sometimes}} for a double vowel letter for a long glottalized vowel, as in uuc /u’uk/), the use of u for /w/, as in uac /wak/, and the variable use of z, ç, s for /s/. The greatest difference <b>from</b> <b>modern</b> orthography, however, is in the various attempts to transcribe the ejective consonants.|$|E

5|$|Domestication of {{the horse}} most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500 BC. Two major sources of {{information}} are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world.

5|$|During Darius's Greek expedition, he {{had begun}} {{construction}} projects in Susa, Egypt and Persepolis. He had linked the Red Sea to the river Nile by building a canal (Darius Canal) which ran <b>from</b> <b>modern</b> Zaqāzīq to modern Suez. To open this canal, he travelled to Egypt in 497 BCE, where the inauguration was carried out with great fanfare and celebration. Darius also built a canal to connect the Red Sea and Mediterranean. On this visit to Egypt he erected monuments and executed Aryandes on the charge of treason. When Darius returned to Persis, {{he found that the}} codification of Egyptian law had been finished.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route14, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} extended from Corning to Rochester via South Bristol and Pittsford. The majority of Route14 south of Pittsford was routed {{on what is}} now NY64; however, {{in the vicinity of}} Bloomfield, Route14 broke <b>from</b> <b>modern</b> NY64 and used what later became NY20C to access Holcomb. At the same time, the portion of current NY64 that overlaps with US20 and NY5 was included in Route6, a cross-state highway connecting Albany to Buffalo. On March1, 1921, Route14 was altered to bypass Holcomb to the south on what is now NY64.|$|E
