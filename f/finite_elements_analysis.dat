With the assistance of <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>analysis</b> many companies and industries have decreased the time and cost of product production. Currently, the athletic shoe industry does not use <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>analysis</b> in the shoe development process. The goal of this project was to implement <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>analysis</b> into the athletic shoe design process with the intent of decreasing time to market and cost. This effort determined <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>analysis</b> is not recommended to design and test an entire athletic shoe.

5000|$|Computer-aided {{manufacturing}} (CAM) Interactive {{analysis and}} engineering. Today nearly {{all aspects of}} power plant simulation require extensive off-line setup, calculation, and iteration. The time required for each iteration can range {{from one day to}} several weeks. Tools for interactive collaborative engineering in which the engineer can establish a dynamic thinking process are needed to permit real-time exploration of the “what-if” questions that are essential to the engineering process. In nearly all circumstances, an engineering answer now has much greater value than an answer tomorrow, next week, or next month. Although many excellent engineering analysis techniques have been developed, they are not routinely used as a fundamental part of engineering design, operations, control, and maintenance. The time required to set up, compute, and understand the result, then repeat the process until an adequate answer is obtained, significantly exceeds the time available. This includes techniques such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), <b>finite</b> <b>elements</b> <b>analysis</b> (FEA), and optimization of complex systems. Instead, these engineering tools are used to provide limited insight to the problem, to sharpen an answer, or to understand what went wrong after a bad design and how to improve the results next time. This is particularly true of CFD analysis.|$|E
