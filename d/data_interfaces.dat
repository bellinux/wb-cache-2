25|$|Zvezda uses {{gyroscopes}} and thrusters to turn itself around. Gyroscopes do {{not require}} propellant, rather they use electricity to 'store' momentum in flywheels by turning {{in the opposite direction}} to the station's movement. The USOS has its own computer controlled gyroscopes to handle the extra mass of that section. When gyroscopes 'saturate', thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum. During Expedition 10, an incorrect command was sent to the station's computer, using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed. When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, it can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which has no thrusters. When an ATV, NASA Shuttle, or Soyuz is docked to the station, it {{can also be used to}} maintain station attitude such as for troubleshooting. Shuttle control was used exclusively during installation of the S3/S4 truss, which provides electrical power and <b>data</b> <b>interfaces</b> for the station's electronics.|$|E

40|$|A DRAM {{communicates}} with a {{processing unit}} via two interfaces: a <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> and a command interface. In today 2 ̆ 7 s DRAMs, {{also known as}} synchronous DRAMs (SDRAMs), both interfaces use a clock {{to communicate with the}} processing unit. The clock times the communication between the processing unit and the SDRAM on both the <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> and the command interface. We propose a self-timed DRAM. The self-timed DRAM introduces more flexibility into the DRAM interface by eliminating the clock. The command <b>interface</b> and the <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> each communicate with the processing unit using a handshake protocol rather than a clock. This thesis presents the <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> between the self-timed DRAM and the processing unit. The proposed <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> is self-timed. The self-timed <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> allows the DRAM to deliver data to or accept data from the processing unit as the processing unit demands rather than on a schedule set from the command <b>interface.</b> The self-timed <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> is designed using GasP circuits and micropipeline circuits. The design is simulated in 180 nm CMOs process technology using hspice. This thesis presents the effects of width mismatch on the self-timed <b>data</b> <b>interface.</b> The micropipeline is slightly faster than the GasP. Also, the thesis compares the self-timed DRAM <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> with synchronous DRAM for the data burst rate...|$|R

30|$|The {{supplier}} <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> (c_ 5) ranks third, {{and before}} the SCADA modules (fourth and fifth, respectively), although the supplier <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> has a lower interference degree than the SCADA modules. This {{can be explained by}} the impact location of the failing IT components. The supplier <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> influences the first process step, in contrast to the SCADA modules, which influence later process steps. Therefore, an interesting insight is that the impact location in the production network is an important factor because the supplier <b>data</b> <b>interface’s</b> restriction causes production failures in all subsequent process steps of our smart factory example. Further, the SCADA module for the sewing machines has a partial backup, which reduces its threat potential.|$|R
