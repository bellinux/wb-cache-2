When Beyoncé <b>does</b> <b>an</b> album, when Beyoncé sings a song, when Beyoncé does anything, it's an event, and it's broadly influential. Right now, she is the heir-apparent diva of the USA – the reigning national voice. In 2014, Beyoncé was listed again on the Time 100 and also featured {{on the cover of}} the issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{phonology}} {{of words}} {{has proven to}} be beneficial to vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that they already know to learn new words. The phonological loop encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities in the area of phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 and adolescence), so <b>does</b> <b>an</b> individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.|$|E

5|$|As {{the fifth}} book begins, the setting shifts briefly to North America. Following the Ural War, the Japanese had led an Asian {{occupation}} of western North America. The local populations, inspired by Native American beliefs and mythologies, react by leaving the cities for the wilderness and destroying the food factories and cities, eventually driving out the Asian occupation. In America and then globally people begin leaving cities {{in favor of}} the wild. Shamanism and the belief in ghosts reemerge amongst the populace, as <b>does</b> <b>an</b> oral tradition of story-telling. The draining of the cities grows into a settler movement: egalitarian communities that live in nature, characterized by gender equality and sexual liberation. In response to the threat this movement poses to the ruling Senates, political leaders in London hatch a plan to colonize Greenland, thereby channeling both the drive for technological innovation and the drive to settle new land.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} family arrive at their new house in Cypress Creek, they meet Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, {{who is very}} amiable and seems like the perfect boss. After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that his job is to motivate the {{employees}} in the nuclear division. Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read cursive writing, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer <b>does</b> <b>an</b> excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very proud of him.|$|E

25|$|It {{is not a}} {{question}} of an assault in the classic sense of the word. What <b>does</b> <b>an</b> assault on a city mean?

It means heavy bombing raids on the whole city with the aim of disabling 60% of the defenders and demoralizing the rest.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} {{crossing}} numbers originated in Turán's brick factory problem, in which Pál Turán {{asked for a}} factory plan that minimized the number of crossings between tracks connecting brick kilns to storage sites. Mathematically, this problem can be formalized as asking for the crossing number of a complete bipartite graph, The same problem arose independently in sociology at approximately the same time, {{in connection with the}} construction of sociograms. Turán's conjectured formula for the crossing numbers of complete bipartite graphs remains unproven, as <b>does</b> <b>an</b> analogous formula for the complete graphs.|$|E

25|$|This {{raises the}} {{question}} why <b>does</b> <b>an</b> employer ever do {{more than it is}} legally obliged to do ? One theory seeking to explain this behaviour is that employment {{is an example of a}} relational contract, based upon a relationship of trust between the parties. The explicit terms of the contract are just an outline as there are implicit terms and understandings which determine the behaviour of the parties. The High Court has long held there is a distinction between the employment relationship and the contract of employment.|$|E
25|$|Secret sharing (also called secret splitting) {{consists}} of methods for distributing a secret amongst {{a group of}} participants, each of whom is allocated {{a share of the}} secret. The secret can be reconstructed only when a sufficient number of shares, of possibly different types, are combined together; individual shares are of no use on their own. A secret sharing scheme is perfect if every collection of participants that does not meet the criteria for obtaining the secret, has no additional knowledge of what the secret is than <b>does</b> <b>an</b> individual with no share.|$|E

25|$|The first {{national}} Greek census after 1923, conducted in 1928, showed {{the number of}} the Greeks of Asia Minor origin to be 1,164,267 (probably over 3million). Some refugees had moved to Russia and the Middle East in previous years. Approximately 250,000 Greek Americans of Asia Minor descent had emigrated to the United States between 1866 and 1917, had American citizenship, and thereby would not become refugees; they would, however, be deprived from their property rights in their ancestral homeland, as well as from their right to return. It is usually estimated that the refugees in Greece numbered approximately 1.5million people. Descendants of the refugees took part in the great Greek migrations of the Interwar period, as well as the large immigrations to the United States, Australia and Germany in the 1960s-1970s. Today, about 40% of the population of Greece claims full or partial descent from the Asia Minor refugees; as <b>does</b> <b>an</b> almost equal percentage of diasporan Greeks.|$|E
25|$|ETFs have a {{reputation}} for lower costs than traditional mutual funds. This will be evident as a lower expense ratio. This is mainly from two factors, the fact that most ETFs are index funds and some advantages of the ETF structure. However, this needs to be compared in each case, since some index mutual funds also have a very low expense ratio, and some ETFs' expense ratios are relatively high. An index fund is much simpler to run, since it does not require some security selection, and can be largely done by computer. Not only <b>does</b> <b>an</b> ETF have lower shareholder-related expenses, but because it does not have to invest cash contributions or fund cash redemptions, an ETF does not have to maintain a cash reserve for redemptions and saves on brokerage expenses. Mutual funds can charge 1% to 3%, or more; index fund expense ratios are generally lower, while ETFs are almost always less than 1%. Over the long term, these cost differences can compound into a noticeable difference.|$|E
