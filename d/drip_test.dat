40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} relationship between poultry PSE meat and water loss of frozen chicken carcass in two experiments. The first experiment was carried out in commercial abattoir. Poultry carcass were classified as PSE meat (n= 59) (pH 5. 8). Water absorption and <b>drip</b> <b>test</b> were performed according to the Brazilian legislation methodologies. The second experiment was carried out with commercial whole five brands frozen carcasses purchased from the local supermarkets (n= 30) and analyzed for pH, water holding capacity (WHC) and <b>drip</b> <b>test.</b> PSE poultry meats absorbed 3. 59 % of water during the processing similar to the control samples; however, released 0. 38 % more water during thawing of the carcasses. From these five brands evaluated, three presented drip values above 6. 0 %. The highest drip value was showed by the brand sample that had pH and WHC values characteristics of PSE meat. It could be postulated that PSE meat phenomenon promoted more water release during thawing leading to a misinterpretation in relation to the Brazilian legislation for water carcass liberation during thawing...|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of vinyl nail-on {{windows in the}} North American new home construction market has prompted ASTM International to write ASTM E 2112 - 01 "Standard Practice for Installation of Exterior Windows, Doors and Skylights". This thesis focuses on the window jamb flashing recommendation in ASTM E 2112 - 01 for vinyl nail-on windows by asking {{the question of whether}} a vinyl window's integral nail-on flange is by itself an adequate jamb flashing. To answer this question, the Jamb <b>Drip</b> <b>Test</b> was designed and completed on fourteen (14) window/wall details. The answer to the question depends on the window/wall construction sequence. When the weather resistant barrier (WRB) is installed prior to the window, it isn't. When the WRB is installed after the window, the nail-on fin is by itself an adequate jamb flashing. Based on this Jamb <b>Drip</b> <b>Test</b> study, a recommended window/wall construction sequence of sheathing- flashing (sill, jamb and head) - vinyl nail-on window - WRB - siding option is proposed. This sequence recognizes that while the nail-on fin may be an adequate jamb flashing, without flashing, the designer cannot take full advantage of the symbiotic relationship between the nail-on flange and the space it creates between the adjoining building elements (e. g. sheathing and the WRB). In this capacity, jamb flashing is added to the construction sequence to protect the sheathing from wetting and aid in directing incidental water to the exterior. Based on this proposed construction sequence, effort was focused on improving the present state of the art window/wall weatherproofing detail. An alternative to the use of high performance sealant to create the seal between the flashing and the window's nail-on flange is proposed. The present recommendation uses a(cont.) one-piece folded sheet that envelops the window flange, WRB {{and at the same time}} incorporates the window flashing function. This novel, dual function (window seal + window flashing system) product is called w-Flashing. The thesis ends with a description of w-Flashing's performance attributes, prototype design and recommended installation sequence around a vinyl nail-on window. by Austin Parsons. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|As {{part of the}} U. S. National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program, {{aluminide}} fuels (UAl{sub x}) {{are being}} tested under conditions that might exist in the proposed repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Intermittent <b>drip</b> <b>tests</b> at 90 C were completed for up to 183 days on partially declad, unirradiated, low-enriched UAl{sub x} samples. Through 183 days of exposure to modified water from the J- 13 well at 90 C, the fuel coupon remained in good mechanical condition. Only a tarnishing of the surface was observed and no spalled products {{were found in the}} fuel holder. The mechanism for alteration is consistent with that observed from dry oxidation experiments on UAl{sub x} (for the initial corrosion) and humid UO{sub 2 } oxidation (for the subsequent paragenesis). Specifically, solid-state conversion of UAl{sub x} into UO{sub 2 } and oxidized Al is followed by further oxidation, dissolution of the uranium, and reprecipitation as uranyl oxyhydroxides. The release rate of uranium varied from 0. 23 to 2. 9 mg/m{sup 2 }/day (avg. = 0. 97 mg U/m{sup 2 }/day) depending on the specimen and test interval, but was similar in magnitude to that observed in earlier flow-through and <b>drip</b> <b>tests</b> with irradiated UAl{sub x} and UO{sub 2 }. Most (mean= 87 %) of the released uranium sorbed to the vessel walls. Colloids were detected in the leachate samples, and dynamic light scattering of aliquots from most sampling periods favored a polydisperse distribution typical of environmental samples. In addition, the light scattering intensities measured in these tests were much higher than any measured from UO{sub 2 } fuel tests in our laboratory. Electron microscopy of the colloids indicated that the colloids were individual and agglomerated silicates and aluminosilicates. No distinct uranium-rich colloids were found, although dissolved uranium would be expected to sorb to aluminosilicate colloids. In conclusion, the UAl{sub x} corroded slowly, releasing uranium at a rate comparable to UO{sub 2 } fuels. Colloid production, however, was quite high with light scattering intensities that were much higher than any measured in previous tests with spent fuels in our laboratory...|$|R

In these tests, simulated groundwater is periodically injected onto a sample at 90 C in a steel vessel. The solids react with the dripping groundwater and water condensed on surfaces to form a suite of U(VI) alteration phases. Solution chemistry is determined from leachate at the bottom of each vessel after the leachate stops interacting with the solids.

Dehydrated schoepite, UO{sub 3 }{center_dot}H{sub 2 }O, exists in <b>drip</b> <b>tests</b> on spent fuel. Equivalent sets of U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 } and UO{sub 3 }{center_dot}H{sub 2 }O dissolution experiments allowed a systematic examination of the effects of temperature (25 - 75 C), pH(8 - 10), and carbonate (2 - 200 x 10 {sup - 4 }molar) concentrations at atmospheric oxygen conditions. Results indicate that UO{sub 3 }{center_dot}H{sub 2 }O has a much higher dissolution rate (at least tenfold) than U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 } under the same conditions. The intrinsic dissolution rate of unirradiated U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 } is about twice that of UO{sub 2 }. Dissolution of both U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 } and UO{sub 3 }{center_dot}H{sub 2 }O shows a very high sensitivity to carbonate concentration.

40|$|The Engineered Barrier System (EBS) {{represents}} {{the system of}} human engineered barriers in the isolation of high-level radioactive waste in the proposed repository at Yucca Mountain. It is designed to complement and enhance the natural barriers to isolate and prevent the transport of radionuclides into the surrounding environment. The transport mechanism most frequently postulated for radionuclides is liquid water flux that has penetrated the EBS through corrosion breaches in the drip shield and waste packages (WP). A water flux-splitting model is used to predict flow through WP and drip shield breaches and is documented in the ''EBS Radionuclide Transport Abstraction''. A future revision of the ''EBS Radionuclide Transport Abstraction'' will be one component of the total system performance assessment [...] license application (TSPA-LA) for the Yucca Mountain repository. The flux-splitting model is conservative based on the following assumptions: (1) Drip impact occurs without a loss of water mass. (2) Dripping flux falls exactly at the crown of the drip shield as opposed to different locations on the curved surface, which will effect splashing and flow patterns. (3) The flux passing through a drip shield patch {{is proportional to the}} ratio of the length of the penetration in the axial direction to the total axial length of the drip shield. In this assumption all fluid that drips and flows from the drip shield crown toward a penetration will be collected if the axial locations of the source and patch coincide. (4) The potential for evaporation is ignored. Because of these conservatisms, the current version of the flux-splitting model is incapable of accounting for water that has been splashed from the impact location, the deviation of water paths (rivulets) from the axis of impact, and water loss due to evaporation.

The ''unsaturated drip tests'' being conducted at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) provide {{the basis of this}} AMR (Table 1). The ANL <b>drip</b> <b>tests</b> on spent fuel are the only experiments on fuel corrosion from which solids have been analyzed for trace levels of radionuclides. Brief summaries are provided of the results from other selected corrosion and dissolution experiments on spent UO{sub 2 } fuels, specifically those conducted under nominally oxidizing conditions. Discussions of the current understanding of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of U(VI) compounds is provided in order to outline the scientific basis for modeling precipitation and dissolution of potential radionuclide-bearing phases under repository-relevant conditions. Attachment I provides additional information on corrosion mechanisms and behaviors of radionuclides in the tests at ANL. Attachment II reviews occurrence, formation, and alteration (collectively known as paragenesis) of naturally occurring U(VI) minerals because natural mineral occurrences can be used to assess the possible long-term behaviors of U(VI) compounds formed in short-term laboratory experiments and to extrapolate experimental results to repository-relevant time scales. This AMR develops a model for calculating dissolved concentrations of radionuclides that are incorporated into U(VI) compounds, which is an alternative to models currently used in TSPA to calculate dissolved concentration limits for certain radionuclides. In particular, the model developed in this AMR applies to Np (neptunium) concentrations being controlled by solid uranyl oxyhydroxides that are known to contain trace levels of Np. The results of this AMR and the conceptual model developed from it and presented in Section 6. 7. 2. 3 are primarily intended to support sensitivity evaluations in performance assessment.

All of them, except T-Tape, were pressure compensating (PC) emitters; the T-Tape was non-pressure compensating (NPC). For all products, except Toro, the emitter spacing was 0. 305 m (12 inches) and for Toro, it was 0. 46 m (18 inches).

Flow rate vs. pressure head (Q-H) curves were also developed for each <b>drip</b> emitter <b>tested.</b> From emitter exponent values {{it was observed that}} all of the pressure compensating (PC) products behaved like NPC emitters at low pressures, although they behaved like PC emitters under normal operating pressures. From statistical analysis, it was determined that except for Netafim product, all other tested products were effective under low operating pressures as were under high operating or recommended pressures. Netafim product had no emission under low pressures. Using the measured average emission rate and developed Q-H curves, the distribution uniformities of all products except Netafim were calculated under low pressure ranges of 5. 97 KPa (0. 87 psi) to 23. 88 KPa (3. 50 psi) for different lengths of laterals and under 0 %, 1 %, 2...|$|R

40|$|Presently {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} in the production and marketing of wild boar meat, and to attend a differentiated consumer demand the quality attributes of this product should be well established. To characterize the quality of wild boar meat in comparison to commercial pork, post mortem changes in the longissimus dorsi and semimembranosus muscles were determined by pH and temperature decline, and color (CIE L*a*b*) measurements. Water holding capacity (WHC) was determined by the compression method and the exudate loss (EL) by the <b>drip</b> loss <b>test.</b> Decline in longissimus dorsi muscle pH of wild boar was gradual and in the pork it was faster and more extensive. Temperature differences were observed in some post mortem times, and the lowest values were found in wild boar carcasses. Wild boar meat presented lower values of L* (brightness) and b* (yellow color intensity), and higher values of a* (red color intensity) than pork. The WHC of the wild boar meat was similar to pork, but the EL in female wild boar meat was lower than in pork...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater in D-Area at the Savannah River Site (SRS) is {{contaminated}} with trichloroethylene (TCE) and by-products resulting from discharges of this organic solvent during past operations. Several potential clean-up strategies are being {{or have been}} investigated, including a novel drip irrigation-phytoremediation process that {{is the focus of}} the treatability study described in this report. The contaminated groundwater in D-Area occurs primarily at depths of 30 to 50 feet below ground surface, well below the depths that are typically penetrated by plant roots. The system investigated in this study involved pumping water from the contaminated aquifer and discharging the water into overlying test plots below the surface using <b>drip</b> irrigation. The <b>test</b> plots contained pines, cottonwoods, or no vegetation (controls).

50|$|The main crops {{grown by}} the farmers are bananas and cotton, with {{priority}} {{given to the}} banana. Kharif crops are harvested during the monsoon season. Water for rabi crops comes from wells. In the decades running up to 1990, flood irrigation was extensively used, due to which the water level in the wells dropped to an alarming level. Because of awareness programmes run by the farmer Vasantrao Mahajan, social worker Digambar Narkheda and Jain Irrigation Systems, farmers have started using agronomic practices, soil <b>testing,</b> <b>drip</b> irrigation, and fertigation to conserve water and increase productivity. These modern methods of cultivation were noted {{by a team of}} agriculture officers from the government of Kerala who visited Chinawal village in June 2004. 99% of the banana cultivation in Chinawal village is under drip irrigation, which has increased per-plant yield from 15 kg to nearly 30 kg, averaging 65 tonnes per hectare.|$|R
40|$|The {{cylindrical}} filters presently used in < 1000 m 2 {{drip irrigation}} systems are frequently clogged, increasing pressure loss and lowering the flow rate through the filters. This work investigates the mechanisms for this clogging and proposes an alternative filtration design {{that would enable}} both more reliable and lower maintenance filtering. This proposed system is compatible with existing drip irrigation systems and could be made inexpensively with plastic bottle manufacturing equipment. To compare the proposed design to off-the-shelf options, a <b>drip</b> irrigation <b>test</b> setup was built to measure the pressure loss across different filters as particles accumulated. These experiments confirmed that pleated cartridge filters, with high effective surface area, incurred lower pressure losses than cylindrical filters. These tests revealed that the greatest reason for clogged performance was that filtered particles (not the cartridge filter itself) eventually restricted {{the flow of water}} through the system. This inspired the redesign of the filter housing such that the housing extended far below the filter, providing a catch basin away from the filter for the particles to settle. Fixing the filter independently of the bottom casing significantly improved the overall performance of the filtration system, reduced the maintenance requirement necessary from the user, and would enable inexpensive manufacturing via blow molding. This paper experimentally demonstrates that the cartridge filter inside the redesigned housing can filter out over 2 kg of sand while maintaining less than a. 03 bar pressure drop across the filter at a flow rate of 25 l/s.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{disposal of}} {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) {{is one of the}} most serious challenges to the successful completion of the nuclear fuel cycle and the future of nuclear power generation. In the United States, 21 percent of the electricity is generated by 107 commercial nuclear power plants (NPP), each of which generates 20 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel annually. In 1996, the total accumulation of spent nuclear fuel was 33, 700 metric tons of heavy metal (MTHM) stored at 70 sites around the country. The end-of-life projection for current nuclear power plants (NPP) is approximately 86, 000 MTHM. In the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain over 95 % of the radioactivity originates from spent nuclear fuel. World-wide in 1998, approximately 130, 000 MTHM of SNF have accumulated, most of it located at 236 NPP in 36 countries. Annual production of SNF is approximately 10, 000 MTHM, containing about 100 tons of ''reactor grade'' plutonium. Any reasonable increase in the proportion of energy production by NPP, i. e., as a substitute for hydrocarbon-based sources of energy, will significantly increase spent nuclear fuel production. Spent nuclear fuel is essentially UO{sub 2 } with approximately 4 - 5 atomic percent actinides and fission product elements. A number of these elements have long half-lives hence, the long-term behavior of the UO{sub 2 } is an essential concern in the evaluation of the safety and risk of a repository for spent nuclear fuel. One of the unique and scientifically most difficult aspects of the successful disposal of spent nuclear fuel is the extrapolation of short-term laboratory data (hours to years) to the long time periods (10 {sup 3 } to 10 {sup 5 } years) as required by the performance objectives set in regulations, i. e. 10 CFR 60. The direct verification of these extrapolations or interpolations is not possible, but methods must be developed to demonstrate compliance with government regulations and to satisfy the public that there is a reasonable basis for accepting the long-term extrapolations of spent fuel behavior. In recent years ''natural analogues'' for both the repository environment (e. g., the Oklo natural reactors) and nuclear waste form behavior (e. g., corrosion and alteration of uraninite, UO{sub 2 +x}) have been cited as a fundamental means of achieving confirmation of long-term extrapolations. In particular, considerable effort has already been made to establish that uraninite, UO{sub 2 +x}, with its impurities, is a good structural and chemical analogue for the analysis of the long-term behavior of the UO{sub 2 } in spent nuclear fuel. This proposal is based on the study of uraninite and the naturally occurring alteration products of UO{sub 2 +x} under oxidizing and reducing conditions. The UO{sub 2 } in spent nuclear fuel is not stable under oxidizing conditions. In oxic solutions, uranium has a strong tendency to exist as U{sup 6 +} in the uranyl molecule, UO{sub 2 }{sup 2 +}. Uranyl ions react with a wide variety of inorganic and organic anions to form complexes. Throughout most of the natural range of pH, U{sup 6 +} forms strong complexes with oxygen-bearing ions like CO{sub 3 }{sup 2 -}, HCO{sup 3 -}, SO{sub 4 }{sup 2 -}, PO{sub 4 }{sup 3 -}, and AsO{sub 4 }{sup 3 -}, which are present in most oxidized stream and subsurface waters. In arid environments, the U{sup 6 +} ion can precipitate as a wide variety of uranyl oxide hydrates, uranyl silicates and uranyl phosphates. This is well demonstrated in experimental work, e. g., in long term <b>drip</b> <b>tests</b> on UO{sub 2 } and is confirmed by natural occurrences of UO{sub 2 } in which a wide variety of uranyl phases form as alteration products. The most striking feature of these studies is the very close parallel in the paragenetic sequences (i. e. phase formation sequence) between the very long term (10 year tests) and the young (therefore, low-Pb uraninites) of the Nopal I deposit in Mexico...|$|R
40|$|Emitters {{inserted}} in drip irrigation laterals cause local head loss, generally estimated {{as a product}} of a coefficient and the velocity head. This local head loss coefficient and the emitter discharge curve hydraulic parameters may exhibit considerable variability attributable to the manufacturing process. This paper provides a framework for assessing whether the variability in the hydraulic parameters could lead to significant differences in the performance of rolls of drip irrigation laterals from the same manufacturing batch. A system approach with inlet pressure as input, pressure distribution along the drip lateral and inlet discharge as outputs (or responses), and a drip lateral hydraulic model as the transfer function is explored. Within a Bayesian statistical framework of parameter uncertainty based on the Metropolis algorithm, the hydraulic parameters of pressure-compensating drip lateral rolls from the same manufacturing batch were inferred (calibrated). Overlapping of the space (region) of the hydraulic parameters of different drip laterals give an indication of compatibility (similarity) of the drip laterals. Results indicated that half of the <b>drip</b> lateral rolls <b>tested</b> were strongly compatible, a third were weakly compatible, and the remainder were not compatible with any other. This finding has significant ramifications in the design of drip irrigation lateral networks. Therefore, it is essential to closely examine the hydraulic properties of drip laterals for the design of drip irrigation networks to avoid poor performance of the system...|$|R
40|$|Family {{farming is}} {{critical}} for Brazilian food security and economy. However, this sector has low investment capacity, which results in low utilization of production technologies. Alternative soil cultivation systems and inexpensive drip irrigation needs {{to be tested for}} family farming. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate different soil cultivation systems and the use of KIFNET™ drip irrigation in the initial vegetative growth of coffee (Coffea arabica L.) ‘Catuaí’ in an Oxisol. We tested three soil cultivation systems (plowing and harrowing/CONV; subsoiling at 30 cm/SS; and scarification, fertilization at 60 cm and harrowing/TO) and two irrigation treatments (irrigated and non-irrigated). The irrigation management addressed the crop water requirements by monitoring weather conditions using an automatic weather station and calculating the ETo using the Penman-Monteith equation. There were significant differences among the soil cultivation systems and irrigation (p< 0. 01). Treatments with CONV soil cultivation system presented higher plant height, stem diameter, number of branches and canopy width compared to the other soil cultivation systems (13. 8 %, 10 %, 16 %, and 19. 2 % respectively) (p < 0 01). Irrigated treatments were 12. 8 %, 39. 7 %, 34. 8 %, and 25. 8 % higher than non-irrigated ones for the same variables (p < 0. 01). SS and TO soil cultivation systems presented no effect at the initial development stage because of the shallow root system.

We compared the effectiveness of glucose and pH parameters by dripping CSF samples obtained from spinal needle during combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) by means of glucose and pH regions of the urine test strip. Methods: After obtaining written consent, 70 patients scheduled for lower extremity surgery under CSEA were included in this unicenter and randomized clinical study. During the intervention, block levels and color changes in urine test strips' glucose and pH parameters were all recorded. Results: In both groups, urine test strip color change were positive in 34 patients and negative in 1 patient. There was no statistically significant difference. In our study, even free CSF flow was detected after CSEA implementation, block levels were detected as and ldquo;none and rdquo; in 3 patients in and ldquo;glucose and rdquo; group (9 %) and 1 patient in and ldquo;pH and rdquo; group (3 %). There was a statistically significant difference in comparison of block levels.

40|$|An {{estimated}} {{half million}} homes in Minnesota {{are not connected}} to public sewer systems. Along with the growing use oflakeshore cabins and the conversion of cabins into year-round homes, many {{have the potential to}} degrade surface and groundwater resources as they depend primarily on individual sewage treatment systems (ISTSs) for the treatment and dispersal of domestic wastewater. Unfortunately, many are in noncompliance with state standards or are hydraulically failing to the surface. Effective treatment options are needed for the thousands oflocations with restrictive soil and site conditions. Many of these sites occur along lakes and streams, creating a potential health hazard to swimmers and others using surface water for drinking water and recreation, leading to increased algal blooms, aesthetic nuisances and degraded fish habitat. The suspended-growth wastewater treatment process is commonly used by municipal wastewater treatment facilities. This biological treatment process is also available at smaller scales for both individual and multiple home use, and are commonly referred to as aerobic treatment units or ATU's. Since the mid- 1990 's, systems using both the suspended-growth and fixed-film treatment processes were evaluated for single-family home use in northern Minnesota (McCarthy et al., 1997, 1998, 1999; 2001; Henneck et al., 1999, 2001; Axler et al., 1999, 2000; Monson Geerts et al., 2000, 2001; Pundsack et al., 2001).
