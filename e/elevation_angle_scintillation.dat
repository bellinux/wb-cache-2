The analysis of a few scintillation events proves that, as for measurements at higher <b>elevation</b> <b>angle,</b> <b>scintillation</b> {{may be attributed to}} well-developed turbulence in clouds. The comparison of monthly statistics of scintillation with available prediction methods based on ground meteorological data indicates that the current methods overestimate the measurements.

30|$|In {{order to}} account for varying {{geometrical}} effects on the measurements made at different <b>elevation</b> <b>angles,</b> the amplitude <b>scintillation</b> index is projected to the vertical according to the formulae described in (Alfonsi et al. 2013). The elevation and azimuth of every GPS satellite signal that is received are recorded every 60  s. We focus our attention on an infinitely thin layer within the E layer {{at an altitude of}} 110  km above the Earth’s surface. The reason is that previous studies (as discussed in “Background” section) have been shown that daytime scintillation and Esb are correlated. Esb layer is considered to have the form of a thin sheet in which the electron density is higher than that of the background ionization. These sheets have been observed to occur at altitudes between 90 and 110  km (Tong et al. 1988; Wu et al. 2005). For this study, we need the nominal ionospheric pierce point (IPP) height to determine the latitude associated with the scintillation. Hence, the height of 110  km is assumed to be that of the irregularity sheet, where scintillation occurs. The IPP is defined to be the point where an incoming GPS signal ray intersects the ionosphere. By prescribing the altitude of 110  km for the IPP, the elevation and azimuth of the GPS satellite may then be used to calculate the location of the IPP.|$|R

It means that the receiving mutual impedances do not vary with <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> significantly. The simulation results in [6, 7] have shown that estimating the <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> with single-elevation-angle receiving-mutual-impedance could achieve error accuracy around 1 °. Therefore, it is feasible to estimate the <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> using mutual coupling compensated with single-elevation-angle receiving-mutual-impedance. We will estimate an initial <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> using the MCM obtained at θ = 45 ° first. Then we can get a more accurate result with the MCM obtained at the initial estimate.|$|R

Without optimizing the subreflector (focus) positions {{as a function}} of the antenna <b>elevation</b> <b>angle,</b> antenna beam patterns show lopsided sidelobes, and antenna efficiencies show degradations. The sidelobe level increases and the antenna efficiencies decrease about 1 % and a few %, respectively, for every 10 ◦ change in the <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> at the measured frequency of 237 GHz. We therefore obtained the optimized subreflector positions for X (azimuth), Y (elevation), and Z (radio optics) focus axes at various <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> for all the eight SMA antennas. The X axis position does not depend on the <b>elevation</b> <b>angle.</b> The Y and Z axes positions depend on the <b>elevation</b> <b>angles,</b> and are well fitted with a simple function for each axis with including a gravity term (cosine and sine of elevation, respectively). In the optimized subreflector positions, the antenna beam patterns show low level symmetric sidelobe of at most a few%, and the antenna efficiencies stay constant at any antenna <b>elevation</b> <b>angles.</b> Using one set of fitted functions for all antennas, the SMA is now operating with real-time focusing, and showing constant antenna characteristics at any given <b>elevation</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R

The measurements were made using sources on satellites with 42 -day orbits. The angle of arrival of the ray path to a satellite changed slowly allowing observations of fluctuations caused by atmospheric irregularities as they slowly drifted across the ray path. The fluctuations were characterized by the rms variations of <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> and the logarithm of received power (log power). Over a one-year period, 458 hours of observation were amassed spanning every season, time of day, and weather conditions.

30|$|There are {{two main}} {{characteristics}} of the SNR data in Figure  3 (left): the SNR multipath oscillations and the overall trend. The multipath effect is decreasing with increasing satellite <b>elevation</b> <b>angle,</b> i.e., the amplitude of the interference pattern decreases with increasing satellite <b>elevation</b> <b>angle.</b> This decrease depends on the amplitude (signal strength) of the reflected signal and the antenna gain pattern. For low satellite <b>elevation</b> <b>angles,</b> the reflected signal is mostly RHCP due to the higher amplitude of the RHCP Fresnel reflection coefficient compared to the LHCP coefficient (see e.g., [22, 25]).

30|$|Blauert {{reported}} {{a very interesting}} auditory phenomenon of narrow-band sound sources on the medial plane: the <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> given by subjects are independent of the real <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> but depended on the signal frequencies [17]. For wide-band signals of familiar types, {{it is easy for}} our auditory system to compare the pinnae filtered spectra (some frequency amplified and some decayed) to the spectra in memory, and based on the difference, reliable <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> estimation can be given (Figure 3). But for narrow-band signals, pinnae filtered spectra do not have detectable shape difference, just level difference. Thus the <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> detection will be very unreliable. In fact, the <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> given by the subjects are the angles at which the narrow-band signals have the maximum gain due to the pinnae filtering. For example, the peak gain frequency when the sounds come from the front is 3 [*]kHz for most people [21]. So wherever a sound of 3 [*]kHz came from, most subjects pointed at the front.|$|R

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} how the organization of a whole body movement is altered when movement duration (MD) is varied. Subjects performed the same whole body pointing movement over long, normal and short MDs. The kinematic trajectories were then analyzed on a normalized time base. A principal components analysis (PCA) revealed {{that the degree of}} coordination between the <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> of the body did not change with MD. This lack of significant differences in the coordination was interesting given that small spatial and temporal differences were observed in the individual kinematic trajectories. They were revealed by studying the trajectories of the <b>elevation</b> <b>angles,</b> joint markers and center of mass. The <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> excursions displayed modifications primarily in their spatial characteristics. These alterations were more marked for the short rather than long duration movements. The temporal characteristics of the <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> as measured by the time to peak of angular velocity were not modified in the same fashion hence displaying a dissociation in the tuning of the spatial and temporal aspects of the <b>elevation</b> <b>angles.</b> Modifications in the temporal characteristics of the movement were also studied by examining the velocity profiles of the joint markers. Interestingly, unlike the disordered nature of this variable for the <b>elevation</b> <b>angles,</b> the time to peak velocity was neatly ordered as a function of MD for the joint markers – It arrived first for the short duration movements, followed by those of the normal and finally long duration movements.

Also, the reflected power is relatively large compared to the vertical polarization, especially at low grazing angles.
