25|$|In 1936 Foy {{realized}} that Vaudeville was waning quickly {{and decided to}} attempt a return to film, so he left New York and relocated to Hollywood. 21 years after his last foray into film {{as one of the}} Seven Little Foys, Charley Foy returned to film in 1936, with the small role of Ratto in the comedy, <b>Hot</b> <b>Money</b> From 1936 to 1943, Foy appeared in over 20 pictures, cast either as Charley or Charles Foy. In 1937 he appeared in several films, including Saratoga, which stars Clark Gable and Jean Harlow, in her last screen appearance. Foy had been attempting to utilize his dance expertise since his return to film, with little success. That changed with his being cast as 'Scoop' Trotter in the 1937 musical, Melody for Two, for which his dancing received positive notices. He also had a featured role, again utilizing his dance skills, in Dance Charlie Dance, a comedy directed by Frank McDonald. In 1939 he appeared in several notable films. In Lew Landers's espionage drama, Conspiracy, he had one of the starring roles, Studs, which also stars Allan Lane, Linda Hayes, and Robert Barrat.

Foy would again have a featured role in another Bogart film in 1941, the drama The Wagons Roll at Night, which was directed by Ray Enright, and also stars Sylvia Sidney and Eddie Albert. Foy's final on-screen performance came in the 1943 western, The Woman of the Town, starring Claire Trevor and Albert Dekker, and directed by George Archainbaud, in which Foy played his father, Eddie Foy, Sr. Foy's final film credit came twelve years later, when he provided the narration for the biopic about his father, The Seven Little Foys in 1955, which stars Bob Hope as the senior Foy.|$|E

As with Mama's Boy, the film received a limited release only, resulting in a gross of US$1.8million worldwide.

Starting out as small-time dope dealers on Blue Hill Avenue in Roxbury, they eventually go to work for Benny, {{a major player in the}} Boston crime scene. As the four friends grow up and become the biggest dealers in the city, things become increasingly heated: Tristan's wife wants him to leave the business because she's pregnant, Tristan finds out his sister is hooked on drugs and is alienated from his family, Simon becomes obsessed with a near-death experience and expects to die, cops dog their tracks trying every trick in and out of the book to catch them, and Benny, their main supplier, wants them out of the business for good. Worse, it becomes clear one of the four is trying to sell the others out to the cops. In the end, Tristan faces Benny down, after losing his friends, and is able to get out of the business—and the life—for good.|$|R

Later, UMG acquired a portion of Cash Money Records, making it a UMG subsidiary. For its first few years (1991-1994), Cash Money played host to a number of local releases by artists, selling only one album, without ever releasing a music video or having a Billboard hit. Some of the label's releases garnered some regional success in New Orleans, Louisiana, but the label was little known to the national rap scene. Artists on the label during this period included the group U.N.L.V. (Uptown Niggas Living Violently), Kilo G, Lil Slim, Pimp Daddy, and PxMxWx. In 1995, the label signed young rappers B.G., Turk and Lil Wayne. The signees marked what would be the second wave of Cash Money artists. Cash Money Records’ opening salvo was the release of Kilo G’s ‘The Sleepwalker.’ Rapper Kilo G was just 15 years old when his Cash Money debut arrived in 1992, and his album was sold out of the trunk of the Williams brothers’ car.|$|R

[...] "Blame Me" [...] and [...] "Early Morning Anger" [...] are both about the {{emotions}} the band felt after being dropped by Geffen Records. Murray said of the songs [...] "When we were on Geffen (where) we had this ‘all star team,' we had all these people working for us. The minute we lost our deal with Geffen, thing changed- my Blackberry used to vibrate non-stop. It was constantly ringing or e-mails were coming in. The minute we were dropped, it went completely dead. I turned off the thing a couple of weeks later. The business is just brutal. When you're <b>hot</b> and there's <b>money</b> around, everybody is right there for you. And, then when things go a little south, you really figure out who your friends are and who your friends are not". [...] The song [...] "Texas" [...] is [...] "sort of a fantasy about revenge...ultimately, it's about picking up and starting over and not necessarily feeling that you have to give anybody a reason. Just basically hitting the ‘reset button,'". [...] "Wasting Away" [...] was about Murray's philosophical thoughts over [...] "wrestling with how much you're sacrificing for a dream or a pursuit in life. Is it worth it in the end...". [...] "All I Have" [...] was inspired about a news story regarding soldiers saying goodbye to their families in order to go off to war in Iraq, and how he felt when he received an email from a friend who was about to do the same".|$|R
50|$|Tommy Linklater is an eighteen-year-old magician. The magic he {{performs}} is often minor - re-directing croquet balls, making cards appear in closed purses - {{it is always}} genuine; he actually does the impossible. He will soon learn that his hobby for playing chess while his mother was alive is another gift she left him. His father, Herman Linklater, is a physicist who believes that all the universes mysteries will eventually be explained away. Tommy's mother and Herman's wife, Melanie, has died and left them a house {{they did not know}} she owned. It is in a small lake-side town called North Hatley. They decided to move there for a year so that Herman can finish his book on cosmology. Once they arrive, the Linklaters discover that Melanie was something of a local legend. She left North Hatley after throwing a game against the town's greatest chess rivals, the Russians. The town was forced to realize their mistakes. They pushed her too hard to win, undermining the soul of the game. Her pictures and trophies are everywhere in the small town. Tommy attends Hatley High, whose main claim to fame is the Knights, an internationally ranked chess team. He befriends a basketball prodigy named Julius, whose secret passion is surfing, as well as Trevor and Darryl two charming and ambitious guys who call themselves the Syndicate. He also meets, and ends up going out with, Hyacinthe Marquez, the beautiful and witty cheerleader who does cartwheels as effortlessly as she quotes Oscar Wilde. Herman, meanwhile, is being pestered by the town priest Lorne Granger. Lorne is a physics buff who actually, and casually, talks to God. Herman is very uncomfortable around priests, but is eventually won over by Lorne's enthusiasm for physics. Herman undergoes a sort of epiphany when Lorne provides him with an equation that isn't supposed to exist. The equation enables him to finish his book, but he is forced to confront the possibility that he not living in a clockwork universe after all. Shaun Rodes, egomaniac and captain of the chess team continually challenges Tommy to a chess match, wishing to find out if Tommy inherited his mother's skills. Tommy refuses. However, Hyacinthe sets up an after school game of chess between Shaun, and Tommy. Tommy loses and chides Hyacinthe for selling him out. However, Shaun has a feeling Tommy threw the game. Hyacinthe tries to win Tommy back, and does so by singing to him outside his window. Tommy is moved to forgive her. Shaun, still suspicious from his victory, invites Tommy to an underground high-stakes chess club, rife with shady characters, <b>hot</b> babes, and <b>money.</b> Shaun, hoping to prove his suspicions of Tommy's monumental talent, volunteers Tommy to play a blitz game against the top player in the club. Tommy, though reluctant, wins easily. When it is announced that the Russian Junior Chess Team is coming to play Hatley High, the whole town is thrown into a frenzy. An opportunity for redemption. At the pre-game dance, Anya, captain of the Russian chess team, easily seduces Shaun, ties him up, and locks him in the school's attic, solidifying a Russian win. The Russians are winning. During halftime Tommy performs a spectacular half-time magic show. When Shaun does not escape from his bonds in time to play the remaining match, the coach is forced to substitute Tommy in his place.|$|R
