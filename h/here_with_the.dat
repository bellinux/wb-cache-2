5|$|The 6th Airlanding Brigade, {{with the}} Belgians and Dutch under its command, {{had to contend}} with German delaying tactics. The lead battalions {{advanced}} under heavy mortar and machine gun fire, until stopped by a strong defensive position at Cabourg. The 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles, unable to outflank the position, were ordered to dig in. The next day, the battalion was relieved by the Belgians and moved to a brigade concentration point, first at Le Plein and then at Troan, which they reached by the morning of 21August. The 6th Airlanding Brigade advance continued from <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment in the lead. The battalion was unopposed until that afternoon, when they had several casualties from German mortar and machine-gun fire. With night approaching the battalion had to dig in, and prepared to continue the advance the next day. At 03:00 on 22August, the battalion started an outflanking attack on Branville, which they occupied by 08:00, and later the same day they liberated Vauville and Deauville, where they secured the high ground {{to the north of the}} town.|$|E

5|$|Exmoor is an upland area formed almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Devonian and early Carboniferous periods. The name of the geological period and system, 'Devonian', comes from Devon, as rocks of that age were first studied and described <b>here.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> exception of a suite of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks forming the lower ground between Porlock and Timberscombe and from Minehead to Yarde (within Exmoor National Park but peripheral to the moor itself), all of the solid rocks of Exmoor are assigned to the Exmoor Group, which comprises a mix of gritstones, sandstones, slates, shales, limestone, siltstones and mudstones. Quartz and iron mineralisation can be detected in outcrops and subsoil. The Glenthorne area demonstrates the Trentishoe Member (formerly 'Formation') of the Hangman Sandstone Formation (formerly 'Group'). The Hangman Sandstone represents the Middle Devonian sequence of North Devon and Somerset. These unusual freshwater deposits in the Hangman Grits were mainly formed in desert conditions. As this area of Britain was not subject to glaciation, the plateau remains as a remarkably old landform. The bedrock and more recent superficial deposits are covered in part by moorland which is supported by wet, acid soil.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{dishes in}} Sabah include the Beaufort mee, bosou, hinava, ngiu chap, pinasakan, Sipitang satay, Tuaran mee, tuhau, the bambangan fruit (mangifera pajang) {{along with many}} others. Apart from these, Sabah also {{features}} a number of snacks like amplang, cincin, lidah, roti kahwin, UFOs pinjaram and Sandakan tart and dessert like lamban, punjung and Tuaran coconut pudding. Every ethnic group has its own cuisine with different styles of preparing, cooking, {{and the way they}} serving and eating the food. Example of Sabah-based companies promoting dairy product and state drinks are like the Desa Cattle, Tenom coffee and Sabah Tea. The indigenous people features a number of alcoholic drinks such as bahar, kinomol, lihing, montoku, sagantang, sikat and tuak; with the state itself becoming the third highest in alcohol consumption in the country after Kuala Lumpur and Sarawak. The English Tea House and Restaurant in Sandakan is another attraction promoting the British tea culture. Other international shops and restaurants such as for Western food, Middle Eastern food, Bruneian food, Indonesian food, Filipino food, Japanese food, Korean food, Taiwanese food, Thai food and Vietnamese food have their presence <b>here.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> increasing number of tourists on the purpose of culinary tourism, this have since raise the local awareness on the important of local food to state tourism.|$|E

25|$|In distinction, the New York bagel {{contains}} {{salt and}} malt and is {{boiled in water}} before baking in a standard oven. The resulting bagel is puffy with a moist crust. The Montreal bagel is smaller (though with a larger hole), crunchier, and sweeter. There is a belief that New York bagels are the best due {{to the quality of}} the local water. However, this belief is heavily debated. For instance, Davidovich Bagels, made in NYC, are a recognized wholesale manufacturer of bagels that use these traditional bagel-making techniques (associated <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Montreal-style bagel), including kettle boiling and plank baking in a wood fired oven.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, {{after the}} Soviet Union {{recognized}} {{the state of}} Israel, Israel returned all Russian church properties on its territory to the Moscow Patriarch, including the Russian Compound. In 1964 the property was purchased {{by the government of}} Israel except for the cathedral and one building. The purchase was paid for in $3.5 million worth of oranges since at the time Israel had a shortage of hard currency. The Jerusalem municipality was built <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> adjacent Safra Public Square. Today, the neglected but architecturally striking enclave serves as an Israeli lock-up; at visiting times, families of prisoners can often be seen huddling outside the police barricades. The Ministry of Agriculture, courts, and the Jerusalem’s police headquarters are housed in other buildings.|$|E
25|$|A lower-table side {{through the}} 1930s, VfB's {{performance}} improved considerably {{in the following}} decade. As war overtook the country, the Gauliga Baden was sub-divided at various times {{into a number of}} more local city-based circuits and the team was able to earn three second-place finishes in divisional play. The Gauliga Baden collapsed in 1944–45 after playing a significantly reduced schedule in which many teams, including Mühlburg were unable to compete. After the war the club slipped from top-flight competition until earning promotion to the Oberliga Süd in 1947. They generally competed as a mid-table side <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of a strong performance in 1951 when they narrowly missed an advance to the national championship rounds after earning a third-place result just a single point behind SpVgg Fürth.|$|E

25|$|The {{two main}} tracks from Fort Washington Avenue enter Broadway near 171st Street, running {{underneath}} the yard tracks in a double-decker tunnel.

South of 168th Street, the express (outer) tracks lower below the local tracks, forming another double-decker tunnel, this time under St. Nicholas Avenue.|$|E
25|$|In 1966 the American Air Force {{established}} a joint forces air-base <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> airport code CCK. It {{was the largest}} {{air force base in}} the Far East at the time, allowing B-52 Stratofortress to land. During the Vietnam War, CCK became a depot for the US Air Force. The US Air Force had been garrisoning with two fighter squadrons until the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty came into force on March 3, 1955. The US Military used CCK air base and ShueiNan airbase to run many of its long-distance Vietnam, Cambodia and Laotian bombing, scouting and cargo transport runs during the Vietnam conflict era. This base was shut down and most American facilities were removed after Nixon established diplomatic relations with Deng Xiaoping of the PRC in 1979, after former Chairman Mao's death allowed a diplomatic opening of relationships with today's China.|$|E
25|$|After {{the conquest}} of Teruel by the Republican army on 7 January, the Nationalists started an {{offensive}} in order to conquest the high ground around Teruel on 17 January and occupied the heights of La Muela, nevertheless the Republican troops led by Hernandez Saravia and backed by the International Brigades, stopped the Nationalist offensive on 27 January. Then, the Nationalists concentrated an army of 100,000 men and 500 guns in the Sierra de Palomera {{in the north of}} Teruel, led by the general Juan Vigon, with three Army Corps (Aranda’s Galicia corps, Yagüe's Morocco corps and the Garcia Valiño’s Navarre Corp), the Italian CTV and Monasterio’s cavalry division. On the other hand, the republican defenses {{in this part of the}} front were weak, since most of the republican troops were concentrated in the city of Teruel and the republican troops in this part of the front had never seen action. The Republican army had one Army corps, the 13th Army Corps <b>here,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 29th and the 42nd division.|$|E
