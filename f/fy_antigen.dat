40|$|The Duffy {{blood group}} locus, which encodes a {{chemokine}} receptor, {{is characterized by}} three alleles-FY*A, FY*B, and FY*O. The frequency of the FY*O allele, which corresponds {{to the absence of}} <b>Fy</b> <b>antigen</b> on red blood cells, is at or near fixation in most sub-Saharan African populations but is very rare outside Africa. The FST value for the FY*O allele is the highest observed for any allele in humans, providing strong evidence for the action of natural selection at this locus. Homozygosity for the FY*O allele confers complete resistance to vivax malaria, suggesting that this allele has been the target of selection by Plasmodium vivax or some other infectious agent. To characterize the signature of directional selection at this locus, we surveyed DNA sequence variation, both in a 1. 9 -kb region centered on the FY*O mutation site and in a 1 -kb region 5 - 6 kb away from it, in 17 Italians and in a total of 24 individuals from five sub-Saharan African populations. The level of variation across both regions is two- to threefold lower in the Africans than in the Italians. As a result, the pooled African sample shows a significant departure from the neutral expectation for the number of segregating sites, whereas the Italian sample does not. The FY*O allele occurs on two major haplotypes in three of the five African populations. This finding could be due to recombination, recurrent mutation, population structure, and/or mutation accumulation and drift. Although we are unable to distinguish among these alternative hypotheses, {{it is likely that the}} two major haplotypes originated prior to selection on the FY*O mutation...|$|E

For homozygous antigen-positive red cells. {{the average number of}} determinants per red cell was about 1 4, 000 for Jk, 1 7, 000 for Fy and Fyb, 1 9, 000 for Dib, and 23, 000 for the U antigen. assuming that the equilibrium binding observed represented 80 % saturation of the accessible antigen sites. The site numbers for this group of antigens were less than that for the Rh antigens. but considerably more than the Kell and Cellano antigens. The technique used was capable of demonstrating a twofold difference in antigen density between heterozygous and homozygous Fy (a +) red cells. More than 85 % of the <b>Fy</b> and Fyb <b>antigen</b> sites were lost following pretreatment of the red cells with papain. consistent with the serologic lability of the <b>Fy</b> <b>antigens</b> following proteolysis. The ferritin distribution observed following conjugate staining of antibody-sensitized ghost membranes was similar for all five antigens studied and showed a random, clustered ferritin pattern. Although the quantitative estimates are valid, the remarkable similarity in antigen distribution pattern for this diverse group of antigens, as well as other considerations. suggest that the findings with ghost membranes probably do not reflect faithfully the antigen arrangement on the intact red cell membrane.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{basis of the}} three major alleles (Fy(a) /Fy(b) /Fy) of the Duffy (FY) blood group system has recently been established but the Fy(x) phenotype associated with weak expression of the Fy(b) and other <b>FY</b> <b>antigens</b> is poorly understood. In the Fy(x) genes of five unrelated British and Swedish donors with the Fy(a+b+weak) phenotype we found two missense mutations predicting amino acid changes Arg 89 Cys and Ala 100 Thr in the FY glycoprotein. The same mutations were found in two Fy(a-b+weak) samples from individuals of Swedish and Algerian origin. Their red blood cells showed a marked decrease in Fy(b), Fy 3 and Fy 6 expression measured by routine serology and flow cytometry. The rare FY genotypes Fy(x) Fy(x) and Fy(x) Fy were confirmed by family studies and DNA sequencing. Screening by allele-specific primer PCR (ASP-PCR) for these mutations among 100 Caucasian and 100 Black random blood donors indicated allele frequencies of 2. 5 % and 0 % respectively. Ala 100 Thr alone was present in 33 % of the Caucasians (but none of the Blacks) with no weakening of FY expression. A novel allele at the FY locus associated with the Fy(x) phenotype was studied. Mistyping of this weak Fy(b) antigen in clinical transfusion medicine may lead to delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions in immunized patients. A potential role for genomic typing is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The Duffy (<b>Fy)</b> <b>antigens</b> act as receptors for chemokines {{as well as}} for Plasmodium vivax {{to invade}} human RBCs. A recent study has {{correlated}} the occurrence of the FY*A allele of Duffy gene with decreased susceptibility to vivax malaria, but no epidemiological correlation between the distribution of FY*A allele and incidences of vivax malaria has been established so far. Furthermore, if such correlations exist, whether natural selection has mediated the association, is an important question. Since India is highly endemic to P. vivax malaria with variable eco-climatic and varying vivax malaria epidemiology across different regions, such a question could well be answered in Indians. For this, we have genotyped the FY gene at the - 33 (rd) and the 125 (th) nucleotide positions in 250 Indians sampled from six different zonal plus one tribal population covering the whole of India and studied possible correlations with eco-climatic and vivax malaria incidences. No FY*O allele was found, however, both the FY*A and FY*B alleles forming FY*A/FY*A, FY*A/FY*B and FY*B/FY*B genotypes were widely distributed among Indians. Five out of seven population samples significantly deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectation, and two alleles (FY*A and FY*B) and the homozygote genotype, FY*B/FY*B were clinically distributed over the population coordinates. Furthermore, vivax malaria incidences {{over the past five years}} were significantly negatively and positively associated with the frequencies of the FY*A and FY*B alleles, respectively. The Northern Indians were highly differentiated from the other zonal population samples at the FY gene, as evidenced from the reconstructed Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree. The results specify the role of natural selection in the distribution of FY gene polymorphism in India. Furthermore, the hypotheses on the part of the FY*A allele in conferring protection to vivax malaria could be validated following population genetic studies in a vivax malaria epidemiological setting, such as India...|$|R
40|$|The Duffy {{blood group}} system of human {{erythrocytes}} comprises a membrane glycoprotein recently characterized by immunoprecipitation techniques (1). It is a polymorphic system that includes determinants for five alloantigens, {{two of which}} are Mendelian alleles (Fya and Fyb) (2, 3). A null genotype, designated Fy(ab-) (4), lacks the expression of both Fya and Fy b, and is inherited as a third allele of the series. Homozygous Fy(a-b-) red cells, however, also lack expression of the <b>Fy</b> 3 (5) <b>antigen,</b> which is present on all other Duffy types. Fy 4 (6) occurs on almost all samples of Fy(ab-), but the expression is weak on some. In addition Fy 4 is occasionally found on red cells of Fy(a+b'), so that its exact Duffy status is not in perfect agreement with the absence of both Fya and Fy b (7). Fy 5 (8) resembles Fy 3 but is also absent from Rh-null red cells regardless of their other Duffy types.

40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of pre-erythrocytic Plasmodium vivax vaccines is hindered {{by the lack}} of in vitro culture systems or experimental rodent models. To help bypass these roadblocks, we exploited the fact that naturally exposed Fy− individuals who lack the Duffy blood <b>antigen</b> (<b>Fy)</b> receptor are less likely to develop blood-stage infections; therefore, they preferentially develop immune responses to pre-erythrocytic–stage parasites, whereas Fy+ individuals experience both liver- and blood-stage infections and develop immune responses to both pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic parasites. We screened 60 endemic sera from P. vivax-exposed Fy+ or Fy − donors against a protein microarray containing 91 P. vivax proteins with P. falciparum orthologs that were up-regulated in sporozoites. Antibodies against 10 P. vivax antigens were identified in sera from P. vivax-exposed individuals but not unexposed controls. This technology has promising implica-tions in the discovery of potential vaccine candidates against P. vivax malaria...|$|R

Some popu-lations have a highly prevalent Fy-negative phenotype; such persons are naturally protected from P. vivax blood infection but are expected to completely support the P. vivax pre-erythrocytic cycle, representing a valuable model for studying the immune response during these parasitic stages. We typed 214 individuals, mostly Afro-Colombians, from a P. vivax-endemic area for Fy expression and determined the antibody response to P. vivax pre-erythrocytic (sporo-zoites and CS) and blood-stage antigens (blood forms, P. vivax merozoite surface protein 1, and P. vivax Duffy binding protein [PvDBP]). Antibody titers to P. vivax circumsporozoite protein, P 11, and N-terminal peptides {{and the number of}} responders were similar in Fy-negative and Fy-positive individuals. The number of responders to sporozoites, blood forms, and PvDBP were different between these groups. Thus, Fy-negative individuals from malaria-endemic areas can be used to study the immune response to the P. vivax liver phase without interference of the erythrocytic cycle...|$|R
40|$|Plasmodium vivax (Pv) is a {{major cause}} of human malaria and is {{increasing}} in public health importance compared with falciparum malaria. Pv is unique among human malarias in that invasion of erythrocytes is almost solely dependent on the red cell's surface receptor, known as the Duffy blood-group <b>antigen</b> (<b>Fy).</b> Fy is an important minor blood-group antigen that has two immunologically distinct alleles, referred to as Fya or Fyb, resulting from a single-point mutation. This mutation occurs within the binding domain of the parasite's red cell invasion ligand. Whether this polymorphism affects susceptibility to clinical vivax malaria is unknown. Here we show that Fya, compared with Fyb, significantly diminishes binding of Pv Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) at the erythrocyte surface, and is associated with a reduced risk of clinical Pv in humans. Erythrocytes expressing Fya had 41 – 50 % lower binding compared with Fyb cells and showed an increased ability of naturally occurring or artificially induced antibodies to block binding of PvDBP to their surface. Individuals with the Fya+b− phenotype demonstrated a 30 – 80 % reduced risk of clinical vivax, but not falciparum malaria in a prospective cohort study in the Brazilian Amazon. The Fya+b− phenotype, predominant in Southeast Asian and many American populations, would confer a selective advantage against vivax malaria. Our results also suggest that efficacy of a PvDBP-based vaccine may differ among populations with different Fy phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|Após a introdução da técnica de antiglobulina indireta por Coombs em meados da década de 40, vários anticorpos antieritrocitários foram descobertos. O grupo sanguíneo Duffy foi descoberto quando Cutbush e Ikin detectaram, no início da década de 50, os primeiros anticorpos desse sistema. Os anticorpos Duffy são clinicamente significantes na prática transfusional, pois mostraram ser causadores de reação hemolítica transfusional e de doença hemolítica do recém-nascido, sendo de ocorrência mundial. O gene FY é constituído por dois exons e seu lócus foi mapeado no cromossomo 1 q 22 -q 23. Os antígenos Fyª e Fy b são codificados pelos alelos FYA e FYB e são responsáveis pelos fenótipos Fy(a+b-), Fy(a-b+) e Fy(a+b+). São carreados por uma glicoproteína de 336 aminoácidos também chamada DARC (Duffy Antigen/Receptor for Chemokines), que tem alta afinidade a quimiocinas, sendo também os receptores para Plasmodium vivax. Os polimorfismos relacionados aos seus alelos permitiram o desenvolvimento da técnica de genotipagem por PCR, que é de grande utilidade para a segurança transfusional e incompatibilidade feto-materna. Na última década, inúmeras pesquisas têm sido feitas quanto ao papel biológico dos antígenos de grupos sangüíneos. Nesse artigo iremos revisar o sistema de grupo sangüíneo Duffy, em especial quanto à prática transfusional e suas funções biológicas. After the {{introduction}} of the indirect antiglobulin technique by Coombs {{in the middle of the}} 1940 's, several antibodies have been discovered. Duffy blood group system came to light when Cutbush and Ikin detected the first antibodies related to this system in the beginning of the 1950 's. The antibodies of this system are clinically significant in transfusional practice as they have been involved in hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the newborn, showing them to be of worldwide occurrence. The FY gene is constituted of two exons and its locus was mapped on chromosome 1 q 22 -q 23. The Fyª and <b>Fy</b> b <b>antigens</b> are encoded by FYA and FYB alleles, and are responsible for the Fy(a+b-), Fy(a-b+) and Fy(a+b+) phenotypes. They are carried by a 336 amino acid glycoprotein called DARC (Duffy Antigen/Receptor for Chemokines) which has high affinity to chemokines, also being Plasmodium vivax receptors. The polymorphisms related to its alleles have led to the development of a PCR genotyping technique, which is useful for the safety of blood transfusion, and determining fetus-maternal incompatibilities. In the last decade, much research has been done to determine the biological role of blood group antigens.

40|$|Plasmodium vivax {{invasion}} of human erythrocytes requires {{interaction of the}} P. vivaxDuffy binding protein (PvDBP) with its host receptor, the Duffy <b>antigen</b> (<b>Fy)</b> on the erythrocyte surface. Consequently, PvDBP is a leading vaccine candidate. The bind-ing domain of PvDBP lies in a cysteine-rich portion of the molecule called region II (PvDBPII). PvDBPII contains three distinct subdomains based upon intramolecular disulfide bonding patterns. Subdomain 2 (SD 2) is highly polymorphic and is thought to contain many key residues for binding to Fy, while SD 1 and SD 3 are comparatively conserved and their role in Fy binding is not well understood. To examine the relative contributions of the different subdomains to binding to Fy and their abilities to elicit strain-transcending binding-inhibitory antibodies, we evaluated recombinant proteins from SD 12, SD 2, SD 3, and SD 3, which includes 24 residues of SD 2. All of the recombinant subdomains, except for SD 2, bound variably to human erythrocytes, with constructs containing SD 3 showing the best binding. Antisera raised in laboratory animals against SD 3, SD 3, and SD 23 inhibited the binding of full-length PvDBPII, which is strain transcending, whereas antisera generated to SD 12 and SD 2 failed to generate blocking antibodies. All of the murine monoclonal antibodies generated to full-length PvDBPII that had significant binding-inhibitory activity recognized only SD 3. Thus, SD 3 binds Fy and elicits blocking antibodies, indicating that it contains residues critical to Fy binding {{that could be the}} basis of a strain-transcending candidate vaccine against P. vivax.

The biological role of the Duffy glycoprotein has not been explained yet. It is suggested that Duffy protein modulate {{the intensity of the}} inflammatory response. The Duffy blood group system consists of two major antigens, Fya and Fyb, encoded by two codominant alleles designated FY*A and FY*B which differ by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 125 G&amp;gt;A of the FY gene that results in Gly 42 Asp amino acid change in the Fya and Fyb antigens, respectively. The presence of antigen Fya and/or Fyb on the erythrocytes determine three Duffy-positive phenotypes: Fy(a+b-), Fy(a-b+) and Fy(a+b+), identified in Caucasian population. The Duffy-negative phenotype Fy(a-b-), frequent in Africans, but very rare in Caucasians, is defined by the homozygous state of FY*B- 33 alleles. The FY*B- 33 allele is associated with a SNP - 33 T&amp;gt;C in the promoter region of the FY gene, which suppresses erythroid expression of this gene without affecting its expression in other tissues. The FY*X allele, found in Caucasians, is correlated with weak expression of Fyb antigen. Fyx antigen differs from the native Fyb by the Arg 89 Cys and Ala 100 Thr amino acid substitutions due to SNPs: 265 C&amp;gt;T and 298 G&amp;gt;A in FY*B allele.

40|$|Serological {{discrepancies}} in matching blood group antigens between donors and patients for blood transfusion {{may lead to}} alloimmunisation, especially in multiply transfused patients. Blood group genotyping (BGG) has contributed in reducing this issue. ABO, <b>Fy</b> and Jk <b>antigens</b> are among those to be causative for alloimmunisation through transfusion or pregnancy. The number of alleles of these clinically significant blood groups is ever increasing. Currently, all commercially available high-throughput BGG platforms are only based on pre-defined polymorphisms. Consequently, novel or rare alleles that might have clinical significance are not identified. Next generation sequencing (NGS) circumvents this issue by providing high-throughput comprehensive genotyping of blood group genes in discovery mode to find all existing and novel mutations. Accordingly, {{a large number of}} individuals can be genotyped in a single run. Here, we describe an NGS-based method coupled with long-range polymerase chain reaction (LR-PCR) for high-throughput, rapid and extensive genotyping of FY, JK and ABO blood group genes. The Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGMTM) was used for sequencing the entire FY, JK and ABO blood group genes including flanking regions. Accordingly, high resolution genotyping was obtained. 53 genomic DNA samples were sequenced and genotyped for FY, 67 for JK and 47 for ABO. Sequencing data were aligned to the gene reference sequence derived from the human genome (hg 19) to analyse variants. Analysis was accomplished by software packages, such as Ion Torrent SuiteTM plugins. Sanger sequencing of cDNA and cDNA clones was used to confirm findings in the JK gene. The sequencing data had a coverage depth of more than 5000 x for FY, 700 x for JK and 600 x for ABO. NGS data matched with the serological phenotypes of FY alleles FY*A, FY*B and FY* 02 Null main polymorphisms, such as FY*A/FY*B (125 G>A) in exon 2 and (- 67 T>C) in the promotor region. JK variant analysis revealed that the JK* 01 W. 01 allele (130 G>A) is common (10 / 67 samples) with normal antigenicity. The previously described silencing polymorphism (810 G>A), leading to a purported JK*B null allele, restores a splice site and does not correlate with loss of Jkb antigenicity (10 / 67 samples). JK intron analysis revealed several new JK alleles described in this thesis. All 7 exons, introns and the flanking regions of the ABO gene were covered by only four amplicons. Several rare O alleles were found, such as O 73 and O 75, while one suggested novel O allele was characterised by a missense SNP 482 G>A (Arg 161 His) in exon 7. The ABO reference sequence from hg 19 appeared to resemble (O 01 and O 02) alleles. The intronic SNPs might be used to distinguish between alleles more accurately as a correlation of the intronic SNPs with the alleles was noted for the homozygous O alleles. It is predicted that NGS-based genotyping will replace not only microarray-based genotyping but also serology in the blood group typing of individuals, with great advancements in technology and molecular knowledge being expected in the near future.
