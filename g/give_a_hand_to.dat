25|$|Meanwhile, {{the siege}} of Hull had commenced. The Eastern Association forces under Manchester {{promptly}} moved up into Lincolnshire, the foot besieging Lynn (which surrendered on 16 September 1643) while the horse rode into {{the northern part of}} the county to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the Fairfaxes. Fortunately the sea communications of Hull were open.|$|E
25|$|As in 1643, Rupert {{was soon}} {{on his way}} to the north to {{retrieve}} the fortunes of his side. Moving by the Welsh border, and gathering up garrisons and recruits snowball-wise as he marched, he went first to Cheshire to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> Byron, and then, with the utmost speed, he made for Newark. On 20 March 1644, he bivouacked at Bingham, and on the 21st, he not only relieved Newark but routed the besiegers' cavalry. On the 22nd, Meldrum's position was so hopeless that he capitulated on terms. But, brilliant soldier as he was, the prince was unable to do more than raid a few Parliamentary posts around Lincoln. After that, he had to return his borrowed forces to their various garrisons, and go back to Walesladen, indeed with captured pikes and muskets, to raise a permanent field army.|$|E
2500|$|It was now {{possible}} for the Roundheads to approach Oxford. Abingdon was no sooner evacuated than on 26 May 1644, Waller's and Essex's armies united there [...] still, unfortunately for their cause, under separate commanders. Edmund Ludlow joined Waller at Abingdon to place Oxford under siege. From Abingdon, Essex moved direct on Oxford. Waller moved towards Wantage, where he could <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> Edward Massey, the energetic governor of Gloucester.|$|E

2500|$|The United States lobbied {{against the}} {{resolution}} {{being brought to}} the UNGA, while Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman {{said that it was}} only exacerbating the situation and that a vote would trigger [...] "an extreme response from us." [...] However, following Operation Pillar of Defense, and under pressure from the United States, Israel stopped its threats of punishment to Abbas for going ahead with the move to the UN. Lieberman also went to New York City to meet Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, while Ambassador Ron Prosor was scheduled to speak after Abbas. Israeli former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert wrote: [...] "I believe that the Palestinian request from the United Nations is congruent with the basic concept of the two-state solution. Therefore, I see no reason to oppose it. Once the United Nations will lay the foundation for this idea, we in Israel will have to engage in a serious process of negotiations, in order to agree on specific borders based on the 1967 lines, and resolve the other issues. It is time to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to,</b> and encourage, the moderate forces amongst the Palestinians. Abu-Mazen [...] (Mahmoud Abbas) and Salam Fayyad need our help. It's time to give it." [...] There was a rally in support of the Palestinian bid in Tel Aviv's Rothschild Boulevard, which was organised by Gush Shalom, Peace Now, Hadash and Meretz. Former Foreign Ministry director Dr. Alon Liel said: [...] "As of today there is a Palestinian state. As of today we no longer control the life of a nation but the life of a separate state." [...] Former Meretz MK Mossi Raz said: [...] "We call on Lieberman and Netanyahu: It's not too late. Order the ambassador to say 'Israel yes.'" [...] Arab-Israeli singer Mira Awad also performed at the rally and said that she was [...] "happy with Abbas' bid and very sad about the inexplicable refusal to finally give the Palestinian people a chance to move forward." [...] Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard was criticised by Jewish groups for not rejecting the motion; she had initially wished to vote against the measure, but abstained instead due to opposition from her own cabinet and caucus. Netanyahu later downplayed the importance of the vote in saying that [...] "the decision at the United Nations will change nothing on the ground. It will not advance the establishment of a Palestinian state. It will delay it further. No matter how many hands are raised against us there is no power on earth that will cause me to compromise on Israel's security." ...|$|E

I hope she may hereafter acknowledge and respect my motives, but I cannot now go as a guest to her father's house." [...] And the Barchester Brutus went out to fortify his own resolution by meditations on his own virtue.|$|E
6000|$|It was Henry of Navarre himself who spoke, {{and bent}} to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the fallen imp. A flush of shame rushed over Berenger's face, already red with passion. He {{felt that he}} had done wrong to use his {{strength}} at such a moment, and that, though there had been spite in is assailant, he had not been therefore justified. He was glad to see Narcisse rise lightly to his feet, evidently unhurt, and, with the frankness with which he had often made it up with Philip Thistlewood or his other English comrades after a sharp tussle, he held out his hand, saying, 'Good demon, your pardon. You roused my spirit, and I forgot myself.' ...|$|E

"Elizabeth, {{take care}} of Miss Jane," [...] screams that worthy woman, who has been for a {{fortnight}} employed in getting this tremendous body of troops and baggage into marching order. [...] "Hicks!

60|$|But {{the river}} below the Abbey {{is to be}} traversed by stepping-stones, which, to the female uninitiated foot, appear {{to be full of}} danger. The Wharfe here is no {{insignificant}} brook, to be overcome by a long stride and a jump. There is a causeway, of perhaps forty stones, across it, each some eighteen inches distant from the other, which, flat and excellent though they be, are perilous from their number. Mrs. Lovel, who knew the place of old, had begun by declaring that no consideration should induce her to cross the water. Aunt Julia had proposed that they should go along the other bank, on the Abbey side of the river, and thence cross by the bridge half a mile up. But the Earl was resolved that he would take his cousin over the stepping-stones; and Minnie and the curate were equally determined. Minnie, indeed, had crossed the river, and was back again, while the matter was still being discussed. Aunt Julia, who was strong-limbed, as well as strong-minded, at last assented, the curate having promised all necessary aid. Mrs. Lovel seated herself at a distance to see the exploit; and then Lord Lovel started, with Lady Anna, turning at every stone to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> his cousin.|$|E
60|$|On {{the first}} night, Arthur Berkeley and the Progenitor {{went down in}} fear and {{trembling}} to the stage door of the Ambiguities. There was a full house, and the critics were all present, in some surprise at the temerity of this new man; for it was noised abroad already by those who had seen the rehearsals that 'The Primate of Fiji' was a fresh departure, after its own fashion, {{in the matter of}} English comic opera. The curtain rose upon the chorus of mermaids, and the first song was a decided hit. Still the Public, as becomes a first night, maintained a dignified and critical reserve. When the President of the Board of Trade, in full court costume, appeared upon the scene, {{in the midst of the}} very realistic long-haired sea-ladies, the audience was half shocked for a moment by the utter incongruity of the situation; but after a while they began to discover that the incongruity was part of the joke, and they laughed quietly a sedate and moderate laugh of suspended judgment. As the Progenitor had predicted, the gods were the first to enter into the spirit of the fun, and to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the Primate's first sermon. The scuntific professors on the Challenger Expedition took the fancy of the house a little more decidedly; and even the stalls thawed visibly when the professor of biology delivered his famous exposition of the evolution hypothesis to the assembled chiefs of Raratouga. But it was the one feeble second-hand old joke of the piece that really brought pit and boxes down together in a sudden fit of inextinguishable laughter. The professor of political economy enquired diligently, with note book in hand, of the Princess of Fiji, whether she thought the influence of the missionaries beneficial or otherwise; whether she considered these preachers of a new religion really good or not; to which the unsophisticated child of nature responded naively, 'Good, very good--roasted; but not quite so good boiled,' and the professor gravely entered the answer in his philosophic note-book. It was a very ancient jest indeed, but it tickled the ribs of the house mightily, as ancient jests usually do, and they burst forthwith into a hearty roar of genuine approval. Then Arthur began to breathe more freely. After that the house toned down again quietly, and gave no decided token of approbation till the end of the piece. When the curtain dropped there was a lull of hushed expectation for poor Arthur Berkeley; and at its close the house broke out into a storm of applause, and 'The Primate of Fiji' had firmly secured its position as the one great theatrical success of the present generation.|$|E

"Oh, never mind," [...] began Thekla ashamed; and at {{that moment}} a frantic barking was heard in the depths, and Valetta, Wilfred, Fergus and a dog or two darted headlong past, calling out, [...] "Hedgehogs, hedgehogs!
