A Brief History of the Group At the 2001 NCTM Research Presession, the facilitators of this <b>discussion</b> <b>group</b> led a session titled “Studying Professional Development is Messy Work. What are the research issues? ” Approximately 50 people attended. At the 2002 PME-NA meeting in Georgia, the same facilitators began a PME-NA-based <b>discussion</b> <b>group</b> to address continued interest in the issues surrounding research on professional development for teachers of mathematics (Arbaugh, Brown, & McGraw, 2002).

The analysis of the voices shows textualized voices, that include appropriated voices from mentors or previous teachers that replace the personal voices, at times. The dominant voice of the teacher comes into conflict with the other dominant voices during discussions. Thus, the relationship of these voices structures the <b>discussion</b> <b>group</b> sessions...|$|R
