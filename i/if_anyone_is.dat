5|$|Back at her apartment, Scully runs a {{background}} check of Doggett on her computer, learning about his background as a former NYPD detective. She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks outside {{the window to see}} <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>is</b> out there. She angrily calls Doggett to protest him monitoring her phone conversations, which he seems genuinely surprised about. She notices a mysterious man and runs into the hall to pursue him, but meets her landlord Mr. Coeben who tells her that he had seen Mulder.|$|E
5|$|The Minister can declare any fence or barrier {{surrounding}} {{a part of}} a security area to be a perimeter fence. The Commissioner of Police is permitted to take steps to prevent people from crossing the fence or passing articles over, through or under the fence, including defensive measures that involve or may involve danger to life. If the measures are taken in a place other than on, under or within the perimeter fence, the Commissioner must take precautions – including displaying prominent warning signs – to ensure that people do not accidentally enter the area. <b>If</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>is</b> injured or dies {{as a result of a}} defensive measure, no compensation is payable unless the Minister certifies that it is just and equitable for such compensation to be paid. It is an offence to cross or attempt to cross, or pass or attempt to pass any article over, though or under a perimeter fence except at an authorized entry point; and to damage, attempt to damage or tamper with any fence or any gate or movable barrier at an entry point.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} starts with Usher waking up inside an empty nightclub. He {{calls out to}} see <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>is</b> there and sees Hilson, whom he follows into {{a room full of}} people dancing as a disc jockey starts playing music. Usher chases Hilson around the club, who at times mysteriously vanishes. The two dance intimately {{throughout}} the video at the club's bar, dance floor and lounge. Its choreography was likened to Janet Jackson's [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] routine. The video concludes with the club burning down and Usher waking up in a valley. The storyline is continued in the [...] "Moving Mountains" [...] clip. During the video Usher is shown using a Sony Ericsson W350i Walkman, as part of Usher's endorsement of the company.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Disaster", Ro {{is one of}} {{the crew}} trapped on the bridge of the Enterprise when it {{undergoes}} a series of power failures. The ship is placed at risk of destruction because of the potential failure of the containment fields on the antimatter pods. Ro argues that they need to separate the saucer section to save those on-board it as they have no way knowing <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>is</b> still alive on the engineering part of the vessel. When the crew undergo group amnesia in [...] "Conundrum", Ro and Riker act on a mutual attraction until their memories are restored. In [...] "The Next Phase", Ro and La Forge apparently die after a transporter accident after returning from a Romulan Warbird. But they have suffered the side effects of a Romulan cloaking experiment. Ro initial questions whether or not she has died and is now in the afterlife. But together with La Forge they discover a Romulan plot and defeating a similarly cloaked Romulan operative, Ro and La Forge alert the crew and return to normal, warning Picard and averting disaster.|$|E

2500|$|Note that Maimonides' {{approach}} is also widely held amongst the non-rationalistic, mystical streams of Judaism—thus, for example, Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz, the Shlah HaKodosh holds that [...] "none of these sometimes mind-boggling 'stories' are devoid of profound meaning; <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>is</b> devoid of understanding, {{it is the}} reader" [...] (Shnei Luchos HaBris, introduction).|$|E

2500|$|Australia's Rod Marsh blamed England coach Keith Fletcher for {{the poor}} {{performances}} and for a negative attitude towards the series, criticising the coach's press conference comments in Adelaide. [...] "A team must always, always, play to win {{and even if you}} think that way you should never say it," [...] he told radio listeners. [...] "'The best we can do is an honourable draw' – what a load of codswallop. <b>If</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>is</b> wondering why England have had such a hard time in Australia, there lies the answer", but Fletcher refused to quit, citing a string of injuries and illnesses that had hampered the tour as the main cause of the team's lack of success and defending the inclusion of Gooch and Gatting, noting that [...] "indsight is a brilliant thing, but there was not one person who would have left Graham at home {{at the start of the}} tour." ...|$|E
2500|$|Until recently, it {{was thought}} that no Greek Church Father had taken note of the passage before the 1100s. [...] However, in 1941 a large {{collection}} of the writings of Didymus the Blind (c. 313–398) was discovered in Egypt, in which Didymus states that [...] "We find in certain gospels" [...] an episode in which a woman was accused of a sin, and was about to be stoned, but Jesus intervened [...] "and said to those who were about to cast stones, ‘He who has not sinned, let him take a stone and throw it. [...] <b>If</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>is</b> conscious in himself not to have sinned, let him take a stone and smite her.’ [...] And no one dared," [...] and so forth. [...] This is far from a direct quotation, but it may be a loose summary of the episode. [...] Barring the possibility that Didymus was referring to some other Gospel than the four-Gospel collection that was typically used in the churches in his time, this reference appears to establish that the passage was present in its usual place in some Greek manuscripts known in Alexandria and elsewhere from the 300s onwards.|$|E
2500|$|... "On {{one side}} of a table stands a grave-looking elderly gentleman with the ballot-box before him; on the other side sits a second still more grave, with an open book; in the book is written, each several number, on the margin, and {{opposite}} the number the name of the juror thereby denoted. The first grave gentleman shakes the box, puts in his hand, and takes out a card, from which he reads the number—then the other grave gentleman turns to that number in the book, and pronounces the name of the juror so numbered, whose name and address are then taken down as one of the forty-eight; and this process is repeated forty-eight times... it is said—I say nothing, but it is said—that those two gentlemen know each juror just as well by his number as by his name: and so, when the first takes out a card and finds 253, for example, written on it—if he knows that 253 would vote for the people, and against the Crown, it is said he gives out (as solemn as he looks), not 253, but, say, 255, or some loyal number; and thus a safe man is put on the list. Or, <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>is</b> standing by, and has an opportunity of seeing the card, he cries 253, and winks, or otherwise telegraphs to this other grave gentleman. Then the onus is upon the man with the book, who has nothing to do but call out a loyal man for the disloyal number, and so you have safe voters still. They never make the mistake, these elderly gentlemen, of turning out the whole forty-eight all of the right sort there is no need: there is a margin to the extent of twelve: and so they generally leave about nine or ten dubious names amongst the forty-eight. The Crown has afterwards the right to strike off twelve peremptorily, without reason assigned, and always gets rid of the men who would vote for the people.|$|E

If I {{happen to}} say {{that it would be a}} most reprehensible thing <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>were</b> to do something, somehow or other that is the very thing that Jack and you do. It was only last week I said that it would be a very {{objectionable}} trick <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>was</b> to tie paper bands round the neck of the clergyman's black cat--who is always stealing our chickens--and to my surprise, the next morning, when we started for business, there was quite a crowd outside his house, watching the cat calmly sitting over the porch, with white bands round its neck. Now, that is an example of what I mean." ...|$|R

50|$|Indeed, <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>was</b> {{attempting}} {{to kill the}} king, it was more likely Claude de Vin des Œillets, who had an illegitimate child fathered but not publicly acknowledged by Louis.

I should not mind a walk, {{if it is}} to be a walk; but a walk with you {{generally}} means rushing across ploughed fields and jumping into ditches, and getting one's self hot and uncomfortable, and splashing one's self from head to foot. It is bad enough in flannels, but it is downright misery in one's ordinary clothes. But I don't mind a game at rackets, <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>is</b> disposed for it." ...|$|E
