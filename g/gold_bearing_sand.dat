40|$|Methane gas {{hydrates}} are crystalline compounds {{formed from}} water and methane under certain pressure and temperature. They are mostly found in marine continental margin sediments {{and beneath the}} permafrost and considered as the future non-conventional energy resource. In order to develop innovative techniques for the safe extraction of methane gas from Methane Hydrate (MH) {{it is important to}} understand the shear behaviour of methane hydrate <b>bearing</b> <b>sand.</b> It has been reported that the pore scale habits of MH have a significant influence on the shear behaviour of methane hydrate <b>bearing</b> <b>sand.</b> In this paper, an attempt has been made to capture the effect of pore scale habits on the shear behaviour of methane hydrate <b>bearing</b> <b>sand</b> using the Discrete Element Method. Two modelling approaches (i) pore filling, leading to load bearing, and (ii) cementation, bonding of the interparticle contact, have been simulated using PFC 3 D. A series of triaxial monotonic tests were carried on an assembly of particles for different methane hydrate saturations. Both the approaches have captured, qualitatively, the stress ratio- axial strain behaviour similar to the laboratory experiments. The DEM simulation results highlight that MH saturation has a profound influence on the shear behaviour of hydrate <b>bearing</b> <b>sand.</b> It was shown that the cementation habit closely captures the variation of peak deviator stress with MH saturation similar to the laboratory experiments. Moreover, the evolution of micro-mechanical parameter (e. g. contact force and bond breakage) during shear loading has been presented and discussed...|$|R

50|$|The Wernecke Mountains {{are home}} to many rich mineral deposits, {{including}} the largest gold deposit in the Yukon, the Eagle Gold deposit. This deposit is found is the Tombstone Plutonic Suite, a series of <b>gold</b> <b>bearing</b> intrusions stretching across Alaska and the Yukon known as the Tombstone Gold Belt.. These deposits are characterized by sheeted mineralized veins within granitoid intrusions and fault-veins, breccias and replacement style mineralization in the country rocks.

5000|$|Remington Hill {{lay on a}} <b>gold</b> <b>bearing</b> gravel {{channel on}} the Chalk Bluff Ridge, which lies between Steep Hollow and Greenhorn Creeks, tributaries of the Bear River. As the channel runs southwest, it joins a major channel running from the San Juan Ridge easterly through Red Dog and You Bet into Placer County. Remington Hill became a center for both {{hydraulic}} and drift mining.Water for hydraulic mining was brought from Steep Hollow Creek by a 16 mile ditch constructed between 1854 and 1857.

40|$|GS- 11 sand of Gandhar {{which is}} oil {{producer}} in North eastern and North {{western part of}} the field is having varying electrical property. The electrical resistivity range of hydrocarbon producing interval of this sand varies from 3 ohmm to 300 ohmm., while the range of water producing interval varies from 2 - 9 ohmm. Due to its low resistivity it becomes difficult to identify it’s hydrocarbon bearing potential on normal suit of log. A method has been devised which takes into account of acoustic impedance characteristic of this sand. Theoretical acoustic impedance of the sand is calculated using linear volumetric average formula. This is compared with the actual observed acoustic impedance on the log on a cross plot. As theoretically calculated acoustic impedance assumes the rock as water bearing only, hence in case of hydrocarbon bearing rock it is more than the actual acoustic impedance value. This difference in case of hydrocarbon bearing rock stands out on the crossplot involving the above two impedance values. Hence, the hydrocarbon <b>bearing</b> <b>sand</b> is discriminated against water <b>bearing</b> <b>sand</b> irrespective of their resistivity values...|$|R
