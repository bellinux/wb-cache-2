40|$|Environmental, {{architectural}} {{and organizational}} issues may support or hinder planned emergency measures. Existing laws define {{a set of}} parameters {{that have to be}} implemented within the framework for disaster, in order to ensure the health and safety both for workers and guests. A recent study has been developed to test the response of individuals and the efficiency of emergency plans, analysing the response of people just after an earthquake. Educational institutions have been chosen as field of application, because these buildings represent a mix of staff, employees, students and families, anyone with different knowledge, behaviours and roles of emergency procedures as planned. The study of the emergency and post-emergency stages, as perceived by the 1, 300 individuals {{who took part in the}} survey, has highlighted a preferred list of key points used later by educational teams, municipality offices and civil protection to strengthen the existing procedures. The scope is to organize a feasible defence in case of danger, based on a better building and urban evaluation, training people within a broader “civil based” <b>emergency</b> <b>instruction...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a program of}} research examining emergency messaging during the response and early recovery phases of natural disasters. The objective of this suite of studies is to develop message construction frameworks and channels that maximise community compliance with instructional messaging. The research has adopted a multi-hazard approach and considers the impact of formal emergency messages, as well as informal messages (e. g., social media posts), on community compliance. In recent years, media reports have consistently demonstrated highly variable community compliance to instructional messaging during natural disasters. Footage of individuals watching a tsunami approaching from the beach or being over-run by floodwaters are disturbing and indicate {{the need for a}} clearer understanding of decision making under stress.

Preliminary results indicate that there is, as yet, little published evidence on which to base decisions about emergency instructional messages to threatened communities.

30|$|In {{traditional}} urban {{rail transit}} systems, drivers provide necessary information {{and communicate with}} passengers in case of delays and/or emergencies [48]. In DTO systems, drivers are not present anymore, so the required information, especially in emergencies, the operation center should provide onboard and platform voice information (e.g., delays, <b>emergency</b> <b>instructions)</b> to passengers [48]. The passengers could communicate with the staff in the operation center through onboard emergency calls and onboard telemetry. In addition, the videos, images, and other information collected by the CCTV and supervision systems should send to the operation center continuously to enable the operator undertake suitable measures [4]. So the reliability and usability of the communication systems is significant for the DTO systems.|$|R

At around 2:30 a.m., a Canadian Pacific Railway train derailed and leaked 240,000 gal of toxic anhydrous ammonia, releasing a cloud of caustic, poisonous gas over the city. At the time, Clear Channel owned six commercial radio stations out of nine in the Minot area. City officials attempted to contact the local Clear Channel office by telephone to spread warnings of the danger using its radio stations, but it was several critical hours before the station manager was finally reached at his home. In the meantime, 9-1-1 operators were advising panicked callers to tune to KCJB for <b>emergency</b> <b>instructions,</b> but the station was not broadcasting any such information.|$|R

50|$|During the conflict, life {{in much of}} {{southern}} Israel was paralyzed by Hamas rocket and mortar fire. The Israeli Home Front Command issued detailed <b>emergency</b> <b>instructions</b> to Israeli citizens for preparing for and dealing with rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip. The instructions included orders to stay within a certain distance of bomb shelters based on proximity {{to the source of}} the rockets. Hamas' Grad rockets' increased range of 40 km put more than 700,000 Israelis within strike range, prompting 40% of the residents of the southern city of Ashkelon to flee the city, despite official calls to stay. Throughout the war, Palestinian rocket attacks into Israel damaged or destroyed more than 1,500 homes and buildings and 327 vehicles. Numerous agricultural fields near Gaza also sustained damage. Twenty-eight Israeli families lost their homes to rocket attacks, and had to temporarily live in hotels. Among the buildings hit were nine educational facilities and three synagogues.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{surveillance}} framework (SECRETS: SECure Real-time ElecTronic Surveillance) {{that is a}} practical solution to safeguarding sensitive physical facilities like command and control centers, missile storage facilities of a military base, traffic controller units of airports and other high-volume public areas by providing controlled secure distribution of live multimedia data recorded on-site onto display devices with different access permissions in a multi-level secure environment. Our methodology uses cameras and microphones as input devices and handheld radio linked displays as output devices. The geographical location of an input device determines its security level and the classification of the holder determines the security level of an output device. Our objective is to respect the security classifications whereby only those recipients with corresponding security classifications receive live media streams, but during emergencies, they can receive pre-computed <b>emergency</b> <b>instructions</b> and/or cover stories.

40|$|The nerve agents, GA, GB, and VX are organophosphorus esters {{that form}} {{a major portion}} of the total agent volume {{contained}} in the U. S. stockpile of unitary chemical munitions. Congress has mandated the destruction of these agents, which is currently slated for completion in 2004. The acute, chronic, and delayed toxicity of these agents is reviewed in this analysis. The largely negative results from studies of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, developmental, and reproductive toxicity are also presented. Nerve agents show few or delayed effects. At supralethal doses, GB can cause delayed neuropathy in antidote-protected chickens, but {{there is no evidence that}} it causes this syndrome in humans at any dose. Agent VX shows no potential for inducing delayed neuropathy in any species. In view of their lack of genotoxcity, the nerve agents are not likely to be carcinogens. The overreaching concern with regard to nerve agent exposure is the extraordinarily high acute toxicity of these substances. Furthermore, acute effects of moderate exposure such as nausea, diarrhea, inability to perform simple mental tasks, and respiratory effects may render the public unable to respond adequately to <b>emergency</b> <b>instructions</b> in the unlikely event of agent releaase, making early warning and exposure avoidance important. Likewise, exposure or self-contamination of first responders and medical personnel must be avoided.
