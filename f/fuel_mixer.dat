40|$|The {{hydrogen}} mixer for the Space Transportation Main Engine {{is used to}} mix cold hydrogen {{bypass flow}} with warm hydrogen coolant chamber gas, which is then fed to the injectors. It {{is very important to}} have a uniform fuel temperature at the injectors in order to minimize mixture ratio problems due to the fuel density variations. In addition, the fuel at the injector has certain total pressure requirements. In order to achieve these objectives, the hydrogen mixer must provide a thoroughly mixed fluid with a minimum pressure loss. The AEROVISC computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code was used to analyze the STME hydrogen mixer, and proved to be an effective tool in optimizing the mixer design. AEROVISC, which solves the Reynolds Stress-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations in primitive variable form, was used to assess the effectiveness of different mixer designs. Through a parametric study of mixer design variables, an optimal design was selected which minimized mixed fuel temperature variation and <b>fuel</b> <b>mixer</b> pressure loss.

40|$|Abstract. Stress {{analysis}} {{is an essential}} part of the design process and is also an indispensable tool for optimizing structural design to meet multidisciplinary performance requirements. The purpose of this study is to determine natural vibration frequency of intake manifold on the natural gas motorcycle by using finite element modal analysis. Besides that, the stress and displacements of the manifold structure are also been determined. When the motorcycle engine is running, the engine will cause some vibration due to unbalance condition of the engine. Vibration created by the engine will be transmitted to all neighboring component including intake manifold as well as the air <b>fuel</b> <b>mixer.</b> Intake manifold is next to the engine which is the source of the vibration. Thus, it takes greater impact of the transmitted vibration as compare to other components. Computer simulation technique using Finite Element method has been used to simulate this problem. Finite Element structure analysis was employed to study the stress distribution and natural frequency of the intake manifold. Finite Element model of the intake manifold is developed and analyzed. The effect of localize stiffening with ribs on intake manifold is considered to reduce the level of the vibration. It was found that by adding a stiffened rib to the manifold structure, the natural frequencies are increased. This may due to the stiffening of the manifold structure which dominates its vibration characteristics. Moreover, the strength of the manifold structure is also increased by adding a rib...|$|E
40|$|New York City Department of Sanitation has {{operated}} natural gas fueled refuse haulers {{in a pilot}} study: a major goal {{of this study was}} to compare the emissions from these natural gas vehicles with their diesel counterparts. The vehicles were tandem axle trucks with GVW (gross vehicle weight) rating of 69, 897 pounds. The primary use of these was for street collection and transporting the refuse to a landfill. West Virginia University Transportable Heavy Duty Emissions Testing Laboratories have been engaged in monitoring the tailpipe emissions from these trucks for seven-years. In the later years of testing the hydrocarbons were speciated for non-methane and methane components. Six of these vehicles employed the older technology (mechanical mixer) Cummins L- 10 lean burn natural gas engines. Five trucks were equipped with electronically controlled Detroit Diesel Series 50 lean burn engines, while another five were powered by Caterpillar stoichiometric burn 3306 natural gas engines, The Ca terpillar engines employed an exhaust oxygen sensor feedback and three way catalysts. Since the refuse haulers had automatic Allison transmissions, and since they were employed in stop-and-go city service, initial emissions measurements were made using the Central Business Cycle (SAE Jl 376) for buses at 42, 000 pound test weight. Some additional measurements were made using an ad hoc cycle that has been designed to be more representative of the real refuse hauler use that included several compaction cycles. The Cummins powered natural gas vehicles showed oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide emission variations typically associated with variable <b>fuel</b> <b>mixer</b> performance. In the first Year of testing, the stoichiometric Caterpillar engines yielded low emission levels, but in later years two of these refuse haulers had high carbon monoxide attributed to failure of the feedback system. For example, carbon monoxide on these two vehicles rose from 1. 4 g/mile and 10 g/mile in 1995 to 144. 9 g/mile and 57. 8 g/mile in 1996. These stoichiometric engines were also less fuel efficient than their lean burn counterparts. The Detroit Diesel Series 50 powered refuse haulers produced high levels of oxides of nitrogen. However, it was found that changing the shifting patterns of the transmission lowered the oxides of nitrogen. All three engine types showed the potential for low emissions operation and the particulate matter reduction advantage offered by natural gas was evident from the results...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate and compare the performance and emission characteristics of the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) -fuelled engine generator and the conventional gasoline-fuelled engine generator. The approach involves converting a gasoline engine generator, commonly used in Malaysian night markets to generate electricity, to the LPG engine generator. A four-stroke SI single-cylinder engine is equipped with an LPG injection system with minor modifications and then tested with both LPG and gasoline <b>fuels.</b> A venturi <b>mixer</b> (carburettor) was designed and in house constructed and then installed to deliver a proper A/F ratio to the combustion chamber. The commercial computational fluid dynamics software FLUENT was used for simulation of air flow inside the mixer. The converted engine was tested at constant speed for its brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), efficiency, exhaust temperature, and exhaust gas emissions. The results show that the performance and emission characteristics of the LPG-fuelled engine are well suited for use in night markets. Average BSFC and average efficiency for the LPG engine over a range of loads were quite similar to those for the gasoline engine: the average BSFC was 0. 95 kg/kWh for the LPG engine and 1 kg/kWh for the gasoline engine. The lower energy content of LPG causes only a slight reduction in efficiency as 17 per cent reduction in average efficiency was recorded over the entire load range; however, the LPG engine fared better at higher loads than the gasoline engine for which only as low as 4 per cent reduction was recorded at high loads. Emission testsseemto verify the minimal pollution products; there are significant reductions in the emission concentration results when LPG is used. Average decreases of 32 per cent for nitrogen oxide, 10 per cent for carbon dioxide, and 40 per cent for carbon monoxide were recorded. However, higher values of hydrocarbon were recorded, but as high as 50 per cent reduction in HC was found for loads higher than 700 W. The study verified the more favourable features ofLPGcompared to gasoline as it is one of the best alternative fuels to gasoline for spark-ignition engine generators to solve the air pollution problem in night markets...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of an emulsion by emulsification plant without {{the addition of}} chemical additives always requires an injection device of the dispersed phase (water or ethanol) into the continuous phase (fuel oil). In this way a preliminary mixture of immiscible liquids is produced at the right volume ratio. Such a mixture is processed downstream to have an emulsion with the dispersed phase drop mean diameters less than 4 μm. Since Gas Turbines have a variable fuel flow related to the delivered power, there is the necessity of maintaining a prescribed dispersed phase to continuous phase volumetric ratio when the fuel flow varies. This paper deals with an automatic device {{that is capable of}} producing the prescribed injection ratio of the dispersed phase into the fuel oil when the fuel oil flow rate changes. Such a device is developed to be coupled with an emulsification system that provides to break an immiscible part of fluid in a very small drops. The system is for feeding fuel into engines (S. I. Gasoline, Diesel, Gas Turbine combustors) operating at variable loadings i. e variable liquid <b>fuel</b> flow. The <b>mixer</b> (PMD, Pre-Mixer Device) has been presented at ASME Turbo Expo (Montreal 2007) for diesel # 2 operating at 25 °C with the viscosity being assumed as constant because of its variation is in a reduced range. In this paper, different fuels having different viscosities (diesel oil of different numbers, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, etc) have been tested. The major modeling aspect concerns with the behavior of the annular orifice that produces a membrane displacement. A bibliographic analysis has been performed and the main results are reported in this paper. Since the architecture of the orifice, its geometry and the flow conditions were not reported in the bibliography, systematic experiments have been performed. Such experiments where carried on for various liquids having various viscosities for different geometric arrangements and force acting on the membrane. The analysis of results led to formulate models to describe both the flow discharge and effective force coefficients. The paper gives a complete outlook of the experiments and of the above models. The viscosity dependent models have been introduced in to the PMD simulation code. Such models that take the influence of viscosity into account have been developed and some scale-up rules have been established. An amply description of the sizing and scale-up models are presented together with modification to improve the prototype behavior operated with fluids having different viscosities. Experimental results concerning the influence of viscosity of the continuous phase are presented and widely discussed taking the model as reference...|$|R
