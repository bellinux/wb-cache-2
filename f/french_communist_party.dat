5|$|During {{the final}} {{part of his}} career, Tzara {{combined}} his humanist and anti-fascist perspective with a communist vision, joining the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance during World War II, and serving a term in the National Assembly. Having spoken in favor of liberalization in the People's Republic of Hungary just before the Revolution of 1956, he distanced himself from the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> {{of which he was}} by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the Algerian War.|$|E
5|$|In June 1939, Pontecorvo {{applied for}} a visa to visit Sweden, but his {{application}} was rejected. On 23 August came {{the news of the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. He joined the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> the next day as an affirmation of his personal faith in the Soviet Union. Marianne rejoined him in Paris on 6 September 1939, three days after the British and French declaration of war on Germany in response to the German invasion of Poland that started the Second World War in Europe. They were married on 9 January 1940.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} this geopolitical perspective, Pablo {{argued that the}} only way the Trotskyists could avoid {{isolation}} was for various sections of the Fourth International to undertake long-term entryism in the mass Communist or Social Democratic parties. This tactic was known as entrism sui generis, to distinguish it from the short-term entry tactic employed before World War II. For example, it meant that the project of building an open and independent Trotskyist party was shelved in France, because it was regarded as not politically feasible alongside entry into the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{political}} instability {{characteristic of the}} Fourth Republic was gone. The far-right extremists who had threatened military coups over the question of French Algeria largely receded after Algeria was granted independence. The <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> image gradually became less radical. Politics largely turned into a Gaullists vs left-wing opposition.|$|R
50|$|Both the <b>French</b> and Indochinese <b>Communist</b> <b>parties</b> were outlawed.|$|R
5|$|The French {{government}} negotiator Jean Sainteny flew to Saigon {{to consult}} Leclerc, who was acting as high commissioner {{in the absence}} of d'Argenlieu. Leclerc approved Sainteny's proposal to negotiate with Ho because he preferred a diplomatic solution to a larger conflict, but he still dispatched a flotilla with shiploads of French soldiers to northern Vietnam ready to attack if the talks failed. At that time, Ho felt that negotiations with the French constituted his best option because the Soviet Union had not yet endorsed the Vietminh or the Vietnamese nationalist party (VNQDD), and the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> chose to support French rule in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth of}} eight {{children}} of a wealthy Italian family, Pontecorvo studied physics at the University of Rome La Sapienza, under Fermi, becoming the youngest of his Via Panisperna boys. In 1934 he participated in Fermi's famous experiment showing the properties of slow neutrons that {{led the way to}} the discovery of nuclear fission. He moved to Paris in 1934, where he conducted research under Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie. Influenced by his cousin, Emilio Sereni, he joined the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> as did his sisters Guiliana and Laura and brother Gillo. The Italian Fascist regime's 1938 racial laws against Jews caused his family members to leave Italy for Britain, France and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by the {{establishment}} of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, which also signified the end of Berlin's avant-garde, he merged his activities as an art promoter with the cause of anti-fascism, and {{was close to the}} <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PCF). In 1936, Richter recalled, he published a series of photographs secretly taken by Kurt Schwitters in Hanover, works which documented the destruction of Nazi propaganda by the locals, ration stamp with reduced quantities of food, and other hidden aspects of Hitler's rule. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he briefly left France and joined the Republican forces. Alongside Soviet reporter Ilya Ehrenburg, Tzara visited Madrid, which was besieged by the Nationalists (see Siege of Madrid). Upon his return, he published the collection of poems Midis gagnés ("Conquered Southern Regions"). Some of them had previously been printed in the brochure Les poètes du monde défendent le peuple espagnol ("The Poets of the World Defend the Spanish People", 1937), which was edited by two prominent authors and activists, Nancy Cunard and the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. Tzara had also signed Cunard's June 1937 call to intervention against Francisco Franco. Reportedly, he and Nancy Cunard were romantically involved.|$|E
50|$|In France, {{moderate}} Communists, such {{as historian}} Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, resigned, questioning the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> policy of supporting Soviet actions. The French philosopher and writer Albert Camus wrote an open letter, The Blood of the Hungarians, criticising the West's lack of action. Even Jean-Paul Sartre, still a determined Communist, criticised the Soviets {{in his article}} Le Fantôme de Staline, in Situations VII. Left Communists were particularly supportive of the revolution.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, his {{greatest}} {{success as a}} trade union leader was when workers across the French West Africa went on a 71-days general strike to force {{the implementation of a}} new overseas labor code and was elected to Guinea's Territorial Assembly the same year. As a result, he was elected as one of the three secretaries-general of the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> Confédération Générale du Travail (General Confederation of Labour; CGT) in 1954.|$|R
5|$|Like the Italian and <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>parties,</b> the {{majority}} of the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Finland denounced the occupation. Nonetheless, Finnish president Urho Kekkonen was the very first Western politician to officially visit Czechoslovakia after August 1968; he received the highest Czechoslovakian honours from the hands of President Ludvík Svoboda, on 4 October 1969. The Portuguese communist secretary-general Álvaro Cunhal was one of few political leaders from western Europe to have supported the invasion for being counter-revolutionary. along with the Luxembourg party and conservative factions of the Greek party.|$|R
5|$|Born on 9 January 1910 in Damascus to {{a middle}} class Greek Orthodox Christian family, his father, Joseph, working as a grain merchant. Aflaq was first educated in the westernized schools of the French Mandate of Syria. In 1929, he left Syria to study {{philosophy}} abroad at the Sorbonne in Paris. During his stay Aflaq {{was influenced by the}} works of Henri Bergson, and met his longtime collaborator Salah al-Din al-Bitar, a fellow Syrian nationalist. Aflaq founded an Arab Student Union at the Sorbonne, and discovered the writings of Karl Marx. He returned to Syria in 1932, and became active in communist politics, but left the movement when the government of Léon Blum, supported by the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (FCP), continued France's old politics towards its colonies. Aflaq, and others, had believed that the FCP followed pro-independence policies towards the French colonies. It had not helped that the Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party (SLCP) supported the FCP's decision. From then on Aflaq saw the communist movement as a tool of the Soviet Union. He was impressed by the organisation and ideology of Antun Saadeh's Syrian Social Nationalist Party.|$|E
25|$|In 1933 {{he joined}} the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (Parti communiste français, PCF).|$|E
25|$|Saumoneau {{stayed with}} the socialist SFIO rather than join the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
50|$|Born in Hergnies, Nord, a {{small town}} in the coal-mining region of {{northern}} France, Stil was educated at the University of Lille, earning a degree in philosophy. He taught at the University from 1941 to 1944. Having joined the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1940, he then held a series of increasingly senior editorial positions with communist newspapers. He was secretary-general of Liberté until 1949, then editor-in-chief of Ce Soir. He served as editor of the party's main newspaper, L'Humanité, until 1956, continuing to contribute thereafter, and from 1950 to 1970 {{he was a member of}} the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> central committee.|$|R
50|$|He was a {{political}} activist in France during the 1968 student riots. In 1969 he left the country, disgusted by the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> failures, for Argentina. Over the period of a year Mesili explored Patagonia, crossing the Southern Patagonian Ice Field; {{he may have been}} the first person to travel through modern-day Los Glaciares National Park. He further explored the Cordillera Darwin and crossed into Chile. He later moved to La Paz, where he worked as a mountain guide.|$|R
5000|$|From a Trotskyist {{point of}} view, Ernest Mandel in From Stalinism to Eurocommunism: The Bitter Fruits of 'Socialism in One Country views Eurocommunism as a {{subsequent}} {{development of the}} decision taken by the Soviet Union in 1924 to abandon the goal of world revolution and concentrate on social and economic development of the Soviet Union, the doctrine of [...] "socialism in one country". According to this vision the Eurocommunists of the Italian and <b>French</b> <b>communist</b> <b>parties</b> {{are considered to be}} nationalist movements, who together with the Soviet Union abandoned internationalism.|$|R
25|$|At the Berlin conference, the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> {{rejected}} {{the possibility of}} holding future conferences on the same lines.|$|E
25|$|In {{a change}} of stance, after the war she {{remained}} with {{the right of the}} socialist party after the majority split off to form the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|Around 1920 Brion {{joined the}} <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> She {{was one of}} the few Frenchwomen who were able to visit revolutionary Russia in 1919–22, with Madeleine Pelletier and Magdeleine Marx.|$|E
5000|$|On 16 September, L'Humanité, {{which at}} that time was the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> {{official}} daily newspaper, reported on a notebook belonging to Sir Jack Drummond. The notebook, which was partially burnt, was allegedly found by schoolchildren on a rubbish heap in Long Eaton, near the Drummonds' Nottingham residence. The newspaper reported that on one unspecified day in July 1947, a note was written [...] "6 pm, meeting in Lurs with …". The rest of the line had been burnt. The source of this information was deemed by the British press to be unreliable.|$|R
50|$|In {{many other}} {{capitalist}} countries, struggles against dictatorships, state repression, and colonisation were also marked by protests in 1968, {{such as the}} beginning of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Tlatelolco massacre in Mexico City, and the escalation of guerrilla warfare against the military dictatorship in Brazil. Countries governed by <b>communist</b> <b>parties</b> had protests against bureaucratic and military elites. In Eastern Europe there were widespread protests that escalated particularly in the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia. In response, USSR occupied Czechoslovakia. The occupation was denounced by the Italian and <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>parties,</b> and the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Finland. Few western European political leaders defended the occupation, among them the Portuguese communist secretary-general Álvaro Cunhal. along with the Luxembourg party and conservative factions of the Greek party.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} September, the Italian and <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Parties</b> {{had decided}} {{to set up a}} column. Luigi Longo, ex-leader of the Italian Communist Youth, was charged to make the {{necessary}} arrangements with the Spanish government. The Soviet Ministry of Defense also helped, since they had experience of dealing with corps of international volunteers during the Russian Civil War. The idea was initially opposed by Largo Caballero, but after the first setbacks of the war, he changed his mind, and finally agreed to the operation on 22 October. However, the Soviet Union did not withdraw from the Non-Intervention Committee, probably to avoid diplomatic conflict with France and the United Kingdom.|$|R
25|$|In 1934, Manouchian {{joined the}} <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> From 1935 to 1937 he edited the Armenian-language left-wing weekly {{newspaper}} Zangou, {{named for a}} river in Armenia. The newspaper was anti-fascist, anti-Dashnak, anti-imperialist and pro-Soviet.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{a devout}} if left-wing Catholic, Althusser joined the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1948, {{a time when}} others such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty were losing sympathy for the party. That same year, Althusser passed the agrégation in philosophy.|$|E
25|$|A {{student at}} Berlin Institute of Technology and ParisTech between 1925 and 1931, Roller also joined the Communist Party of Germany in 1926 and the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1928, {{working on their}} publications. Professionally, he {{qualified}} as a road and highway superintendent.|$|E
5|$|Pablo and Mandel {{aimed to}} counter the {{opposition}} of the majorities inside the British Revolutionary <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and <b>French</b> Internationalist <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> Initially, they encouraged party members to vote out their leaderships. They supported Gerry Healy's opposition in the RCP. In France, they backed elements, including Pierre Frank and Marcel Bleibtreu, opposed to the new leadership of the PCI albeit for differing reasons.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the end of}} the Great Power {{alliance}} at the end of World War II and {{the beginning}} of the Cold War, so-called [...] "Browderism" [...] was attacked by the rest of the international Communist movement. They particularly criticized the restructuring of the American party in 1944. In April 1945 the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> theoretical magazine, Les Cahiers du communisme, published an article by French party leader Jacques Duclos that declared that Browder's beliefs about a harmonious post-war world were [...] "erroneous conclusions in no wise flowing from a Marxist analysis of the situation." [...] Duclos held that Browder's [...] "liquidation of the independent political party of the working class" [...] constituted a [...] "notorious revision of Marxism." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the midst}} of the struggle, a {{proposal}} that the colony be converted into a French-Indian condominium was floated from <b>French</b> quarters. The <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> immediately rejected the proposal.|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} side women of the Resistance, {{many of whom were}} {{associated}} with combat groups linked to the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PCF), broke the gender barrier by fighting side by side with men. After the war, their services were ignored, but France did give women the vote in 1944.|$|E
25|$|Singer {{spent the}} rest of his life living in Paris, {{reporting}} first for The Economist, and then, after 1970, for The Nation, and became in 1980 the magazine's European correspondent.

25|$|There were {{a number}} of {{reconciliations}} after this period of disunion, such as between Breton and Bataille, while Aragon left the group after committing himself to the <b>French</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1932.
