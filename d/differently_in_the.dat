5|$|Bubbles do not redissolve {{immediately}} on recompression, {{and rates of}} gas uptake will alter from initial dive to repetitive dives, so repetitive dives must be handled <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mathematical model to predict safe decompression.|$|E
5|$|Later on the bridge, Data is {{reviewing}} {{the information from}} the probes sent into the nebula. He theorises that life might have evolved <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nebula because of the volume of dark matter detected. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) orders the ship to the nearest planet within the nebula. Data and D'Sora configure further probes, when she kisses him on the cheek and then on the lips, before leaving the room. Data seeks the opinion of his friends, including Picard, Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Worf (Michael Dorn). Data decides to pursue the relationship and goes to D'Sora's cabin with a bunch of flowers, where he informs her that he created a romantic subroutine for the relationship.|$|E
5|$|Like all metal type revivals, {{reviving}} Gill Sans {{in digital}} form raises several decisions of interpretation, such as {{the issue of how}} to compensate for the ink spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger. As a result, printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match. The digital release of Gill Sans, like many Monotype digitisations, has been criticised, in particular for excessively tight letter-spacing and lack of optical sizes: with only one design released that has to be used at any text size, it cannot replicate the subtlety of design and spacing of the metal type, for which every size was drawn <b>differently.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> hot metal era the structure of the font varied by size as is normal for metal type, with wider spacing and other detail changes at smaller text sizes. In the phototype period Monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master, but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital. To replicate this, it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate for size changes, such as expanding the spacing and increasing the weight used at smaller sizes.|$|E

30|$|In general, proper {{amounts of}} S/a, unit weight and super {{plasticizer}} were <b>differently</b> used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mixture. It {{was dependent on}} blending ratios of CS and incorporation ratios of FA.|$|R
5|$|Technically, the Kleinschmidt orthography {{focused upon}} morphology: the same derivational affix would be written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way <b>in</b> {{different}} contexts, despite its being pronounced <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> different contexts. <b>The</b> 1973 reform replaced {{this with a}} phonological system: Here, {{there was a clear}} link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> different contexts. <b>The</b> differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter) whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.|$|R
25|$|Friends and foes are {{represented}} <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain. The fusiform cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, amygdala, and areas involved in motivational control were differentially activated {{as a function}} of previous social encounters. In general, these areas were more active when faces were perceived as foes rather than friends.|$|E
25|$|Although in the Pali tradition, Maudgalyāyana is {{described}} as an arhat who {{will no longer be}} reborn again, in the Mahayāna traditions this is sometimes interpreted <b>differently.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Lotus Sutra, Chapter 6 (Bestowal of Prophecy), the Buddha is said to predict that the disciples Mahākasyapa, Subhuti, Mahakatyayana, and Maudgalyāyana will become Buddhas in the future.|$|E
25|$|Arthur's knights are {{described}} <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film and the legend. In the film, Lancelot, Tristan, Bors {{and the other}} Knights of the Round Table are Sarmatian knights fighting for {{the glory of the}} Roman Empire. In historical notes, the Knights of the Round Table are Britons, knights of Romano-Celtic Britain fighting for the freedom of Britain against the Saxons.|$|E
30|$|<b>Differently,</b> <b>in</b> [1], <b>the</b> authors {{consider}} the performance {{limits of the}} optimal maximum likelihood detector, while in [3] a soft-decision decoder is taken under consideration with Bayes optimal statistics at each iteration. Finally, the works [14, 16 – 18] take into account approximate message passing decoding algorithms.|$|R
50|$|EMV cards {{can have}} either contact or {{contactless}} interfaces. They work {{as if they}} were a normal EMV card with a contact interface. Via the contactless interface they work somewhat <b>differently,</b> <b>in</b> that <b>the</b> card commands enabled improved features such as lower power and shorter transaction times.|$|R
25|$|In other languages, derivations from curatus {{may be used}} <b>differently.</b> <b>In</b> French, <b>the</b> curé is {{the chief}} priest of a parish, as is the Italian curato, the Spanish cura, and the Filipino term kura pároko (which almost always refers to the parish priest), which is derived from Spanish.|$|R
25|$|The Contra war {{unfolded}} <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{northern and}} southern zones of Nicaragua. Contras based in Costa Rica operated on Nicaragua's Atlantic coast, which is sparsely populated by indigenous groups including the Miskito, Sumo, Rama, Garifuna, and Mestizo. Unlike Spanish-speaking western Nicaragua, the Atlantic Coast is predominantly English-speaking and was largely ignored by the Somoza regime. The costeños {{did not participate in}} the uprising against Somoza and viewed Sandinismo with suspicion from the outset.|$|E
25|$|Two detectives from RHD interrogated her {{the next}} month, July 2010. She {{told them she}} was {{concerned}} that events leading to Lazarus's arrest {{in which she was}} involved had been portrayed <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media than she recalled them, putting the department in a more favorable light. Nuttall as well, she recalled, had been placed in an equally difficult position, since he told her that Lazarus may have learned that they had reopened the investigation despite the precautions he and Barba had taken.|$|E
25|$|In {{the study}} How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm (2010) the {{researchers}} criticized the free-choice paradigm as invalid, because the rank-choice-rank method is inaccurate {{for the study}} of cognitive dissonance. That the designing of research-models relies upon the assumption that, if the experimental subject rates options <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second survey, then the attitudes of the subject towards the options have changed. That there are other reasons why an experimental subject might achieve different rankings in the second survey; perhaps the subjects were indifferent between choices.|$|E
2500|$|The term buddha has {{acquired}} somewhat different meanings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> various Buddhist traditions. An equivalent term for Buddha is Tathāgata, [...] "the thus-gone". The way to Buddhahood is somewhat <b>differently</b> understood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> various buddhist traditions.|$|R
2500|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> Catholic church, {{there are}} moral debates on certain treatments. [...] A {{significant}} number of Catholic moralists consider use of methotrexate and the salpingostomy procedure to be not [...] "morally permissible" [...] because they destroy the embryo; however [...] situations are considered <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> mother's health is endangered, and the whole fallopian tube with the developing embryo inside is removed.|$|R
30|$|Conclusions: Our {{results suggest}} that qSOFA and SIRS perform <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> {{identifying}} <b>the</b> septic patient. Outcomes are worse for patients who are SIRS negative/qSOFA positive compared to SIRS positive/qSOFA negative patients. This suggests qSOFA {{may be a better}} indicator <b>in</b> identifying <b>the</b> septic patient with strong predictive validity and provides a quick and reproducible bedside prompt to further investigation and management of sepsis.|$|R
25|$|A {{popular belief}} exists that the Inuit have {{an unusually large}} number of words for snow. This is not accurate, and results from a {{misunderstanding}} {{of the nature of}} polysynthetic languages. In fact, the Inuit have only a few base roots for snow: 'qanniq-' ('qanik-' in some dialects), which is used most often like the verb to snow, and 'aput', which means snow as a substance. Parts of speech work very <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Inuit language than in English, so these definitions are somewhat misleading.|$|E
25|$|Orchidaceae is {{the largest}} family of all {{angiosperms}} and hence {{by far the largest}} in the order. The Dahlgren system recognized three families of orchids, but DNA sequence analysis later showed that these families are polyphyletic and so should be combined. Several studies suggest (with high bootstrap support) that Orchidaceae is the sister {{of the rest of the}} Asparagales. Other studies have placed the orchids <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> phylogenetic tree, generally among the Boryaceae-Hypoxidaceae clade. The position of Orchidaceae shown above seems the best current hypothesis, but cannot be taken as confirmed.|$|E
25|$|Race {{was asked}} <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Census 2000 {{in several other}} ways than previously. Most significantly, {{respondents}} were given the option of selecting one or more race categories to indicate racial identities. Data show that nearly seven million Americans identified as members {{of two or more}} races. Because of these changes, the Census 2000 data on race are not directly comparable with data from the 1990 census or earlier censuses. Use of caution is therefore recommended when interpreting changes in the racial composition of the US population over time.|$|E
50|$|Different {{approaches}} to portfolio optimization measure risk <b>differently.</b> <b>In</b> addition to <b>the</b> traditional measure, standard deviation, or its square (variance), {{which are not}} robust risk measures, other measures include the Sortino ratio and the CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk).|$|R
25|$|This Islamist {{movement}} especially {{resonated with}} the younger generation, university graduates and young professionals, who began to dress <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> public from <b>the</b> majority of urban rising middle and even upper-class Egyptians, who since the 1930s had worn Western clothing.|$|R
40|$|Oregon and Washington state {{administrative}} agencies’ {{impacts on}} economic development within the winery industry are examined. Policy cluster development appears to impact economic development programs <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> each state. <b>The</b> wine industry has flourished in both states since 1970, yet Oregon with 60...|$|R
25|$|The seepage {{salamander}} {{is easily}} {{confused with the}} Pygmy Salamander (Desmognathus wrighti). These two species overlap in a small area of southern North Carolina. D. wrighti and D. aeneus are the smallest species in the genus Desmognathus and are the only terrestrial direct-developers, lacking a free-swimming larval stage. They both have vomerine teeth, and similar tail length to total body length ratios; however, they have different patterns and coloration. Seepage salamanders have a smoother top of the head. The mental glands are also shaped <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> males. The pygmy salamander has a large, U-shaped mental gland while the seepage salamander's is small and kidney shaped.|$|E
25|$|IM and ID DNA {{delivery}} initiate immune responses <b>differently.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> skin, keratinocytes, fibroblasts and Langerhans cells take up {{and express}} antigens and {{are responsible for}} inducing a primary antibody response. Transfected Langerhans cells migrate out of the skin (within 12 hours) to the draining lymph node where they prime secondary B- and T-cell responses. In skeletal muscle striated muscle cells are most frequently transfected, but seem to be unimportant in immune response. Instead, IM inoculated DNA “washes” into the draining lymph node within minutes, where distal dendritic cells are transfected and then initiate an immune response. Transfected myocytes seem {{to act as a}} “reservoir” of antigen for trafficking professional APCs.|$|E
25|$|When the {{publisher}} PlayFirst's blog staff interviewed with the game's producer Ryan Sindledecker, he gave players an in depth look at Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air. Taking about {{coming up with}} the new features, Ryan shared that the developer, Kat Games came up with all the new features, including using Dream Jewels as powers. With each Dream Chronicles game, Dream Jewels were used <b>differently.</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> Book of Air there was a need to add these powers and a need to have a new use for the Jewels and they just fit together perfectly. After the Standard Edition of the game was released, Sindledecker uploaded a special walkthrough for The Book of Air on PlayFirst's blog.|$|E
5000|$|As well {{as private}} patients, the asylum at Grove Park {{accepted}} paupers from poor law unions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, {{but the two}} groups were treated very <b>differently.</b> <b>In</b> 1844 <b>the</b> 19 private patients were housed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main house but the 53 resident paupers were located in outbuildings. They were separated into [...] "clean" [...] and [...] "dirty" [...] patients but otherwise little attention was paid to their comfort or rehabilitation.|$|R
50|$|Given {{that these}} {{different}} wall types are of different rigidities and perform <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> fire conditions, <b>the</b> EN standard {{requires that the}} certificate of fired doors indicates for what wall type it has been tested. The UL Standard does not specify any such supporting construction types.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of Biotechnology {{is aimed at}} creating improved products.

25|$|While the Noble Eightfold Path is best-known in the west, a {{wide variety}} of {{practices}} and stages have been used and described in the Buddhist traditions. Basic practices include sila (ethics), samadhi (meditation, dhyana) and prajna (wisdom), as described in the Noble Eightfold Path. An important additional practice is a kind and compassionate attitude toward every living being and the world. Devotion is also important in some Buddhist traditions, and in the Tibetan traditions visualizations of deities and mandalas are important. The value of textual study is regarded <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> various Buddhist traditions. It is central to Theravada and highly important to Tibetan Buddhism, while the Zen tradition takes an ambiguous stance.|$|E
25|$|Chigurh then ruthlessly tracks Moss down. The hotel {{confrontation}} between Moss and Chigurh plays out very <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film from the novel; rather than punching out {{the lock and}} wounding Moss, in the novel Chigurh apparently steals a key from a murdered clerk and quietly enters Moss's room, and Moss ambushes him and takes him captive at gunpoint, {{so they have a}} chance to see and know each other. Then Moss runs and the chase/shootout begins. As Chigurh and Moss face off in the hotel and the streets, they are interrupted by a group of Mexicans, all of whom Chigurh kills. In the film, this scene was cut to the point that only Moss and Chigurh fight.|$|E
25|$|According to the confession, the {{covenant}} of grace was administered <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{time of the}} law (during Old Testament times) and {{in the time of}} the gospel (during and after New Testament times). Under the law, {{the covenant}} was administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances instituted among the Jewish people. These all anticipated Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah, and were sufficient to give the elect of that time forgiveness of sins and eternal salvation. The confession teaches that under the gospel, the covenant of grace is dispensed more fully through the preaching of the Bible and the administration of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper.|$|E
50|$|A head-driven phrase {{structure}} grammar might parse {{this sentence}} <b>differently.</b> <b>In</b> this theory, <b>the</b> sentence is modeled as a verb phrase (VP). The noun phrase (NP) {{that is the}} subject of the sentence is located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> specifier of the verb phrase. The predicate parses <b>the</b> same way <b>in</b> both theories.|$|R
30|$|Leaf {{and root}} tissues shared some common gene {{expression}} during stress, {{with the purpose}} of enhancing protective systems. However, these two tissues appeared to act <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> response to <b>the</b> different level of dehydration they experience. Besides, they can affect each other via the signaling and transportation system.|$|R
25|$|Merge replication: Changes made at {{both the}} {{publisher}} and subscriber databases are tracked, and periodically the changes are synchronized bi-directionally between the publisher and the subscribers. If the same data has been modified <b>differently</b> <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> publisher and the subscriber databases, synchronization {{will result in a}} conflict which has to be resolved, either manually or by using pre-defined policies. rowguid needs to be configured on a column if merge replication is configured.|$|R
