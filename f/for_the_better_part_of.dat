5|$|The Roman Empire conquered Dacia in AD 101 and 106, {{during the}} rule of Trajan, and the Roman {{settlement}} Napoca, established thereafter, is first recorded on a milestone discovered in 1758 {{in the vicinity of}} the city. Trajan's successor Hadrian granted Napoca the status of municipium as municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napocenses. Later, in the 2nd century AD, the city gained the status of a colonia as Colonia Aurelia Napoca. Napoca became a provincial capital of Dacia Porolissensis and thus the seat of a procurator.

5|$|As {{one of the}} company's major offerings, {{the chicken}} fries are {{sometimes}} the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the nu metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on a new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups.

40|$|Abstract only. Conservation and {{management}} of North American West Coast fisheries encompass {{a broad array of}} issues including the economic, spatial, and temporal relations between the coastal pelagic species live bait fishery and the highly migratory species recreational fishery. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> <b>the</b> century, the live bait fishery has supplied live bait to the commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) fleet and private recreational anglers. Live bait consists primarily of small coastal pelagic species such as sardine, anchovy, and squid. The use of live bait in the recreational targeting of high value HMS species, such as albacore tuna, yellowtail tuna, bluefin tuna, marlin, and dolphin fish and the established nature of the live bait fishery's infrastructure differentiate the Southern California saltwater recreational fishery from other fisheries. Given its unique position on the interface between the coastal pelagic and highly migratory species fisheries, the live bait fishery finds itself at the nexus of conservation {{and management}} issues between both fisheries. Resource managers and industry have expressed interest in increasing the understanding and documentation of the fleet and in developing economic measures of the fleet's value and its contribution to the Southern California recreational fishery. This presentation lays <b>the</b> groundwork <b>for</b> economic research through the presentation of brief history and empirical characterization of the live bait fleet and its role in the recreational fishery...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the field of positioning technology. The contents of the thesis is based on information gathered from articles, the internet, meetings and interviews as well as experiences learned as a project participant. The goal of the thesis is to investigate what trends exist in the application of positioning technology today. Several technologies are described, both for indoor and outdoor use. In describing technologies used for outdoor positioning it will be made clear that GPS and RFID are two of the most significant technologies. As <b>for</b> indoor use, <b>the</b> wireless network technologies WLAN and Bluetooth as well as ultrasound based technologies will stand out as the most central. Specific system descriptions will also be given. The various technologies and systems have a vast number of potential combined applications. The thesis describes a selection of these applications. Some of the examples given are established applications that are widely used, while other examples are for new applications and even some that are still in development. The thesis gives an indication of {{the focal point of the}} technologies and applications. This will show that outdoor applications are dominant and that GPS and RFID are the two technologies given the most attention. This thesis was originally part of a project at the telecom and computer department at SINTEF in Oslo. The project aimed to investigate posibilities and shortcomings of using ultrasound <b>for</b> indoor positioning. <b>The</b> project, called "Maurtua", carried on <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>parts</b> of six months before being closed down for financial reasons. This project is described in a separate chapter of the thesis. This chapter shows the great potential of using ultrasound for indoor positioning, but also comes to the realization that the use of these systems are marginal at best. Large expenses in contrast to the believed benefits is shown to be one of <b>the</b> main reasons <b>for</b> this. <b>The</b> use of positioning technology oftes raises questions concerning rights to privacy. The thesis explains the central parts of the legislation, namely "Personopplysningsloven" and the department, "Datatilsynet" which regulates the use of positioning technology in Norway...|$|R
500|$|The Chremonidean War, which {{broke out}} in late 268 BC, {{provides}} <b>the</b> stage <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> known <b>part</b> of Patroclus' career. Patroclus has frequently been called nauarchos (admiral) by modern studies, beginning with the British classicist William Woodthorpe Tarn, who in the early 20th century conceived the Ptolemaic nauarchos as having been an office of almost viceregal authority, held by men like Philocles, the king of Sidon, for terms of ten years each. As the French historian Marcel Launey has shown, the title is applied to Patroclus only once in ancient sources, by the 2nd-century geographer Pausanias; all contemporary or later literary and epigraphical sources refer to him as strategos (general), which must have been his actual title. Indeed, according to the German classicist Hans Hauben, his Macedonian origin seems to argue for a previous career in the army {{rather than in the}} navy. The actual extent of Patroclus' authority is a matter of dispute in current scholarship, {{but it is clear that}} he enjoyed broad powers over the other Ptolemaic commanders and their allies in the Aegean Sea.|$|R
