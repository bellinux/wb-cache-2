25|$|Theophylline is metabolized {{extensively}} in the liver (up to 70%). It undergoes N-demethylation via cytochrome P450 1A2. It is metabolized by parallel zero order and Michaelis-Menten pathways. Metabolism may become saturated (non-linear), even within the therapeutic range. Small dose increases may result in disproportionately large increases in serum concentration. Methylation to caffeine is also important in the infant population. Smokers and people with <b>hepatic</b> (liver) <b>impairment</b> metabolize it differently. Both THC and nicotine {{have been shown to}} increase the rate of theophylline metabolism.|$|R
25|$|The {{elimination}} half-life of lidocaine is biphasic {{and around}} 90min to 120min in most patients. This may be prolonged {{in patients with}} <b>hepatic</b> <b>impairment</b> (average 343min) or congestive heart failure (average 136min). Lidocaine is excreted in the urine (90% as metabolites and 10% as unchanged drug).|$|E
25|$|The {{elimination}} half-life varies: 30 {{hours for}} premature neonates, 24 hours for neonates, 3.5 hours {{for children ages}} 1 to 9, 8 hours for adult non-smokers, 5 hours for adult smokers, 24 hours for those with <b>hepatic</b> <b>impairment,</b> 12 hours for those with congestive heart failure NYHA class I-II, 24 hours for those with congestive heart failure NYHA class III-IV, 12 hours for the elderly.|$|E
25|$|The {{systemic}} bioavailability of azelastine {{is approximately}} 40% when administered intranasally. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are observed within 2–3 hours. The elimination half life, steady-state volume of distribution and plasma clearance are 22 h, 14.5 l/kg and 0.5 l/h/kg respectively (based on intravenous and oral administration data). Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 family into its active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, and two inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. Approximately 75% of an oral dose is excreted in feces. Pharmacokinetics of orally administered azelastine are {{not affected by}} age, gender or <b>hepatic</b> <b>impairment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Anidulafungin {{significantly}} {{differs from}} other antifungals {{in that it}} undergoes chemical degradation to inactive forms at body pH and temperature.

Paracetamol can be safely used at low doses (2 - 3 grams per day) for a period not exceeding a few days. NSAIDs should be avoided because of their direct hepatic toxicity and {{an increased risk of}} life-threatening side-effects (hemorrhagic, renal). Glucuronoconjugated opiates should be preferred but all must be used carefully because of the risk of side effects. Dosage reduction and/or increased dose interval are often required...|$|R

25|$|After intra-muscular {{administration}} of Parecoxib sodium peak plasma concentration is reached within 15 minutes. The plasma concentration decreases rapidly after administration {{because of a}} rather short serum half-life, which is about 15–52 minutes. This {{can be explained by}} the rapid formation of Valdecoxib. In contrast to the rapid clearance of Parecoxib, plasma concentration of Valdecoxib declines slowly because of a longer half-life. On the other hand, when Valdecoxib is taken orally it is absorbed rapidly (1–2 hours), but presence of food can delay peak serum concentration. It then undergoes the same metabolism that is described above. It is extensively protein-bound (98%), and the plasma half-life is about 7–8 hours. Note that the half-life can be significantly prolonged in the elderly or those with <b>hepatic</b> <b>impairment,</b> and can lead to drug accumulation.|$|E
25|$|Celecoxib was {{the first}} {{specific}} inhibitor of COX-2 approved to treat patients with rheumatism and osteoarthritis. A study showed that the absorption rate, when given orally, is moderate, and peak plasma concentration occurs after about 2–4 hours. However, the extent of absorption is not well known. Celecoxib has the affinity to bind extensively to plasma proteins, especially to plasma albumin. It has an apparent volume of distribution (VD) of 455 +/- 166 L in humans and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increases proportionally to increased oral doses, between 100 and 800mg. Celecoxib is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 isoenzyme to carboxylic acid and also by non-CYP-dependent glucuronidation to glucuronide metabolites. The metabolites are excreted in urine and feces, with {{a small proportion of}} unchanged drug (2%) in the urine. Its elimination half-life is about 11 hours (6–12 hours) in healthy individuals, but racial differences in drug disposition and pharmacokinetic changes in the elderly have been reported. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency appear to have 43% lower plasma concentration compared to healthy individuals, with a 47% increase in apparent clearance, and it can be expected that patients with mild to moderate <b>hepatic</b> <b>impairment</b> have increased steady-state AUC.|$|E
25|$|Etoricoxib, that is {{used for}} {{patients}} with chronic arthropathies and musculoskeletal and dental pain, is absorbed moderately when given orally. A study on its pharmacokinetics showed that the plasma peak concentration of etoricoxib occurs after approximately 1 hour. It has shown to be extensively bound to plasma albumin (about 90%), and has an apparent volume of distribution (VD) of 120 L in humans. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increases in proportion to increased dosage (5–120mg). The elimination half-life is about 20 hours in healthy individuals, and such long half-life enables the choice to have once-daily dosage. Etoricoxib, like the other coxibs, is excreted in urine and feces and also metabolized in likewise manner. CYP3A4 is mostly responsible for biotransformation of etoricoxib to carboxylic acid metabolite, but a non CYP450 metabolism pathway to glucuronide metabolite is also at hand. A very small portion of etoricoxib (<1%) is eliminated unchanged in the urine. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency {{do not appear to}} have different plasma concentration curve (AUC) compared to healthy individuals. It has though been reported that patients with moderate <b>hepatic</b> <b>impairment</b> have increased plasma concentration curve (AUC) by approximately 40%. It has been stated that further study is necessary to describe precisely the relevance of pharmacokinetic properties in terms of the clinical benefits and risks of etoricoxib compared to other clinical options.|$|E

50|$|Chlorpropamide {{and other}} sulfonylureas {{encourage}} weight gain, {{so they are}} generally not favored for use in very obese patients.

40|$|Carbendazim {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} carbamate fungicide used in the control of various fungal pathogens. The present work studied the effect of carbendazim on the liver of albino rats and the possible protective role of Ginko biloba extract (EGB). Liver of carbendazim-treated animals showed histopathological and histochemical alterations. The histopathological changes include <b>hepatic</b> tissue <b>impairment,</b> cytoplasmic vacuolization of the hepatocytes, and congestion of blood vessels, leucocytic infiltrations and fatty infiltration. Histochemical results showed reduction of carbohydrates and total proteins in hepatic tissues. Moreover, liver function enzymes (ALT, AST) were elevated in sera of carbendazim-treated animals. Coadministration of EGB with Carbendazim improved the hisological and histochemical changes observed in animals treated with carbendazim. In addition, EGB treatment leads to {{a significant decrease in}} ALT and AST.
