5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{found that}} Train 214 {{had come to}} a stop entirely within the faulty circuit B2-304, making it {{effectively}} invisible to the automatic train control system. Other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum to make <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> circuit and resume detection and receipt of speed commands from the ATC system. Train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in manual mode by its operator, and it came to a stop while remaining on circuit B2-304 and was therefore invisible. Train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by the ATC to proceed on the track. The investigation found that the emergency brakes had been applied by the operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view {{but it was too late}} to avert the collision.|$|E

5|$|To win, {{the player}} must fight monsters {{to improve the}} characters' {{experience}} levels and get gold to buy better weapons and armor. Eventually, the player's characters become strong enough to make <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> town or dungeon. This repeats until the player reaches the final boss and defeats him. However, the gameplay is not necessarily linear, especially after the player gets the boat. Exploration is {{a key component of}} the game. The game offers a few spots to save the game. In most of the towns, talking to a king or minister saves the game. In the American version, which incorporated a battery for saved games rather than the password system of the original, talking to the king also allows for the deletion and moving of saved games.|$|E

This {{resulted}} in a re-release of their previous album, For Those Who Have Heart (2007), with additional tracks. The songs featured on Homesick were written while the band were on Warped Tour 2008 and on the Easycore Tour with producer Chad Gilbert of New Found Glory. The songs were finished on the latter tour. Gilbert helped to structure the band's songs and also assisted the band with composing [...] "a few really catchy parts". The album's lyrics are similar to their previous efforts, with the band aiming to [...] "keep it as personal and open at the same time", as vocalist Jeremy McKinnon commented.
