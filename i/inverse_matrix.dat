Having applied mathematics, many other sciences may be explained and developed, such as cryptography. Cryptography is science that learns mathematical techniques related to information safety aspect, for example validity, data integrity, and data authentic. In general, there are two techniques of cryptography, namely symmetric-key and asymmetric-key (public-key). The basic idea of public-key cryptography system was that cryptography key constructed in a couple, one key for encrypts and the other for description. The key for encrypts process was public (no secret) that by using matrices Amxn, it was called public key, while descriptive process was secret called private key or secret key that used generalization <b>Inverses</b> <b>matrix</b> A- = (ATA) - 1 AT where all operation were above Z 29 (mod 29).
