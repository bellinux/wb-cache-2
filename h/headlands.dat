5|$|On {{the hill}} summits {{that dot the}} <b>headlands</b> are heather and gorse, shaped by the {{prevailing}} wind; thrift and wild thyme thrive on the acidic soil. The cliffs are a stronghold of the chough, and a nesting place for razorbills and guillemots. On the lower rocks, in reach of the waves, are plentiful lichens, seaweeds, sponges, limpets and barnacles.|$|E
5|$|B.integrifolia is {{a highly}} {{variable}} species. It is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (80ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres (110ft). In more exposed areas it may grow as a small, gnarled tree, reaching {{to no more than}} about 5 metres (15ft), and in highly exposed positions, such as on exposed coastal <b>headlands,</b> it may even be reduced to a small shrub.|$|E
5|$|Express routes run {{between the}} {{outskirts}} of the city and downtown or between major rail stations and other points in the city. These routes typically run only during peak hours, going inbound in the morning and outbound in the evening, except the 76X Marin <b>Headlands</b> Express, which runs on weekends and holidays; and the 83X Mid-Market Express, which runs in both directions during peak hours. Asterisked (*) routes indicate that they run only during morning peak hours.|$|E

50|$|Restructuring of the {{companies}} in May and June 2008 involved the renaming of <b>Headland</b> Archaeology Ltd as <b>Headland</b> Group Limited.

5|$|For {{most of its}} distribution, B.integrifolia occurs {{only within}} about 50 {{kilometres}} (30mi) of the coast, where it typically occurs on poor quality sandy soils derived from sandstone. It grows near coastal cliffs and <b>headlands,</b> alongside river estuaries, and even on stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30°C (30–85°F), with almost no frosts. The species can occur in pure stands, but is usually associated with other species such as Melaleuca quinquenervia (broad-leaved paperbark).|$|E
5|$|Geologically, Plymouth has {{a mixture}} of limestone, Devonian slate, granite and Middle Devonian limestone. Plymouth Sound, Shores and Cliffs is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, because of its geology. The bulk {{of the city is}} built upon Upper Devonian slates and shales and the <b>headlands</b> at the {{entrance}} to Plymouth Sound are formed of Lower Devonian slates, which can withstand the power of the sea.|$|E
5|$|The scenery {{of rocky}} <b>headlands,</b> ravines, waterfalls and towering cliffs gained the Exmoor coast {{recognition}} as a Heritage Coast in 1991. The Exmoor Coastal Heaths have been recognised as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the diversity of species present. The path passes the smallest parish church in England, Culbone Church, in Culbone. The path crosses the county boundary into Devon, {{a few hundred yards}} north of the National Park Centre at County Gate.|$|E

5|$|The coast now {{shows the}} open and ancient {{landscape}} of the Penwith district along a series of wild <b>headlands</b> such as Clodgy Point, Hor Point, Pen Enys Point, and Carn Naun Point. The Carracks lie just offshore, locally known as Seal Island (and seals can often be seen close to the shore opposite here), then there lies Zennor Head and Gurnard's Head as the Path leads into Morvah, although the village proper lies inland. Portheras Cove is a relief from the many small rocky bays along this coast but the cliffs then continue beyond the iconic, disused Crowns Mine at Botallack.|$|E
5|$|Colonies {{are usually}} {{situated}} on islands, cliffs or <b>headlands,</b> which land mammals have difficulty accessing. This {{is thought to}} provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. Coloniality often arises in types of bird that do not defend feeding territories (such as swifts, which have a very variable prey source); {{this may be a}} reason why it arises more frequently in seabirds. There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also attract the attention of predators, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.|$|E
5|$|When news of {{the arrival}} of Duperré's {{squadron}} reached Decaen at Port Napoleon, he immediately despatched fast couriers to Grand Port and ordered Hamelin's squadron, consisting of the frigates Vénus, Manche, Astrée and the brig Entreprenant, to make ready to sail in support of Duperré. Hamelin departed Port Napoleon at midnight on 21 August, intending to sail northeast and then south, down the island's eastern shore. On 23 August, Hamelin's squadron spotted and captured a British transport ship named Ranger, sent 24 days earlier from the Cape of Good Hope with 300 tons of food supplies and extensive naval stores for Rowley on Île Bourbon. On rounding the northern <b>headlands</b> of Isle de France, however, Hamelin found he could make no progress against the headwinds and reversed direction, passing the western shore of the island and arriving off Grand Port at 1:00 pm on 27 August.|$|E

5|$|Along the San Francisco peninsula, {{gaps in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, one {{south of}} San Bruno Mountain and another in Crystal Springs, allow oceanic weather into the {{interior}} and causing a cooling effect for cities along the Peninsula and even {{as far south as}} San Jose. This weather pattern is also the source for delays at San Francisco International Airport. In Marin county north of the Golden Gate strait, two gaps north of Muir Woods bring cold air across the Marin <b>Headlands,</b> with the cooling affect reaching as far north as Santa Rosa. Further inland, the East Bay receives oceanic weather that travels through the Golden Gate strait, and further diffuses that air through the Berkeley Hills, Niles Canyon and the Hayward Pass into the Livermore Valley and Altamont Pass. Here, the resulting breeze is so strong that it is home to one of the world's largest array of wind turbines. Further north, the Carquinez Strait funnels the ocean weather into the San Joaquin River Delta, causing a cooling effect in Stockton and Sacramento, so that these cities are also cooler than their Central Valley counterparts in the south.|$|E
25|$|All Muni lines run inside San Francisco city limits, {{with the}} {{exception}} of several lines serving locations {{in the northern part of}} neighboring Daly City, and the 76X Marin <b>Headlands</b> Express line to the Marin <b>Headlands</b> area on weekends and major holidays.

The <b>headland</b> is named from the smell of hydrogen sulfide emerging from springs at the site.|$|R
25|$|The {{coastline}} {{consists of}} many beaches characterised by fine pale gold-coloured sands; however, these beaches are sometimes interrupted by prominent and rocky <b>headlands,</b> such as Tego Rock, jutting into the sea. In places these <b>headlands</b> have been excavated or extended to create artificial harbours at Wollongong, Port Kembla, Shellharbour and Kiama. Just {{off the coast}} south of Wollongong centre, near Port Kembla, lies a group of five islands known collectively as The Five Islands. The islands are a wildlife refuge.|$|E
25|$|Compartmentalisation of {{the shore}} occurs {{where there are}} major {{obstacles}} or objects, especially <b>headlands</b> on deeply embayed coasts. The beaches that are the most enclosed {{are commonly known as}} pocket beaches. On these type of beaches the volume of sand remains constant and are closed compartments. Littoral cells can be defined as sediment within a coast that is circulated e.g. rip currents. Littoral cells usually develop on coast which are not impeded by <b>headlands</b> and where longshore currents are allowed to develop.|$|E
