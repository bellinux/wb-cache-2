5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E
5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) {{in the early}} universe, making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> {{substance}} that is {{everywhere in the}} universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E

5|$|This Lime-Tree Bower and Frost at Midnight also {{deal with}} a similar {{understanding}} of nature, and the ideas within This Lime-Tree Bower {{form the basis for}} a natural education. Coleridge hoped that his son Hartley would be able to learn through nature in an innocent way. Unlike Wordsworth's nature, Coleridge's has a strong Christian presence and nature <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> presence of God's word. There is also a connection between Dejection and Frost at Midnight with its emphasis on Coleridge's private life.|$|E
5|$|Tunneling {{diffusion}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> {{manifestation of}} the quantum tunneling effect involving particles tunneling across diffusion barriers. It can occur {{in the case of}} low diffusing particle mass and low Ediff, and has been observed in the case of hydrogen diffusion on tungsten and copper surfaces. The phenomenon is unique in that in the regime where the tunneling mechanism dominates, the diffusion rate is nearly temperature-independent.|$|E
5|$|Where is {{the mind}} located? If the mind <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> {{phenomenon}} of some kind, {{it has to}} be located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible options: either the mind is internal to the body (internalism) or the mind is external to it (externalism). More generally, either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's body or it depends also on factors external to it.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{relationship}} having declined from friendship to hatred, Bogdan-Pitești's style and his mundane interests are occasionally seen {{as sources of}} inspiration for Caragiale's only novel, Craii de Curtea-Veche (completed in 1928). Some have noted that Bogdan-Pitești has {{a lot in common}} with {{at least one of the}} three protagonists. He and his wife were both characters in Ion Vinea's novels Venin de mai ("May Venom") and Lunatecii ("The Lunatics")—Alexandru as Adam Gună, Domnica as wife Iada Gună. Both novels portray the Bogdans' cultural circle, allude to their influence in making young people reject all conventionalism, and show them promoting vice as virtue. This lifestyle has taken its toll on Adam Gună, who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> ruin and slowly loses his hold on reality. Vinea's books repeat claims that Bogdan-Pitești was abusing drugs, and that Domnica was originally a prostitute.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{interactions}} can {{be classified}} broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships within a species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae, and corals with photosynthetic algae. If there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> connection between host and associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{receives}} a distress signal from a shuttlecraft returning Deanna Troi from a conference. They {{find that the}} shuttle has crashed on a desolate planet, Vagra II, and while they can find the life signs of Troi and the pilot, {{they are unable to}} beam the two to the ship. An away team beams down and discovers an animated pool of a tar-like substance, a malevolent life form that calls itself Armus. When Lt. Yar attempts to approach the shuttle, Armus hurls her back with a psychokinetic blast, killing her instantly. The away team is brought back to the Enterprise but the damage to Yar is too great for Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) to repair, and they are unable to resuscitate her. A second away team is sent to the planet. Armus taunts the crew members and maintains his grasp of the shuttle. During this time, Troi has communicated with Armus and learned that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> manifestation of evil from the bodies of an ancient race, abandoned on Vagra II.|$|E
