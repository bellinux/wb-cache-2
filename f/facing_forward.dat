5|$|The Isobarik is {{so named}} as it employs the {{isobaric}} loading principle invented by Harry Olson in the 1950s: two bass units are mounted {{in a sealed}} container and driven in parallel so as to effectively double the speaker enclosure volume and extend its bass frequency response beyond what would be possible for otherwise identical speakers. Linn used {{a variant of the}} isobaric principle and patented the use of two bass drive units ("woofers") <b>facing</b> <b>forward</b> in an isobaric arrangement in early 1974.|$|E
5|$|The Swarm is a steel Wing Coaster at Thorpe Park, a {{theme park}} in the United Kingdom. The Swarm was the world's second Wing Coaster {{designed}} by Swiss roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard and the United Kingdom's first Wing Coaster. Construction commenced in May 2011, and the coaster opened on 15 March 2012. Starting in 2013, the last two rows of each train face backwards, while the first five rows face forward. This was removed in 2016, with all riders <b>facing</b> <b>forward</b> once again.|$|E

5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{spends much}} of its time climbing trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, {{many of which are}} shared by other woodpecker species. These include the zygodactyl arrangement of the foot, with two toes <b>facing</b> <b>forward</b> and two back, and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a prop against the trunk. In most birds the bones of the tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final vertebra, the pygostyle, is very large to anchor the strong tail muscles.|$|E
5|$|The rider's {{experience}} {{is dependent upon}} the location of her or his seat on the train. Screens are located {{on both sides of}} the track but the only continuous screen on the track is on the right-hand side. The train makes several tight turns during the ride; riders <b>facing</b> <b>forward</b> experience all the animations while riders facing backward miss some scenes because of the lack of screen space. The cars rotate 90 degrees clockwise to face the screens; forward-facing riders rotate toward the continuous screen.|$|E
5|$|Class II {{stones are}} {{carefully}} shaped slabs dating after {{the arrival of}} Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a cross on one face and {{a wide range of}} symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include Glamis 2, which contains a finely executed Celtic cross on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure <b>facing</b> <b>forward</b> in the prow. Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones. Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas.|$|E

5|$|Woodpeckers, piculets and wrynecks all possess {{characteristic}} zygodactyl feet, {{consisting of}} four toes, the first (hallux) {{and the fourth}} facing backward and {{the second and third}} <b>facing</b> <b>forward.</b> This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and trunks of trees. Members of this family can walk vertically up a tree trunk, which is beneficial for activities such as foraging for food or nest excavation. In addition to their strong claws and feet, woodpeckers have short, strong legs. This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks. Exceptions are the black-backed woodpecker and the American and Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, which have only three toes on each foot. The tails of all woodpeckers, except the piculets and wrynecks, are stiffened, and when the bird perches on a vertical surface, the tail and feet work together to support it.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} is {{dispatched}} and enters Wonder Mountain, riders {{find themselves in a}} graveyard where zombies are roaming. At the end of the scene, riders who began <b>facing</b> <b>forward</b> see a survivor directing them to the next scene. Riders who were seated backwards do not see this transition. The next scene takes place in a house overrun by the zombies and large spiders. At the end of the scene a truck crashes into the house. Riders then leave the house and pass the survivor; this transition is again absent for backward-seated riders. The train continues to a road with zombies, where three cars with zombies on them join the riders. Two of the cars crash {{at the end of the}} scene. The train then passes through a tunnel with abandoned cars; this scene is absent for riders facing backward. Riders then battle the zombies for the final time before entering the drop track sequence. The names of the highest-scoring riders are displayed on a leader-board for this version of the attraction.|$|E
5|$|The DNC {{objected to}} the loss of the {{mainmast}} as he believed that it was needed to support a boat-handling derrick, but was overruled by the Admiralty, which preferred to position the tripod foremast behind the forward funnel with the tripod legs <b>facing</b> <b>forward</b> to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable. The short height of the funnel also bedevilled the bridge with smoke until it was raised in 1912, although this exacerbated the problem for the spotting top. The decision to space the wing turrets more closely together also made the smoke problem worse; because it reduced the space available to the aft boiler room which meant that the forward funnel had to accommodate the exhausts of a dozen boilers compared to the aft funnel's six, further increasing the smoke from the forward funnel.|$|E

5|$|The L version {{would not}} be able to enter {{production}} with the DB 600 owing to its use in the Bf 109, and the Bramo engine was rather thirsty on fuel and left the M models with too short a range for reconnaissance use. BMW 132N radials of 865PS were selected instead, which had lower fuel consumption for better range. Another two prototypes with DB 600 engines were produced as the Do 17R-0, but did not enter production. During reconnaissance missions the P-1 was armed with four MG 15s in the A, B and C—Stands. One machine gun was located in the rear of the cockpit, another in the lower rear Bola mount, one <b>facing</b> <b>forward</b> through the windscreen and the other in the nose glazing. In earlier variants the B-Stand (the gun position in the upper rear cockpit) was open to the elements, but the P-1 now provided an enclosed bulb-shaped mount protecting the radio operator from the weather.|$|E
5|$|About 250 Pictish stones {{survive and}} have been {{assigned}} by scholars to three classes. Class I stones are those thought to date to the period up to the 7th century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals including fish and the Pictish beast, everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V-rod, double disc and Z-rod. They are found between from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus). Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the 8th and 9th centuries, with a cross on one face and {{a wide range of}} symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include Glamis 2, which contains a finely executed Celtic cross on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure <b>facing</b> <b>forward</b> in the prow. Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones. Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, {{the turret}} {{layout of the}} Delawares was also retained, with its {{respective}} challenges. Two turrets, Numbers 1 and 2, were mounted fore in a superfiring pair, while the other three were mounted aft of the main superstructure, all on the centerline. The rearmost turret, number 5, {{was placed on the}} main deck, facing rearward, the next turret, Number 4, was placed on the main deck <b>facing</b> <b>forward,</b> but could only have fired on either broadside, it could not have fired straight forward or aft. The center turret, Number 3, placed in a superfiring position facing rearward, could not fire astern when the turret directly under it had its guns trained forward. This left only the rearmost turret, with its pair of 12-inch guns, to cover the rear quarter of the ship. Also, since the engine room was situated between the superfiring rear turret and the ones behind it, steam lines ran from the boiler rooms amidships around the ammunition magazine for Number 3 turret to the engine room. These lines, it was later found, had the potential to heat the powder in the magazine and degrade its ballistics. This design flaw was also prevalent in several British dreadnoughts but was considered inescapable by naval designers on structural grounds.|$|E
