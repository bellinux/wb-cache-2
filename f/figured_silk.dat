25|$|The Baluchari sarees are <b>figured</b> <b>silk</b> saree {{produced}} {{in the town of}} Baluchar in Murshidabad district. Baluchar sarees essentially have a silk base with silk brocaded designs with respect to their colours, where in spite of a rich composition, the Baluchar bootidars almost avoid strong contrasts. Each pattern is treated in a colour which harmonises with the ground on which it is laid. The most popular colours used are red, blue, yellow, green and scarlet. The Baluchari sarees have large floral motifs interspersed with flowering shrubs. Traditionally the Muslim community was also known to produce these Baluchars with figured patterns depicting court scenes, horse with a rider, women smoking hookah. The Kalka design or the cone motif is often surrounded with floral borders.|$|E
500|$|Appliqué {{work was}} {{popular in the}} Tudor era, {{especially}} for large-scale works such as wall hangings. In Medieval England, rich clothing had been bequeathed to the church to be remade into vestments; following {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries at the Reformation, the rich silks and velvets of the great monastic houses were cut up and repurposed to make hangings and cushions for private homes. [...] Shapes cut from opulent fabrics and small motifs or slips worked on fine linen canvas were applied a background fabric of <b>figured</b> <b>silk,</b> velvet, or plain wool and embellished with embroidery, in a style deriving from the later, simpler forms of Medieval work.|$|E

40|$|Consistent {{with the}} theme of this conference, my work {{involves}} a new direction in the study of weft-faced compound weave <b>figured</b> <b>silks</b> attributed to the Mediterranean region c. AD 600 - 1300. Known as samite and taqueté according to the binding structure, woven <b>figured</b> <b>silks</b> represent a highly recognizable, but poorly understood body of material. <b>Figured</b> <b>silks</b> are often described in terms of their association with the Byzantine Empire, based on representational and textual evidence. 1 The implement necessary to weave sophisticated repeating patterns was the drawloom. 2 These devices were equipped with a figure harness for repetitive production of woven patterns. Although the origin and development of these looms is obscure, they were important labor-saving devices. Patterns tied-up in a figure harness provided a means of recording and storing work for later mechanical reproduction. Without a means to replicate memorized patterns, weaving designs in silk was slow and tedious. From a modern point of view, the capability to store sequences of mechanically recorded work steps means that pattern tie-ups were, in effect, an early form of software (Fig. 1) ...|$|R
500|$|From {{the middle}} of the 14th century, money that had {{previously}} been spent on luxury goods like lavish embroidery was redirected to military expenditure, and imported Italian <b>figured</b> <b>silks</b> competed with native embroidery traditions. [...] Varieties of design in textiles succeeded each other very rapidly, and they were more readily available than the more leisurely produced needlework. [...] The work produced by the London workshops was simplified {{to meet the demands of}} this deteriorating market. [...] The new techniques required less work and smaller quantities of expensive materials. [...] Surface couching replaced underside couching, and allover embroidery was replaced by individual motifs worked on linen and then applied to <b>figured</b> <b>silks</b> or silk velvets. Increasingly, designs for embroidery were derived directly from woven patterns, [...] "thus losing not only their former individuality and richness, but also their former ... story-telling interest." ...|$|R

60|$|And {{after that}} they had gone through many streets {{they came to a}} little door that was set in a wall that was covered with a {{pomegranate}} tree. And the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it opened, and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with black poppies and green jars of burnt clay. And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of <b>figured</b> <b>silk,</b> and bound with it the eyes of the Star-Child, and drave him in front of him.

50|$|The {{so-called}} “minor arts” {{were very}} important in Byzantine art and luxury items, including ivories carved in relief as formal presentation Consular diptychs or caskets such as the Veroli casket, hardstone carvings, enamels, jewelry, metalwork, and <b>figured</b> <b>silks</b> were produced in large quantities throughout the Byzantine era. Many of these were religious in nature, although {{a large number of}} objects with secular or non-representational decoration were produced: for example, ivories representing themes from classical mythology. Byzantine ceramics were relatively crude, as pottery was never used at the tables of the rich, who ate off silver.|$|R
60|$|And on the morrow the old man, who {{was indeed}} the subtlest of the magicians of Libya and had learned his art from one who dwelt in the tombs of the Nile, came in to him and frowned at him, and said, 'In a wood that is nigh to the gate of this city of Giaours there are three pieces of gold. One is of white gold, and another is of yellow gold, and the gold of the third one is red. To-day thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a hundred stripes. Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be waiting for thee {{at the door of}} the garden. See that thou bringest the white gold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.' And he bound the eyes of the Star-Child with the scarf of <b>figured</b> <b>silk,</b> and led him through the house, and through the garden of poppies, and up the five steps of brass.

6000|$|The countess and her {{youngest}} {{daughter had been}} breakfasting together in the elder lady's sitting-room, and were now seated in a very graceful and well-arranged deshabille. The tea-cups out of {{which they had been}} drinking were made of some elegant porcelain, the teapot and cream-jug were of chased silver and as delicate in their sway. The remnant of food consisted of morsels of French roll which had not even been allowed to crumble themselves in a disorderly fashion, and of infinitesimal pats of butter. If the morning meal of the two ladies had been as unsubstantial as the appearance of the fragments indicated, it must be presumed that they intended to lunch early. The countess herself was arrayed in an elaborate morning wrapper of <b>figured</b> <b>silk,</b> but the simple Alexandrina wore a plain white muslin peignoir, fastened with pink ribbon. Her hair, which she usually carried in long rolls, now hung loose over her shoulders, and certainly added something to her stock of female charms. The countess got up as Crosbie entered and greeted him with an open hand; but Alexandrina kept her seat, and merely nodded at him a little welcome.

6000|$|And is it {{not with}} writers as with raconteurs? Ought they not to have their ingenuous modesty? May authors tell old stories, and how many times over? When I come {{to look at a}} place which I have visited any time these twenty or thirty years, I recall not the place merely, but the sensations I had at first seeing it, and which are quite {{different}} to my feelings to-day. That first day at Calais; the voices of the women crying out at night, as the vessel came alongside the pier; the supper at Quillacq's and the flavor of the cutlets and wine; the red-calico canopy under which I slept; the tiled floor, and the fresh smell of the sheets; the wonderful postilion in his jack-boots and pigtail;--all return with perfect clearness to my mind, and I am seeing them, and not the objects which are actually under my eyes. Here is Calais. Yonder is that commissioner I have known this score of years. Here are the women screaming and hustling over the baggage; the people at the passport-barrier who take your papers. My good people, I hardly see you. You no more interest me than a dozen orange-women in Covent-Garden, or a shop book-keeper in Oxford Street. But you make me think of a time when you were indeed wonderful to behold--when the little French soldiers wore white cockades in their shakos--when the diligence was forty hours going to Paris; and the great-booted postilion, as surveyed by youthful eyes from the coupe, with his jurons, his ends of rope for the harness, and his clubbed pigtail, was a wonderful being, and productive of endless amusement. You young folks don't remember the apple-girls who used to follow the diligence up the hill beyond Boulogne, and the delights of the jolly road? In making continental journeys with young folks, an oldster may be very quiet, and, to outward appearance, melancholy; but really he has gone {{back to the days of}} his youth, and he is seventeen or eighteen years of age (as the case may be), and is amusing himself with all his might. He is noting the horses as they come squealing out of the post-house yard at midnight; he is enjoying the delicious meals at Beauvais and Amiens, and quaffing ad libitum the rich table-d'hote wine; he is hail-fellow with the conductor, and alive to all the incidents of the road. A man can be alive in 1860 and 1830 at the same time, don't you see? Bodily, I may be in 1860, inert, silent, torpid; but in the spirit I am walking about in 1828, let us say;---in a blue dress-coat and brass buttons, a sweet <b>figured</b> <b>silk</b> waistcoat (which I button round a slim waist with perfect ease), looking at beautiful beings with gigot sleeves and tea-tray hats under the golden chestnuts of the Tuileries, or round the Place Vendome, where the drapeau blanc is floating from the statueless column. Shall we go and dine at [...] "Bombarda's," [...] near the [...] "Hotel Breteuil," [...] or at the [...] "Cafe Virginie?"--Away! [...] "Bombarda's" [...] and the [...] "Hotel Breteuil" [...] have been pulled down ever so long. They knocked down the poor old Virginia Coffee-house last year. My spirit goes and dines there. My body, perhaps, is seated with ever so many people in a railway-carriage, and no wonder my companions find me dull and silent. Have you read Mr. Dale Owen's [...] "Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World?"--(My dear sir, it will make your hair stand quite refreshingly on end.) In that work you will read that when gentlemen's or ladies' spirits travel off a few score or thousand miles to visit a friend, their bodies lie quiet and in a torpid state in their beds or in their arm-chairs at home. So in this way, I am absent. My soul whisks away thirty years back into the past. I am looking out anxiously for a beard. I am getting past the age of loving Byron's poems, and pretend that I like Wordsworth and Shelley much better. Nothing I eat or drink (in reason) disagrees with me; and I know whom I think to be the most lovely creature in the world. Ah, dear maid (of that remote but well-remembered period), are you a wife or widow now?--are you dead?--are you thin and withered and old?--or are you grown much stouter, with a false front? and so forth.|$|E

5000|$|Linen {{shirts and}} chemises or smocks had full sleeves and often full bodies, pleated or {{gathered}} closely at neck and wrist.

These garments were often decorated with embroidery in black or red silk, and occasionally with gold metal threads if the garment was meant to be flashier of ones wealth. [...] The bodice was boned and stiffened to create a more structured form, and often a busk was inserted to emphasize the flattening and elongation of the torso. Small geometric patterns appeared early in the period and, in England, evolved into the elaborate patterns associated with the flowering of blackwork embroidery. German shirts and chemises were decorated with wide bands of gold trim at the neckline, which was uniformly low early in the period and grew higher by midcentury.Silk brocades and velvets in bold floral patterns based on pomegranate and thistle or artichoke motifs remained fashionable for those who could afford them, although they were often restricted to kirtles, undersleeves and doublets revealed beneath gowns of solid-coloured fabrics or monochromatic <b>figured</b> <b>silks.</b> Yellow and red were fashionable colors.|$|R
