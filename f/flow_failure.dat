50|$|A static {{liquefaction}} <b>flow</b> <b>failure</b> {{occurred in}} the upstream slope of the North Dike of Wachusett Dam near Clinton, Massachusetts on April 11, 1907 during the first reservoir filling. The fine sands of the upstream dike shell liquefied and flowed approximately 100 meters horizontally into the reservoir. This caused many Clinton residents considerable concern. However, the project’s Chief Engineer, Frank E. Winsor, assured the townsfolk that everything was okay. This event remains controversial. At least one engineering study claims that the initial failure is a precursor to the dam’s future failure. However, it has now stood for over one hundred years.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Catastrophic <b>flow</b> <b>failures</b> {{occur in}} mine {{tailings}} dams and dumps of discards and other mine waste with alarming frequency. In recent years catastrophic <b>flow</b> <b>failures</b> have also occurred in dumps of municipal refuse {{and even in}} what {{were considered to be}} carefully controlled and well engineered landfills. Apart from the environmental devastation caused by these flows, they are also dangerous to human life and society. For examples the Buffalo Creek disaster in the USA in 1972 killed 118 people, made 4000 homeless and destroyed 50 million US dollars worth of property and facilities, the flow slide that occurred in the Umraniye-Hekimbasi refuse dump in Turkey in 1993, killed 39 people, destroying their homes in the process. The paper will briefly review some of the more typical flow slides in waste materials, analysing the mechanics of failure and pointing to ways of preventing this type of failure by a combination of sound design and operating procedures. In the case of existing deposits modified operating procedures can be adopted, reducing the probability of failure as well as constructing deflecting structures to protect communities and facilities from the consequences of failure...|$|R

40|$|Unexpected {{failure of}} subaqueous {{excavated}} slopes {{in the form}} of flow slides is considered in this graduate study.

Several recent <b>flow</b> slide <b>failures</b> in sand borrow pits, together with qualms in engineering practice about not knowing exactly what fundamental mechanism causes <b>flow</b> slide <b>failure,</b> gave cause for this study. The knowledge that <b>flow</b> slide <b>failure</b> may be caused by either static liquefaction of (part of) a sloping body (also called spontaneous collapse), or by the development of active banks, is taken as a point of departure. Liquefaction due to dynamic loading will be left out of consideration. Special attention will be paid to the geological circumstances of The Netherlands. Herewith, the central problem of this flow slide study becomes: "How, from an engineering point of view, can we understand and predict <b>flow</b> slide <b>failure</b> of excavated (or being excavated) slopes, better?". To be able to answer the question at issue, we need to understand the fundamental mechanisms, leading to <b>flow</b> slide <b>failure.</b> Then, the soil properties may be related to the mechanisms and specific circumstances may be taken into account. The main aim of this graduate study is to obtain insight in different mechanisms, possibly triggering <b>flow</b> slide <b>failure</b> and causing its retrogressive nature. Since the extent of a flow slide can be very large, and seems hard to predict, the prediction of the potential for failure will be the pith of the study, not the consequences of failure (Volume 1 : Literature Review). The possible ways to model failure potential are investigated and their prediction values are evaluated on the basis of case histories (Volume 3 : Case History Study / Appendix). With the insights obtained, an effort has been made to formulate a practical guideline for flow slide analyses, which should lead to improvements in engineering practice (this Volume 2 : Directive for Engineering Practice).

40|$|Water {{saturated}} loose sand, when sheared under undrained conditions, {{exhibits a}} peak strength {{at a small}} strain and then collapses rapidly with a very low residual strength. This flow-type failure, known as flow liquefaction or flow slides in soil mechanics, {{is a major concern}} in geotechnical applications involving dams, slopes and hydraulic-placed fills. A fundamental understanding of flow liquefaction behavior has been established through well-controlled laboratory experiments on sand specimens, mainly for the isotropic consolidation condition where no initial shear stress is present. The influence of initial shear stress on the initiation of <b>flow</b> <b>failure,</b> though being an issue critical to the safety of dams and slopes, is not yet well understood. This paper reports several interesting findings from an experimental study that aimed to address this issue. A number of undrained strain-controlled triaxial tests were conducted on two quartz sands, covering a range of confining stresses and void ratios and a range of initial shear stress levels. The initial shear stress was achieved by applying anisotropic consolidation and its level was characterized by an anisotropic consolidation ratio (ACR). One of notable findings is that the influence of initial shear stress is complicated, depending on the void ratio and confining stress prior to undrained shearing {{as well as on the}} ACR value. By normalizing the shear stress required to initiate <b>flow</b> <b>failure</b> with the initial shear stress applied, a fairly good correlation is established between this normalized shear stress ratio and the ACR value...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop simple, empirical tools to evaluate liquefaction problems in level and sloping ground. The proposed correlations and procedures are particularly useful as screening tools because of their simplicity. Specifically, these procedures include: 1. CPT-based level ground liquefaction resistance relationships for sandy soils; 2. SPT- and CPT-based relationships to estimate the yield shear strength available at the triggering of liquefaction in ground subjected to a static shear stress; 3. SPT- and CPT-based relationships to estimate the liquefied shear strength available at large deformation after the triggering of liquefaction in ground subjected to a static shear stress; and 4. A comprehensive liquefaction analysis procedure for ground subjected to a static shear stress that addresses liquefaction susceptibility, triggering of liquefaction, and post-triggering stability. The author collected a database of 172 level ground liquefaction and nonliquefaction case histories where CPT results are available. These cases were separated into those involving clean sands (less than 5 % fines content), silty sands (between 5 and 35 % fines content), and silty sands to sandy silts (greater than 35 % fines content) to develop three separate liquefaction resistance relationships based on fines content (percentage by weight passing the U. S. Standard # 200 sieve). The proposed relationships also use median grain size (D 50) to classify the case histories. The author collected thirty-three case histories of liquefaction <b>flow</b> <b>failure</b> where SPT and/or CPT results are available or can be reasonably estimated. These <b>flow</b> <b>failure</b> case histories were back-analyzed to evaluate the yield shear strength and yield strength ratio mobilized at the triggering of liquefaction. Relationships between yield strength ratio and corrected SPT and CPT resistance were developed for use in liquefaction triggering analysis. The <b>flow</b> <b>failure</b> case histories also were back-analyzed to evaluate the liquefied shear strength and liquefied strength ratio mobilized at large deformation. For cases with sufficient information, the stability back-analysis incorporated the kinetics of failure (i. e., momentum). Relationships between liquefied strength ratio and corrected SPT and CPT resistance were developed for use in post-triggering stability analysis. Lastly, the author proposes a comprehensive liquefaction analysis procedure for sandy soils to evaluate: (1) liquefaction susceptibility; (2) triggering of liquefaction; and (3) post-triggering/flow failure stability. The procedure incorporates the proposed relationships to estimate yield strength ratio and liquefied strength ratio, and does not require a suite of laboratory tests or corrections for sloping ground and vertical effective stress. The procedure is verified initially using the Lower San Fernando Dam case history, and is particularly useful as a screening tool. National Science Foundation EEC- 970178...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a methodology to evaluate flow slide susceptibility in potentially liquefiable sandy slopes. The proposed approach accounts for both contractive and dilative volumetric behaviour during shearing using the MIT-S 1 constitutive model. As a result, {{it is possible}} to distinguish among different types of undrained response induced by a rapid shear perturbation. The first part of the paper describes the general methodology for infinite slopes, providing an index of stability for incipient static liquefaction in shallow deposits. The methodology accounts for the anisotropy due to the initial stress state and uses simple shear simulations to assess instability conditions as a function of slope angle, stress state, and density of the soil. The resulting stability charts define the margin of safety against static liquefaction and the depths likely to be affected by the propagation of an instability. The second part of the paper applies the methodology to the well-known series of <b>flow</b> <b>failures</b> in a berm at the Nerlerk site. The MIT-S 1 model is calibrated using published data on Nerlerk sands and in situ cone penetration test (CPT) data. The analyses show that in situ slope angles α = 10 °– 13 ° are less than the critical slope angle needed for incipient instability. Liquefaction and <b>flow</b> <b>failures</b> were therefore promoted by small perturbations in shear stresses that could be generated by rapid deposition of hydraulic fill...|$|R

It is loosely structured and its strength is low, with some development of pores and cavities. Research on the hydro-mechanical coupling of the altered rock are of important significance to hydropower projects. In this study, the advanced fully automatic triaxial fluid flow-rheological test servo system is employed to study the hydro-mechanical coupling characteristics of the altered rock, and the water pressures and confining pressures in the laboratory tests are set to simulate the conditions of excavation and impoundment of Xiaowan Hydropower Station. Based on the test results, the stress-strain laws of the rock specimens under the effect of complete hydro-mechanical coupling, as well as the lateral strain and volumetric strain characteristics, are studied. The fluid flow laws of the rock specimens and the effects of the confining pressures on the fluid flow are analyzed.

The aim of this document is to contribute knowledge to the effort of nuclear hydrogen generation. In particular, this study regards identification of safety issues in the coupled plant and the transient modeling of some leading candidates for implementation in the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative (NHI). The Sulfur Iodine (SI) and Hybrid Sulfur (HyS) cycles are considered as candidate hydrogen generation schemes. ^ Several thermodynamically derived chemical reaction chamber models are coupled to a well-known reference design of a high temperature nuclear reactor. These chemical reaction chamber models have several dimensions of validation, including detailed steady state flowsheets, integrated loop test data, and bench scale chemical kinetics. Eight unique case studies are performed based on a thorough literature review of possible events. The case studies are: (1) feed <b>flow</b> <b>failure</b> from one section of the chemical plant to another, (2) product <b>flow</b> <b>failure</b> (recycle) within the chemical plant, (3) rupture or explosion within the chemical plant, (4) nuclear reactor helium inlet overcooling due to a process holding tank failure, (5) helium inlet overcooling as an anticipated transient without SCRAM, (6) total failure of the chemical plant, (7) parametric study of the temperature in an individual reaction chamber, and (8) control rod insertion in the nuclear reactor.

40|$|Operation of {{technical}} equipment involves three consecutive stages, {{each of which}} is characterized by a particular trend in the behavior of the <b>failure</b> <b>flow</b> parameter (FFP). The FFP value is approximately constant during normal operation. In this case, the equipment operation process is assumed to be temporally homogeneous and the reliability indicators are calculated by conventional methods. At the burn-in stage, the FFP decreases with time while increasing at the aging stage. Therefore, the operating times between two successive failures at the burn-in and aging stages are not similarly distributed random values and the flow of events cannot be assumed to be recurrent. It shall be taken into account in the reliability performance calculation that the <b>flow</b> of <b>failures</b> is temporally inhomogeneous. The paper describes a method to estimate the NPP equipment reliability indicators allowing the potential inhomogeneity of the <b>failure</b> <b>flow</b> to be taken into account. The specific nature of incoming statistical data on failures is shown. The application of the normalizing flow function model for the calculation of required reliability indicators is described. A practical example of an analysis of data on the Bilibino NPP CPS KNK- 56 component failures is presented...|$|R

Yet due to design flaws or other factors, the insulation in a product can break down, resulting in excessive leakage current <b>flow.</b> This <b>failure</b> condition can cause shock or death to anyone that comes {{into contact with the}} faulty product.|$|R
