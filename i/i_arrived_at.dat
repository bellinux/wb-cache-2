25|$|After having {{achieved}} this victory, Elisabeth did not stay to enjoy it, but instead {{embarked on a}} life of travel, and saw little of her children. “If <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> a place and knew that I could never leave it again, the whole stay would become hell despite being paradise”. After her son's death, she commissioned the building of a palace in Corfu which she named the Achilleion, after Homer's hero Achilles in The Iliad. After her death, the building was purchased by German Emperor Wilhelm II. Later it was acquired by the nation of Greece and converted to a museum.|$|E
500|$|Pick {{introduced}} a common advertising policy, improving {{the appearance of}} stations by standardising poster sizes, limiting the number used and controlling their positioning. Before he took control of advertising, posters had been stuck up on any available surface on station buildings and platform walls in a crowded jumble of shapes and sizes that led to complaints from passengers {{that it was difficult}} to find the station name. Pick standardised commercial poster sizes on printers' double crown sheets, arranging these in organised groups to enable the station name to be easily seen. The Underground's own promotional posters were smaller, using single or paired double royal sheets, and were arranged separately from the commercial advertising. Pick described the process: [...] "after many fumbling experiments <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> some notion of how poster advertising ought to be. Everyone seemed quite pleased and I got a reputation that really sprang out of nothing." ...|$|E

500|$|The second {{investigations}} performed between 1981 and 1984 by the legislature, the U.S. Justice Department, and {{the local}} press uncovered a plot to assassinate the activists and a possible, though not conclusive, conspiracy to cover-up these actions. During interviews of the Senate Investigations Committee in 1983, officer Miguel Cartagena Flores, a detective in the Intelligence Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department, testified: “When <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the scene I saw 4 police officers aiming their guns at the two activists who were kneeling before them. I turned my eyes away and heard 5 gunshots." [...] Cartagena, who was offered immunity for his testimony, added that several hours before the shooting, he and other officers were told by Col. Angel Perez Casillas, commander of the Intelligence Division, that “these terrorists should not come down (from the mountain) alive.” His testimony was corroborated by officer Carmelo Cruz who, {{although he did not}} witness the fatal shooting, confirmed many details provided by Cartagena when also granted immunity.|$|E

2500|$|On 19 March 2008, {{during a}} {{surprise}} visit to pray at {{the tomb of}} Saint Francis in Assisi, Italy, Gorbachev made an announcement which has been interpreted {{to the effect that}} he was a Christian. Gorbachev stated: [...] "St Francis is, for me, the alter Christus, another Christ. His story fascinates me and has played a fundamental role in my life". He added: [...] "It was through St Francis that <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the Church, so it was important that I came to visit his tomb". However, a few days later, he reportedly told the Russian news agency Interfax: [...] "Over the last few days some media have been disseminating fantasies—I can't use any other word—about my secret Catholicism, [...] To sum up and avoid any misunderstandings, let me say that I have been and remain an atheist", to which the contemporary Orthodox patriarch replied, [...] "He is still on his way to Christianity".|$|E

[...] …At each interrogation, I refused to tell them anything. [...] Each time I was amazed that, while I was truly terrified by their tactics and their threats, I was able to stonewall their questions and refuse to give them the answers they were so desperate for. I came to realize that they, as a group, were really a very dumb bunch of redneck, illiterate people, clumsily wielding a vast amount of power over others.|$|E

The {{front page of the}} Los Angeles Times ran four stories, including aerial photos of the collapsed dam and the city of Santa Paula. A Times Flood Relief Fund was set up to receive donations, mirrored by similar efforts by other publications. In a statement Mulholland said, [...] "I would not venture at this time to express a positive opinion as to the cause of the St. Francis Dam disaster... Mr. Van Norman and <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the scene of the break around 2:30a.m. this morning. We saw at once that the dam was completely out and that the torrential flood of water from the reservoir had left an appalling record of death and destruction in the valley below." [...] Mulholland stated that it appeared that there had been major movement in the hills forming the western buttress of the dam, adding that three eminent geologists, Robert T. Hill, C. F. Tolman and D. W. Murphy, had been hired by the Board of Water and Power Commissioners to determine if this was the cause. It was noted that no tremors had been reported at seismograph stations, ruling out an earthquake as the cause of the break.|$|E
2500|$|Cappon {{was known}} for his {{conservatism}} as a coach. [...] In 23 years at Princeton, the uniforms never changed, having small sewn-on numbers and no player names. [...] He considered a fast break as a lack of discipline and would not allow his players to shoot before five or ten passes had been completed. [...] In 1995, former Princeton player Selden Edwards wrote an article on Cappon's influence at Princeton. [...] Edwards, a junior varsity player in the Cappon era, wrote that [...] "Cappy was Princeton basketball to anyone even vaguely familiar with the teams of that era." [...] Edwards described Cappon's physical appearance this way: [...] "In 1959, the fall <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Princeton, Cappy was in peak form, a character who knew he was a character. He was in his early sixties, and his body {{looked as if it had}} been sculpted in ice cream and left in the sun. He was bald, the skin on his face drooped, he had deep shadows under his eyes. His voice was gravelly, and he enunciated as if he had wads of Kleenex in his mouth. He always said exactly what he meant, and his language was delightfully salty. Legend had it that he had been a great athlete at Michigan, but by the 1960s no one could imagine that. He was grumpily personable and totally without pretension." ...|$|E

[...] On March 10, 1959, the crowd surrounded the summer palace in response to a rumor that the Chinese communists were planning to arrest the Dalai Lama at a cultural performance in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) camp. The people were determined not to allow the Dalai Lama to leave Norbulingka palace. Some members of the crowd directed aggression at Tibetan officials that were thought to be Chinese collaborators. Tenpa Soepa, who was staying at a house on the night of March 10th near Norbulingka said, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the gate I found Kalon Sampho lying on the ground unconscious." [...] Sampho, [...] "...had arrived at Norbulinka [...] in a car with his Chinese bodyguard. They got out of their car and when the crowd saw the Chinese guard they began throwing stones." [...] "Phakpalha Khenchung ...had been killed by the protestors. He was a government official, and it was rumored that he had a very close relationship with the Chinese." [...] PLA General Tan considered the Dalai Lama to be in danger and offered him refuge if he could make it to the Chinese camp. He declined the offer. A week into the fighting, the general ordered two mortar rounds shot toward the palace. At that point, the Dalai Lama decided {{the time had come to}} slip out over the mountains, with a very small party, arriving a few days later at the Indian border. He was granted asylum by the Nehru government with the stipulation that he would not engage in politics on Indian soil. Meanwhile, Enlai dissolved the Tibetan government and appointed the Preparatory Committee for the Founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region to take its place. In 1959, Tenpa Soepa and other prisoners of war near Toema in Amdo said, [...] "Along the road we could see why our guards were so jumpy. We saw many burnt-out guardposts and even some tanks that were destroyed by Tibetan guerillas. This was Amdo, where the guerrilla war had gone on for years." ...|$|E
