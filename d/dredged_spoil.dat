The affected part of the estuary includes (but is not limited to) the Calcasieu River from northern Moss Lake up to the salt water barrier, that is north of both the existing bridge and any realigned new bridge in Lake Charles.

40|$|Disease {{development}} in flounder (Platichthys flesus) was studied {{over a period}} of 3 years in three large mesocosms (40 m x 40 m x 3 m). Two of the mesocosms contained clean sand and the third, sharing a common water circulation with one of the clean-sand mesocosms, was stocked with contaminated <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil.</b> In this way, one of the clean-sand mesocosms was indirectly polluted via the water phase, and analysis of contaminant concentrations in sediments and flounder tissues showed that it had a status intermediate between the other two. Random samples of the flounder populations from the indirectly polluted and reference mesocosms were examined every 2 months for epidermal diseases (lymphocystis, skin ulcers, fin rot) and then released. In addition, every 6 months, random samples of fish from all three mesocosms were sacrificed for histological and chemical investigation. With regard to the development of epidermal disease, the results showed little difference between the reference mesocosm and the indirectly polluted mesocosm, with the exception that lymphocystis was significantly elevated in the indirectly polluted mesocosm. Although pollution may be a risk factor in the etiology of this disease, such a relationship would probably be obscured under field conditions due to variation arising from other factors. Histopathological analysis of the livers revealed in total four cases of hepatocellular adenoma (1. 5 % of sampled population) in fish from the polluted mesocosms, the first occurring after 2. 5 years of exposure in fish from the indirectly polluted mesocosm. Furthermore, several other liver lesions, including foci of cellular alteration and hydropic vacuolated lesions, developed {{during the course of the}} experiment before tumor formation was apparent. Prevalences of these conditions were very much lower in the reference mesocosm than in the two polluted mesocosms. Densities of melanomacrophage centers in the liver showed a similar trend. The findings clearly indicate that long-term exposure to chemically contaminated <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil</b> can induce liver neoplasia and other liver lesions in flounder at contaminant levels comparable to those found in the natural environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to characterise macrozoobenthic community structure of the western sector of Algoa Bay, to identify the drivers of community structure and to develop a long-term monitoring framework. Data were collected from six study sites stratified along-shore. Each site comprised three stations; most sites were located in areas directly influenced by anthropogenic activities such as inflow from storm water drains and areas where <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil</b> was dumped. Other sites included areas in close proximity to estuary mouths. Physico-chemical parameters of the water column were measured with a YSI instrument, sediment for faunal and physico-chemical analyses was sampled with a Van Veen grab, and collected macrofauna were sedated and preserved pending analysis. In the laboratory, macrofauna were identified to finest taxonomic resolution possible under dissecting and compound microscopes, and enumerated. Sediment samples for physico-chemical analyses were kept frozen pending analysis. Up to 187 species belonging to 137 genera and 105 families were identified. Univariate community parameters such as abundance and number of species varied significantly along-shore, generally increasing towards less wave-exposed sites. Multivariate analyses revealed that community assemblages were heterogeneously distributed along-shore, corresponding to areas where anthropogenic influences such as effluent discharge and commercial harbour activities prevailed. During the 2008 survey, species assemblages separated into six groups corresponding to the six sites but xvii during the 2009 survey, species assemblages separated into four groups probably due to changes in environmental parameters such as the hydrodynamic regime. In both surveys the assemblage opposite a drainage canal (Papenkuils outfall) was distinct as it was dissimilar to all other assemblages. This site was also heterogeneous over relatively small spatial scales. Important physico-chemical variables influencing community structures during the 2008 survey included bottom measurements of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, coarse sand and mud. During the 2009 survey, only bottom temperature and mud content were identified as important physico-chemical variables structuring community assemblages. The principal variable was probably the hydrodynamic regime, driving community structure at a larger scale in Algoa Bay. On a localised scale, communities were probably structured by other factors such as effluent discharges, influence of estuary mouths and activities associated with the harbour. With a lack of information on keystone species (regarded as good monitoring species) in Algoa Bay, it was proposed that groups that cumulatively comprise 50 – 75 percent of total abundance within communities be monitored annually. Included are amphipods, polychaetes, cumaceans, ostracods, tanaids and bivalves. It was also proposed that areas opposite estuary mouths, effluent outfalls and the <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil</b> dumpsite be monitored. This routine monitoring programme should be accompanied by periodic hypothesis driven research to assess the importance of stochastic events (e. g., upwelling) on macrozoobenthic community dynamics.

40|$|Flounder (Platichthys flesus) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) {{were exposed}} to three {{different}} levels of pollution involving contaminants from harbour <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil</b> in a large-scale mesocosm study lasting 30 months. Exposure of fish to PCBs and PAHs was estimated from liver concentrations of CB- 153 and biliary levels of 1 -OH pyrens in flounder. Both marker compounds were significantly elevated in fish from the polluted mesocosms {{in comparison to the}} reference mesocosm. Of the three parameters used to characterise CYPIA induction in flounder, only CYPIA-mRNA in female fish was significantly induced by pollution. However, significant induction of EROD activity and immunochemically measured CYPlA protein content was observed in plaice. To investigate in more detail the apparent lack of CYP 1 A induction, a parallel experiment was run in which flounder were injected with a single i. p. injection of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and sacrificed after 48 hours. Since this approach did result in significant induction of all the parameters used to characterise CYP 1 A induction (EROD, CYPIA, CYPIA mRNA), it appears that external factors may have prevented induction in the mesocosm experiments. Down-regulating effects of the possible presence of a compound with oestrogenic activity, or altered membrane-CYPIA or membrane-receptor interaction, could have contributed to this apparent lack of response, despite the intrinsic ability of flounder to increase CYPIA levels after exposure to a model inducer (BaP) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{laboratory}} scale study {{was carried out}} using Starkey medium to demonstrate the feasibility of using microbial methods for the bioleaching of heavy metals from contaminated spoils. Acidophilic bacteria, Acidithiobacillus species were isolated from abandoned dredged spoils that were produced during the dredging of oil well access canals in the Niger Delta. Two different composite <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil</b> samples were collected, suspended in Starkey medium and inoculated with {{the culture of the}} bacteria for 1 - 7 weeks. The heavy metal concentration of the sediment prior to the bioleaching are as follows: copper (121. 1 ± 0. 30 mg/kg), cadmium (130. 8 ± 0. 53 mg/kg), chromium (143 ± 1. 00 mg/kg), nickel (138. 5 ± 0. 36 mg/kg), manganese (296 ± 2. 00 mg/kg) and zinc (131. 5 ± 0. 50 mg/kg). During the leaching process, the results of the physico-chemical monitoring show that pH decreased from 3. 5 to < 2. 0, while sulphate, conductivity, redox potential, turbidity, iron and optical density of the leaching broth increased. The physical observations (colour, turbidity, slime production, utilization of sulphur crystals) correlated with the physico-chemical measurements. After seven weeks of bioleaching, the heavy metal recoveries from the spoil 1 are copper (89 %), cadmium (100 %), chromium (56 %), nickel (81 %), manganese (68 %) and lead (96 %). We therefore conclude that Acidithiobacillus sp isolated from abandoned dredged spoils have the potential for the bioremediation of heavy metal contaminated dredged spoils.

40|$|The Arroyo Colorado {{is located}} in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas and flows through the middle of Hidalgo and Cameron counties. The lower 16 miles of the Arroyo Colorado form the {{boundary}} between Cameron and Willacy Counties, but the lower 26 miles form the tidally influenced segment. This tidal segment is periodically dredged to accommodate barge traffic to the Port of Harlingen and is characterized by steep eroding slopes with bank heights up to 50 feet. The steep banks are partially the result of the placement of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil</b> material {{on the banks of the}} stream. In the upper portions of the tidal segment, the steep banks are thought to occasionally impede the flow of air across the surface of the stream, which can reduce aeration and vertical mixing, factors that contribute to the low levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) observed in this portion of the stream. The average width of the tidal segment of the Arroyo Colorado is about 200 feet and the average depth is 13 feet. Being tidally influenced, it is brackish to saline (slightly salty to very salty) and usually stratifies under warm weather conditions, forming layers of warmer, fresher water on the surface and cooler, more saline water near the bottom. For most of its course, the tidal segment of the Arroyo Colorado has a significant degree of natural sinuosity. However, sinuosity in the tidal segment of the Arroyo Colorado severely diminishes in the final four miles of the stream as the Arroyo Colorado flows into a man-made channel that leads to the Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) and the Lower Laguna Madre...|$|E
40|$|Dredging is {{of major}} {{importance}} to the economic survival of many European estuaries, being essential to both commercial and recreational activities. Despite its environmental impacts, the numerous ways in which dredging {{can be used to}} improve the environment must not be overlooked. With increasing legislative controls, the current system for granting licences is becoming ever more complex and constrained, with the ability to realise any benefits being severely restricted. The following thesis identifies existing constraints to dredging in small UK estuaries, and proposes measures to effectively mitigate them in the future. Current practices are reviewed, highlighting the 'need' for dredging and the inherent environmental impacts. These are then considered {{in the context of the}} legal and administrative frameworks within which licencing procedures operate. Data gathered from regulating authorities and five case study estuaries in southwest England identified a multitude of legal, administrative and practical constraints to dredging. The EU decision to treat maintenance dredging as a plan or project under the Habitats Regulations, and the definition of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil</b> as 'waste' under the Hazardous Waste Directive, are fundamental. Dredging policies and protocols for individual estuaries would better guided and inform decisions on dredging, whilst redefining dredged material as a resource would facilitate its Beneficial Use. Overlapping jurisdictions in the intertidal zone complicate this situation, and guidance on how sediments should be defined would be advantageous. A single Act licencing both the dredging and disposal would bring all damaging forms of dredging under much needed regulatory control. Improved dialogue and communication networks, via a 'one-stop-shop approach', would ensure openness and transparency during statutory consultation, reducing delays and providing a common point of reference for applicants. If dredging and disposal operations become so constrained that ports are unable to continue for financial reasons, their very future could be threatened. Whilst the Marine B i l l presents an unprecedented opportunity to resolve many of the issues, a strategic and holistic approach will be crucial if the socio-economic lifeline of many estuarine communities is not to be lost in the foreseeable future.

40|$|The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of {{southeast}} China has a total land area of 1042 km 2 and encompasses 235 islands of varying sizes. It {{is affected by}} an unusual combination of water masses which not only keeps the coastal waters of Hong Kong warm and maintains the local sub-tropical/tropical biotic communities, but also allows temperate species to survive. It is greatly affected by freshwater dilution from both heavy rainfall during monsoons, and from the Pearl River which has an annual flow of 308 billion m 3, from a drainage area of 228, 000 km 2. These may lower the salinity of the western and northwestern approaches to 1 to 7 ‰, while the eastern and northeastern waters remain virtually unaffected. These conditions create sheltered, estuarine environments to the west, exposed, oceanic environments to the east, and a transitional zone in the middle, typified by the Victoria Harbour region. Species surviving are both euryhaline and eurythermal, and able to tolerate highly sedimented waters. These natural stresses also make the marine fauna and flora much more susceptible to pollution stresses. Nevertheless, there is considerable plant life, including mangroves, and the bird life associated with sheltered shore and mangroves is of considerable international significance. There is heavy use of the marine environment. A pronounced decline in demersal fish stocks in the South China Sea due to over-fishing has occurred. The sea receives over 2 million m 3 of waste water per day, and at present about 80 % of Hong Kong's sewage is largely untreated. About 75 % enters Victoria Harbour directly, representing a daily BOD loading of over 300 tonnes. As a result, many of Hong Kong's beaches are contaminated, especially along the western shores of the New Territories. There are some signs of a trend of improving beach water quality in general, {{but there are also}} increasing signs of harmful algal blooms. The huge volume of sea traffic in Hong Kong, with considerable paint stripping and painting, results in the release of chemical contaminants and biocides, e. g. tributyltin (TBT); the latter leading to concentrations of 53, 000 and 18, 300 ng Sn g- 1 in sediments, which exceed typical levels recorded elsewhere. Farming practices have become more specialized, resulting in large increases in application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Crop and livestock farms are large sources of nutrient-rich and pesticide-laden run-off, the former being considered the culprit in an increasing number of red tides. Some pesticides include compounds that have been banned in Hong Kong (e. g. DDT), which are attributable to contamination sources in the Chinese mainland. Indeed, the annual discharge of the Pearl River accounts for over 85 % of the total nutrient input to the local waters of Hong Kong. Rapid urban development has exerted an unprecedented pressure on the local marine environment. Large-scale reclamation has altered current patterns, reduced tidal flushing and caused hypoxia/anoxia in many areas. During 1991 to 1999, a total of 366 million m 3 of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil</b> was disposed into coastal waters, and the new port and airport development involved the dredging of 880 million m 3 of fill materials, and the dumping of 380 million m 3 of dredged materials within a very small coastal area, affecting fisheries resources, coral, seagrass, benthos and water quality. Health issues, including PSP and ciguatera intoxication are a problem, and some 3 to 7 % of shellfish samples contain unacceptably high levels of PCB and Σ DDT. Some important wildlife areas are now protected. Habitats such as mudflats are increasingly scarce in south China; there are only 23 remaining sites with intertidal mudflat habitats within 800 km of Hong Kong. The large Mai Po/Deep Bay Ramsar site is one such, and is described. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Contributor: Lene Buhl-MortensenThe 25 {{the meeting}} of the Benthos Ecology Working Group (Chair: Heye Rumohr, Germany) was held in the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR) in Heraklion, Crete. The meeting was {{attended}} by 22 participants from twelve nations, two of which were new to the group (Russia and Latvia). ToR a) The Agenda contained reports from ongoing and new benthos research projects in the ICES area and special reports from the hosting institute about the eastern Mediterranean. The Wikispecies project supported by the Wikimedia Foundation has a great potential. It is meant to become an open, free directory of species. This will cover Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Bacteria, Archaea and Protista. Everyone has the possibility to add or adjust a page on species, or any higher taxon. Species will ideally have name references, synonymy and links to wikipedia pages in all languages. All the information, images included, is free of copyright. The peracarid order Cumacea was outlined as an example both on Wikispecies and on the Dutch Wikipedia on [URL] (www. wikipedia. org and species. wikipedia. org) ToR b) The group discussed the progress of the SGNSBP and the contents of the planned CRR which will be finished in 2006. The data will be integrated in the MarBEF database when all data providers have agreed. ToR c) A subgroup formulated a text concerning benthos as eutrophication indicator where they addressed the topic regionally in estuaries, Baltic Sea and Lagoons, Fjords and the open waters. No simple, single species based system can be recommended for defining eutrophication effects on macrozoobenthos. An approach investigating whole community structure shifts must be adopted. It was recommended that observations are to be carried out on changes in the ratio of species numbers to total individual numbers. Increases in opportunistic species, including increases in biomass, should be considered. Changes in the community diversity can then be followed and compared by the Rarefaction Method. Pearson – Rosenberg (and related) models should be considered to identify species / groups important as local indicators. This should also include observed higher variability and even increased species numbers in the very early stages of enrichment. The group also recommends that consideration be given to shifts in feeding strategies in the benthic community (from suspension feeders to deposit feeders) The group recommends not only to consider infauna but also to consider hyper- and epibenthos which involves the application of different sampling methods such as dredging, imaging, etc. ToR d) There is a possibility to form a consortium of researchers which have a common interest in the marine environmental implications of off-shore renewable energy generation. (www. cost. esf. org/opencall). An initial expression of interest to participate in this initiative was from Spain, Belgium, Germany, Poland and the UK. The end of May deadline may be difficult to attain, although the group is convinced that there would be enough interest from different countries and institutes. Therefore it was concluded that a mailing list of possible interested parties would be created. ToR f) The outcome of Theme Session S (ASC 2005) was not very relevant for the question of long-term effects of oil-spills since it mainly dealt with short-term effects and clean-up methodologies. Looking in the literature, however, we find that after oil spills many effects were no longer visible after one year, most of them disappeared after three years {{but in the case of}} Amoco Cadiz the Ampelisca spp. population recovery took more than ten years. Single remainders of crude oil may be found even after 25 years as asphalt ‘pavements’. Kingston (2002) reports in his very comprehensive and up-to-date paper that the recovery in intertidal habitats is very much coupled to wave exposure and natural processes and that recovery is normally within 1 – 3 years after the spill depending on the latter ones and of the life span of the species in question ToR g) The initial draft report on <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil</b> disposal produced by the sub-group illustrated examples from the work conducted in several countries including information from Belgium, Germany, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and the U. S. A. The group formulated a list of conclusions and recommendations on how to deal with the search for suitable disposal site. A final document will be published as a Cooperative Research Report (CRR), final draft ready by September 2006. ToR j) To achieve a comprehensive list of existing metrics Hiscock 2004 shall be updated including newly developed metrics like e. g. tools developed under the WFD to assess the ecological status (i. e. multimetric tools or multivariate tools); Taxonomic distinctness and related indices; Any other new univariate indices. The regional sections of the WGRED report were distributed to experts in the group asking for critical review and need for amendments. The group agreed that generally the major interest goes to oceanography and fishing and only very little to benthos, special amendmends can be found in the annexes.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park for port expansion at Abbot Point in North Queensland, Australia, {{has been a}} contentious issue receiving extensive media coverage. The media has {{played a key role}} in representing different risk perceptions, and potentially influencing policy decision-making. This paper identifies different perceptions of risk portrayed by local, regional, interstate and national print media in relation to the <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> issue from January 2013 until February 2014. Media analysis explored the questions: how is 'risk' represented, who is linked to different risk perceptions, and how has the media coverage of the issue changed over time? Results show that 'risk' to the Great Barrier Reef from the <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> was framed by four main themes: Environmental Disaster, Socio-economic Disaster, Equilibrium and Industrialism. Environmental Disaster was the most prominent overall, and often positioned in opposition to Industrialism. In January 2013 the <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> issue was mainly covered by local sources and focused on risks to local livelihoods and environments. By February 2014 the issue was covered by sources throughout Australia and represented a range of risks to the GBR, and its World Heritage status, in relation to coal mining and port developments. Insights for communication from this analysis include the importance of using clear language that provides exact and solid examples of risks, especially in light of the media's agenda-setting power and with an issue that the general public does not have direct experience...|$|R
40|$|Providence Harbor and the Providence River {{shipping}} {{channel in}} Narragansett Bay need dredging {{to accommodate the}} shipping interest of the Port of Providence. Federal and State regulations have evolved {{in such a way}} that no dredging can be initiated without identifying sites for disposal of the <b>dredge</b> <b>spoils.</b> <b>Dredge</b> <b>spoils</b> are one of the few remaining categories of materials that, under regulation, can be dumped in the ocean.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{policy in}} the Netherlands {{concerning}} waste recognises an order of preference, with prevention as the ideal solution, followed by reuse (either direct or after treatment) and confined disposal as the least preferred option. The reuse of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> is the cheapest removal option {{and one that is}} frequently used. Treatment of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> is more expensive than disposal and hence difficult to stimulate. Consequently, 2002 saw the introduction of a tax of € 13. 48 per ton on the disposal of treatable <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils.</b> The environmental objective was to cancel out the economic advantage of disposal over processing and thus to encourage treatment. The introduction of this tax measure has had a number of positive effects:- In-situ sediment site investigations have been extended to include the determination of the sand content, and more attention is being paid to identifying sandy and non-sandy batches;- More accurate records of the dredging, transportation and disposal processes are being drawn up;- Treatment is being carried out under a quality assurance system geared towards maximising sand production...|$|R

Calculations of time trends indicated {{that on the}} whole concentrations of trace metals had significantly decreased since 1981, also on dredged material dumping sites.

40|$|One of the {{important}} uses of the ocean is to receive certain types of wastes from human developments, such as municipal wastewater and sludge, thermal power-plant effluents, mine tailings, and <b>dredge</b> <b>spoils.</b> An effective disposal system is one which must be carefully designed and operated like any other important engineering system. The physical part of the disposal system is the submarine outfall pipe with its associated components [...] a multi-port diffuser, a pumping system and/or a drop structure {{at the beginning of}} the pipe.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Channel {{maintenance}} {{operations in the}} rivers and harbors of the United States annually require the disposal of over 320 million cubic meters of <b>dredge</b> <b>spoils.</b> As the availability of suitable land sites diminishes, open water disposal presents an attractive yet controversial alternative method. For open water disposal to be acceptable, {{the fate of the}} spoils which are discharged in the water must be predictable. The study described in this thesis was an effort to examine the validity, in field conditions, of an analytical model for predicting hydraulic <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> fate. The analytical model was developed as part of an earlier laboratory study of open-water. <b>dredge</b> <b>spoiling.</b> The model employs the vector sum of spoil particle settling velocity and forward velocity in the water to compute particle trajectory for sand spoils. The forward velocity was determined by superimposing the ambient velocity of the receiving water upon the velocity induced by the dredge pipeline discharge. Investigation of the model in field conditions was accomplished by sampling sediment in the spoil plume from an operating hydraulic dredge, and comparing the data gathered with model predictions. The results obtained indicate the analytical model proposed is a usable means of locating <b>spoil</b> areas in <b>dredging</b> operation planning...|$|R
