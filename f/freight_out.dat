25|$|Until the {{acquisition}} of the WMR in December 1908 all NZR <b>freight</b> <b>out</b> of Wellington was carried on the Wairarapa Line. As soon as the western route became available, all freight that could be diverted off the Wairarapa Line was diverted, due to the difficulties created by the Rimutaka Incline. This meant that even some traffic from the northern Wairarapa was sent through the Manawatu Gorge and down the west coast to Wellington. The opening of the Rimutaka Tunnel made the line more desirable for through freight traffic, but as localised freight gave way to containerised inter-city freight in the 1980s, {{the significance of the}} Wairarapa Line declined, especially on the section north of Masterton.|$|E

60|$|Some {{of the men}} had rusty guns by them, {{some had}} swords on and had shawl belts with long, silver-mounted pistols stuck in them. All the camels had their loads on yet, but the packs had busted or rotted and spilt the <b>freight</b> <b>out</b> on the ground. We didn't reckon the swords was any good to the dead people any more, so we took one apiece, and some pistols. We took a small box, too, because it was so {{handsome}} and inlaid so fine; and then we wanted to bury the people; but there warn't no way to do it that we could think of, and nothing to do it with but sand, and that would blow away again, of course.|$|E
6000|$|I once hypnotized a bull on Boston Common. It {{was past}} midnight {{and he had}} me dead to rights; but before I got done with him he had ponied up a silver quarter and given me the address of an all-night restaurant. Then there was a bull in Bristol, New Jersey, who caught me and let me go, and heaven knows he had {{provocation}} enough {{to put me in}} jail. I hit him the hardest I'll wager he was ever hit in his life. It happened this way. About midnight I nailed a <b>freight</b> <b>out</b> of Philadelphia. The shacks ditched me. She was pulling out slowly through the maze of tracks and switches of the freight-yards. I nailed her again, and again I was ditched. You see, I had to nail her [...] "outside," [...] for she was a through freight with every door locked and sealed.|$|E

I told the minister to pull his <b>freight</b> <b>out</b> of that, and went on with my lunch, when another man come along and shook hands with Van Zyl. He'd known him at close range in the Kimberley seige and before. Van Zyl was well seen by his neighbours, I judge. As soon as this other man opened his mouth I said, 'You're Kentucky, ain't you?' 'I am,' he says; 'and what may you be?' I told him right off, for I was pleased to hear good United States in any man's mouth; but he whipped his hands behind him and said, 'I'm not knowing any man that fights for a Tammany Dutchman. But I presoom you've been well paid, you dam gun-runnin' Yank.' ...|$|E

They also believe that the Marine Highway can better handle the nation's north-south transit, though there are no east-west sailing corridors and those will always be land-side transits. Truck drivers, under DOT regulation, are limited {{in the number of}} hours they are allowed to drive in a day. These limits do not allow for traffic, waiting to load or unload, or check points.
