5|$|BSkyB's {{continued}} {{partnership with}} the Premier League <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increase {{in the value of}} broadcasting rights and matches televised. Managers however have voiced their concerns about the latter and the excessive cost of live rights is partly a reason why top-flight football has not returned to the BBC or ITV. In 2005 BSkyB's monopoly on live rights ended after the European Commission ruled that the Premier League needed to have more than one holder.|$|E
5|$|One major {{advantage}} of genome-scale RNAi screening {{is its ability}} to simultaneously interrogate thousands of genes. With the ability to generate a large amount of data per experiment, genome-scale RNAi screening <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> explosion data generation rates. Exploiting such large data sets is a fundamental challenge, requiring suitable statistics/bioinformatics methods. The basic process of cell-based RNAi screening includes the choice of an RNAi library, robust and stable cell types, transfection with RNAi agents, treatment/incubation, signal detection, analysis and identification of important genes or therapeutical targets.|$|E
5|$|Ecologists {{study and}} measure {{nutrient}} budgets {{to understand how}} these materials are regulated, flow, and recycled through the environment. This research <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet, including minerals, soil, pH, ions, water, and atmospheric gases. Six major elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.|$|E

5|$|Many {{indigenous}} communities did not evenly {{share in the}} benefits of the economic boom Taiwan experienced during {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century. They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{during the}} early English Renaissance was far less formal than that of {{mainland}} Europe and drew from a greater selection of motifs both ancient and modern, with less emphasis placed on the strict observance of rules derived from antique architecture. This <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> argument that the style was an evolution of Gothic rather than an innovation imported from Europe. This argument is evident at Montacute, where Gothic pinnacles, albeit obelisk in form, are combined with Renaissance gables, pediments, classical statuary, ogee roofs and windows appearing as bands of glass. This profusion of large, mullioned windows, an innovation of their day, give the appearance that the principal façade is built entirely of glass; a similar fenestration was employed at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire. However, despite the Dutch gables, {{a feature of the}} English Renaissance acquired as the style spread from France across the Low Countries to England, and the Gothic elements, much of the architectural influence is Italian.|$|E
5|$|There were 1480 {{schools in}} Sarawak in 2014, of which 1271 were primary, 202 were {{secondary}} and 7 were vocational/technical secondary schools. Among {{these are a}} number of schools that date from the Brooke era, including St. Thomas's School Kuching (1848), St Mary's School Kuching (1848), and St Joseph's School Kuching (1882). As well as government schools, there are four international schools: Tunku Putra School, a primary and secondary school offering national and Cambridge curricula, Lodge International School, which is also open to local students and uses both the British National and Cambridge systems, Kidurong International School, which is owned by Shell and offers primary education mainly to children of employees but local children may enter depending on space availability, and Tenby International School, which opened in 2014 and is open to both local and expatriate children. There are also 14 Chinese independent secondary schools in Sarawak that teach in Chinese rather than English or Malay. Previously, only Chinese students were enrolled in these schools, but mobility of the workforce has led to increasing turnover of students as parents move to other areas for employment. This <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increasing number of bumiputera students being enrolled in Chinese schools.|$|E
