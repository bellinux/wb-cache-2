25|$|When {{a company}} lists its {{securities}} {{on a public}} exchange, the money paid by the investing public for then newly issued shares goes directly to the company (primary offering) {{as well as to}} any early private investors who opt to sell all or a portion of their holdings (secondary offerings) as part of the larger IPO. An IPO, therefore, allows a company to tap into a wide pool of potential investors to provide itself with capital for future growth, repayment of debt, or working capital. A company selling common shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. Those investors must endure the unpredictable nature of the open market to price and trade their shares. After the IPO, when shares trade freely in the open market, money passes between public investors. For early private investors who choose to sell shares as part of the IPO process, the IPO represents an opportunity to monetize their investment. After the IPO, once shares trade in the open market, investors holding large blocks of shares can either sell those shares piecemeal in the open market, or sell a large block of shares directly to the public, at a fixed price, through a secondary market offering. This type of offering is not <b>dilutive,</b> since no new shares are being created.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, many {{venture capital}} firms will only seriously {{evaluate}} {{an investment in}} a start-up company otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove {{at least some of}} its claims about the technology and/or market potential for its product or services. To achieve this, or even just to avoid the <b>dilutive</b> effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven, many start-ups seek to self-finance sweat equity until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or angel investors. This practice is called [...] "bootstrapping".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{offering}} a relatively competitive range of cars, Fiat was not immune {{from the financial}} pressures that the auto industry confronted following the 1973 oil price shock. Towards the end of 1976 {{it was announced that}} the Libyan government was to take a 9.6% shareholding in the company in return for a capital injection worth an equivalent of £250million. The size of the Libyan investment is apparent when it is compared to the £310million IMF loan that the Italian government was trying to negotiate at the time. Other aspects of the Libyan agreement included the construction of a truck and bus plant at Tripoli. Chairman Agnelli candidly described the deal as [...] "a classic petro-money recycling operation which will strengthen the Italian reserves, provide Fiat with fresh capital and give the group greater tranquility in which to carry out its investment programmes". Equally noteworthy was the fact that despite the <b>dilutive</b> effect of the Libyan investment on existing shareholders, the company's largest shareholder, the Agnelli family, retained a 30% stake in the recapitalised business.|$|E
5000|$|Under International Financial Reporting Standards, diluted {{earnings}} per share is calculated by adjusting the earnings and number of shares {{for the effects of}} <b>dilutive</b> options and other <b>dilutive</b> potential common stock. <b>Dilutive</b> potential common stock includes: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Dilutive</b> {{securities}} are {{financial instruments}} like stock options, warrants, convertible bonds, etc. {{which increases the}} number of common stock, if exercised. It reduces the basic EPS (Earnings Per Share). Only if the diluted EPS {{is less than the}} basic EPS then it is called <b>dilutive</b> securities.|$|E

50|$|A real-life accretion/dilution {{analysis}} may be {{much more}} complex if the deal is structured as cash-and-stock-for-stock, if preferred shares and <b>dilutive</b> instruments are involved, if debt and transaction fees are substantial, and so on. Generally, if the buying company has a higher P/E multiple {{than that of the}} target, the deal is likely to be accretive. The reverse is true for a <b>dilutive</b> transaction.|$|E

5000|$|Rights {{issues may}} be {{particularly}} useful for all publicly traded companies as opposed to other more <b>dilutive</b> financing options. As equity issues are generally preferable to debt issues from the company's viewpoint, companies usually opt for a rights issue {{in order to minimize}} dilution and maximize the useful life of tax loss carryforwards. Since in a rights offering there is no change of control and a [...] "no-sale theory" [...] applies, companies are able to preserve tax loss carry-forwards better than via either follow-on offerings or other more <b>dilutive</b> financings. It's one of the types in modes of issue of securities both in public and private companies.|$|E
5000|$|Stock {{dilution}} {{has special}} relevance to investor-backed private companies and startups. Significantly <b>dilutive</b> events occur much more frequently for private companies {{than they do}} for public companies. These events happen because private companies frequently issue large amounts of new stock every time they raise money from investors.|$|E
50|$|Water {{quality is}} also closely linked with water {{quantity}} issues. Water shortages from natural and anthropogenic activity reduce the <b>dilutive</b> properties {{of water and}} may concentrate water pollution. Oppositely, during flooding events, water pollution may spread to previously uncontaminated waters through surface overflow or the failure of man-made barriers.|$|E
50|$|A {{seasoned}} equity offering {{or secondary}} equity offering (SEO) or capital increase {{is a new}} equity issue by an already publicly traded company. Seasoned offerings may involve shares sold by existing shareholders (non-dilutive), new shares (<b>dilutive)</b> or both. If the seasoned equity offering is made by an issuer that meets certain regulatory criteria, {{it may be a}} shelf offering.|$|E
50|$|The term (sometimes used in {{the phrase}} cram-down deal) has also gained {{currency}} to denote informally any transaction where existing investors (debt or equity) are forced by circumstance to accept an unappealing transaction, such as an expensive financing, a debt transaction that subordinates them, a <b>dilutive</b> equity raising, or an acquisition at an unappealingly low price.|$|E
5000|$|Calculations of diluted EPS vary. Morningstar reports diluted EPS [...] "Earnings/Share $", {{which is}} net income minus {{preferred}} stock dividends {{divided by the}} weighted average of common stock shares outstanding over the past year; this is adjusted for <b>dilutive</b> shares. Some data sources may simplify this calculation by using the number of shares outstanding {{at the end of}} a reporting period.|$|E
50|$|Accretion/dilution {{analysis}} {{is a type}} of M&A financial modelling performed in the pre-deal phase to evaluate the effect of the transaction on shareholder value and to check whether EPS for buying shareholders will increase or decrease post-deal. Generally, shareholders do not prefer <b>dilutive</b> transactions; however, if the deal may generate enough value to become accretive in a reasonable time, a proposed combination is justified.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} maximizing {{shareholder}} value is usually highlighted {{in opposition to}} alleged examples of CEO's and other management actions which enrich themselves {{at the expense of}} shareholders. Examples of this include acquisitions which are <b>dilutive</b> to shareholders, that is, they may cause the combined company to have twice the profits for example but these might have to be split amongst three times the shareholders.|$|E
5000|$|A {{secondary}} market offering {{should not be}} confused with a follow-on offering, otherwise known as a subsequent offering, or a <b>dilutive</b> secondary offering. In a follow-on offering, the company itself places new shares onto the market, thus diluting the existing shares. [...] "Secondary market offering" [...] can be understood as an offering on the {{secondary market}}, and is thus different from a secondary offering on the primary market — in other words, an offering following an initial, primary-market offering. A follow-on offering which is the second offering from a company can be understood as a secondary offering on a primary market, which is where the confusion between a <b>dilutive</b> (follow-on) and a non-dilutive secondary market offering possibly comes from. If a company were to make a third, primary-market offering, this would be a follow-on offering which is not a secondary market offering. [...] "Secondary offering" [...] as described in this article is an offering on the secondary market which is non-dilutive, and is thus not a follow-on offering.|$|E
50|$|Calculations of diluted EPS under U.S. GAAP are {{described}} under Statement No. 128 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FAS No. 128). The objective of diluted EPS is {{to measure the}} performance of a company over the reporting period taking into account the <b>dilutive</b> effect of potential common stock that could be issued by the company. To compute diluted EPS, both the denominator (outstanding shares) and the numerator (earnings) may need to be adjusted.|$|E
50|$|Existing investors tend to {{have mixed}} {{reactions}} to PIPE offerings as the PIPE is often highly <b>dilutive</b> and destructive to the existing shareholder base. Depending upon {{the terms of the}} transaction, a PIPE may dilute existing shareholders' equity ownership, particularly if the seller has agreed to provide the investors with downside protections against market price declines (a death spiral), which can lead to issuance of more shares to the PIPE investors for no more money.|$|E
5000|$|Company founders {{start with}} 100% {{ownership}} of their company but frequently {{have less than}} 35% ownership in the later-stages of their companies' life cycles (i.e., before a sale of the company or an IPO). [...] While founders and investors both understand this dilution, managing it and miminizing it can often {{be the difference between}} a successful outcome for founders and a failure. As such, <b>dilutive</b> terms are heavily negotiated in venture capital deals.|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of mergers and acquisitions, {{accretion}} {{is referred to as}} the increase in a company's earnings per share on a pro forma basis following the transaction. For example, if Company A has $1.00 earnings per share and after acquiring Company B, the combined company's earnings per share is $1.25, then the acquisition would be referred to as 25% accretive. In contrast, a transaction is <b>dilutive</b> if the earnings per share decreases following the transaction.|$|E
50|$|The non-dilutive type of {{follow-on}} offering is when {{privately held}} shares are {{offered for sale}} by company directors or other insiders (such as venture capitalists) who may be looking to diversify their holdings. Because no new shares are created, the offering is not <b>dilutive</b> to existing shareholders, but the proceeds from the sale do not benefit the company in any way. Usually however, the increase in available shares allows more institutions to take non-trivial positions in the company.|$|E
50|$|A {{follow-on}} offering (often but incorrectly {{called a}} secondary offering) is an issuance of stock {{subsequent to the}} company's initial public offering. A follow-on offering can be either of two types (or a mixture of both): <b>dilutive</b> and non-dilutive. A secondary offering is an offering of securities by a shareholder of the company (as opposed to the company itself, which is a primary offering). A follow on offering is preceded by release of prospectus similar to IPO: a Follow-on Public Offer (FPO).|$|E
5000|$|Warrants {{issued by}} the company itself are <b>dilutive.</b> When the warrant {{issued by the}} company is exercised, the company issues new shares of stock, so the number of {{outstanding}} shares increases. When a call option is exercised, {{the owner of the}} call option receives an existing share from an assigned call writer (except in the case of employee stock options, where new shares are created and issued by the company upon exercise). Unlike common stock shares outstanding, warrants do not have voting rights.|$|E
50|$|A {{secondary}} offering is not <b>dilutive</b> to existing shareholders since no new shares are created. The {{proceeds from the}} sale of the securities do not benefit the issuing company in any way. The offered shares are privately held by shareholders of the issuing company which may be directors or other insiders (such as venture capitalists) who may be looking to diversify their holdings. Usually however, the increase in available shares allows more institutions to take non-trivial positions in the issuing company which may benefit the trading liquidity of the issuing company's shares.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, many {{venture capital}} firms will only seriously {{evaluate}} {{an investment in}} a start-up company otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove {{at least some of}} its claims about the technology and/or market potential for its product or services. To achieve this, or even just to avoid the <b>dilutive</b> effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven, many start-ups seek to self-finance sweat equity until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or angel investors. This practice is called [...] "bootstrapping".|$|E
5000|$|Rights offerings {{offset the}} <b>dilutive</b> effect of issuing more shares. For this reason, stock-exchange rules don't require that {{shareholders}} approve rights offerings {{if the company}} offers at least 20% of outstanding shares at a discount. However, some investors see rights offers as an [...] "unwelcome choice between stumping up more cash or seeing their existing holding diluted", {{as a result of}} which rumors that a company might undertake an offering can hurt its share price. Because rights offerings are unpopular, companies typically choose them as a last resort, perhaps due to insufficient investor demand.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, Atari, SA, BlueBay Value Recovery (Master) Fund Limited, and The BlueBay Multi-Strategy (Master)Fund Limited {{reached an}} {{agreement}} following their negotiations regarding the restructuring of the debt and capital structure of the Atari group. As part of the agreement, the €20.9 million Credit Facility Agreement was extinguished via €10.9 million loan forgiveness from BlueBay Value Recovery (Master) Fund Limited and Atari's payment of €10 million; the cancellation of the <b>dilutive</b> effect of the ORANEs held by BlueBay; €20 million capital increases to be submitted to the vote of Atari shareholders (of which €10 million with preferential subscription right).|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} win a {{cybersquatting}} claim, Falwell would have to show bad faith intent to profit from using the fallwell.com domain name, and prove that the domain name is [...] "identical or confusingly similar to, or <b>dilutive</b> of, the distinctive and famous mark". [...] In addition to the already established lack of confusion, the Appeals Court found that Lamparello {{did not have a}} bad faith intent to profit {{due to the lack of}} income from the site, that Lamparello had not attempted to sell the domain name, and that Lamparello had not purchased a large quantity of domain names.|$|E
5000|$|The {{acquisition}} of Vanstar reportedly added {{a large amount}} of debt, and {{it has been said that}} Inacom overpaid too much for a company of that size. Vanstar had 43.26 million shares outstanding at the time the deal was struck, and shareholders of Vanstar received [...]64 shares of ICO for each VST share in a stock swap deal, thus the issuance of 27.7 M shares of stock effectively more than doubled the number of outstanding shares while also being <b>dilutive</b> to the existing shares. This, plus debt concerns, led to a decline in the price of Inacom's stock.|$|E
5000|$|Simon's next step, on April 14, 2010, was to {{announce}} a $2.5 billion equity investment offer which equaled the price per share of Brookfield's offer. [...] Simon claimed that the deal was more favorable to GGP and its equity holders than Brookfield's offer, stating that it would eliminate the highly <b>dilutive</b> warrants that GGP would issue to Brookfield, Pershing Square and Fairholme Capital. Simon's offer also included a co-investment commitment by Paulson & Co worth $1 billion. Simon Property Group had not ruled out a full takeover of General Growth, claiming that their investment offer would give them more time to work out their differences concerning antitrust issues.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of the <b>dilutive</b> offering, the company's board of {{directors}} agrees to increase the share float for the purpose of selling more equity in the company. This new inflow of cash might be used to pay off some debt or used for needed company expansion. When new shares are created and then sold by the company, the number of shares outstanding increases and this causes dilution of earnings on a per share basis. Usually the gain of cash inflow from the sale is strategic and is considered positive for the longer term goals of the company and its shareholders. Some owners of the stock however may not view the event as favorably over a more short term valuation horizon.|$|E
50|$|Stock dilution, {{also known}} as equity dilution, is the {{decrease}} in existing shareholders’ ownership of a company {{as a result of}} the company issuing new equity. New equity increases the total shares outstanding which has a <b>dilutive</b> effect on the ownership percentage of existing shareholders. This increase in the number of shares outstanding can result from a primary market offering (including an initial public offering), employees exercising stock options, or by issuance or conversion of convertible bonds, preferred shares or warrants into stock. This dilution can shift fundamental positions of the stock such as ownership percentage, voting control, earnings per share, and the value of individual shares. A broader definition specifies dilution as any event that reduces an investor's stock price below the initial purchase price.|$|E
5000|$|On October 9, 1998, Inacom {{purchased}} Vanstar for {{a reported}} $465 - $480 million. The resulting company employed nearly 12,000 and {{was estimated to}} generate $7 billion in revenue.The acquisition of Vanstar reportedly added {{a large amount of}} debt, and {{it has been said that}} Inacom overpaid for a company of that size. Vanstar had 43.26 million shares outstanding at the time the deal was struck, and shareholders of Vanstar received [...]64 shares of ICO for each VST share in a stock swap deal, thus the issuance of 27.7 M shares of stock effectively more than doubled the number of outstanding shares while also being <b>dilutive</b> to the existing shares. This, plus debt concerns, led to a decline in the price of Inacom's stock.|$|E
5000|$|Convertible {{preferred}} stock—These are preferred {{issues which}} holders can {{exchange for a}} predetermined number of the company's common-stock shares. This exchange may occur at any time the investor chooses, regardless of the market price of the common stock. It is a one-way deal; one cannot convert the common stock back to preferred stock. A variant {{of this is the}} anti-dilutive convertible preferred recently made popular by investment banker Stan Medley who structured several variants of these preferred for some forty plus public companies. In the variants used by Stan Medley the preferred share converts to either a percentage of the company's common shares or a fixed dollar amount of common shares rather than a set number of shares of common. The intention is to ameliorate the bad effects investors suffer from rampant shorting and <b>dilutive</b> efforts on the OTC markets.|$|E
