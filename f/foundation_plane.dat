On the ground floor there is a central wing with historical baths. Due to long-term decaying, the construction needs to be additionally settled, renovated and converted into hotel rooms. Diploma paper comprises four chapters: The first chapter includes {{a description of a}} building in Rimske Toplice, a short historical outline of the Rimske Toplice Health Resort, and concludes with a description of the current state. The second chapter is entitled The beginning of renovation works and describes investor's decision-making policy, proposed renovation plan, the process of documentation acquiring, scheme presentation, construction site plan and the timeline of the renovation implementation. The third chapter is entitled Building renovation. It describes foundation and redevelopment works, including a description of construction work, craft trades and installation works. The first part of the third chapter focuses on the identified condition, it is followed by a description of an architectural concept and finishes with a description of the renovation implementation. The works comprised inadequate foundations, static and seismological stiffing and the elimination of moisture. Construction work, craft trades and installation works comprised roof, façade and arches renewal, construction of new AB concrete <b>foundation</b> <b>plane,</b> flooring, lowered ceilings, plastered walls, bathroom equipment, electrical and mechanical installation. After the renovation is completed, it is followed by a financial revision and a delivery of opinion on the justification of the renovation...|$|E

It is found that the interference between the two foundations has a significant influence on the contact stress distribution. In the absence of interference, the contact stress distribution beneath a single foundation exhibits a symmetrical shape. As the spacing between the foundations diminishes the contact stress distribution exhibits an asymmetrical shape.

The foundation is a sub horizontal dipping blocky sandstone. The dam is built with a 130 m wide uncontrolled central primary spillway and an uncontrolled left bank secondary spillway which commences discharging at the 1:100 year flood level. The dam cross section is rather squat {{in order to}} provide sufficient resistance against potential sliding along <b>foundation</b> bedding <b>planes.</b> The [...] dam wall holds back the [...] reservoir when at full capacity. From a catchment area of 546 km2 that includes much of the western portion of the McPherson Range, the dam creates an unnamed reservoir with a surface area of 1230 ha.

In the middle of the lesson a student asked, “What is the difference between congruent triangles and similar triangles?” Commentary: The set of mathematical foci below bring attention to the background knowledge that one must have {{in order to understand the}} concepts of similarity and congruence. The first focus highlights the axiomatic approach taken by Euclid and David Hilbert, which is ultimately the <b>foundation</b> of <b>plane</b> geometry. In order to grasp the concept of congruence and similarity not only in triangles but also in other geometric figures, one must first be familiar with the Euclidean distance formula derived from the Pythagorean Theorem (second focus). The other three foci that follow concentrate on proving congruence and similarity in triangles by using the geometric properties of triangles and angles...|$|R

The aim of this thesis is to give a more {{complete}} description {{of some of the}} interesting topics in this article. We will start with Hilbert's axioms and Euclid's propositions, and then focus on hyperbolic geometry. We will proceed to give a complete proof of the uniformity theorem by using Saccheri's quadrilateral. Further, implication relations between the axioms and statements which can eliminate the obtuse angle hypothesis. Lastly, we shall discuss the famous mathematic problem of "squaring the circle" in a hyperbolic plane to Fermat primes, based on W. Jagy's discovery...|$|R

The analysis is separated into two physically meaningful subproblems: the first {{deals with the}} determination of the restraining forces acting on the foundation; the second deals with the evaluation of driving forces induced by seismic waves on the fixed foundation. This analysis is applied to the case of a hemispherical foundation embedded in a homogeneous elastic half space. The exact series solutions of the mixed boundary value problem are presented. The results are compared with those of a circular flat foundation. The comparison indicates that the embedment may have a marked influence of foundation response. The impedance components of the embedded hemispherical foundation are generally larger than those of the disc <b>foundation.</b> For incident <b>plane</b> P, SV and SH waves, scattering due to embedment reduces the foundation translational motion at high frequencies, but leads to significant rocking and torsional motions...|$|R
