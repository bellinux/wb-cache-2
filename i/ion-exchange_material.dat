Metals are taken up by peat through an ion exchange reaction where the metal displaces a proton if the pH is low or an existing metal if the pH is high from the anionic function group. Anions, such as [...] and [...] are removed more effectively at pH < 3 because of the positively charged surface created {{by the addition of}} protons onto the surface functional groups, whereas cations, such as , , , are more effectively removed at higher pH values. Peat moss seems to be an effective <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>material</b> for removing heavy metals and some anions.

The objective of this experiment {{was to determine the}} strontium-loading distribution coefficients (Kds) for some titanate <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>materials,</b> modified minerals, and organic ion-exchange resins. The equilibrium uptake data presented in this report are useful for identifying potential materials that are capable of removing strontium from N-area groundwaters. The data show the relative selectivities of the <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>materials</b> under similar operating conditions, and show that additional flow studies are needed to predict materials capacities and to develop complete ion-exchange process flow sheets. The materials investigated in this study include commercially available ion exchangers such as IONSIV IE- 911 (manufactured by UOP) and SuperLig 644 (IBC Advanced Technologies, Inc.), and materials produced on an experimental basis by Allied Signal (nontitanates), Selion Inc.

40|$|This project {{seeks to}} {{determine}} if inorganic or hybrid inorganic <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>materials</b> can be exploited to provide effective americium and curium separations. Specifically, we seek to understand the fundamental structural and chemical factors responsible for the selectivity of the tested <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>materials</b> for actinide and lanthanide ions. During FY 13, experimental work focused in the following areas: (1) investigating methods to oxidize americium in dilute nitric acid with subsequent ion-exchange performance measurements of ion exchangers with the oxidized americium and (2) synthesis, characterization and testing of <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>materials.</b> <b>Ion-exchange</b> <b>materials</b> tested included alkali titanates, alkali titanosilicates, carbon nanotubes and group(IV) metal phosphonates. Americium oxidation testing sought to determine the influence that other redox active components may have on the oxidation of Am(III). Experimental findings indicated that Pu(IV) is oxidized to Pu(VI) by peroxydisulfate, {{but there are no}} indications that the presence of plutonium affects the rate or extent of americium oxidation at the concentrations of peroxydisulfate being used. Tests also explored the influence of nitrite on the oxidation of Am(III). Given the formation of Am(V) and Am(VI) in the presence of nitrite, it appears that nitrite is not a strong deterrent to the oxidation of Am(III), but may be limiting Am(VI) by quickly reducing Am(VI) to Am(V). Interestingly, additional absorbance peaks were observed in the UV-Vis spectra at 524 and 544 nm in both nitric acid and perchloric acid solutions when the peroxydisulfate was added as a solution. These peaks have not been previously observed and do not correspond to the expected peak locations for oxidized americium in solution. Additional studies are in progress to identify these unknown peaks. Three titanosilicate ion exchangers were synthesized using a microwave-accelerated reaction system (MARS�) and determined to have high affinities for lanthanide ions in dilute nitric acid. The K-TSP ion exchanger exhibited the highest affinity for lanthanides in dilute nitric acid solutions. The Ge-TSP ion exchanger shows promise as a material with high affinity, but additional tests are needed to confirm the preliminary results. On the other hand, carbon nanotubes and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes exhibited low, but measureable affinities for lanthanide ions in dilute nitric acid solutions (pH 3 and 6). The MWCNT exhibited much lower affinities than the K-TSP in dilute nitric acid solutions. However, the MWCNT are much more chemically stable in concentrated nitric acid solutions and, therefore, may be candidates for ion exchange in more concentrated nitric acid solutions...|$|R

Although primarily used for aqueous effluents desalination, electro-dialysis was recently shown to be a promising technology for industrial wastewater and co-solvent mixtures purification. The harsh working conditions imposed by these liquid effluents, including high suspended solids, require the development of more chemically and mechanically resistant membranes. In this study, commercial porous stainless steel media filters (240 μm thick) were used as a backbone to prepare hybrid ion-exchange membranes by casting ion-exchange materials within the porous metal structure. The surface of the metal reinforcements was modified by plasma treatment prior to sol-gel silane grafting to improve the interface between the metal and the ion-exchange resins. The morphology of novel hybrid materials and the interface between the metal fibers and the <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>material</b> have been characterized using techniques such as scanning electron microscopy and FTIR mapping. The thickness of the silane coating was found to lie between 1 and 2 μm while water contact angle tests performed on membrane surfaces and corrosion test behaviors revealed the formation of a thin passivating oxide layer on the material surfaces providing anchoring for the silane grafting and adequate surface energy for the proper incorporation of the <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>material.</b> The hybrid membranes desalination performance were then tested in a bench top electro-dialysis cell over a range of flow rate, current densities and salt concentration conditions to evaluate the ability of the novel hybrid materials to desalinate model streams. The performance of the hybrid membranes were benchmarked and critically compared against commercially available membranes (Selemion™). Although the salt transfer kinetics across the hybrid ion-exchange composite membranes were shown to be comparable to that of the commercial membranes, the low porosity of the stainless steel reinforcements, around 60 %, was shown to impede absolute salt permeations. The hybrid ion-exchange membranes were however found to be competitive at low current density and low flow velocity desalination conditions...|$|E

I n t roduct ion Synthetic ion-exchange r sins have been known for about 15 years and, apart from their use in a great variety of ap-plications, several points of theoretical interest such as adsorption isotherms and exchange kinetics have been inves-tigated.

40|$|Abstract: Hydrophobic {{microporous}} aluminosilicates {{created by}} the modification of zeolites and clays are currently being investigated as storage media for hazardous cations. Addition of an organic monolayer {{to the surface of}} an aluminosilicate after introduction of an ion into the zeolite or clay reduces the interaction of water with the material. The resuItant systems are approximately 20 times more resistant to leaching of the stored ion than the unmodified <b>ion-exchanged</b> <b>materials.</b> XAS spectra demonstrate that byproducts from the organic modifier can complex with the encapsulated cation. This complexation can result in a decreased affinity of the cation for the aluminosilicate matrix. Changing the organic modifier eliminates this problem. XAS spectra also indicate that the reactivity and subsequent speciation of the encapsulated ion alters upon application of the hydrophobic layer. 1...|$|R

In this study, electrically conductive nanocomposite of polyaniline Sn(IV) tungstomolybdate (PSTM) was synthesized by sol–gel method via the blend of inorganic precipitate of Sn(IV) tungstomolybdate into the matrix of polyaniline gel having good ion-exchange capacity and electrical conductivity behavior. The so obtained composite was characterized by using several sophisticated instrumental analyses; such as FTIR, TGA-DTA, XRD, SEM and TEM. Electrical conductivity behavior of this composite material was investigated by using 4 -probe-in-line DC electrical conductivity measuring technique and the electrical conductivity was found in semiconductor region; i. e., 10 − 2 S cm − 1, which followed Arrhenius equation for its temperature dependence. The thermal stability of the PSTM composite material in terms of dc electrical conductivity retention was studied under isothermal and cyclic techniques and electrical conductivit...|$|R
