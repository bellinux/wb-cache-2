The hot air generated in the solar air heater was forced into drying chamber to avoid the direct exposure of sunlight and UV radiation on cocoons. The drying air temperature varied from 50 to 75 Â Â°C. The cocoon was dried from the initial moisture content of about 60 - 12 % (wb). The drying data was fitted to thin layer drying models. Drying behaviour of the silk cocoon was best fitted with the Wang and Singh drying model. Good agreement was obtained between predicted and experimental values. Quality of the cocoons dried in the solar dryer was at par with the cocoons dried in the conventional <b>electrical</b> <b>oven</b> dryer in term of the silk yield and strength of the silk.

Kernels roasted using microwave and microwave – infrared combined treatments showed dry weight, colour and fracturability values similar to those obtained by traditional treatment. Microwaves preserved hazelnut phenol compounds showing a loss of 7. 5 % with respect to unroasted hazelnut, whereas loss of total phenols higher than 44 % were observed in traditional roasted hazelnuts.

The requirements of flour used to produce high-quality steamed bread are poorly defined. The suitability of Western and Southern Cape wheat for steamed bread production was, therefore, investigated. A marked increase in the nutritive value of steamed bread was reported compared to that of conventionally baked bread, mainly due to the loss of available lysine during conventional baking. Samples of three spring wheat cultivars that were produced during the 1995 and 1996 seasons in the Western and Southern Cape were selected. Flour protein content of these samples varied between 8 and 16 %. Flour protein content, Falling Number determinations, gluten content, Mixograph, Alveograph and Rheofermentometer measurements and the 10 g baking test were performed on each of the flours. Steamed and conventionally baked breads were prepared for each cultivar at the four selected flour protein levels, respectively. Total bread volume, weight, height and texture, crust and crumb colour and lysine availability were measured for each loaf of bread. None of the Rheofermentometer measurements correlated significantly with flour protein content or any of the analytical and rheological measurements performed on the flour. All the crust colour parameters of conventionally baked bread correlated significantly with flour protein content. Even though significant correlation was observed for three crust colour parameters of steamed bread, the correlation was lower compared to that of conventionally baked bread. At the four different protein levels, more variation was observed in the elasticity of conventionally baked bread compared to the steamed bread, the texture of the steamed bread was finer and firmer and the crumb was more sticky. The browning reaction occurring in conventionally baked bread results in less available lysine than would be the case for steamed bread. In this study, higher availability of lysine was only the case when steamed bread was produced from high protein flour. Western and Southern Cape spring wheat, irrespective of protein content are, therefore, suitable for the production of good quality steamed bread. Articl...|$|R

Porosity and porosity control methods are also discussed in relevant sections. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the effects of casting processes on the development of porosity on Ag-Pd alloys for metal - acrylic restorations. An M. O. D.

Gas (propane) - oxygen and centrifugal casting machine, <b>electrical</b> <b>oven</b> and centrifugal casting machine and <b>electrical</b> <b>oven</b> - vacuum and press air were used to melt each alloy and cast the specimens. A stereo-microscope was used to scan the external porosity in conjunction with digital photography, in order to store imaging data. The surfaces of the specimens and the total area of the pores were measured using an image analysis program. Quantitative results from the conducted investigation have been analyzed using statistical methods, lending to the following conclusions: 1. There was no statistically significant difference in the total number of defects (pores) on the external surface of the specimens among the three groups of alloys treated by different melting and casting techniques. 2. There was no statistically significant difference in the total number of defects (pores) on the three surfaces of the specimens among the three groups of alloys treated by different melting and casting techniques, in correlation with different width and position of the specimen surface. 3.

40|$|Overall, {{the market}} for {{gluten-free}} foods, and thus also for gluten-free breads, grows. About 1 % of the world population suffers from celiac disease and cannot consume wheat, rye, or barley based food products. Furthermore, {{people who suffer from}} non-celiac gluten sensitivity and an increasing number of people who avoid gluten {{as a result of their}} ‘lifestyle choices’ follow a gluten-free or gluten-poor diet. However, gluten-free breads often have poor organoleptic and nutritional quality. They are of low specific loaf volumes, have a dry and crumbly crumb and stale faster than wheat bread. Furthermore, in many instances they lack taste, mouthfeel and an acceptable color. In addition, excluding wheat and other gluten‐containing cereals from the diet creates the risk of shortage of certain essential nutrients. Different ingredients and additives are used to improve the sensory and nutritional quality of gluten-free breads. Many recipes have been developed by ‘trial-and-error’ approaches without fully understanding the impact of individual ingredients or additives on bread quality. In our research, the influence of individual ingredients and additives on different parameters during the complete bread making process, from batter production to bread staling, is investigated using innovative techniques such as baking in an <b>electrical</b> resistance <b>oven</b> and low field proton nuclear magnetic resonance. In this presentation, the use of buckwheat as a gluten-free starch bread ingredient was investigated. Buckwheat is a pseudocereal with good nutritional composition and a high dietary fiber content. The recipe for control starch bread was kept as simple as possible, with only cassava and potato starches, egg white, yeast, sugar, salt and water as ingredients. Substitution of 30 % starch-egg white mixture by buckwheat flour changed neither the specific bread volume nor the textural parameters after cooling. Also, buckwheat addition did not alter amylopectin retrogradation enthalpy during six days storage. However, the rate of crumb hardening during storage decreased. Differences in water (re) distribution between both recipes were observed in fresh bread crumb and maintained during storage. Addition of buckwheat flour can thus prolong the shelf-life of gluten-free starch bread. Water distribution appears to play an important role in the mechanism of gluten-free bread staling. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to develop new {{aluminium}} matrix (intermetallic) composites reinforced with iron oxide (Fe 3 O 4) that will be used in aeronautical engineering or in electronic industry. Different parameters such as sintering time and temperature, reinforcement, compact pressure were evaluated. The final purpose of this project is going on to improve conductivity and magnetic permeability of this new composite. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, a new alternative materials “aluminium–iron oxide (Fe 3 O 4, naturally as the mineral magnetite) powder composite” has been developed by using a microwave (in the laboratory scale) sintering programme with various aspect ratios, that iron oxide (Fe 3 O 4) particle sizes and aluminium powders together were prepared. This paper contains partially preliminary results of our going-on research project. Findings: Green density increased regularly depending on the compact pressure and percentage of the iron oxide (Fe 3 O 4). Micro and macro porosity was not found due to very clean microwave sintering.

40|$|International audienceTreatment of {{polluted}} {{industrial wastes}} {{is one of}} the challenging research topics that occupy an important position in various chemical processes. Among the various types of processes which can be used for treating aqueous wastes polluted with organic matter, the biological and chemical treatments, as well as the incineration are the most commonly used techniques. Each of the mentioned techniques can be used separately or combined with other procedures in order to optimise the global operating conditions. The choice of the process depends upon the nature of the waste and its final destination. Although, the operating cost is an important factor which determines the possibility to exploit the process in large scale. Wet air oxidation is a destructive technology based upon the oxidation of organic and inorganic pollutants in aqueous solutions. The system uses molecular oxygen or air as a potential source of oxidant. Wet air oxidation can be either a non-catalysed process or can occur in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. Destruction of Methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether (MTBE) is a research subject of growing concern since the recognition of this compound as an environmental pollutant. MTBE is commonly added to gasoline as an octane enhancer and has been used for the last two decades. It is highly soluble in water and transports easily in ground and surface water. As a result, it is found frequently in groundwater and some surface water. We have focused our research on the catalytic decomposition of this compound using a wet air oxidation process. Some typical results are presented, pointing out the most important parameters of the process and showing the specific behaviour of a Ruthenium/Cerium catalyst during the oxidation of MTBE. The main part of the process consists of one fixed bed tubular reactor centred in an <b>electrical</b> automated <b>oven.</b> The substrate mixed to pure oxygen is oxidised over the catalyst bed and the emergent effluent is therefore cooled into a condenser thus liquid and gas phases could be separated hereafter. Catalysts are prepared by co-impregnation process of metallic chloride precursors (RuCl 3. H 2 O and CeCl 3. 7 H 2 O) onto commercial alumina (Merck-Prolabo; BET = 331 m²/g) support commonly used in the industrial catalytic processes. Therefore, catalysts are calcinated at 450 °C under airflow in order to remove impurities at the surface, then reduced at the same temperature under pure hydrogen flow for 3 hours. Feed solution of MTBE giving 2500 ppm of COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) was prepared in distilled water. The oxidation runs have been carried out at 150 °C under 2 bar of pure oxygen pressure during 3 hours. The catalyst presenting 3 % of Cerium concentration showed the best result regarding the abatement of COD and TOC (Total Organic Carbon). Higher concentrations of cerium have negative effects on the oxidation reaction. This could be explained by the presence of chlorine which inhibits the active metallic sites. AOSC (Average Oxidation State of Carbon) has been calculated according to the measured COD and TOC values. Here again, the optimal oxidation state was obtained with the catalyst of 3 % of Cerium concentration...|$|R
40|$|Pound cake, {{a common}} European cake type, is {{prepared}} from equal portions of flour, sugar, fat and eggs. During baking, both starch and egg components form a gel. This results in water binding and structure setting. Temperature gradients during conventional pound cake batter baking cause structure setting {{to take place}} at different times in {{different regions of the}} batter. As a result, crumb of conventional cake is heterogeneous in terms of moisture content and starch and protein properties. During storage, cake crumb firms through mechanisms that, when this work started, were still poorly understood. Still, most authors agreed that crumb to crust moisture migration has a large impact on crumb firming. We here set out to study the mechanisms by which crumb firming occurs. In a first experimental chapter, model systems of different complexities, i. e. flour-water, flour-sugar-water, egg-water, egg-sugar-water and flour-egg-sugar-water models, were analyzed by proton (1 H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to provide a basis for studying proton mobility in pound cake and its crumb. Crumb proton populations were assigned to (A) non-exchanging CH protons of crystalline starch, proteins and crystalline fat, (B) and (C) non-exchanging CH protons of amorphous starch and gluten, which are in little contact with water, (D) exchanging protons of water, starch, gluten, egg proteins and sugar and (E) protons of lipids from margarine and egg yolk. In a next chapter, electrical resistance (ER) heating was used to produce cakes with minimal moisture gradients. In the further experimental work, this technique was applied to study processes other than moisture migration during storage of cakes. The baking process in an <b>electrical</b> resistance <b>oven</b> (ERO) was first compared with that in a conventional oven. In an ERO, the structure setting of cakes, which is the result of both starch and egg gel formation, progressively and uniformly takes place throughout the entire cake batter and ultimately results in homogeneous cake crumb. For conventional cakes, a batter moisture content of 26. 9 % was sufficient to gelatinize all starch in the center crumb. More moisture evaporation during baking in the ERO resulted in the need to increase the batter moisture content to 30. 0 % to allow all starch to gelatinize in these cakes (further referred to as ERO cakes). Minimal temperature gradients during baking in the ERO resulted in cakes with minimal moisture gradients. Furthermore, starch gelatinization and protein network formation by covalent linkage formation occurred in a similar way during both conventional and ERO baking. All in all, ERO baking allows producing homogeneous cake samples, with starch and protein properties {{similar to those of the}} center of conventional cakes. Only in the outer crumb layer, i. e. at a distance of up to 1 cm from the side walls in the ERO, starch and protein properties may be slightly different because of the small temperature gradient close to the surface. Moisture migration from crumb to crust contributes to firmingof crumb of conventional cakes and evidently not to that of ERO cakes. DSC and 1 H NMR measurements showed that the contribution of amylopectin retrogradation to crumb firming was rather small but significant in both cake types. To further study the importance of amylopectin retrogradation for pound cake crumb firming, amylases were included in the recipe. The texture of the resultant ERO cakes was monitored during storage. First, activity of amylases with varying modes of action, i. e. maltogenic, maltotetraose forming and endo-amylases, was measured in different sucrose concentrations and at different temperatures. To work properly during cake baking, the amylases should be active at high temperature (85 &# 176;C) and in high sucrose concentrations. Our results showed that the maltotetraose forming amylase was the least sensitive to both high temperature and high sucrose concentrations. Based on the results, different amylases with varying working mechanisms, i. e. two maltogenic amylases, an endo-amylase and a maltotetraose forming amylase, were selected for cake making and enzyme dosages appropriate for cake making were determined based on dose-response curves for cake volume. In the last part of this study, the amylases selected in the previous chapter were added to the recipe of ERO cakes in doses determined as described above. The crumb texture evolution of these cakes during storage was monitored and related to changes in amylopectin retrogradation and proton mobility. The impact of amylases on cake firming during storage depends on their mode of action and the effects on cake crumb firming resemble those found for bread crumb firming. Since starch in cake batter is much more diluted than in bread dough, and because of the high levels of sugar in cake batter, it is hypothesized that starch in pound cake is present in more or less intact swollen granules, surrounded by a limited amount of leached amylose, and embedded in a protein network. Exo-amylases limit crystallization of the side chains of amylopectin inside the granular structures. In contrast, endo-amylases had only a limited impact on amylopectin retrogradation. The anti-firming effect of exo-amylases was more pronounced than that of endo-amylases in line with what is known for bread systems. All in all, we conclude that some exo-amylases are effective anti-firming agents in cake. Their anti-firming properties very likely result from inhibition of amylopectin retrogradation. Although amylopectin retrogradation was reduced to a great extent in cakes baked with (some) amylases, crumb firming of these cakes was much less affected. Therefore, we conclude that the firming of ERO cakes during storage is also influenced by processes other than amylopectin retrogradation. In conclusion, comparison of the changes in crumb properties of conventional and ERO cakes during storage allowed putting forward a crumb firming mechanism maintaining that crumb to crust moisture migration is the dominant and amylopectin retrogradation is only a minor factor in cake crumb firming. Further work will be needed to unravel the role of other components such as amylose, protein and lipids in cake crumb firming during storage. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Neste trabalho foi estudado o efeito da introdução de energia de microondas no assamento de biscoito semi-doce duro, no gradiente de umidade, incidência de quebra, qualidade sensorial, medidas instrumentais de cor e textura e medidas físicas de diâmetro, espessura, fator de expansão, perda de peso, volume e densidade. Inicialmente foi utilizado um planejamento fatorial completo para os tempos de exposição em microondas de 15, 20, 30 e 40 segundos nas potências alta e média, após o assamento convencional dos biscoitos (2400 C por 4 minutos), visando avaliar o comportamento do gradiente de umidade e umidade global dos mesmos. A partir da análise do modelo ajustado ao primeiro fatorial selecionou-se um segundo plano fatorial com tempos de exposição de 23 e 29 segundos nas potências alta e média de microondas, para proceder às análises tecnológicas do produto. Os biscoitos resultantes destes tratamentos apresentaram redução significativa (p produto padrão, e a textura (dureza) daqueles foi significativamente menor (1207. 59 g) comparada ao padrão (1601. 35 g). O valor de fator de expansão (DIE) para biscoitos padrão (11. 3) foi significativamente maior do que o tratamento com microondas (10. 7), mostrando que á energia de microondas exerce um efeito de encolhimento no produto. Com relação à perda de peso, os resultados evidenciaram que a retirada da umidade {{residual}} pela ação das microondas aumenta a perda de peso do produto (de 0. 910 para 0. 956). No entanto, a diferença de peso não foi suficiente para distinguir as amostras (padrão e microondas) com relação à densidade. Portanto, concluímos que a introdução da energia de microondas no pós-assamento de biscoitos foi capaz de eliminar o problema de fissura do produto através da diminuição do gradiente de umidade dos mesmos, preservando sua qualidade sensorial e alterando muito pouco as propriedades físicas do produto. In this work, {{the effect}} of the introduction of microwave energy in the post-baking of hard semi-sweet biscuits, on humidity gradient, incidence of checking, sensory profile, instrumental measurements of colour and texture, and physical diameter, thickness, expansion ratio, loss of weight, volume and density was studied. A complete factorial plan was used initially at 15, 20, 30 and 40 seconds with high and medium power of microwaves in the post-baking (240 °C/ 4 min) of biscuits, in order to evaluate the humidity gradient and global humidity. Based on this first factorial ajusted model a second plan was selected at 23 and 29 seconds of high and medium microwave power exposure, in order to carry out a complete analysis of the products. The resulting biscuits showed a significant reduction (p< 0. 05) in the humidity gradient and percent of checking, and showed no significant sensory difference with respect to the standard product. The texture analyses showed no difference between the treatments, but all were less hard than the standard: With respect to colour, the products submitted to medium microwave power exposure (23 and 29 sec.) did not differ significantly from the standard, but those exposed to high microwave energy (23 and 29 sec.) did not differ from each other but were different from the standard. The biscuits baked in a conventional <b>oven</b> (<b>electrical</b> heating) at 240 °C/ 4 min and subsequently dried with medium microwave power for 29 sec, showed a significant reduction in the humidity gradient (from 2. 16 % to 0. 88 %) and in the incidence of checking (from 41. 7 %to 0 %). The instrumental measurement of colour (L parameter) of the biscuits (combined, process) was significantly (p< 0. 05) equal to the standard sample and that of texture (hardness) was lower (1207. 59 g) then the standard (1601. 35 g). The expansion ratio of the standard sample. (11. 3) was significantly higher than the combined process sample (10. 7), showing a shrinkage effect due to the microwave energy. With respect to weight losses, the results showed us that the residual humidity removal by the action of microwaves increased the product weight loss (from 0. 912 to 0. 956 g). However, the weight difference was not sufficient to differenciate the samples. It was concluded that the introduction of microwave energy in the pot-baking of the biscuits could solve the checking problem through a decrease in the humidity gradient, without causing any sensory changes or notable alterations in the physical properties of the product...|$|R
