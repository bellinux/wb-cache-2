40|$|To {{explore the}} {{challenges}} and opportunities for pain management <b>for</b> <b>animals</b> <b>used</b> in research an interview study with 9 veterinarians, 3 veterinarian-scientists and 9 scientists, all engaged in animal-based studies in Canada, was carried out.

Diverse views were identified regarding the ease of recognizing when animals are in pain and whether animals hide pain. Evidence of inconsistencies in pain management across laboratories, institutions and species were also identified. Clarification of the interactions between scientific objectives and pain management are needed, {{as well as a}} stronger evidence base for pain management approaches.

50|$|The Agadez-Bilma route, {{passing through}} the Ténéré desert and the oasis town of Fachi, takes around three weeks to {{complete}} (both ways). It is traditionally a twice yearly caravan from {{the capital of the}} Aïr region to the natron salt pans along the string of oases formed by the Kaouar cliffs. Food and supplies were carried from Agadez each November and March and traded for bricks of salt, condensed in the natron pits of oasis towns, and to a lesser extent, dates and vegetables.

5000|$|The {{combination}} milbemycin oxime/lufenuron (trade names Sentinel Flavor Tabs, by Novartis Animal Health, and Program plus) is {{a parasite}} control drug {{in which the}} active ingredient, milbemycin oxime, eliminates worms, while a second active ingredient, lufenuron, arrests the development of eggs and larvae, preventing them from maturing and continuing the infestation of an animal. This combination is registered <b>for</b> <b>animal</b> <b>use</b> only. To achieve efficacy, the treatment is administered once monthly, together with food, in a dosage suitable for {{the weight of the}} affected animal. The usual ratio is 500 µg milbemycin oxime and 10 mg lufenuron/kg body weight. Novartis indicates the proper dosage by color-coding the packages.|$|E

50|$|Debate {{about the}} ethical use {{of animals in}} {{research}} dates {{at least as far}} back as 1822 when the British Parliament enacted the first law for animal protection preventing cruelty to cattle. This was followed by the Cruelty to Animals Act of 1835 and 1849, which criminalized ill-treating, over-driving, and torturing animals. In 1876, under pressure from the National Anti-Vivisection Society, the Cruelty to Animals Act was amended to include regulations governing the use of animals in research. This new act stipulated that 1) experiments must be proven absolutely necessary for instruction, or to save or prolong human life; 2) animals must be properly anesthetized; and 3) animals must be killed as soon as the experiment is over. Today, these three principles are central to the laws and guidelines governing the use of animals and research. In the U.S., the Animal Welfare Act of 1970 (see also Laboratory Animal Welfare Act) set standards <b>for</b> <b>animal</b> <b>use</b> and care in research. This law is enforced by APHIS’s Animal Care program.|$|E
50|$|The central {{importance}} of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees means that animal care and use is fundamentally {{dependent on the}} application of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals regulations by an institution’s committee. It has been suggested that one measure {{of the success of the}} IACUC system is the reliability of protocol approvals between institutions. In other words, would a protocol <b>for</b> <b>animal</b> <b>use,</b> approved by the IACUC at one institution, be approved at another institution? This question was addressed specifically by researchers Plous and Herzog in 2001: They concluded that, regardless of whether the research involved terminal or painful procedures, IACUC protocol reviews did not exceed chance levels of intercommittee agreement. The Plous and Herzog work was criticized by some in the animal research community as drawing invalid conclusions because IACUCs rely on knowing the experience of the investigators and staff. The Plous and Herzog study compared responses of in-house IACUCs, who knew the investigators and staff, with blinded IACUCs, who did not know the investigators and staff. The blinded IACUCs did not necessarily have expertise in the species or procedures under consideration, or with the forms used to submit the protocol, and most of the lack of agreement between the non-blinded and blinded IACUC ratings took the form of requests for more information.|$|E
