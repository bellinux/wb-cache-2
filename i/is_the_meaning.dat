25|$|The {{positional}} decimal {{system is}} presently universally used in human writing. The base1000 {{is also used}} (albeit not universally), by grouping the digits and considering a sequence of three decimal digits as a single digit.

25|$|The {{foundation}} of this theory is {{the concepts of}} text and conversation. Text {{is defined as the}} content of interaction, or what is said in an interaction. Text <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> made available to individuals through a face-to-face or electronic mode of communication. Conversation is defined as what is happening behaviorally between two or more participants in the communication process. Conversation is the exchange or interaction itself.|$|E

25|$|Many semi-miraculous mythical tales were woven around Hafez {{after his}} death. It {{is said that}} by {{listening}} to his father's recitations, Hafez had accomplished the task of learning the Quran by heart {{at an early age}} (that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the word Hafez). At the same time, he is said to have known by heart the works of Rumi (Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi), Saadi, Farid ud-Din, and Nizami.|$|E
25|$|The {{meaning of}} the word is not {{confined}} to male prostitutes. According to Malick (op cit), when malakos is employed in reference to sexual relationships of men with men, it is not a technical term for male call-boys in a pederastic setting. The term may mean effeminate with respect to boys or men who take the role of a woman in homosexual relationships. Nor <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the word confined to sexually exploited males.|$|E

25|$|One {{frequent}} {{source of}} confusion <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of temperature in MD. Commonly we have experience with macroscopic temperatures, which involve {{a huge number}} of particles. But temperature is a statistical quantity. If there is a large enough number of atoms, statistical temperature can be estimated from the instantaneous temperature, which is found by equating the kinetic energy of the system to nkBT/2 where n is the number of degrees of freedom of the system.|$|E

Peter Swift, a designer with experience of adapting Japanese garden design principles to the British environment and climate, conceived the garden as a place of quiet contemplation and meditation as well as a functional space complementary to the gallery and its artistic activities.|$|E

25|$|If a {{constitution}} {{is to be}} interpreted {{in light of the}} evolving standards of decency, why, in most democratic countries, should the highest authority of judicial branch (e.g., the Supreme Court in U.S.) be the ones to have the final say over its interpretation? Is not the legislative branch which is elected, thereby more likely {{to be in touch with}} the current standards of decency, and therefore better placed to make such judgments? If originalism is wrong, then Marbury v. Madison—which holding underpins judicial review of constitutionality, that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the constitution—was wrongly decided, and two centuries of jurisprudence relying on it is thereby on shaky ground.|$|E
25|$|Subtitle {{translation}} can {{be different}} from the translation of written text. Usually, during the process of creating subtitles for a film or television program, the picture and each sentence of the audio are analyzed by the subtitle translator; also, the subtitle translator {{may or may not have}} access to a written transcript of the dialog. Especially in the field of commercial subtitles, the subtitle translator often interprets what is meant, rather than translating the manner in which the dialog is stated; that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> is more important than the form—the audience does not always appreciate this, as it can be frustrating for people who are familiar with some of the spoken language; spoken language may contain verbal padding or culturally implied meanings that cannot be conveyed in the written subtitles. Also, the subtitle translator may also condense the dialog to achieve an acceptable reading speed, whereby purpose is more important than form.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years, {{they were more}} {{interested}} in the acoustics of speech. For instance, they were looking at the differences between /ba/ or /da/, but now research has been directed to the response in the brain from the stimuli. In recent years, there has been a model developed {{to create a sense of}} how speech perception works; this model is known as the Dual Stream Model. This model has drastically changed from how psychologists look at perception. The first section of the Dual Stream Model is the ventral pathway. This pathway incorporates middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal sulcus and perhaps the inferior temporal gyrus. The ventral pathway shows phonological representations to the lexical or conceptual representations, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the words. The second section of the Dual Stream Model is the dorsal pathway. This pathway includes the sylvian parietotemporal, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, and premotor cortex. Its primary function is to take the sensory or phonological stimuli and transfer it into an articulatory-motor representation (formation of speech).|$|E

25|$|Tabari writes, “God created Adam {{with his}} own hands so that God could say to Iblis (Satan) that he was exalting himself over that which God formed {{with his own}} hands. So God created Adam as a human and his body was from clay. God breathed his spirit into Adam. Then when God’s spirit entered his eyes he saw the fruits of Paradise and when it entered his stomach he was hungry, so before the spirit reached his feet {{he tried to get}} up in haste to have the fruits of Paradise. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of God’s word: “Man was created in haste” (21:37) In regards to the testing of Adam and Eve, Ibn Ishaq writes, “Iblis started off by crying for Adam and Eve, and they became sad when they heard him. They asked him why he was crying and he said, “I am crying for you because you will die and be forced to give up the luxury and plenty you are enjoying.” Then Iblis went to them and whispered saying, “Adam, may I lead you to the Tree of Immortality and to a kingdom that does not decline?” (20:120) Meaning that they might become angels or live forever in Paradise. In the Qur'an it states, “When we took from the prophets their {{covenant}} from you, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a solemn covenant” (Q 33:7) That covenant was, as quoted by Ibn Abbas “The Prophet Muhammad said, “God took a covenant from the back of Adam on the day of ‘Arafat. He caused all of his offspring to come out of him, and spread them out in front of him. In regards to Adam’s death, Tabari writes, “When Adam died it was Friday. The angels came to him, sent by God from Paradise, to embalm and wrap him, and they honored his son and heir Seth. Ibn Ishaq says: The sun and the moon were eclipsed for seven days and nights.|$|E

500|$|Meeting Venus (1991), {{the first}} of several English-language films {{directed}} by Szabó—and his first comedy—is based on his experience directing Tannhäuser at the Paris Opera in 1984.

500|$|An {{alternative}} theory, {{which has}} gained only limited acceptance among professional scholars, derives the name Arthur from Arcturus, {{the brightest star}} in the constellation Boötes, near Ursa Major or the Great Bear. Classical Latin Arcturus would also have become Art(h)ur when borrowed into Welsh, and its brightness and position in the sky led people to regard it as the [...] "guardian of the bear" [...] (which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the name in Ancient Greek) and the [...] "leader" [...] of the other stars in Boötes.|$|E
500|$|The book {{features}} {{two major}} religions: the Handdara, an informal system reminiscent of Taoism and Buddhism, and the Yomeshta or Meshe's cult, a close-to-monotheistic religion {{based on the}} idea of absolute knowledge of the entirety of time attained in one visionary instant by Meshe, who was originally a Foreteller of the Handdara, when attempting to answer the question: [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of life?" [...] The Handdara is the more ancient, and dominant in Karhide, while Yomesh is the official religion in Orgoreyn. The differences between them underlie political distinctions between the countries and cultural distinctions between their inhabitants. Estraven is revealed to be an adept of the Handdara.|$|E
500|$|Philosophy of {{economics}} is {{the branch of}} philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to economics. It can also {{be defined as the}} branch {{of economics}} which studies its own foundations and morality. It can be categorized into three central topics. The first concerns the definition and scope of economics and by what methods it should be studied and whether these methods {{rise to the level of}} epistemic reliability associated with the other special sciences. For example, is it possible to research economics in such a way that it is value-free, establishing facts that are independent of the normative views of the researcher? The second topic <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> and implications of rationality. For example, can buying lottery tickets (increasing the riskiness of your income) at the same time as buying insurance (decreasing the riskiness of your income) be rational? The third topic is the normative evaluation of economic policies and outcomes. What criteria should be used to determine whether a given public policy is beneficial for society? ...|$|E
