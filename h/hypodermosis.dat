40|$|CDATA[Hypodermosis {{is a very}} {{important}} disease affecting cattle, yaks and dairy cattle in China. Five species of <b>hypodermosis</b> have been recognized in livestock: H. bovis, H. lineatum, H. sinense, H. qinghaiensis, H. diana. Of these five species, the most common ones are H. bovis and H. lineatum. Both of these two species and H. sinense parasitise cattle, yak and dairy cattle. Deer is the natural host of H. diana. The host of H. qinghaiensis remains unknown. Bovine <b>hypodermosis</b> is widely distributed in China and the endemic areas covers 15 provinces. In some province, the average infestation rate is 80 % and the infection rate of calves at age of 1 - 2 years old is higher than adult, and reaches 90 - 100 %. The epidemiology of the disease is still poorly understood in some provinces. The national economic loss induced by <b>hypodermosis</b> is largely unknown, though some data on reduction of milk, meat and damage of skins are available. Losses caused by the migrating larvae themselves are responsible for the greater part of the cost of disease. In northern China, the annual economic loss on skins is estimated to be about 15, 000, 000 USD. Diagnosis of Hypoderma sp infection in live cattle relies on either observation of clinical signs or the palpation of second and third stage larvae on back of infected animals during the spring and summer months, and serological diagnostic tool is not available. There is no national eradication program in China. In most cases, the control of <b>hypodermosis</b> was based on the chemotherapy administrated by farmers themselves. The priority and suggestion on control of <b>hypodermosis</b> is also presented. ]]...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hypodermosis</b> is a myiasis {{of cattle}} mainly {{found in the}} Northern Hemisphere. In Italy it has been {{reported}} primarily in southern regions with a farm prevalence reaching a peak of 85 %, while few data are available in the north of the country. This paper reports the results of a serological survey carried out on <b>hypodermosis</b> in Vicenza province (northeastern Italy). During January and February 1999, bulk milk samples were collected from 224 dairy farms and tested, using an <b>hypodermosis</b> ELISA kit. Epidemiological data, such as farm location, herd size, number of cows, grazing management, treatments against Hypoderma larvae, presence of imported animals, were gathered and statistically analysed in relation to the serological results. In 15 farms the presence of warbles was monitored by manual palpation and larvae collected for identification. Ninety-seven (43. 3 %) samples were detected as positive, whereas 12 (5. 4 %) and 115 (51. 3 %) were inconclusive and negative, respectively. Thirteen farms were positive upon parasitological examination and the larvae collected were identified as Hypoderma bovis. Seroprevalence was highly correlated with the practice of free grazing and slightly, but significantly, correlated with the number of cows on the farm. The mean antibody level of positive herds was significantly higher on farms without imported animals. On farms with warbled animals there was a high inverse correlation between antibody level and quantity of milk in the tanks and the number of lactating cows.

40|$|Pasteurised and ultra high {{temperature}} (UHT) -treated milk were tested {{over the period}} November 1997 -February 1998 in order to evaluate the applicability of an <b>hypodermosis</b> ELISA test on commercial milk samples. Milk samples from six dairy companies were analysed {{and the development of}} anti-Hypoderma antibodies recorded for the period from September 1998 to June 1999. For one dairy (no. 3) bulk milk samples were also obtained from the tankers, transporting milk away from the farms, and analysed; the results were compared to the parasitological status of the cows whose milk had been collected on the farms. Out of 32 pasteurised samples tested, 23 were positive, exceeding the cut-off (22 %), while 9 samples were negative. UHT milk was always negative. The antibody levels in milk samples from four of the six companies were highest during January and decreased gradually during February to May 1999. The bulk milk samples also had high antibody levels and 47. 2 % of milk producing cows had lesions of <b>hypodermosis.</b> It was concluded that testing commercial milk for antibodies is an efficient way of detecting the presence of <b>hypodermosis</b> in cattle, especially in those countries for which no data on this disease are available. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|<b>Hypodermosis,</b> {{caused by}} warble fly Przhevalskiana silenus (Order: Diptera, Family: Oestridae), is an endemic {{parasitic}} infestation of goats in Pakistan. The larvae of this fly, obligatory parasite of their hosts, are economically very important causing severe losses to leather industry. This infestation is {{also responsible for}} growth retardation, carcass depreciation and production losses in milk and meat. Keeping in view {{the importance of this}} infestation, studies were designed on serodiagnosis, epidemiology and economic importance of <b>hypodermosis</b> in goats in northern uplands of Balochistan, Pakistan, with the objectives to diagnose warble fly infestation at early stages through serology for better control and eradication strategies, to study different epidemiological factors (age, sex, breed, temperature, humidity and rain fall) contributing goat warble fly infestation, to compare seroprevalence over the prevalence based on clinical examination and to study the economic importance of <b>hypodermosis</b> in the study area. The duration of the study was one year (April 2011 to March 2012) and the most prevalent breed of goat i. e. khurasani breed in uplands of Balochistan was involved in the study which was compared with the non-descriptive breed of goat. In the first experiment, a total of 1440 sera samples were processed by commercial ELISA kit (IDEXX <b>hypodermosis</b> serum antibody test) method. The infestation was detected in May (summer) while the infestation is usually detected in the months of October until February (winter) by clinical palpation method when warbles appear {{on the backs of the}} animals. ELISA based seroprevalence showed the highest mean percentage (48. 45 % Â± 16. 14) of goat <b>hypodermosis.</b> In the second experiment on epidemiology, the mean percentage was 15. 94 % Â± 5. 65 by clinical palpation method in the field. In the slaughter house and skin market studies, the mean percentages were 9. 07 % Â± 3. 90 and 7. 16 % Â± 3. 39, respectively, while the mean intensity was 16. 19 Â± 3. 04 holes per skin. Analysis of data by Pearson Chi-square test (Ã· 2), revealed highly significant differences (P 2 years of age groups whereas no significant difference (P< 0. 05) was observed sex-wise and breed-wise. The life cycle of warble fly in naturally infested goats was studied from April 2011 to March 2012. First instars larvae (L 1) were observed in subcutaneous tissues from mid of May to mid of July in slaughter houses of the study areas, second instars larvae (L 2) from mid of July to November and third instars larvae (L 3) were palpated in the field animals from December until the end of February. The pupal period was observed in early spring in the months from March to mid April while the adult fly activity season (Oviposition period) was observed in early summer from mid April to mid May. In the third experiment, the overall loss due to skin damages by warble fly infestation was calculated as Pak. Rupees 7578625. 49 (Pak. Rs. 7. 57 million = US$ 77530. 69, US$ 1 = Rs. 97. 75) annually. Based on the early detection studies, it is concluded and recommended that the best time for the treatment of goat warble fly infestation in uplands of Balochistan is in the months of June and July when first larval instars are still in migratory stage and not yet have caused damage to the skin while the farmers usually treat their animals against warble fly in the winter season when they observe the warbles on the back of the animals but at that stage the larvae have damaged the skins of the animals...|$|E

40|$|The {{prophylactic}} {{efficacy of}} microdoses of injectable and pour-on ivermectin formulations against larval stages of Przhevalskiana silenus was assessed in naturally infected goats {{in the region}} of Calabria (southern Italy). Sixty-eight goats from two goat farms were divided into five groups: one group remained untreated, while the other four groups were treated with microdoses of ivermectin (5 and 10 microg/kg injectable formulation and 10 and 20 microg/kg pour-on formulation). The microdoses of ivermectin were fully effective in the treatment of goat warble fly infestation (GWFI) as no larvae emerged from the warbles in the treated groups, while all the larvae emerged in the control groups. Irrespective of the type of formulation used, the difference between the treated groups and the control group was statistically significant (P< 0. 001). By contrast, no statistical {{differences were found between the}} goats treated with the injectable formulation and those receiving the pour-on applications, and between the two doses of the injectable and pour-on formulations used. Given the plasma concentrations it attains at its lowest dose (0. 052 - 0. 042 ng/ml for the injectable formulation and 0. 030 ng/ml for the pour-on) the injectable formulation seems to offer the most reliable route for the administration of ivermectin microdoses and it is acceptable for milk consumption. The introduction of ivermectin in the early eighties and the use of microdoses in some cases have made it possible to control cattle <b>hypodermosis</b> in large areas of Europe. As with cattle <b>hypodermosis,</b> the administration of ivermectin microdoses in goats is particularly interesting because of the low costs involved and the low levels of residues found in goat milk; it may thus constitute the basis for GWFI control campaigns in areas where the disease is prevalent...|$|E

The following summary represents a synthesis of a symposium presented at the 19 th International Conference of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology, New Orleans, USA, 10 - 14 August 2003. The coverage began with a review of the need for more subtle economic analysis of the impact of myiasis based {{on the use of the}} sterile insect technique (SIT) for control of bovine <b>hypodermosis</b> in North America. This was followed by a review of the status of chemical control with particular emphasis on the macrocyclic lactones. The outcome of the use of these compounds in a regulated control program for eradication of bovine <b>hypodermosis</b> in EU was surveyed. Similarly, the success of the screwworm eradication program, using the sterile insect technique has shown how effective this approach can be given the appropriate target. Several aspects of the development of newer approaches were surveyed in discussion of newer chemical control products, development of vaccines, use of host genetics, use of predictive simulation modelling and trapping for monitoring and control and the development of new diagnostic approaches for occult infestations. Finally, use of the latest molecular tools for identification of larvae causing myiasis and their use for the identification of species coming from different and distant geographical areas to colonize regions where they have been eradicated was reviewed.

The cattle came from three collection sites in Northern (site A), Central (site B) and Southern (site C) Albania. Milk samples were collected monthly from four animals from October 2002 to May 2003 during the lactating period. The animals were also clinically examined {{for the presence of}} warbles by manual palpation from April to July 2003 and 2004 and third instar larvae were collected and morphologically identified.

Recently, a sixth species, Hypoderma sinense Pleske, has been rediscovered but the endogenous migration pathway within the host body is completely unknown and it represents a major constraint for the control of larval infection. In December 2003 a total of 165 larval stages of Hypoderma spp. were collected from different anatomical sites of 40 yaks slaughtered at an abattoir in the province of Gansu, China. The morphological characters and size of the recovered larvae were used to infer migratory routes and 45 specimens were also subjected to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of cox 1 mtDNA and amplicons sequenced. All the larvae molecularly processed were identified as H. sinense and sequence identity was confirmed by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) tool carried out using BfaI and HinfI endonucleases. The finding of H. sinense larvae only in the oesophagus or both in oesophagus and subcutaneous tissue of 12 and 15 animals, respectively, indicates that H. sinense larvae migrate through the oesophagus similarly to Hypoderma lineatum (De Villers). The description of the endogenous life cycle of H. sinense will help to determine the timing of specific treatment programmes to guarantee the improvement of animal welfare and health, thus resulting in an increase in livestock production in China. © 2006 The Royal Entomological Society...|$|E
