50|$|<b>Investment</b> <b>controlling</b> {{is an area}} of {{activity}} {{that is part of the}} overall controlling process within the asset management and is an important component of the recurring investment decision making process. From an asset management company point of view, in general <b>investment</b> <b>controlling</b> is defined as information management that gathers, processes, checks and distributes information necessary to meet the overall objectives of the asset management company. In this respect the <b>investment</b> <b>controlling</b> objective consists in configuring the infrastructure - particularly within the framework of the investment decision making process - in such a way that the processes (e.g. forecasting, decision making and implementation), the quality and the results (e.g. returns), the risks (e.g. of using derivatives) and the costs become more transparent and comprehensible. Considering the client perspective, in the following <b>investment</b> <b>controlling</b> is in general defined as independent monitoring of the performance of asset management products and/or accounts with the aim of ensuring that the client gets what was promised in the first place with respect to quality and performance.|$|R

40|$|We study {{an optimal}} <b>investment</b> <b>control</b> problem for an {{insurance}} company. The surplus process follows the Cramer-Lundberg process with perturbation of a Brownian motion. The company can invest its surplus into a risk free asset and a Black-Scholes risky asset. The optimization {{objective is to}} minimize the probability of ruin. We show by new operators that the minimal ruin probability function is a classical solution to the corresponding HJB equation. Asymptotic behaviors of the optimal <b>investment</b> <b>control</b> policy and the minimal ruin probability function are studied for low surplus levels with a general claim size distribution. Some new asymptotic results for large surplus levels in the case with exponential claim distributions are obtained. We consider two cases of <b>investment</b> <b>control</b> - unconstrained investment and investment with a limited amount. Comment: 23 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of ruin {{probability}} minimization under various <b>investment</b> <b>control</b> and reinsurance schemes. We first look at the minimization of ruin probabilities in the models in which the surplus process is a continuous diffusion process in which we employ stochastic control to find the optimal policies for reinsurance and investment. We then focus on the case in which the surplus process is modeled via a classical Lundberg process, i. e.  the claims process is compound Poisson. There, the optimal reinsurance policy is derived from the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.
