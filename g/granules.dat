5|$|C. elegans is an unsegmented pseudocoelomate, and lacks a {{respiratory}} and a circulatory system. It possesses gut <b>granules</b> which emit {{a brilliant}} blue fluorescence, {{a wave of}} which is seen at death in a 'death fluorescence'.|$|E
5|$|Fordyce spots, or Fordyce <b>granules,</b> are ectopic sebaceous glands {{found on}} the {{genitals}} and oral mucosa. They show themselves as yellowish-white milia (milk spots).|$|E
5|$|Some {{bacteria}} produce intracellular nutrient storage <b>granules</b> {{for later}} use, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Certain bacterial species, {{such as the}} photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vacuoles, vesicles which they use to regulate their buoyancy—allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. The gas vacuoles are freely permeable to gas. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artefacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions {{are considered to be}} nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin <b>granules</b> are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These <b>granules</b> are called metachromatic <b>granules</b> due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or toluidine blue.Microcompartments are widespread, membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes. Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation. Magnetosomes are bacterial microcompartments, present in magnetotactic bacteria, that contain magnetic crystals.|$|E

40|$|Sweet {{potato starch}} was {{modified}} by cross-linking, hydroxypropylation, and combined cross-linking and hydroxypropylation, and the starches were subsequently sieved to obtain differently sized <b>granule</b> fractions. The effects of <b>granule</b> size of native and modified sweet potato starch fractions and all fractions were investigated {{with respect to}} their physicochemical properties. The large-size <b>granule</b> fraction (27 – 30 µm) showed a 16 – 20 % higher chemical phosphorylation and a 4 – 7 % higher hydroxypropylation than the small-size <b>granule</b> fraction (14 – 16 µm). The large-size <b>granule</b> fractions of native and modified sweet potato starches showed lower transition temperatures (0. 7 – 3. 1 °C for peak temperature of gelatinization) and lower enthalpy changes (0. 6 – 1. 9 J/g) during gelatinization than the small-size <b>granule</b> fractions, making the sweet potato starch different from cereal starches. The large-size <b>granule</b> fraction of native starch showed a higher paste viscosity (78 – 244 cP) than the corresponding small-size <b>granule</b> fraction. In addition, cross-linking and hydroxypropylation affected the paste viscosity of the large-size <b>granule</b> fraction significantly more than that of the small-size <b>granule</b> fraction when compared to the corresponding parental starch fractions. The large-size <b>granule</b> fraction of native and dual-modified starches showed a lower syneresis after freeze–thaw treatments than the small-size <b>granule</b> fractions. The difference in swelling power between large- and small-size <b>granule</b> fractions was not significant. In general, the large-size <b>granule</b> fraction of sweet potato starch was more susceptible for cross-linking and hydroxypropylation and the physicochemical properties were changed to a higher extent compared to the corresponding small-size <b>granule</b> fraction...|$|R
5|$|Catecholamine {{release is}} {{stimulated by the}} {{activation}} of the sympathetic nervous system. Splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous system innervate the medulla of the adrenal gland. When activated, it evokes the release of catecholamines from the storage <b>granules</b> by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|In small-cell lung {{carcinoma}} (SCLC), {{the cells}} contain dense neurosecretory <b>granules</b> (vesicles containing neuroendocrine hormones), which give this tumor an endocrine/paraneoplastic syndrome association. Most cases {{arise in the}} larger airways (primary and secondary bronchi). Sixty to seventy percent have extensive disease (which cannot be targeted within a single radiation therapy field) at presentation.|$|E
5|$|The asci are 400–500 by 12–14µm, cylindrical, and operculate. The ascospores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical with rounded ends, uniseriate, hyaline, {{and measure}} 26–40 by 10–12µm. They contain two large oil drops at either end; the oil drops are useful taxonomic characters {{that may be}} used to help distinguish S.dudleyi from some other Sarcoscypha species. The spores are covered with a sheath of mucilage, which typically causes the eight spores of the ascus to be ejected together. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal end cells in the hymenium) are slender, slightly enlarged above, and contain numerous red <b>granules.</b> The <b>granules</b> contain carotenoid pigments such as plectaniaxanthine or beta carotene, and give the fruit body its color.|$|E
5000|$|The {{final stage}} of <b>granule</b> cell {{maturation}} occurs in the IGL. The <b>granule</b> cells express {{a different set of}} mature receptors at this stage including, GC5 and GABA receptors. New cells also make contact with the <b>granule</b> cells. Mossy fibers, which are mostly found in the precerebellar nuclei, make contact with <b>granule</b> cells in the IGL. <b>Granule</b> neurons also extend out to make contacts with Golgi cells.|$|R
50|$|<b>Granule</b> {{cells are}} also subject to {{feedback}} inhibition: Golgi cells receive excitatory stimuli from <b>granule</b> cells {{and in turn}} send back inhibitory signals to the <b>granule</b> cell.|$|R

5|$|The {{generic name}} is a {{combination}} of the Latin prefix semi, meaning half, and noun cassis, meaning helmet. The specific name of this taxon, granulata, is derived from the Latin noun grana meaning grain. Here it is used in the diminutive form, meaning granulated, or covered in <b>granules,</b> i.e. small grains or pellets, referring to the shell sculpture.|$|E
5|$|The mature {{mycelium}} {{consists of}} thin-walled, densely packed hyphae that are 1.5–3.2µm in diameter. They are often gnarled or somewhat spiral (subhelicoid), and frequently branched {{at an angle}} of about 45°, with a clamp {{at the base of}} the branch. They contain amorphous <b>granules</b> that appear refractive when viewed under phase contrast microscopy, and their walls are often encrusted with tiny <b>granules.</b> Gloeocystidia (thin-walled cystidia with refractive, frequently granular contents) are common; they measure 50–85 by 6.5–8.5µm, and are club-shaped (sometimes elongated), thin-walled, and often have one or two lobes with rounded tips. Containing foamy and pale yellow contents, they are a refractive yellow color under phase contrast. Initially they are erect but they soon fall under their own weight to lie on the agar surface. Crystalline deposits are abundant as small, randomly scattered plate-like or star-like crystals.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{translucent}} (hyaline), roughly spherical, thin-walled and smooth, with {{dimensions of}} 6–8µm in diameter. The asci, the spore-bearing cells, are cylindrical and 80–100 by 7–8µm; the paraphyses are thin and filamentous and contain orange <b>granules.</b> Edibility {{has not been}} recorded for this fungus.|$|E
40|$|Wet <b>granule</b> {{breakage}} {{can occur}} in the granulation process, particularly in granulators with high agitation forces, such as high-shear mixers. In this paper, the <b>granule</b> breakage is studied in a breakage only high-shear mixer. <b>Granule</b> pellets made from different formulations with precisely controlled porosity and binder saturation were placed in a high-shear mixer in which the bulk medium is a non-granulating cohesive sand mixture. After subjecting the pellets to different mixing time in the granulator, the numbers of whole pellets without breakage are counted and taken {{as a measure of}} <b>granule</b> breakage. The experimental results showed that binder saturation, binder viscosity and surface tension as well as the primary powder size have significant influence on <b>granule</b> breakage behaviour. It is postulated that <b>granule</b> breakage is closely related to the <b>granule</b> yield strength, which can be calculated from a simple equation which includes both the capillary and viscous force of the liquid bridges in the <b>granule.</b> The Stokes deformation number calculated from the impact velocity and the <b>granule</b> dynamic strength gives a good prediction of whether the <b>granule</b> of certain formulation will break or not. The model is completely based on the physical properties of the formulations such as binder viscosity, surface tension, binder saturation, <b>granule</b> porosity and particle size as well as particle shape...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Granule</b> neurons {{have high}} levels of the {{neuronal}} isoform of nitric oxide synthase. This enzyme is dependent on the presence of calcium and is responsible for the production of nitric oxide (NO). This neurotransmitter is a negative regulator of <b>granule</b> cell precursor proliferation which promotes the differentiation of different <b>granule</b> cells. NO regulates interactions between <b>granule</b> cells and glia [...] and is essential for protecting the <b>granule</b> cells from damage. NO is also responsible for neuroplasticity and motor learning.|$|R
50|$|Loss of dentate gyrus neurons {{from the}} {{hippocampus}} results in spatial memory deficits. Therefore, dentate <b>granule</b> cells {{are thought to}} function {{in the formation of}} spatial memories.Immature and mature dentate <b>granule</b> cells have distinct roles in memory function. Adult-born <b>granule</b> cells are thought to be involved in pattern separation whereas old <b>granule</b> cells contribute to rapid pattern completion.|$|R
5|$|Variety frustosus is morphologically {{similar to}} the main type, but its cap becomes areolate (marked out into small areas by cracks and crevices) in maturity. Its spores are {{slightly}} smaller too, measuring 11–15 by 4–5.5µm. In the European form ereticulatus, the reticulations on the upper stipe are replaced with fine reddish <b>granules,</b> while the variety ruforubraporus has pinkish-red pores.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Entoloma, the fungus is {{classified}} in the subgenus Leptonia, section Cyanula because of its overall habit, clampless hyphae, and abundant <b>granules</b> of pigment. Noordeloos and Gates place it in the stirps (a grouping of related species within a genus) Austroprunicolor, characterized by mushrooms with a violaceous pink or blue cap that contrasts with a pallid, whitish, polished stipe.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in <b>granules.</b> Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
50|$|Cerebellar <b>granule</b> cells receive {{excitatory}} input from 3 or 4 mossy fibers originating from pontine nuclei. Mossy fibres make an excitatory connection onto <b>granule</b> cells which cause the <b>granule</b> cell to fire an action potential.|$|R
40|$|Cerebellar <b>granule</b> cell {{progenitors}} proliferate postnatally in {{the upper}} part of the external <b>granule</b> cell layer (EGL) of the cerebellum. Postmitotic <b>granule</b> cells differentiate and migrate, tangentially in the EGL and then radially through the molecular and Purkinje cell layers. The molecular control of the transition between proliferation and differentiation in cerebellar <b>granule</b> cells is poorly understood. We show here that the transmembrane receptor Plexin-B 2 is expressed by proliferating <b>granule</b> cell progenitors. To study Plexin-B 2 function, we generated a targeted mutation of mouse Plexin-B 2. Most Plexin-B 2 (-/-) mutants die at birth as a result of neural tube closure defects. Some mutants survive but their cerebellum cytoarchitecture is profoundly altered. This is correlated with a disorganization of the timing of <b>granule</b> cell proliferation and differentiation in the EGL. Many differentiated <b>granule</b> cells migrate inside the cerebellum and keep proliferating. These results reveal that Plexin-B 2 controls the balance between proliferation and differentiation in <b>granule</b> cells...|$|R
50|$|<b>Granule</b> {{cells in}} {{different}} brain regions are both functionally and anatomically diverse: {{the only thing}} they have in common is smallness. For instance, olfactory bulb <b>granule</b> cells are GABAergic and axonless, while <b>granule</b> cells in the dentate gyrus have glutamatergic projection axons. These two populations of <b>granule</b> cells are also the only major neuronal populations that undergo adult neurogenesis, while cerebellar and cortical <b>granule</b> cells do not.Granule cells (save for those of the olfactory bulb) have a structure typical of a neuron consisting of dendrites, a soma (cell body) and an axon.|$|R
5|$|In mass, {{the spores}} are whitish. The spores are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, devoid of oil {{droplets}} (eguttulate), and have dimensions of 13–18 by 7–9µm. They are thin walled and germinate and grow rapidly in vitro {{in the absence}} of external stimuli. The asci are 190–225 by 9–10µm. The paraphyses are slightly club-shaped, unbranched, and have irregular orange-brown <b>granules,</b> with tips up to 5µm wide, and are not forked or lobed. The hypothecium, the layer of cells below the hymenium, is made of densely packed, small irregular cells.|$|E
5|$|M.challengeri is {{considered}} {{to have the most}} primitive morphology of any species of Metanephrops, having even fewer novelties than the oldest known fossil species, M.rossensis. Its rostrum is longer than that of other species in the thomsoni species group, and the ridge along the midline of the carapace only has two small spines. Unlike some other species of Metanephrops, the carapace is smooth, as are the abdominal tergae, and the chelipeds are covered in fine <b>granules.</b>|$|E
5|$|Neutrophils {{also play}} a key role in the {{development}} of most forms of acute lung injury. Here, activated neutrophils release the contents of their toxic <b>granules</b> into the lung environment. Experiments have shown that a reduction in the number of neutrophils lessens the effects of acute lung injury, but treatment by inhibiting neutrophils is not clinically realistic, as it would leave the host vulnerable to infection. In the liver, damage by neutrophils can contribute to dysfunction and injury in response to the release of endotoxins produced by bacteria, sepsis, trauma, alcoholic hepatitis, ischemia, and hypovolemic shock resulting from acute hemorrhage.|$|E
50|$|The {{differences}} in mossy fibers that are sending {{signals to the}} <b>granule</b> cells directly effects the type of information that <b>granule</b> cells translate to Purkinje cells. The reliability of this translation {{will depend on the}} reliability of synaptic activity in <b>granule</b> cells and {{on the nature of the}} stimulus being received. The signal a <b>granule</b> cell receives from a Mossy fiber depends on the function of the mossy fiber itself. Therefore, <b>granule</b> cells are able to integrate information from the different mossy fibers and generate new patterns of activity.|$|R
50|$|The <b>granule</b> {{cells in}} the dorsal {{cochlear}} nucleus are small neurons {{with two or three}} short dendrites that give rise to a few branches with expansions at the terminals. The dendrites are short with claw-like endings that form glomeruli to receive mossy fibers, similar to cerebellar <b>granule</b> cells. Its axon projects to the molecular layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus where it forms parallel fibers, also similar to cerebellar <b>granule</b> cells.The dorsal cochlear <b>granule</b> cells are small excitatory interneurons which are developmentally related and thus resemble the cerebellar <b>granule</b> cell.|$|R
40|$|Several reports {{indicate}} that hypoglycemic sulfonyl-ureas augment Ca 2 -dependent insulin secretion via mechanisms other than inhibition of the ATP-sensitive K channel. The effect involves a 65 -kd protein in the <b>granule</b> membrane and culminates in intragranular acid-ification. Lowering of <b>granule</b> pH {{is necessary for the}} insulin <b>granule</b> to gain release competence. Proton pumping into the <b>granule</b> is driven by a v-type H-ATPase, but requires simultaneous Cl uptake into the <b>granule</b> via metabolically regulated ClC- 3 Cl channels to maintain electroneutrality. Here we discuss the pos-sibility that modulation of <b>granule</b> ClC- 3 channels rep-resents the mechanism whereby sulfonylureas directly potentiate the -cell exocytotic machinery.

5|$|Phagocytes {{can also}} kill {{microbes}} by oxygen-independent methods, {{but these are}} not as effective as the oxygen-dependent ones. There are four main types. The first uses electrically charged proteins that damage the bacterium's membrane. The second type uses lysozymes; these enzymes break down the bacterial cell wall. The third type uses lactoferrins, which are present in neutrophil <b>granules</b> and remove essential iron from bacteria. The fourth type uses proteases and hydrolytic enzymes; these enzymes are used to digest the proteins of destroyed bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Poisoned bait is {{a common}} method for {{controlling}} rats, mice, birds, slugs, snails, ants, cockroaches and other pests. The basic <b>granules,</b> or other formulation, contains a food attractant for the target species and a suitable poison. For ants, a slow-acting toxin is needed so that the workers have time to carry the substance back to the colony, and for flies, a quick-acting substance to prevent further egg-laying and nuisance. Baits for slugs and snails often contain the molluscide metaldehyde, dangerous to children and household pets.|$|E
5|$|Several Suillus species which grow under pines {{could be}} {{confused}} with S.brevipes. S.granulatus has a longer stipe, and distinct raised <b>granules</b> on the stipe. S.brevipes is differentiated from S.albidipes by not having a cottony roll of velar tissue (derived from a partial veil) at the margin when young. S.pallidiceps is by distinguished its pale yellow cap color; and S.albivelatus has a veil. S.pungens has a characteristic pungent odor, compared to the mild smell of S.brevipes, and like S.granulatus, has glandular dots on the stipe.|$|E
40|$|Proliferation of Schwann {{cells is}} one of the first events that occurs after contact with a growing axon. To further define the {{distribution}} and properties of this axonal mitogen, we have (a) cocultured cerebellar <b>granule</b> cells, which lack glial ensheathment in vivo with Schwann cells; and (b) exposed Schwann cell cultures to isolated <b>granule</b> cell membranes. Schwann cells cocultured with <b>granule</b> cells had a 30 -fold increase in the labeling index over Schwann cells cultured alone, suggesting that the mitogen is located on the <b>granule</b> cell surface. Inhibition of <b>granule</b> cell proteoglycan synthesis caused a decrease in the <b>granule</b> cells' ability to stimulate Schwann cell proliferation. Membranes isolated from cerebellar <b>granule</b> cells when added to Schwann cell cultures caused a 45 -fold stimulation in [3 H]thymidine incorporation. The <b>granule</b> cell mitogenic signal was heat and trypsin sensitive and did not require lysosomal processing by Schwann cells to elicit its proliferative effect. The ability of <b>granule</b> cells and their isolated membranes to stimulate Schwann cell proliferation suggests that the mitogenic signal for Schwann cells is a ubiquitous factor present on all axons regardless of their ultimate state of glial ensheathment...|$|R
30|$|Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are {{biodegradable}} polymers {{that are}} attractive materials {{for use in}} tissue engineering and medical device manufacturing.
