Eleven women with normal hearing sensitivity were the subjects of this project and were evaluated under four test conditions: supra-aural earphone in quiet, supraaural earphone in noise, muffed <b>insert</b> <b>earphone</b> in quiet, muffed <b>insert</b> <b>earphone</b> in noise. Results of an analysis of variance revealed significantly higher thresholds with the SSE compared to the MIE in the noise test condition. Essentially no threshold shift occurred with the muffed <b>insert</b> <b>earphone</b> in any condition. It was concluded that the MIE is more appropriate than the SSE for testing hearing sensitivity in the presence of moderate amounts of ambient noise. Hearing levels can be accurately assessed using the MIE system in levels of noise that are equal to OSHA maximum permissible levels. Subjective comfort ratings of each earphone revealed no difference between the two systems. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|E

The transducers utilized were a standard electrodynamic headphone (TDH- 39 P) and an <b>insert</b> <b>earphone</b> (ER- 3 A/ 300 ohm from Etymotic Research). Subjects were 10 adult females with normal hearing sensitivity and unobstructed ear canals.

MÉTODOS: Vinte e um idosos com intervalo aéreo-ósseo {{superior}} a 10 dBNA nas frequências de 3 kHz e/ou 4 kHz foram submetidos à anamne se, audiometria tonal liminar, logoaudiometria e imitanciometria. A audiometria tonal e a logoaudiometria foram realizadas com os fones supra-aurais e com fones de inserção. RESULTADOS: Verificou-se que os limiares auditivos por via aérea obtidos com os fones de inserção foram menores em todas as frequências com exceção de 1 kHz. O intervalo aéreo-ósseo também foi menor com o fone de inserção, havendo um acoplamento aéreo-ósseo com este transdutor. CONCLUSÃO: Os fones de inserção ER- 3 A possibilitam melhora significativa nos limiares de audibilidade por via aérea em idosos, diminuindo ou até eliminando o intervalo aéreo-ósseo, sobretudo nas frequências altas, nos casos de colabamento do meato acústico externo.

40|$|Preliminary {{studies have}} stirred {{the hope that}} sound-field {{stimulation}} through auditory steady state evoked potentials {{can be used to}} assess aided thresholds in the difficult-to-test population. Before the introduction of ASSEP into the clinical field, as a technique for the prediction of aided thresholds in the difficult-to-test population, a question arises concerning its clinical validation. The application of ASSEP through sound field stimulation, in the determination of aided thresholds and for the evaluation of amplification fittings, is dependent on the determination of unaided responses. Subsequently the estimation of unaided thresholds in the hearing impaired population is dependent on the establishment of normative data from the normal hearing population. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of insert earphones and sound field speaker presentation on threshold estimations using monotic auditory steady state evoked potentials, in a group of normal hearing adults. To achieve the aim of the study, a comparative, within-group experimental design was selected. The results of the current study indicated that the monotic single ASSEP technique under both insert earphone- and sound field conditions provided a reasonable estimation (25 - 35 dB HL for inset earphones; 20 - 33 dB HL for sound field speaker presentation) of the behavioural pure tone thresholds. The minimum response levels obtained under <b>insert</b> <b>earphone</b> conditions differed significantly from those obtained under sound field conditions for all the frequencies tested except 2 kHz (p < 0. 01). Subsequently, the current study indicates that minimum response levels obtained using a specific transducer should serve as the basis of comparison with behavioural thresholds obtained under the same transducer. Therefore, behavioural pure tone thresholds obtained under <b>insert</b> <b>earphone</b> conditions will not suffice as a basis of comparison for minimum response levels obtained for the ASSEP technique under sound field conditions, and vice versa. This research endeavour concluded that the monotic ASSEP technique under both <b>insert</b> <b>earphone</b> and sound field conditions provide useful information for the estimation of frequency specific thresholds, but that the results are transducer specific and that comparison across transducers should be avoided.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether rising-frequency chirps presented via earphones with an extended high-frequency response would optimize the post-auricular muscle response (PAMR). The PAMR was recorded in adults using three different stimuli (a click, a rising-frequency chirp, and a truncated speech stimulus, /t/). Conventional ER- 3 A <b>insert</b> <b>earphones</b> were compared to ER- 2 <b>insert</b> <b>earphones</b> to determine whether the PAMR is enhanced by the ER- 2 's extended high-frequency response. There were significant stimulus and earphone effects on PAMR amplitudes. The PAMR was largest for the chirp stimulus and the ER- 2 earphones. The poorest responses were obtained using the /t/ stimulus and conventional ER- 3 A earphones. The results support previous ABR studies that have demonstrated a significant advantage of chirps over clicks for evoked response audiometry, and indicate that the PAMR is enhanced by inclusion of additional high-frequency stimulus energy. 6 page(s...|$|R

With the bone-conduction transducer at the forehead, the perceived occlusion effect was close to that obtained from ear-canal sound pressure data in the 0. 3 to 2 kHz frequency range; when the stimulation was at the mastoid the difference between the perceived and measured ear-canal sound pressure occlusion effect was around 10 dB at frequencies below 1 kHz. Further, the occlusion effect was obtained in two clinical settings: with supra-aural earphones (TDH 39), and <b>insert</b> <b>earphones</b> (CIR 22).

The aim {{of this study was to}} record and compare the amplitude, latency, asymmetry ratio and occurrence percentage of oVEMP (n 10) and cervical VEMP (p 13) responses in a group of normal adult subjects. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study on 20 adult subjects' mean age 22. 18 years, SD= 2. 19 with normal hearing sensitivity and no history of vestibular diseases. oVEMP and cVEMP responses in both ears were recorded using air conducted stimuli 500 Hz short tone burst, 95 dB nHL via <b>insert</b> <b>earphone</b> and compared.

There were statistically significant differences between p 13 and n 10 amplitudes (p< 0. 001).

The {{aim of this}} study was comparing vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) between these patients and normal people. Methods: Twenty-four patients with type I diabetes mellitus and twenty-four healthy volunteers with the age range of 15 - 40 years were enrolled in this study. A tone burst of 500 Hz, with the intensity of 95 dB nHL, was delivered through a <b>insert</b> <b>earphone</b> and vestibular evoked myogenic potential was recorded. The t-test was used to compare the results between the two groups. To investigate the effect of glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) on VEMP responses (latency, absolute and relative amplitude), the regression analysis was used. Results: The mean p 13 and n 23 latency were significantly more in patients with type Ι diabetes mellitus (for P 13 latency, p= 0. 013 in right and p= 0. 010 in left ear, and for n 23 latency, p 0. 050). There was no correlation between VEMPs and HbA 1 c in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: Prolonged latencies of the VEMP in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus suggest lesions in the retrolabyrinthine, especially in the vestibulospinal tract.

PAMR amplitudes declined and latencies increased with decreasing click intensity. Both binaural stimulation and eye turn enhanced the PAMR.

All normal-hearing subjects had PAMR when recording conditions were optimized and half had responses for the least optimal condition (20 dB nHL, monaural, eyes front).

40|$|Objectives: Contra-lateral routing {{of signals}} (CROS) devices {{re-route}} sound between the deaf and hearing ears of unilaterally-deaf individuals. This rerouting {{would be expected to}} disrupt access to monaural level cues that can support monaural localisation in the horizontal plane. However, such a detrimental effect has not been confirmed by clinical studies of CROS use. The present study aimed to exercise strict experimental control over the availability of monaural cues to localisation in the horizontal plane and the fitting of the CROS device to assess whether signal routing can impair the ability to locate sources of sound and, if so, whether CROS selectively disrupts monaural level or spectral cues to horizontal location, or both. Design: Unilateral deafness and CROS device use were simulated in twelve normal hearing participants. Monaural recordings of broadband white noise presented from three spatial locations (- 60 °, 0 °, and + 60 °) were made in the ear canal of a model listener using a probe microphone with and without a CROS device. The recordings were presented to participants via an <b>insert</b> <b>earphone</b> placed in their right ear. The recordings were processed to disrupt either monaural level or spectral cues to horizontal sound location by roving presentation level or the energy across adjacent frequency bands, respectively. Localisation ability was assessed using a three-alternative forced-choice spatial discrimination task. Results: Participants localised above chance levels in all conditions. Spatial discrimination accuracy was poorer when participants only had access to monaural spectral cues compared to when monaural level cues were available. CROS use impaired localisation significantly regardless of whether level or spectral cues were available. For both cues, signal re-routing had a detrimental effect on the ability to localise sounds originating {{from the side of the}} deaf ear (- 60 °). CROS use also impaired the ability to use level cues to localise sounds originating from straight ahead (0 °). Conclusions: The re-routing of sounds can restrict access to the monaural cues that provide a basis for determining sound location in the horizontal plane. Perhaps encouragingly, the results suggest that both monaural level and spectral cues may not be disrupted entirely by signal re-routing and that it may still be possible to reliably identify sounds originating on the hearing side...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this poster is to demonstrate the limitations on temporal {{information that can be}} imposed by a cochlear implant (CI) processor which employs the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to decompose the signal. The Nucleus 24 processor increases temporal information with increased stimulation rate by increasing the temporal overlap between FFT analyses (increases FFT rate). Benefits to performance with higher stimulation rates have been shown in some cases (Holden et al., 2002), but there is little evidence to determine whether improved performance (where it occurs) is due to genuine increases in temporal information in the processor output. The study reported here aimed to determine changes in electrode output with increasing FFT rate, and to evaluate the possible perceptual effects of this via an acoustic model. In order to achieve the first aim, sinusoids modulated at varying modulation rates (at 100 % modulation depth) were processed through the Nucleus Matlab Toolbox in order to simulate the processing of the Nucleus 24 system. The modulation depth of the resulting electrode output was analysed for each modulation rate. The resulting temporal modulation transfer functions will be reported for three different FFT rates, but preliminary analysis shows only small differences across FFT rates. A corresponding acoustic model study was also undertaken. Processed sentence materials were presented monaurally to 10 normal hearing subjects via an ER- 3 <b>insert</b> <b>earphone.</b> The speech materials were processed through the same software as used for the acoustic measurements, in order to the mimic the processing of the Nucleus 24 device implementing the Advanced Combination Encoder speech processing strategy (Cochlear, 2002), at three FFT rates equivalent to stimulation rates of 250, 900 and 2000 pulses per second. Noise bands were modulated according to the fluctuations in the virtual electrode channels of the processor and added together to produce simulated sentence materials. Performance on a sentence recognition task was compared between the three FFT rates in quiet and stationary noise at + 10 dB SNR. Results will be presented and discussed in the context of how FFT-based CI processing impacts on temporal information and whether changes in stimulation rate produce real changes in electrode output...|$|E

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the successful hearing screening program in Flanders, the need for accurate objective diagnostics has increased. The aim {{of this study was to}} report on clinical experience using dichotic multiple-stimulus auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) as an objective technique to estimate frequency-specific hearing thresholds in hearing-impaired infants. ASSRs were evoked by 100 % amplitude-modulated and 20 % frequency-modulated tones with carrier frequencies of 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz and modulation frequencies ranging from 82 to 110 Hz. Eight signals (four to each ear) were presented simultaneously through <b>insert</b> <b>earphones.</b> Tests were carried out in a soundproof room. A first group of 20 infants between 3 months and 5 years old was tested under general anaesthesia. This was a group of difficult-to-test children. ASSR recordings were combined with click-evoked ABR measurements. Behavioural hearing thresholds were defined in later test sessions as soon as possible after the ASSR test, dependent on medical and developmental factors. A second group of 15 babies was tested in natural sleep. These babies were between 2 weeks and 5 months old and were referred after a failed hearing screening carried out in the neonatal intensive care unit. A comparison was made between the ASSR, the ABR and behavioural hearing thresholds. Threshold comparisons, test duration and feasibility of testing in natural sleep will be discussed at the conference. The results indicate that multiple-frequency ASSRs offer the possibility to accurately estimate frequency-specific hearing thresholds in babies in a time-efficient way. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 10 % of the global population is impaired to a significant degree by a decrease in hearing sensitivity. With the greatest proportion of these persons residing in developing countries where communities are grossly underserved, it is incumbent on hearing healthcare professionals to seek means of offering equitable hearing health care services to these communities. The delivery of conventional diagnostic hearing services to these population groups is challenged by limitations in human resources, financial constraints and by the dearth of audiometric testing facilities that are compliant with permissible ambient noise levels for reliable testing. Valid diagnostic hearing assessment without an audiometric test booth will allow greater mobility of services and could extend hearing healthcare service delivery in underserved areas. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the validity of diagnostic pure tone audiometry in a natural environment, outside a sound treated room, using a computer-operated audiometer with <b>insert</b> <b>earphones</b> covered by circumaural earcups incorporating real-time monitoring of environmental noise. A within-subject repeated measures research design was employed to assess elderly adults with diagnostic air (250 to 8000 Hz) and bone (250 to 4000 Hz) conduction pure tone audiometry. The study was of a quantitative nature and the required data was collected by testing subjects initially in a natural environment and subsequently in a sound booth environment to compare the threshold measurements. One experienced audiologist used audiometric KUDUwave test equipment to evaluate subjects in both environments. A total of 147 adults with an average age of 76 (± 5. 7) years were tested. Ears had pure tone averages (500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz) of ≥ 25 dB in 59 %, > 40 dB in 23 % and ˃ 55 dB in 6 % of cases. Analysis of collected data showed air conduction thresholds (n = 2259) corresponding within 0 to 5 dB in 95 % of all comparisons between testing in the natural and sound booth environments. Bone conduction thresholds (n = 1669) corresponded within 0 to 5 dB in 86 % of comparisons and within 10 dB or less in 97 % of cases. Average threshold differences (– 0. 6 to 1. 1) and standard deviations (3. 3 to 5. 9) were within typical test-retest reliability limits. Recorded thresholds showed no statistically significant differences with a paired samples t-test (p ˃ 0. 01) except at 8000 Hz in the left ear. Overall the correlation between the air-conduction thresholds recorded in the sound booth environment and the natural environment was very high (˃ 0. 92) across all frequencies while for bone conduction threshold correlation for the two environments fell between 0. 63 and 0. 97. This study demonstrates that valid diagnostic pure tone audiometry in an elderly population can be performed in a natural environment using an audiometer employing <b>insert</b> <b>earphones</b> covered by circumaural earcups with real-time monitoring of ambient noise levels. Mobile diagnostic audiometry performed outside of an audiometric sound booth may extend current hearing healthcare services to remote underserved communities where booths are scarce or inaccessible. In combination with Telehealth applications this technology could offer a powerful and viable alternate diagnostic service to persons unable to attend conventional testing facilities for whatever reasons.

40|$|Background: Auditory Processing Disorder is {{difficult}} to diagnose {{and there is still}} a lot to learn about this condition. Recent research reports MLR as a promising new tool to help assess the disorder. The last few years efforts has been made to establish a Norwegian test battery for APD, but {{there is a need to}} conduct more research on electrophysiological measurements to supplement this battery. Purpose: The main purpose of this study was to describe performance of normal children ages 10 - 12 years, on the Middle Latency Response measurement (MLR). The second purpose was to compare the results from the subjective measurements in the Norwegian test battery for APD, with normative data proposed in a previous Norwegian study. Material and Methods: A total of forty-four children aged 10 - 12 years were measured with the test battery for APD and MLR. Thirty-five cases were included in the analysis of normative values for the Na and Pa wave of the MLR. MLR was assessed using a click stimulus protocol at 70 dB nHL, surface electrodes and <b>insert</b> <b>earphones.</b> Results: Analysis showed no significant differences between age groups, genders or ears on any variable for latency or amplitude of the MLR (p< 0. 05). A significant difference between left and right ear for electrode effect was found. Results for the test battery for APD in this study did not differ much from a previous Norwegian study. Conclusion: The results from this study showed no significant difference between age groups or genders in any variable for the MLR. Normative values for the Na and Pa latency and amplitude are proposed for the age group 10 - 12 years...|$|R
40|$|The {{audiogram}} predicts < 30 % of {{the variance}} in speech-reception thresholds (SRTs) for hearing-impaired (HI) listeners fitted with individualized frequency-dependent gain. The remaining variance could reflect suprathreshold distortion in the auditory pathways or nonauditory factors such as cognitive processing. The relationship between a measure of suprathreshold auditory function—spectrotemporal modulation (STM) sensitivity—and SRTs in noise was examined for 154 HI listeners fitted with individualized frequency-specific gain. SRTs were measured for 65 -dB SPL sentences presented in speech-weighted noise or four-talker babble to an individually programmed master hearing aid, with the output of an ear-simulating coupler played through <b>insert</b> <b>earphones.</b> Modulation-depth detection thresholds were measured over headphones for STM (2 cycles/octave density, 4 -Hz rate) applied to an 85 -dB SPL, 2 -kHz lowpass-filtered pink-noise carrier. SRTs were correlated with both the high-frequency (2 – 6 kHz) pure-tone average (HFA; R 2 [*]=[*]. 31) and STM sensitivity (R 2 [*]=[*]. 28). Combined with the HFA, STM sensitivity significantly improved the SRT prediction (ΔR 2 [*]=[*]. 13; total R 2 [*]=[*]. 44). The remaining unaccounted variance might be attributable to variability in cognitive function and other dimensions of suprathreshold distortion. STM sensitivity was most critical in predicting SRTs for listeners[*]<[*] 65 years old or with HFA < 53 [*]dB HL. Results are discussed in the context of previous work suggesting that STM sensitivity for low rates and low-frequency carriers is impaired by a reduced ability to use temporal fine-structure information to detect dynamic spectra. STM detection is a fast test of suprathreshold auditory function for frequencies < 2 kHz that complements the HFA to predict variability in hearing-aid outcomes for speech perception in noise...|$|R
