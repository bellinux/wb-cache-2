Although she was attempting to fly to Moscow, her odyssey ended in Denmark after {{the government of the}} Soviet Union denied her permission to enter its air space. She wrote about her aviation exploits and philosophy of life in an autobiography published in 1983.|$|E
500|$|Another re-introduction {{involved}} the storyline surrounding the Siege of Riverrun, with actor Clive Russell {{returning to the}} show as Brynden [...] "the Blackfish" [...] Tully, who last appeared since the third-season episode [...] "The Rains of Castamere", in which the Red Wedding took place, and the Blackfish successfully evaded. In an interview with IGN, Clive Russell stated he was hopeful {{to return to the}} role saying [...] "I'd hoped that he'd come back because he comes back in the books again. But they're not doing the books -- there is no book to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>from.</b> I'd hoped that would happen. I don't think I was surprised it would happen because they bring back all kinds of people at all kinds of times. But it was good to go back there, I must say." ...|$|E
2500|$|When he was 14, the Spanish tennis {{federation}} {{requested that}} he leave Mallorca {{and move to}} Barcelona to continue his tennis training. Nadal's family turned down this request, partly because they feared it would hurt his education, but also because Toni said that [...] "I don't {{want to believe that}} {{you have to go to}} America, or other places to be a good athlete. You can <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> your home." [...] The decision to stay home meant that Nadal received less financial support from the federation; instead, Nadal's father covered the costs. In May 2001, he defeated former Grand Slam tournament champion Pat Cash in a clay-court exhibition match.|$|E

60|$|Yes, but she needn't marry them. If {{she wants}} to {{encourage}} Basil let her <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> a discreet distance. Genius always thrives best on bread and water and platonic attachments. If Hilda marries him he'll only become fat and ugly and bald-headed and stupid.|$|E
