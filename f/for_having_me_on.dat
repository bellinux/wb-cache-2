5000|$|A 1974 live {{version was}} {{recorded}} by the Elton John Band with John Lennon and released as the B-side to the former's [...] "Philadelphia Freedom" [...] single. The song {{is available on the}} Lennon box set, and on Elton John's To Be Continued... box set as well as the expanded CD edition of his 1976 live album Here and There and Elton John's Rare Masters. Lennon's introduction: I'd like to thank Elton and the boys <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> tonight. We tried to think of a number to finish off with so I can get out of here and be sick, and we thought we'd do a number of an old, estranged fiancé of mine, called Paul. This is one I never sang, it's an old Beatle number, and we just about know it. This was the last major live performance by John Lennon. After Lennon's death, the track was released as a single and reached #40 on the UK Singles Chart in March 1981, making it the first time that any version of the song had entered the UK charts.|$|E
5000|$|The week of October 17-21 in 1966—that {{would make}} me about 40—was a special celebrity week on Eye Guess. Bill Cullen was the host. The game was very similar to Concentration. I was teamed up with Julia Meade. Remember her? Actress, very pretty young lady, blonde... Okay, never mind. I don't think I won, but I did get the take-home game. Anyway, the show is over, and I start walking toward the podium to say good night to Bill, to thank him <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>me</b> <b>on.</b> He starts coming toward me cross-stage, and I don't know what he's doing. His feet are flopping. His hands are flying everywhere. He's {{doing this kind of}} wacky walk-of-the-unfortunates that Jerry Lewis used to do. So I figured, what the hell, I'll join him. I start doing, I dunno, this multiple-sclerosis walk, {{flapping}} my arms and doing the Milton Berle cross legs—my own Jerry Lewis impression... And Julia is whispering, [...] "No! He's crippled, Mel!" [...] I don't even hear her. Finally we meet in the middle, we hug, and he says to me, [...] "You know, you're the only comic who's ever had the nerve to make fun of my crippled walk. Everyone's so careful, it makes me feel even worse." [...] And I realize, Oh, my God, this guy is really crippled! It was my worst moment — and if you weren't me, probably the funniest thing that ever happened.|$|E

Acknowledgements First of all, I express my deepest {{gratitude}} to my supervisor Professor Andrea Rinaldo, for his trust and continuous support during these four years, for his enthusiasm and great personality. Thanks <b>for</b> <b>having</b> taken <b>me</b> <b>on</b> board on this sturdy ship which <b>has</b> allowed <b>me</b> to end my long journey at EPFL pleasantly and safely. A special thanks to Enrico Bertuzzo and Luca Carraro whose modeling expertise has been a very important contribution to my thesis. I also thank Bernard Sperandio, for the uncountable amount of time he spent collecting data on the field, helping with the lysimeter experiments or filtering my samples when I was on vacation at conferences. Thanks to Bettina Schaefli <b>for</b> not <b>having</b> kicked my students out after I sent them knocking on her door to get some support on SEHR-ECHO. Our lab would have been bankrupted many times ( [...] . my experiments consider-ably contributing to this end) without the wise management of Anna Rothenbühler, to whom I am also very grateful. Many thanks to all other former and current colleagues and friend...|$|R

The {{words are}} these, [...] "Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto {{the city of}} the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general {{assembly}} and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel." [...] Through this blessed sentence the Lord led me over and over, first to this word, and then to that, and showed me wonderful glory {{in every one of}} them. These words also have oft since this time been great refreshment to my spirit. Blessed be God <b>for</b> <b>having</b> mercy <b>on</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Nian You {{have seen}} what I look like now; if I come back, I could not do {{anything}} except top be your burden. I know you ask {{me to come back}} just <b>for</b> <b>having</b> pity <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> But young master, today we are no longer as we have been. In the past just staying beside you, no matter what you said or what you did, just a glance on you would give me happiness. However, I have already changed. I wish you could like me, even only me. I know it is impossible. In the past when I saw you getting along with others, I felt deeply tortured in my heart. I tried to hold myself, but only in vain. Young master, I am now in this condition, so it is better for us to forget it. Let <b>me</b> give up <b>on</b> you.|$|R
5000|$|From an interview, Freddy {{explained}} {{the formation of}} the band: [...] "A lot of the songs were written before Former Ghosts even really came together as a full on band. Once I had decided {{that this was going to}} be a new music project <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>having</b> Jamie <b>on</b> board just came naturally. We had always talked about doing a project in this kind of style but both of our schedules were just too busy to actually do it, but then it ended up working out this time around. Nika got involved because I am a big fan of her band Zola Jesus and I asked her to sing on a song and when she sent it back to me I was so blown away that I knew that I needed her to be a part of this band!" ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} some useful serial and parallel algorithms for fast and accurate evaluations of some singular integrals in regular geometries in real and complex planes. We then show their applications in developing fast and accurate methods for solving elliptic partial differential equations using Green’s function approach in regular and complex geometries. These algorithms {{have been applied}} by the author and his collaborators in solving some practical problems from quasiconformal mapping to computation of pulsatile blood flow in eccentric catheterized artery. Some numerical results are presented in this paper. We describe many other possibilities {{in the use of}} these algorithms and also describe other areas where these algorithms have been applied by others. We chart the landscape where further opportunities for their applications exist. This talk will be partly based on the following papers of the author, some solo and some written with my colleagues. I thank all these colleagues <b>for</b> <b>having</b> collaborated with <b>me</b> <b>on</b> all these papers...|$|R
40|$|Forty {{years ago}} William Lawrence Bragg {{came here to}} thank you for {{awarding}} the Nobel Prize to himself and to his father, and to tell you how they had brought into being a new and fruitful branch of physics by unravelling the atomic arrangement in crystals of common salt and other simple compounds. * Today Sir Lawrence Bragg ranks as one of the fathers of X-ray crystallography, but he has also been something of a scientific father to me personally, and I feel immensely proud that it should now be my own turn, as his former pupil, to thank you <b>for</b> <b>having</b> bestowed <b>on</b> <b>me</b> this supreme honour. I started my X-ray work on crystalline proteins in the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge under J. D. Bernal in 1937, just after he and Dorothy Hodgkin had demonstrated that protein crystals can be made to yield sharp X-ray diffraction patterns which extend to spacings of the order of interatomic distancesa. Soon afterwards Sir Lawrence Bragg was appointed Cavendish Professor. My X-ray diffraction pictures of haemoglobin at onc...|$|R
60|$|After music I made up {{the fire}} and parched an ear of maize for my dinner, and while laboriously {{crunching}} the dry hard grain I thanked Heaven <b>for</b> <b>having</b> bestowed <b>on</b> <b>me</b> such good molars. Finally I slung my hammock in its old corner, and placing myself in it in my favourite oblique position, my hands clasped behind my head, one knee cocked up, the other leg dangling down, I resigned myself to idle thought. I felt very happy. How strange, thought I, with a little self-flattery, that I, accustomed to the agreeable society of intelligent men and charming women, and of books, should find such perfect contentment here! But I congratulated myself too soon. The profound silence began at length to oppress me. It was not like the forest, where one <b>has</b> wild birds <b>for</b> company, where their cries, albeit inarticulate, have a meaning and give a charm to solitude. Even the sight and whispered sounds of green leaves and rushes trembling in the wind <b>have</b> <b>for</b> us something of intelligence and sympathy; but I could not commune with mud walls and an earthen pot. Feeling my loneliness too acutely, I began to regret that I had left Rima, then to feel remorse at the secrecy I had practiced. Even now while I inclined idly in my hammock, she would be roaming the forest in search of me, listening for my footsteps, fearing perhaps that I had met with some accident {{where there was no}} person to succour me. It was painful to think of her in this way, of the pain I had doubtless given her by stealing off without a word of warning. Springing to the floor, I flung {{out of the house and}} went down to the stream. It was better there, for now the greatest heat of the day was over, and the weltering sun began to look large and red and rayless through the afternoon haze.|$|R
