40|$|BACKGROUND: Prescription {{medications}} {{are being}} switched to over-the-counter (OTC) status with increasing frequency. Information is limited regarding {{the impact of}} OTC availability {{on the use of}} prescription forms of those products and on the utilization of health care services. OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of OTC availability of H 2 -receptor antagonists on medication prescribing patterns and utilization of physician services among a population of chronic users of those agents. DESIGN: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate changes in the number of prescriptions filled for H 2 -receptor antagonists and other <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>agents</b> (proton pump inhibitors, gastric motility agents, and sucralfate), and ambulatory medical encounters with physicians during a one-year period before (July 1, 1994 -June 30, 1995) and after OTC availability of H 2 -receptor antagonists (July 1, 1995 -June 30, 1996). Changes in the prescription drug costs for <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>agents</b> were also estimated. SUBJECTS: Members of the Fallon Community Health Plan, a mixed-model HMO located in Central and Eastern Massachusetts (July 1, 1994 -June 30, 1996) who were dispensed at least one H 2 -receptor antagonist during each quarter for the period between July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995. MEASURES: Mean absolute differences in the frequencies of drug dispensings and ambulatory encounters and prescription drug costs during the pre-OTC (July 1, 1994 -June 30, 1995) and post-OTC switch (July 1, 1995 -June 30, 1996) periods were calculated. RESULTS: For the one-year period after OTC availability H 2 -receptor antagonists, we estimated that the mean absolute number of prescriptions dispensed for H 2 -receptor antagonists was reduced by 1. 5 prescriptions (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and the mean number of prescriptions dispensed for all <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>agents</b> was reduced by 1. 3 prescriptions (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) among chronic users of these agents. The number of dispensings of <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>agents</b> was similarly reduced in the population of chronic users with a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). OTC availability was not associated with an increase in physician visits, overall or for GERD-related conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the prescription-to-OTC switch of H 2 -receptor antagonists reduced the number of prescriptions for those agents dispensed among a population of chronic users of those drugs in a managed care setting without increasing physician visits...|$|E

It is well tolerated in adults, including elderly patients. As of July 20, 2006, lubiprostone had not been studied in pediatric patients. Lubiprostone is a bicyclic fatty acid (prostaglandin E1 derivative) that acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels on the apical aspect of gastrointestinal epithelial cells, producing a chloride-rich fluid secretion. These secretions soften the stool, increase motility, and promote spontaneous bowel movements. Unlike many laxative products, lubiprostone does not show signs of tolerance, dependency, or altered serum electrolyte concentration.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{provide the}} first {{nationwide}} estimates of medication use {{in nursing homes}} (NHs) and to introduce a new data set for examining drug use in long-term care facilities. DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison. SETTING: NH medication files from two nationally representative data sets, the 1997 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) and the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Nursing Home Component (MEPS-NHC). PARTICIPANTS: NH residents in the MCBS (n= 929, weighted n= 2. 0 million) and MEPS-NHC (n= 5, 899, weighted n= 3. 1 million). MEASUREMENTS: Estimates include characteristics of facilities and residents, average number of drugs used per person per month, and the prevalence and duration of use by select therapeutic drug classes. RESULTS: NH residents received, on average, seven to eight medications each month (7. 6 MCBS, 7. 2 MEPS-NHC). About one-third of residents had monthly drug regimens of nine or more medications (31. 8 % MCBS, 32. 4 % MEPS-NHC). The most commonly used medications in NHs, in descending order, were analgesics and antipyretics, <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>agents,</b> electrolytic and caloric preparations, central nervous system agents, anti-infective agents, and cardiovascular agents. CONCLUSION: These estimates serve as examples of the first national benchmarks of prescribing patterns in NHs.

40|$|QUESTION UNDER STUDY: Medication {{errors are}} a major concern for health care since they may cause or lead to {{inappropriate}} medication use or patient harm. However, little is known regarding the economic burden of unjustified medications. METHODS: Hospital discharge records of 577 patients were prospectively screened {{for the presence of}} unjustified medications. From this sample population, 318 (55 %) were eligible and their data were used to assess the monthly costs of unjustified discharge medications, their relationship to the total and each individual's drug expenditure, and the relative cost weights of relevant unjustified drug classes. RESULTS: The results found that 619 out of 3691 prescriptions (16. 8 %) were unjustified. The mean (median; 95 % CI) monthly costs of unjustified discharge medications were 32 euro (27 euro; 29 euro to 35 euro). The percentage of unnecessary treatments was inversely linked to the amount of total individual drug expenditure. For this collective, monthly extra costs due to unjustified medications were 18585 euro, and the relative cost weights of the relevant drug classes were 45. 8 % for <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>agents</b> (33. 8 % for proton pump inhibitors), 17. 7 % for cardiovascular drugs, and 17. 2 % for psychiatric drugs. CONCLUSIONS: There is a considerable financial burden imposed by unjustified medications at hospital discharge. Discharge medications not motivated by appropriate diagnoses should be questioned.

40|$|Persistent {{pulmonary}} hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) {{is defined as}} the failure of the normal circulatory transition that occurs after birth. It is a syndrome characterized by marked {{pulmonary hypertension}} that causes hypoxemia and right-to-left extrapulmonary shunting of blood. In the treatment of PPHN, the main goal is to increase oxygen flow to the baby's organs to prevent serious health problems. Treatment may include drugs, mechanical ventilation and respiratory therapy. We performed a retrospective, descriptive and transversal study to investigate the prevalence and treatment of patients with PPHN who were admitted at the Hospital del Niño DIF from 2004 to 2008. Data were collected from charts of the Hospital. The data included demographic, clinical data and those on drugs usage. A total of 38 patients were included (prevalence of 5. 7 %). The average age of patients was 8. 4 1. 4 days. The mortality rate was 42. 1 %. Data were collected and 45 different drugs were given to the pediatric patients. The median number of drugs/inpatient was 8. 3 (1 - 18).

40|$|Any suboptimum {{treatment}} {{in the management of}} patients can lead to medication errors (MEs) that may increase morbidity and mortality in hospitalized individuals. By establishing well-designed patient care activities within the managed care setting, clinical pharmacists can cooperate with other health care professionals to provide quality care and maximize safety. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the frequency and prevention of MEs by clinical pharmacists. This was a cross-sectional interventional study conducted in internal wards of a teaching hospital during a two-month period. During this period, patient records, and physician orders were reviewed by clinical pharmacists. Any prescription error identified was documented. Incorrect drug selection, dose, dosage form, frequency, or route of administration all were considered as medication errors. Then, the clinical pharmacist discuss about findings with the clinical fellows to change faulty orders. The frequency and types of MEs in different wards that were detected and prevented by clinical pharmacists was documented. During the study period, in 132 patients, 262 errors were detected (1. 98 per each). Wrong frequency 71 (27 %), forget to order 37 (14. 1 %), wrong selection 33 (12. 5 %), drug interactions 26 (9. 9 %), forget to discontinue 25 (9. 5 %) and inappropriate dose adjustment in renal impairment 25 (9. 5 %) were the most types of errors.

40|$|Objective: A {{prospective}} medicine usage evaluation {{based on}} prescription monitoring {{was conducted in}} the medicine OPD of our university teaching hospital to know prescribing trends of different categories of medicines. Materials and Methods: A total of 600 patients {{were included in the}} study comprising of 339 (56. 5 %) males and 261 (43. 5 %) females. The data were recorded within the OPD by a registered pharmacist on a medicine usage evaluation form, approved by The University Institutional Review Board (IRB). Results: A total of 2365 medicines were prescribed to 600 patients during the 3 months study period. The mean number of medicines per prescription were found to be 3. 94. Medicines were most frequently prescribed as solid dosage forms (85. 62 %), especially tablets (70. 82 %), and liquid formulations (14. 12 %). Oral route (96. 17 %) was the most preferred mode of administration, followed by topical (2. 11 %) and parenteral (1. 60 %) routes. Combination therapy (94. 33 %) was more prevalent than monotherapy (5. 66 %). An overwhelming tendency for prescribing medicines by brand names (99 %) was observed by the physicians. The most frequently prescribed class of medicines were antimicrobials > analgesics > cardiovascular > <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>agents.</b> The most prescribed individual medicines among various therapeutic classes included isoniazid (antimicrobial), amlodipine (cardiovascular), metformin (hypoglycemic), cetirizine (antiallergic), rabeprazole (GI medicine), atorvastatin (hypolipidemic), dextromethorphan (respiratory medicine), alprazolam (sedative-hypnotic), paracetamol (analgesic). Conclusions: There is a considerable scope of improvement in the existing prescribing practice, especially prescribing by generic names, needs to be encouraged and a hospital formulary has to be developed for the purpose. The number of medicines to be included per prescription should be judged rationally and polypharmacy ought to be curbed. Use of antimicrobial also needs to be rationalized as over usage of antibiotics may lead to the problems such as medicine resistance and noncompliance...|$|E

40|$|Louis Kuritzky George P SamrajDepartment of Community Health and Family Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USAAbstract: Low {{back pain}} (LBP) is amongst {{the top ten}} most common {{conditions}} presenting to primary care clinicians in the ambulatory setting. Further, it accounts for {{a significant amount of}} health care expenditure; indeed, over one third of all disability dollars spent in the United States is attributable to low back pain. In most cases, acute low back pain is a self-limiting disease. There are many evidence-based guidelines for the management of LBP. The most common risk factor for development of LBP is previous LBP, heavy physical work, and psychosocial risk factors. Management of LBP includes identification of red flags, exclusion of specific secondary causes, and comprehensive musculoskeletal/neurological examination of the lower extremities. In uncomplicated LBP, imaging is unnecessary unless symptoms become protracted. Reassurance that LBP will likely resolve and advice to maintain an active lifestyle despite LBP are the cornerstones of management. Medications are provided not because they change the natural history of the disorder, but rather because they enhance the ability of the patient to become more active, and in some cases, to sleep better. The most commonly prescribed medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and muscle relaxants. Although NSAIDs are a chemically diverse class, their similarities, efficacy, tolerability, and adverse effect profile have more similarities than differences. The most common side effects of NSAIDs are <b>gastrointestinal.</b> <b>Agents</b> with cyclo-oxygenase 2 selectivity are associated with reduced gastrointestinal bleeding, but problematic increases in adverse cardiovascular outcomes continue to spark concern. Fortunately, short-term use of NSAIDs for LBP is generally both safe and effective. This review will focus on the role of NSAIDs in the management of LBP.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{validate}} a generalizable process for creating a nonprescription drug formulary. Specifically, the study sought to determine whether (1) a group of experts could achieve consensus on therapeutic criteria to be used in the selection of nonprescription analgesic and gastrointestinal drugs for formulary inclusion and, (2) the criteria could be consistently applied by independent panels of experts to the formulary selection process. The Delphi consensus building process was adapted for this project. Fourteen experts were recruited to serve on each of two panels, one for each therapeutic class. The first task before each 14 -member committee was to achieve consensus on the evaluative criteria that would be used to operationalize the concept of 2 ̆ 2 significant therapeutic advantage 2 ̆ 2 in each therapeutic class. Virtual consensus (all, or all but one expert voting in favor) was achieved over five iterations, on eighteen and twenty-five criteria for analgesic and gastrointestinal drugs, respectively. Nine of the analgesic criteria also appeared on the list of gastrointestinal drug criteria. The next task was to apply the consensus criteria to the selection of analgesic and <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>agents</b> that possessed a significant therapeutic advantage over others considered for the formulary. Both the analgesic and the gastrointestinal panel were divided into two independent seven-member sub-panels for this task. Virtual consensus on the formularies was accomplished over three iterations. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen were selected by the two independent analgesic sub-panels and aluminum hydroxide-magnesium hydroxide combination, famotidine, psyllium, loperamide and electrolyte replacement therapy by the two gastrointestinal sub-panels. Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s exact test was used to test the association between the choices of the sub-panels within each therapeutic class. The results indicate that the consensus criteria were being applied in a consistent and reproducible fashion to formulary selection. It is concluded that this model of formulary development could be applied by hospitals, managed care organizations, and Medicaid programs to guide drug product selection in nonprescription and prescription drug formularies. Applied to other therapeutic classes, a national nonprescription drug formulary could be developed to aid patients and providers in self-care decisions.

Previous nonselective 5 -hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 (5 -HT 4) agonists have been associated with significant interactions with other receptors (5 -HT 1 B, 5 -HT 1 D, and 5 -HT 2 B for tegaserod; hERG for cisapride), leading to adverse cardiovascular events resulting in withdrawal of these drugs from the market. Prucalopride is a novel <b>gastrointestinal</b> prokinetic <b>agent.</b> It acts as a high affinity, highly-selective 5 -HT 4 agonist. Its efficacy in patients with chronic constipation has been demonstrated in several phase II and phase III clinical trials showing significant improvements in bowel transit, bowel function, gastrointestinal symptoms, and quality of life, with benefit maintained for up to 24 months in open label, multicenter, follow-up studies. Prucalopride’s high selectivity for the 5 -HT 4 receptor may explain its favorable safety and tolerability profiles, even in elderly subjects with stable cardiovascular disease. Prucalopride is a well tolerated and efficacious prokinetic medication that should enhance the treatment of chronic constipation unresponsive to first-line treatments...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate gastrointestinal dysfunctions, especially the effects of <b>gastrointestinal</b> prokinetic <b>agents</b> on digestive disorders involving lowered motility. The effects of α 2 -adrenergic agonists for treating acute abdominal disorders involving intestinal torsion in horses were also investigated. The results are as follows: (1) It appeared that the functions of migrating contractions (MC) in horses were to transfer the contents of the digestive tract as soon as possible to the cecum and colon, in addition to maintaining homeostatis in the digestive tract. (2) Motilin was seen {{to be involved in the}} regulation mechanism of intestinal motility in the horse as well as in humans and dogs, and brought about MC. (3) The intravenous injection of cisapride brought about MC in the small intestine. With administration of a higher dose of 0. 75 or 1. 0 mg/kg, a significant increase (P< 0. 05) in MC frequency was observed. (4) It was clear that the inhibitory effects of the α 2 -adrenergic agonists persisted for a longer time with a more remarkable reduction of contractions in the cecum and colon than in the jejunum. When α 2 -adrenergic agonists are used for relieving intestinal tension, it is recommended that medetomidine is more effective than xylazine. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Sphingolipids in {{digestive}} system {{are responsible for}} numerous important physiological and pathological processes. In the membrane of gut epithelial cells, sphingolipids provide structural integrity, regulate absorption of some nutrients, and act as receptors for many microbial antigens and their toxins. Moreover, bioactive sphingolipids such as ceramide or sphingosine- 1 -phosphate regulate cellular growth, differentiation, and programmed cell death—apoptosis. Although it is well established that sphingolipids have clinical implications in gastrointestinal tumorigenesis or inflammation, further {{studies are needed to}} fully explore the role of sphingolipids in neoplastic and inflammatory diseases in <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract. Pharmacological <b>agents</b> which regulate metabolism of sphingolipids can be potentially used in the management of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of this work is to critically the review physiological and pathological roles of sphingolipids in the gastrointestinal tract...|$|R
