25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood {{is the place to be}} yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to be myself.... I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E
500|$|Kinsler signed quickly, {{and broke}} in as a shortstop in 2003. He batted [...]277 in 188 at-bats in his pro debut for the Spokane Indians in the Short-season Northwest League, while leading {{the team in}} steals (11) and triples (6). He then spent the 2003–04 winter in Arizona, working out with the Rangers' {{strength}} and conditioning coaches. He said: [...] "I was probably 170 pounds, and I decided I needed to lift, put on some weight, and eat as much as I could. And <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to hit." ...|$|E

She was soon {{employed as a}} librarian at the Kashmere Gardens Branch at the Houston Public Library. The following year, she moved back to Austin and took another job as a librarian in the Austin Independent School District school Dawson Elementary until 1977. She reflected on her employment experiences {{to a group of}} children in 2003, saying, [...] "I worked as a teacher and librarian and <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> important reading is in school and in life." ...|$|E

500|$|Murray {{likens the}} song to [...] "the R {{equivalent}} of punk rock" [...] or superficially simple {{enough not to}} intimidate beginners. [...] It interested the eleven-year-old Bo Diddley: [...] "I think the first record I paid attention to was John Lee Hooker's 'Boogie Chillen,'... When I found John Lee Hooker on the radio, I said, 'If that guy can play, I know I can.' [...] I mean John Lee's got {{a hell of a}} style". [...] In an interview, Buddy Guy described learning to play [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] at age thirteen: [...] "that was the first thing I thought <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to play that I knew sounded right when someone would listen." [...] Guy later recorded a version with Junior Wells for their 1981 album Alone & Acoustic. [...] Albert Collins also recalled that it was the first song he learned to play.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway greatly admired Cézanne {{and early}} in his career crafted his prose {{in a way that would}} {{resonate}} with that painter's work. He said in a 1949 interview that [...] "Cézanne is my painter after the early painters.... I can make a landscape like Mr. Paul Cézanne, <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how...</b> by walking through the Luxembourg Museum a thousand times." [...] Hemingway wanted the structure of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] to resemble a Cézanne—with a detailed foreground set against a vaguely described background. In a letter to Stein from August 1924, he wrote, [...] "I have finished two long stories... and finished the long one I worked on before I went to Spain where I am doing the country like Cézanne and having a hell of a time and sometimes getting it a little bit. It is about 100 pages long and nothing happens and the country is swell. I made it all up".|$|E
500|$|Fossett {{grew up in}} Garden Grove, California {{and earned}} the Eagle Scout award in 1957. He {{credited}} his experience in Scouting {{as a foundation for}} much of his later success. [...] "As a Scout, <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to set goals and achieve them," [...] he once said. [...] "Being a Scout also taught me leadership at a young age when there are few opportunities to be a leader. Scouting values have remained with me throughout my life, in my business career, and now as I take on new challenges." [...] In his later years, he was described as a [...] "legend" [...] by fellow Scouts. As a national BSA volunteer, he served as Chairman of the Northern Tier High Adventure Committee, Chairman of the Venturing Committee, member of the Philmont Ranch Committee, and member of the National Advisory Council. He later {{became a member of the}} BSA National Executive Board, and in 2007, Fossett succeeded Secretary of Defense Robert Gates as president of the National Eagle Scout Association. Fossett previously had served on the World Scout Committee.|$|E

500|$|After being heavily {{recruited}} by several colleges around the country, Solo attended the University of Washington from 1999 to 2002 where she majored in speech communications. With the Huskies, she switched permanently to goalkeeper under {{the lead of}} head coach Lesle Gallimore and goalkeeper coach and former national team player, Amy Griffin. Solo described the transition in her memoir, [...] "In high school, I had been the forward who won games. It was a huge mental adjustment to learn that {{my job was to}} save games. To anticipate what was needed. Before, I would stand in goal, the ball would come toward me, and I'd use my athletic ability to make the save. But thanks to Amy's tutelage and my time with the national team, I was becoming a much better tactical goalkeeper. <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to read my opponents' runs toward goal, how to position my defenders, how to see the angles... The intellectual side also made goalkeeping so much more interesting. It wasn't just ninety minutes of waiting for my defense to make a mistake. It was ninety minutes of tactics and strategy. The personality traits that had been shaped by my childhood—resilience and toughness—were assets at the position." ...|$|E
500|$|Capitol Records {{executives}} {{were worried that}} the lyrics contained psychedelic overtones, and Brian was accused of having based the song's production on his LSD experiences. Brian clarified that the song was written {{under the influence of}} marijuana, not LSD. He explained: [...] "I made ‘Good Vibrations’ on drugs; I used drugs to make that. ... <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to function behind drugs, and it improved my brain ... it made me more rooted in my sanity." [...] In Steven Gaines's 1986 biography, Wilson is quoted on the lyrics: [...] "We talked about good vibrations with the song and the idea, and we decided on one hand that you could say ... those are sensual things. And then you'd say, 'I'm picking up good vibrations,' which is a contrast against the sensual, the extrasensory perception that we have. That's what we're really talking about." [...] Brian claimed in 2012 that the song's [...] "gotta keep those good vibrations" [...] bridge was inspired by Stephen Foster. Al Jardine of the Beach Boys compared the section to Foster's [...] "Down by the Riverside". According to Love, the lyric [...] "'she goes with me to a blossom world' was originally meant to be followed by the words 'we find'", but Brian elected to cut off the line to highlight the bass track linking into the chorus.|$|E

2500|$|Fator says {{he found}} he {{had the ability to}} {{impersonate}} singers by practicing ventriloquism while driving his car. [...] "One of the reasons <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to sing as a ventriloquist was because I like singing in the car," [...] Fator says. [...] "I’d see other people singing in the car, and they looked goofy, so I’d do it without moving my lips." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paris {{was a city}} which McTell {{revisited}} frequently. Late in 1965 he and {{a friend}} from Croydon took a room in a cheap hotel on the Left Bank, earning their rent by busking cinema queues. After braving a bitterly cold Paris winter, McTell met a young American, Gary Petersen, who had studied with the legendary guitarist Reverend Gary Davis. [...] "There was a great anticipation every time I got to play with (Petersen)," [...] McTell recalled. [...] "Each time I learned something new, and through him <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to play ragtime properly." ...|$|E

While in high school she landed some {{modeling}} assignments and a small role in the film The Owl and the Pussycat (1970) and in which Chambers was credited as Evelyn Lang.

40|$|This book {{presents}} {{a compendium of}} research papers that report {{on the effect of}} the Let Me Learn Process when applied within different learning contexts. The different contributors to this compendium address the same basic questions: <b>How</b> do <b>I</b> <b>learn?</b> <b>How</b> do others <b>learn?</b> <b>How</b> can such knowledge of <b>how</b> learners <b>learn</b> inform my practice? Over the past 20 years, the data generated by gathering responses to these basic questions has helped us refine our understanding of the learning process and has helped learners make learning work for them. This volume {{presents a}}pplications of the Let Me Learn Process within various fields of practice namely Professional Development, reflective practice and leadership; Higher Education and academic advising and the final part deals with studies related to a pedagogy of difference and student achievement.

Then over the years there were artists like Sinéad O’Connor and Siouxsie from Siouxsie and the Banshees and even Peter Harvey was doing it.

2500|$|After the war, Morath {{worked as}} a {{translator}} and journalist. In 1948, she was hired by Warren Trabant, first as Vienna Correspondent and later as the Austrian editor, for Heute, an illustrated magazine published by the Office of War Information in Munich. Morath encountered photographer Ernst Haas in post-war Vienna, and brought his work to Trabant's attention. Working together for Heute, Morath wrote articles to accompany Haas' pictures. In 1949, Morath and Haas were invited by Robert Capa to join the newly founded Magnum Photos in Paris, where she started as an editor. Working with contact sheets sent into the Magnum office by founding member Henri Cartier-Bresson fascinated Morath.

2500|$|Maddux was {{renowned for}} {{focusing}} on the outside corner. This approach was emphasized under former Atlanta Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone. He would begin by throwing strikes with his fastball down and away, then expand the strike zone with his changeup—sometimes obtaining borderline strike calls from umpires simply {{on the strength of}} his reputation. In complement with this strategy, Maddux popularized a tactic of throwing his two-seam fastball off the plate inside to left-handed hitters, only to have the ball break back over the inside corner for a strike. Maddux said of that pitch, [...] "That was just my normal fastball that did that. ... I always had it. The pitch really started to work for me when <b>I</b> ... <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to throw a cutter, it made that pitch more effective." ...|$|E

From age 16 to... well, I started at 15. I started my apprenticeship at 16 and finished when I was 21. Stayed till I was 22, and moved along. I finished welding when I was 24. When I came here, as an apprentice, there was six ships being built, right where I'm standing. It was {{an extraordinary}} place. A hive of activity. Welders, caulkers, platers, burners, joiners, engineers, electricians. <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> men talked to one another, and how merciless Glasgow humour can be.

As he recalled, “I had lost millions in pig-farming and that was the reason I decided to become a footballer again.” Cruyff insisted that his decision to resume his playing career in the United States was pivotal in his career. “It was wrong, a mistake, to quit playing at 31 with the unique talent I possessed,” and adding that “Starting from zero in America, many miles away from my past, {{was one of the best}} decisions I made. There <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to develop my uncontrolled ambitions, to think as a coach and about sponsorship.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Safina {{was born}} in Moscow, Russia to Tatar parents. Her mother, Rauza Islanova, was her trainer when she was younger; while her father is {{director}} of the Spartak tennis club in Moscow. Her brother Marat is a former world No. 1 on the ATP Tour. Speaking of growing up in such a successful tennis family, Safina stated: [...] "Being the little sister in such a big tennis family is not an easy situation. Maybe that's why it took me longer to develop. My father is very competitive, but my parents didn't put pressure on me. I wanted to find my identity. I wanted to be something by myself, like being a big player by myself. So at the beginning I was putting too much pressure on myself. But then gradually I found myself, and <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> to do better with that situation." [...] At age 8, Safina and her family moved to Valencia, Spain, and as a result Safina speaks fluent Spanish as well as Russian and English.|$|E
