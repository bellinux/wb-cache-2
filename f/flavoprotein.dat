25|$|In biochemistry, flavin adenine {{dinucleotide}} (FAD) is a redox cofactor, {{more specifically}} a prosthetic group of a protein, involved in several important enzymatic reactions in metabolism. A <b>flavoprotein</b> is a protein that contains a flavin moiety, this {{may be in the}} form of FAD or flavin mononucleotide (FMN). There are many flavoproteins besides components of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, including α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, some examples are shown in section 6.|$|E
25|$|Massey did {{his thesis}} work with Malcolm Dixon. His thesis project {{revolved}} around the enzyme fumarase, {{which is not a}} <b>flavoprotein.</b> However, Massey was exposed to flavins in the lab through working with other students. After completing his thesis, he moved to the United States for a summer to work with Robert A. Alberty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Here, he continued studying fumarase and published in 1954 possibly the first thorough paper studying steady-state kinetics of an enzyme as a function of pH.|$|E
25|$|Glutathione reductase is a {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and FAD-dependent enzyme, and {{the major}} <b>flavoprotein</b> in erythrocyte. The measurement of the activity coefficient of erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGR) is the preferred method for assessing riboflavin status. It provides a measure of tissue saturation and long-term riboflavin status. In vitro enzyme activity in terms of activity coefficients (AC) is determined both with and without the addition of FAD to the medium. ACs represent a ratio of the enzyme’s activity with FAD to the enzyme’s activity without FAD. An AC of 1.2 to 1.4, riboflavin status is considered low when FAD is added to stimulate enzyme activity. An AC > 1.4 suggests riboflavin deficiency. On the other hand, if FAD is added and AC is < 1.2, then riboflavin status is considered acceptable. Tillotson and Bashor reported that a decrease in the intakes of riboflavin was associated with increase in EGR AC. In the UK study of Norwich elderly, initial EGR AC values {{for both males and females}} were significantly correlated with those measured 2 years later, suggesting that EGR AC may be a reliable measure of long-term biochemical riboflavin status of individuals. These findings are consistent with earlier studies.|$|E
25|$|There are 90 <b>flavo{{proteins}}</b> in {{the human}} genome; about 84% require FAD, and around 16% require FMN, whereas 5 proteins require both to be present. <b>Flavoproteins</b> are mainly located in the mitochondria because of their redox power. Of all <b>flavoproteins,</b> 90% perform redox reactions and the other 10% are transferases, lyases, isomerases, ligases.|$|R
40|$|This Ph. D. thesis {{addresses}} the structural {{characterization of the}} unique family of tetrameric <b>flavoproteins</b> WrbA, the role of which {{in the life of}} cells is still largely unknown but its enzymatic activity and expression properties implicate it in the cell protection against oxidative stress. Proteins of the WrbA family were proved to carry out two-electron reductions of quinones and in this way to prevent generation of the free radicals, similarly to other <b>flavoproteins</b> known as quinone oxidoreductases. Crystal structures of the liganded and unliganded forms of the prototypical WrbA from Escherichia coli were determined. Comparative analyses of these structures with the related <b>flavoproteins</b> were intended to identify and explain the defining structural features of the WrbA family and to clarify its structural and functional relationships to the other <b>flavoproteins...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Flavoproteins</b> are {{involved}} in a wide array of biological processes, including, but by no means limited to, bioluminescence, removal of radicals contributing to oxidative stress, photosynthesis, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The spectroscopic properties of the flavin cofactor make it a natural reporter for changes occurring within the active site; this makes <b>flavoproteins</b> one of the most-studied enzyme families.|$|R
500|$|Electron {{transfer}} flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-Q oxidoreductase), {{also known}} as electron transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase, is a third entry point to the electron transport chain. It is an enzyme that accepts electrons from electron-transferring <b>flavoprotein</b> in the mitochondrial matrix, and uses these electrons to reduce ubiquinone. This enzyme contains a flavin and a [...] cluster, but, unlike the other respiratory complexes, it attaches {{to the surface of}} the membrane and does not cross the lipid bilayer.|$|E
500|$|Nitrogenase is {{the most}} {{important}} enzyme involved in nitrogen fixation. Azotobacter species have several types of nitrogenase. The basic one is molybdenum-iron nitrogenase. An alternative type contains vanadium; it is independent of molybdenum ions and is more active than the Mo-Fe nitrogenase at low temperatures. So it can fix nitrogen at temperatures as low as 5°C, and its low-temperature activity is 10 times higher than that of Mo-Fe nitrogenase. An important role in maturation of Mo-Fe nitrogenase plays the so-called P-cluster. Synthesis of nitrogenase is controlled by the nif genes. Nitrogen fixation is regulated by the enhancer protein NifA and the [...] "sensor" [...] <b>flavoprotein</b> NifL which modulates the activation of gene transcription of nitrogen fixation by redox-dependent switching. This regulatory mechanism, relying on two proteins forming complexes with each other, is uncommon for other systems.|$|E
