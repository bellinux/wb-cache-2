500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on the album drew their lyrics from real life relationships. [...] "Peachy" [...] {{documents}} the permanent breakup of a relationship that had inspired her 2004 single [...] "Ten Days". [...] "Where I Stood", which Higgins calls [...] "a pretty sad love song", describes the end of another relationship. She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you just feel that leaving this person is something you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels {{in love with her}} I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|Christian Clemenson went to Harvard with Cuse {{but still}} {{went through the}} normal {{audition}} channels to get the part of Poole. Clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of the lead roles in a television show because of the long time commitments involved. He later said, [...] "The similarities between this show and The Wild Wild West, and my character to that show's Artemus Gordon, was an important hook for me. It {{was one of my}} favorite shows growing up, and as soon as I saw that Brisco County was based on the same kind of material and attitude as that show, I called my agent and said, 'I'll do anything I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this. Clemenson applied his experiences at Ivy League schools to play the uptight Poole. Praising Clemenson's work on Brisco, Cuse said, [...] "You can't give him anything he's not capable of doing. He adds the voice of intelligence and caution to balance our cast".|$|E

500|$|Lecrae {{attended}} a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest {{was to meet}} girls and experience the big city. When {{he arrived at the}} conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group The Cross Movement. Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> me out of this, just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E

Everywhere was control, control, control; and she really began to despair. There were examinations, and training, and applications to the surgeon-general, and to the assistant surgeon, and to special heads of departments and districts and States and counties, for all I know. There was positively no end to the things she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a regular appointment to go forth and do her duty to her country. So she threw up the whole business of regular army nursing, and made up her mind {{to go out into the}} field of duty to which she had appointed herself, and do the things she ought to do in the way she thought they ought to be done. She likened herself to the knights of old who used to go forth to fight for their ladies and for the upholding of chivalry. She wanted to be a sort of a free-lance, but she did not want to hire herself to anybody. She did not fancy being anything like a guerilla, and then it suddenly struck her that if she did just as she wanted to do she would resemble a bushwhacker more than anything else. A bushwhacker is an honest man. When there is no war he whacks bushes, that is, he cuts them down; and when there is a war--" ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The 2013 Defence White Paper places greater {{emphasis}} than its predecessors on defence engagement, {{and begins to}} link regional security to the defence of Australia itself.

Overall, the White Paper moves towards a reinterpretation of ‘self-reliance’ that focuses more {{on the way in}} which Australia would operate in a coalition conflict, but developing a new defence strategy that links force structure, posture and employment to the achievement of Australia’s strategic objectives is left to future White Papers...|$|R
