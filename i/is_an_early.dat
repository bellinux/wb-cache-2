5|$|However, {{studies of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{indicate that the}} russet sparrow <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> offshoot or basal species among the Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows. While mitochrondrial DNA suggests speciation in Passer occurred during the Miocene and Pliocene, British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith estimated that the russet sparrow separated from the other Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the last glacial period. During this time, sparrows would have been isolated in ice-free refugia, such as the lower Yangtze valley, which Summers-Smith considered the most likely centre of evolution for the russet sparrow.|$|E
5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> {{step in the}} gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the}} influence of high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E
