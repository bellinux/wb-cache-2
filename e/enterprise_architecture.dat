40|$|Despite {{the hype}} {{surrounding}} <b>enterprise</b> <b>architectures,</b> they have delivered little on their promise. In this paper, {{we argue that}} <b>enterprise</b> <b>architectures</b> built using component-based frameworks are fundamentally flawed, in that they model the enterprise {{as a set of}} independent structures with discrete boundaries. Disparate concrete metaphors are used to describe each of these structures, with the result that <b>enterprise</b> <b>architectures</b> can only achieve partial success, at best, in providing a unified view of the enterprise.

Under the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) leadership, the president's fiscal year 2003 budget proposes 24 e-government initiatives, most involving multiple agencies. These initiatives have laudable goals, including the elimination of redundant, nonintegrated business operations and systems which could save billions of dollars.

25|$|The Information Systems Architecture is {{designed}} to be a classification schema for organizing architecture models.

25|$|In the 1980s John Zachman {{had been}} {{involved}} at IBM {{in the development of}} business system planning (BSP), a method for analyzing, defining and designing an information architecture of organizations. In 1982 Zachman had already concluded that these analyses could reach far beyond automating systems design and managing data into the realms of strategic business planning and management science in general. It may be employed in the (in that time considered more esoteric) areas of <b>enterprise</b> <b>architecture,</b> data-driven systems design, data classification criteria, and more.|$|E
25|$|The Zachman Framework is an {{enterprise}} ontology {{and is a}} fundamental structure for <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Architecture</b> which provides a formal and structured way of viewing and defining {{an enterprise}}. The ontology is a two dimensional classification schema that reflects the intersection between two historical classifications. The first are primitive interrogatives: What, How, When, Who, Where, and Why. The second {{is derived from the}} philosophical concept of reification, the transformation of an abstract idea into an instantiation. The Zachman Framework reification transformations are: Identification, Definition, Representation, Specification, Configuration and Instantiation.|$|E
25|$|The Zachman Framework {{summarizes}} {{a collection}} of perspectives involved in <b>enterprise</b> <b>architecture.</b> These perspectives are represented in a two-dimensional matrix that defines along the rows the type of stakeholders and with the columns the aspects of the architecture. The framework does not define a methodology for an architecture. Rather, the matrix is a template that must be filled in by the goals/rules, processes, material, roles, locations, and events specifically required by the organization. Further modeling by mapping between columns in the framework identifies gaps in the documented state of the organization.|$|E

40|$|This book {{presents}} emerging {{trends in}} the evolution of service-oriented and <b>enterprise</b> <b>architectures.</b> New architectures and methods of both business and IT are integrating services to support mobility systems, internet of things, ubiquitous computing, collaborative and adaptive business processes, big data, and cloud ecosystems. They inspire current and future digital strategies and create new opportunities for the digital transformation of next digital products and services. Services Oriented <b>Architectures</b> (SOA) and <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Architectures</b> (EA) have emerged as a useful framework for developing interoperable, large-scale systems, typically implementing various standards, like web services, REST, and microservices. Managing the adaptation and evolution of such systems presents a great challenge. Service-Oriented Architecture enables flexibility through loose coupling, both between the services themselves and between the IT organizations that manage them. Enterprises evolve continuously by transforming and extending their services, processes and information systems. <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Architectures</b> provide a holistic blueprint to help define the structure and operation of an organization with the goal of determining how an organization can most effectively achieve its objectives. The book proposes several approaches to address the challenges of the service-oriented evolution of digital <b>enterprise</b> and software <b>architectures...</b>|$|R

Biological metaphors of living and adaptable ecosystems provide the logical foundation for self-optimizing and resilient run-time environments for intelligent business services and service-oriented <b>enterprise</b> <b>architectures.</b> Our aim is to support flexibility and agile transformations for both business domains and related information technology. The present research paper investigates mechanisms for decision analytics {{in the context of}} multi-perspective explorations of enterprise services and their digital <b>enterprise</b> <b>architectures</b> by extending original architecture reference models with state of art elements for agile architectural engineering for the digitization and collaborative architectural decision support.
