5000|$|Backed {{by some of}} his well-connected {{friends like}} millionaire statesman Bernard Baruch, McCrary {{convinced}} David Sarnoff, the chairman of RCA which owned NBC, to give the couple a morning show on the network's New York radio station, WEAF. The show was called [...] "Hi, Jinx" [...] and first aired on April 22, 1946. Reviews ranged from [...] "sprightly" [...] to [...] "rather intense discussions of foreign affairs." [...] In a cover story about the couple, Newsweek wrote: [...] "A soft-spoken, calculating Texan, Tex McCrary, inched up to the microphone and drawled 'Hi, Jinx.' A voice with all the <b>foam</b> <b>substance</b> of a bubble bath answered, 'Hello Tex.'" [...] Over time they {{came to be known}} as [...] "Mr. Brains and Mrs. Beauty." ...|$|R

The Vicis helmet is a new company that is {{producing}} helmets have a softer outer layer, so that upon impact, it gives a little bit before the blow reaches the brain, slowing down the impact. In addition, {{the inside of the}} helmet also has a <b>foam</b> like <b>substance</b> which also slow down impact and improve comfort for the player.|$|R
500|$|Small {{pieces of}} paper were sprayed as snow, which caused a problem as it scared the horses. However, the snow falling from {{the sky was a}} <b>foam</b> <b>substance.</b> The actors who played the dead bodies possessed by the Gelth had simple make-up, with just shading and contact lenses and no prosthetics. The {{production}} team was mindful of the programme's audience, and decided to not have any missing facial features. Originally, visual effects company The Mill planned the computer-generated effects (CGI) to just be the [...] "ethereal swirl", but in the seance scene they ran into the challenge of animating the Gelth's mouth. The Gelth turning red during the seance scene was a [...] "last-minute" [...] change to the visual effects. The Mill overshot their quota of CGI for the episode, and compensated with small swirls in shots that focused on other characters. The head speaking was in fact actress Zoe Thorne, who had been filmed separately and used as a template for animation. In other scenes, Thorne had the challenge of matching her voice-overs to the actors who portrayed the bodies animated by the Gelth.|$|R
40|$|Sulphides beared in tannery {{wastewater}} are harmful pollutant which beturned to disastrous {{hydrogen sulphide}} gas under acidic circumtances. The previous study on Sulphides Oxydation System of varied catalist (MnSO 4) added has not indicated a satisfactory result yet. The main {{objective of this}} study is to verify the merit of Mn++ dosage based on the sulphides content. Futher, whether or not it will be useful to optimize the oxydation process and economize the daily cost of tannery wastewater treatment. The data of sulpides content monitored during 12 hours oxidation period showed that there was significant difference between the curve (sulpides vs time) with Mn++ and the curve without Mn++ treated as the control. When a foamy oxydated wastewater appeared such as liming waste it would be a problem and the foam should be removed in such a way that not to be harmfull to the oxidation and other chemical processes. However, anti <b>foam</b> <b>substance</b> must be provided or introduced to clean Technology in the system. The experiment, observation and chemical tests data of this study gives proves the advantages of adding Mn++ in sulphides oxidation system. The catalist adding based on the sulphides content can be considered realistic...|$|R

40|$|REDEMPTION {{experiment}} for Rexus / Bexus programme {{allowed to}} test several solutions {{to use a}} particular <b>foam.</b> This <b>substance</b> is a bi-component poliuretanic foam which expands and becomes rigid. Thanks to REDEMPTION it has been possible to test this foam in near space conditions. One of the tests of REDEMPTION experiment was to use this foam like a inflatable rigid structure to deploy a boom. This test was a success also during ground test. This kind of boom can be deployed {{in a couple of}} seconds and thanks to a particular property of the foam can be bigger in volume than the two substances boarded on the space system. This boom could also supply a structure with good mechanical properties. Is a project completely conceived, designed and realised within the Space Robotic Laboratory (SRL) of the II Faculty of Engineering of the University of Bologna "ALMA MATER STUDIORUM", based on REDEMPTION (REmoval of DEbris using Material with Phase Transition: IONospherical tests) experiment has been selected to participate to REXUS/BEXUS 2012 Programme. REDEMPTION allowed to test several solutions to use a particular <b>foam.</b> This <b>substance</b> is a bi-component poliuretanic foam which expands and becomes rigid. The paper describes the IBS inflatable system's characteristics, the mission's configuration, concept, design, process, mechanical assembling and the expected results. © 2012 by the International Astronautical Federation...|$|R
50|$|A <b>foam</b> is a <b>substance</b> {{formed by}} {{trapping}} pockets of gas in a liquid or solid. A bath sponge {{and the head}} on a glass of beer are examples of foams. In most foams, the volume of gas is large, with thin films of liquid or solid separating the regions of gas.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{extinguishers}} use {{a variety}} of substances to put out fires; dry powder, dry chemical, water, halogenated, carbon and <b>foam.</b> Since different <b>substances</b> burn differently, fire extinguishers are labeled (and often color-coded) according to the type or class of fire they can extinguish. It is, therefore, necessary to choose the correct fire extinguisher for home use.|$|R
5000|$|Vanishing spray, {{also known}} as {{vanishing}} <b>foam,</b> is a <b>substance</b> applied to an association football pitch {{in order to provide}} a temporary visual marker. It is most often used by the referee to indicate the minimum distance that the defending team may position themselves from the ball during a direct free kick, as well as to indicate the spot from where the kick is taken. The spray appears similar to white paint or watered-down shaving foam when initially applied. It completely disappears within a minute, leaving no visible residue behind.|$|R
5000|$|Preparations {{to produce}} a foam bath must be able at high {{dilution}} in water of common [...] "hardness" [...] {{to produce a}} foam and hold it for a useful duration. This is practically always done primarily {{by the action of}} an anionic, nonionic, or zwitterionic surfactant. Although cationic surfactants could theoretically be used, for various reasons they are not. Typically a mixture of different surfactants is used. Of the anionics, soap is not a common deliberate constituent of bath foam preparations because they react rapidly with [...] "hardness" [...] cations in water to produce lime soaps, which are anti-foams. Usually one or more ingredients is primarily a <b>foam</b> stabilizer—a <b>substance</b> which retards the breakage of foams; these may themselves be surfactants or film-stabilizing polymers. Some surfactants used in foaming preparations may have a combination of foam-producing and foam-stabilizing properties. Surfactants used in bath foam preparations may also be included for primarily non-foaming purposes: solubilization of other components in the manufacturing of a liquid product, or lime soap dispersion to prevent bathtub ring when used with soap.|$|R
40|$|Poly- and perfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs) are environmental pollutants used in {{many products}} such as outdoor clothing, food packaging, cleaning agents and fire-fighting <b>foam.</b> The <b>substances</b> have been detected in tap water in countries {{all over the world}} and pose risks to human health. Conventional water treatment methods are ineffective as PFAS removal techniques, but ion exchange has proved to be more efficient. Ion exchange water treatment was tested on drinking water containing 14 PFASs in an experimental study in Uppsala 2014 - 2015. In this thesis a model of the experiment was developed using the computer program PHREEQC. The aim was to investigate and discuss the removal efficiency of the 14 PFASs, focusing on differences in functional groups, chain lengths and evaluating the treatment method in a long-term perspective. The simulations from the PHREEQC model showed that the ion exchanger was effectively saturated after 900 days and that the adsorption increased with increasing chain length. In a comparison of the eight-chained PFASs, PFOS was most adsorbed, FOSA was the second most adsorbed and PFNA was the least adsorbed substance. The PFSAs were more efficiently removed than the corresponding chain lengths of PFCAs. The limit of action was exceeded after just a few days but the tolerable daily intake was exceeded first after 220 days...|$|R
