His imagination was fired early by the Irish nationalist movement and these combined influences, together with his family's Scottish roots, led to his development as a prominent Gaelic nationalist, whose compelling dream was of a self-governing Celtic Scotland. As essential steps towards the realization of this dream he was actively involved in the fostering of Gaelic consciousness and in the extension of Gaelic usage, especially in the written form. He hoped that a significant extension of Gaelic literary range would contribute to the raising of literary standards, in a reaction against what he saw as the <b>down-grading</b> influence of music-hall and ‘pop’ culture on Gaelic verse {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a matching model {{that allows for}} classical and frictional unemployment. The labor market is dual featuring low-skilled and high-skilled workers and simple and complex jobs. Simple jobs pay a minimum wage, while wages in the complex jobs are determined by Nash bargaining. Opportunities for low-skilled workers are limited to simple jobs; while high-skilled unemployed can apply for both types of jobs, and thereby can accept to be downgraded. We analyze the outcomes of simple job subsidy policies assuming that government budget is balanced thr ough taxes on occupied workers. We ﬁ rst give conditi ons for the existence and uniqueness of a steady-state equilibrium and we then analyze the effects of different ﬁscal instruments. We show that in this set-up, increasing simple job sub sidies does not necessarily reduce low-skilled unemployment or unemployment spells. By introducing heterogeneous skills and possible <b>down-grading</b> of the high-skilled workers, we show that the effectiveness of such policies in reducing the classical unemployment is decreasing. In fact, any additional classical unemployed re-entering the job market is accompanied by {{an increasing number of}} high-skilled workers downgrading to low-skilled jobs.

For the up-graded films with barium concentration (1 - x) increasing across the film thickness in the direction from the film/substrate interface to the film surface, the full width at half maximum of the BST film (200) rocking curve and the surface roughness, examined by atomic force microscopy, were larger {{than those of the}} <b>down-graded</b> films with barium concentration decreasing from the film/substrate interface to the film surface. The dielectric properties of the graded films, measured using vertical structures, show that at room temperature, the dielectric constant (εr) and dissipation factor (tan δ) at 100 kHz were 380 and 0. 013 for the up-graded films, and 650 and 0. 010 for the <b>down-graded</b> films, respectively.

Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and electron diffraction show that the graded films grow epitaxially with their (100) plane parallel to the (100) surface of the MgO single-crystal substrate, and with an in-plane orientation relationship of 〈 001 〉BST//〈 001 〉LSCO// 〈 001 〉MgO. The crystalline quality and surface morphology of the graded films are closely related to the direction of the compositional gradient built into the graded films. <b>Down-graded</b> films (starting with a BaTiO 3 layer at the film/substrate interface) have a much better crystalline quality and a smoother surface than the up-graded films (starting with a (Ba 0. 75 Sr 0. 25) TiO 3 layer at the film/substrate interface).

40|$|The {{formulation}} of canopy evaporation is investigated {{on the basis}} of the combination equation derived from the Penman equation. All the elementary resistances (surface and boundary layer) within the canopy are taken into account and the exchange surfaces are assumed to be subject to the same vapour pressure deficit at canopy source height. This development leads to generalized combination equations: one for completely dry canopies and the other for partially wet canopies. These equations are rather complex because they involve the partitioning of available energy within the canopy and between the wet and dry surfaces. By making some assumptions and approximations, they can provide simpler equations similar to the common Penman–Monteith model. One of the basic assumptions of this <b>down-grading</b> process is to consider that the available energy intercepted by the different elements making up the canopy is uniformly distributed and proportional to their respective area. Despite the somewhat unrealistic character of this hypothesis, it allows one to retrieve the simple formulations commonly and successfully used up to now.

There {{does not appear to}} be a single cause for Black Point, although evidence suggests that fungal infection is the main link to Black Point symptoms. We sought to identify grain proteins from Black Point-affected and Black Point-free wheat cultivar SUN 239 V, which is known to be very susceptible to Black Point. The proteomes of both the germ and endosperm-bran components of Black Point-affected and Black Point-free grain were compared using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) with six replicate gels run for each protein sample. Approximately 1478 discrete protein spots were found in 2 -DE gels from the germ fraction of the grain, of which 354 were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Similarly, 1360 discrete protein spots were found from the endosperm-bran fraction, of which 303 were identified by MS. No proteins of fungal or bacterial origin were positively identified, suggesting that, at least in some cases, Black Point is not associated with microbial activity. Of the germ proteins, 252 were differentially expressed in Black Point-affected tissue, with 67 of these proteins identified by MS. Of the endosperm-bran proteins, 317 were differentially expressed in Black Point-affected tissue, with 86 identified.

40|$|The UK`s Equal Opportunities Commission has {{recently}} drawn {{attention to the}} `hidden brain drain` when women working part-time are employed in jobs below their level of educational attainment and/or previous experience. These inferences were based on self-reporting. We give an objective and quantitative analysis {{of the nature of}} occupational change as women make the transition between full-time and part-time work. In order to analyse <b>down-grading</b> we construct an occupational classification which supports a ranking of occupations by the average level of qualification of those employed there on a full-time basis. We note that the incidence (and by implication the availability) of part-time work differs across occupations, and that occupational concentration is more acute for part-time work. Using a large sample of panel observations over the period 1991 - 2001 we show that women moving from full- to part-time work are approximately twice as likely to move down as up the occupational ladder, while those moving from part-time back to full-time work {{are twice as likely to}} be moving up than down the ranking. These effects are particularly marked when a change of employer is involved. Not all women are equally at risk of downgrading. It is particularly likely among women in management positions; over one-third of women in managerial or high-skilled clerical/administrative jobs downgrade when they move into part-time employment. But women in some occupations with higher specific skill requirements and where employees may have a stronger sense of vocation, notably teaching and nursing, are much less likely to experience downgrading. Nonetheless, 20 % of teachers and nurses who change employer and switch into part-time work move downwards.
