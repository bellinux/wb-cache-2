500|$|Two weeks {{following}} his announcement, Bayh {{withdrew from the}} race, citing that [...] "the odds were longer than I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> responsibly pursue". He further commented that a run would cause him to be [...] "absent from the Senate...instead of working {{to help the people}} of my state and the nation." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{responded to}} all these songs on an {{emotional}} level, when I first heard them. I wanted songs I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell with my own voice, and interpret them authentically ... But {{it was important to}} maintain the emotional integrity and the heart of the song. It was a high priority to keep true to the songs.|$|E
500|$|For {{the music}} to , O'Donnell began work on {{crafting}} the game's themes before Salvatori joined the team in February 2009. [...] "Marty [...] had started writing before me, and sent me some of his ideas," [...] Salvatori said. [...] "I picked a few that I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> add some magic to, and worked on those. I also came up with several ideas that I sent to Marty that {{he put his hands}} on." [...] Once the duo felt they had enough material, the Chicago-based Salvatori flew to Bungie in Seattle to complete the arrangements and record live musicians.|$|E

500|$|The script served its diversionary purpose, and the Coens put it aside: [...] "Barton Fink sort of {{washed out}} our brain {{and we were}} able to go back and finish Miller's Crossing." [...] Once {{production}} of the first movie was finished, the Coens began to recruit staff to film Barton Fink. Turturro looked forward to playing the lead role, and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to coordinate views on the project: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bring something more human to Barton. Joel and Ethan allowed me a certain contribution. I tried to go a little further than they expected." ...|$|E
500|$|Alaphilippe's second-place finish was {{the best}} for any French rider since Laurent Jalabert in 1998. He had entered the race in support of Kwiatkowski. When Kwiatkowski was {{struggling}} on the Côte de Saint-Nicolas, the Etixx-Quick Step directeur sportif sent a radio message to Alaphilippe to ride for himself; this {{was similar to the}} events in La Flèche Wallonne, where Alaphilippe also finished second to Valverde. He was frustrated on the finish line and waved his arm in the air; he said after the race [...] "today I really <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have done something more". Cyclingnews.com suggested after the race that he had the potential to win a Monument in the future.|$|E
500|$|During the series' {{third season}} in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested Development having {{been picked up}} by the cable {{television}} network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network. As Hurwitz explained, [...] "I had taken it as far as I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> as a series. I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where I {{think a lot of the}} actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms of the quality of the show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, [...] "If there's a way to continue this in a form that's not weekly episodic series television, I'd be up for it".|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stand this no longer. [...] "Yes," [...] I said indignantly, [...] "I {{know all}} about the school, and I don't call his conduct disgraceful either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered; [...] "I <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{at least}} wash the plates. In a way, it wasn't {{altogether}} my fault that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do nothing else. You see, I was never taught to cook." ...|$|R
60|$|Kantos Kan {{had shown}} me {{a trick of}} gearing, which is known only to the navy of Helium, that greatly {{increased}} the speed of our machines, so that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>I</b> <b>could</b> distance my pursuers if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> dodge their projectiles for a few moments.|$|R
500|$|Although it {{was decided}} he has a sister, {{a wife and a}} daughter, Meyer's {{personal}} life is rarely mentioned on screen, enabling viewers to perceive him as a strong man onto whom they can [...] "project whatever they want from their own imagination." [...] Irving believes that modern television drama is populated by characters prone to disclosing everything about themselves, and so feels that having an enigmatic character like Meyer, who behaves in the reserved vein of Humphrey Bogart and Spencer Tracy, makes for a [...] "refreshing change". He commented that revealing more of Meyer's personal life would be anticlimatic compared to viewers' expectations. As preparation for the role, Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital, deeming the experience an [...] "enormous privilege". He had a [...] "real fascination" [...] with medicine and the human body prior to assuming the role, and considered studying biology at university. Upon receiving the script for the first episode of Holby City, Irving felt immediately connected to Meyer, commenting: [...] "I knew instinctively how he moved, how he spoke, what he <b>felt.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> feel his heartbeat." ...|$|E
500|$|McEwen faced {{questions}} about the bounced checks he had written on the House bank. Buchert ran campaign commercials citing McEwen's checks, the expenses of his Congressional office, and his campaign finance disclosures, while noting Portman was [...] "the handpicked choice of the downtown money crowd" [...] and was [...] "a registered foreign agent for the biggest Democrat lobbying firm in Washington," [...] labeling Portman and McEwen [...] "Prince Rob and Bouncing Bob." [...] McEwen, who had taken a hard-line on his checks in 1992, relented in the campaign. Martin Gottlieb wrote, [...] "McEwen says now that his problem {{was a form of}} excessive pride. He says he used to 'demand perfection' of himself." [...] McEwen also said, [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never admit a mistake.... I am very, very sorry. I should have watched it more carefully.... I have learned a great deal." [...] Les Spaeth, chairman of the Warren County Republican Party and former Warren County Auditor, said, [...] "People very much disliked the check overdraft thing, but I think they don't see it as happening again. I think it's past. He made a mistake and he got caught. But that's overridden by the service he's given, particularly to our county." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout all this, Gladstone was {{supported}} {{not only by}} the popular and charismatic Rosebery but also by an array of well-dressed women including Lady Rosebery and Gladstone's daughter Mary. These fashionable people– the celebrities of their day (newspapers at the time gave many column inches each day to the doings of the upper classes)– were as much a crowd-puller as the political speakers, and Rosebery's planning used that to full effect. One meeting was so packed that many were fainting: 70,000 people applied for tickets in a hall capable of holding 6,500. Lady Rosebery reported, [...] "I had never heard Archie (Lord Rosebery) speak in public politically before, but after the first minute I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never be nervous at his making a speech the audience show him great affection." [...] However it was not just Gladstone and Rosebery the huge crowds had come to see, but also the dutifully supporting and smiling families. Lady Rosebery went on to describe how [...] "They (the crowds) patted me on the back till my shoulders were sensitive." [...] Thus in Rosebery's first serious involvement in politics, Disraeli was defeated and the newly elected MP for Midlothian became Prime Minister for the second time (the caretaker liberal leader Lord Hartington retired in favour of Gladstone). It was also obvious that Lady Rosebery was a very evident and valuable political electioneering asset. As the Marquess of Crewe put it [...] "she had cut her spurs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he said, [...] "you {{are always}} beautiful." [...] Then his manner became deprecatory. [...] "I didn't think you'd mind. In one way what I owe you {{makes me a}} privileged person. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> venture----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, Dan'l,' {{returned}} Mrs. Gummidge, whimpering {{and shaking}} her head. 'If <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> less, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do more. You don't feel like me, Dan'l; thinks don't go contrary with you, nor you with them; {{you had better}} do it yourself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could see}} {{everything}} spread out below me, {{as close as}} I see you; I was hovering like a buzzard hawk. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> come down exactly where I wanted. It was fascinating. I had perfect power, Stacey." ...|$|R

2500|$|Pilot Robert White {{commented on}} his high {{altitude}} X-15 flights, [...] "My flights to 217,000 feet [...] and 314,750 feet [...] were very dramatic in revealing the Earth's curvature... at my highest altitude I could turn my head through a 180-degree arc and wow!— the Earth is really round. At my peak altitude I was roughly over the Arizona/California {{border in the}} area of Las Vegas, and this was how I described it: Looking to my left I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> spit into the Gulf of California; looking to my right I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> toss a dime into San Francisco Bay." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrea Leadsom, who was energy {{minister}} and May's primary competitor for party leader, was made the new environment secretary. However, former Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers resigned from Cabinet after May {{offered her a}} post which was [...] "not one which I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> take on". Nearly half of the May ministry are women.|$|E
60|$|BURGE. God knows <b>I</b> {{have often}} <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not go on}} {{if it had not}} been for the sense that I was only an {{instrument}} in the hands of a Power above us.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a written}} secret, I believe, but I--I--do not know. He told me never {{to show it}} to any but a white man--to one whom <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> trust. May <b>I</b> trust you?" [...] she asked, looking me full in the face.|$|R
60|$|I {{had seen}} the thing so many times during my life within Pellucidar that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{anticipate}} to a nicety precisely what I was about to witness. I hoped that the hunters would prove friendly {{and be able to}} direct me toward Sari.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{have been}} every size in my life. I’ve been {{smaller than a}} zero, up through a size 16. I’ve had lots of issues with body image and weight my whole life and it really took {{a great deal of}} work to {{recognize}} that at all those weights, no matter how I <b>felt,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> still find a dress that made me feel sexy and powerful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days before}} the HELP {{confirmation}} hearing, former Surgeon General Richard Carmona went public with claims that the Bush Administration censored his speeches and buried his scientific reports. When asked about this at the hearing, Holsinger said, [...] "If I were faced with a situation that I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not in good conscience do, I think I have a clear response to that. I would resign." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Scalia {{was willing}} to accept that the Eighth Amendment {{contained}} a gross disproportionality requirement [...] "if I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> intelligently apply it." [...] However, because a criminal sentence can have many justificationsnot simply retribution, a goal to which proportionality is inherently linked {{he thought it was}} impossible to intelligently apply a proportionality requirement to non-capital sentences. [...] Even so, Justice Scalia concurred in the judgment that Ewing's sentence was constitutional.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{upon that}} afternoon, {{whether it was}} the Beaune which I had taken with my lunch, or the {{additional}} exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner, <b>I</b> suddenly <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hold out no longer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no!" [...] cried Jones, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{so deeply}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not speak. Jim, who always wanted Navvy to {{be a dead}} Indian, looked profoundly sorry.|$|R
60|$|I was so irate at his audacity, so disgusted that {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not bear}} {{the sight of him}} any longer. I turned my back on him and walked out of my own private room, leaving him there still munching my sausage and drinking my Bordeaux.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the second}} day, Collingwood {{completed}} his century, falling for 129 when Durham were 229 for 4. The last six Durham wickets then added 57 {{to leave them}} with a lead of 115. Liam Plunkett, who had taken eight wickets {{in the first game}} but conceded 55 runs for no wicket in the first innings in this second game, then returned to knock out three top-order wickets. The rest of the bowling unit performed well, and Steve Harmison took a hat-trick on his way to five for 61. Harmison later said, [...] "The way I was feeling, my tail was up and I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go through them. The position they were in I don’t think they were too keen to hang around. Before the last ball , I felt confident. It was a decent ball in a decent area and I was glad when he [...] chopped it on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heirens took full {{responsibility}} for the three murders on August 7, 1946. The prosecution had him reenact the crime in the Degnan home in public {{and in front of}} the press. On September 4, with Heirens's parents and the victims' families attending and Chief Justice Harold G. Ward presiding, Heirens admitted his guilt on the burglary and murder charges. That night, Heirens tried to hang himself in his cell, timed to coincide during a shift change of the prison guards. He was discovered before he died. He said later that despair drove him to attempt suicide:Everyone believed I was guilty...If I weren't alive, I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> avoid being adjudged guilty by the law and thereby gain some victory. But I wasn't successful even at that. ...Before I walked into the courtroom my counsel told me to just enter a plea of guilty and keep my mouth shut afterward. I didn't even have a trial...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, Barlow {{was unable to}} {{reconcile}} his ardent libertarianism with the prevailing neoconservative movement, and [...] "didn't feel tempted to vote for Bush"; in 2004, {{he said that he}} was [...] "voting for John Kerry, though with little enthusiasm". Barlow has subsequently declared that he is a Republican, most notably during an appearance on The Colbert Report on March 26, 2007, and has also claimed on many occasions to be an anarchist. Barlow has said he voted for Natural Law Party Presidential candidate John Hagelin in 2000 after discovering in the voting booth that his friend Nat Goldhaber was Hagelin's running mate. He said in 2004: [...] "I'm embarrassed for my country that in my entire voting life, there has never been a major-party candidate whom I <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> vote for. All of my presidential votes, whether for George Wallace, Dick Gregory, or John Hagelin, have been protest votes." [...] Barlow condemned Donald Trump in November 2016, characterizing him as a [...] "thorough creep" [...] and [...] "toxic asshole" [...] in a Facebook [...] "micromanifesto".|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{was passing}} through Casterbridge,' he said, with faltering deference, 'and I {{walked out to}} ask after your ladyship's health. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do no less; and, of course, to pay my respects to your good husband, my {{heretofore}} acquaintance [...] .

60|$|In the end <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not. Yes, <b>I</b> turned coward {{and saying}} that I must fetch {{something}} out of the waggon, bolted into it, bidding Hans go forward and repeat his tale.
