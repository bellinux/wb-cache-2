50|$|Basic jumps - {{to prove}} the student's ability to safely exit the aircraft, then fly and land a canopy. The student {{must be able to}} go into the stable arched {{position}} out of the aircraft before being progressed to <b>dummy</b> <b>ripcord</b> <b>pulls.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Dummy</b> <b>ripcord</b> <b>pulls</b> (DPs) - {{the student}} {{demonstrates}} {{the ability to}} <b>pull</b> a <b>dummy</b> <b>ripcord</b> while still using the static line to actually deploy the canopy. Generally the student must perform three satisfactory DPs in sequence {{to be allowed to}} progress onto freefall. A successful DP is counted as one in which the student not only manages to pull the handle, but also manages to keep an arched position facing {{in the same direction as}} when they jumped.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of using an RSL is a faster reserve parachute deployment compared with using emergency handles alone; after a cut-away, the RSL will usually activate before the reserve deployment <b>ripcord</b> is <b>pulled.</b> However, proper emergency procedures require the reserve <b>ripcord</b> to be <b>pulled</b> {{in the event}} that the RSL is disconnected or not functioning correctly. An RSL also offers protection in the event a jumper cuts-away but does not (or can not) reach for the reserve deployment handle.|$|R
50|$|Langar {{airfield}} {{was originally}} a World War II bomber base, {{home to the}} RAF 207 Squadron between 1942 and 1943, but is now operating solely as a civilian drop zone. British Parachute Schools has been based at the airfield since 1977. British Parachute Schools {{was set up by}} Tom Sawyer and he encouraged use by universities. One of the first was Loughborough University who moved from Peterborough Parachute Centre after a chance meeting between Tom and Ian Parker, chairman of the university club. Parker's final year project was an analysis of parachute <b>ripcord</b> <b>pull</b> forces after a stiff pull on his first free fall.|$|R
5000|$|Bungee cords {{have been}} used to provide a {{lightweight}} suspension for aircraft undercarriages from before World War I, and are still used on many small homebuilt aircraft where weight remains critical. [...] Bungee cords were also used in parachuting to assist in opening the old-style parachute container after the <b>ripcord</b> was <b>pulled.</b>|$|R
50|$|A ripcord {{is a part}} of a skydiving harness-container system; {{a handle}} {{attached}} to a steel cable ending in a closing pin. The pin keeps the container closed and keeps the spring-loaded pilot chute inside. When the <b>ripcord</b> is <b>pulled,</b> the container is opened and the pilot chute is released, opening the parachute. On tandem systems the ripcord releases the 3-ring release system anchoring the bridle to the harness-container, allowing the parachute to open.|$|R
50|$|Reserve parachutes {{usually have}} a ripcord {{deployment}} system, which was first designed by Theodore Moscicki, but most modern main parachutes used by sports parachutists use a form of hand-deployed pilot chute. A <b>ripcord</b> system <b>pulls</b> a closing pin (sometimes multiple pins), which releases a spring-loaded pilot chute, and opens the container; the pilot chute is then propelled into the air stream by its spring, then uses the force generated by passing air to extract a deployment bag containing the parachute canopy, {{to which it is}} attached via a bridle. A hand-deployed pilot chute, once thrown into the air stream, pulls a closing pin on the pilot chute bridle to open the container, then the same force extracts the deployment bag. There are variations on hand-deployed pilot chutes, but the system described is the more common throw-out system.|$|R
25|$|A typical annual {{training}} programme for 12 Squadron consisted of individual {{training in the}} autumn, working up to Squadron training in the summer consisting of bombing, formation flying, navigation exercises and gunnery. Experimental trials carried out included some limited night flying and the introduction into service and testing of parachutes for aircrew. This involved a number of practice jumps being performed by observers, who would {{climb out of the}} aircraft onto a small ladder and await a signal from the pilot as the aircraft flew over the airfield at 2000ft. The observers carried no reserve parachutes, and the silk material from which the parachutes were constructed had a tendency to build up a static charge whilst in storage, such that when the <b>ripcord</b> was <b>pulled,</b> the silk stuck together. 12 Squadron was also tasked with further trials work, experimenting with oxygen systems, high altitude photography, and low temperature trials work, particularly in respect to lubricants. In addition, cloud flying in formation and pattern bombing techniques were tested.|$|R
5000|$|A patent {{was filed}} on July 27, 1918 and issued May 18, 1920 for his parachute. The {{assignee}} was the Floyd Smith Aerial Equipment Company of San Diego, California. Floyd with Leslie Leroy Irvin, developed a 28-foot backpack parachute. On April 28, 1919, Irvin jumped from a de Havilland biplane traveling at 100 {{miles per hour}} {{at an altitude of}} 1,500 feet. After Irvin bailed out of the airplane and falling free, he manually reached the <b>ripcord</b> handle and <b>pulled</b> it, and the parachute fully deployed at 1,000 feet. Irvin became the first American to jump from an airplane and manually open a parachute in midair. Floyd's original 1919 ripcord parachute is on display at the Air Force Museum at Dayton, Ohio. http://www.libraries.wright.edu/find/gov/patent/miamivalleyinventors.html ...|$|R

In addition, cloud flying in formation and pattern bombing techniques were tested.The Foxes were replaced in January 1931 with the Hawker Hart, after which much work was put into formation flying in cloud, instrument flying, pattern bombing and aircraft icing trials. The purpose of these trials was to enable Royal Air Force aircraft to bomb an enemy ship successfully, regardless of weather. To this end, 12 Squadron dropped several practice bombs on an obsolete battleship, HMS Centurion, which was a radio-controlled target off the south coast. On 6 July 1935, King George V performed the first Royal Review of the Royal Air Force, in which 12(B) Squadron led the Light Bomber Wing flypast at RAF Mildenhall. Several home-based squadrons, including 12 Squadron, were re-deployed in October 1935, to the Middle East and Aden in preparation for action being taken by the League of Nations against Italy for invading Abyssinia. 12 Squadron returned to RAF Andover in August 1936, and on its return took delivery of the Hawker Hind. It was around this time that the majority of B Flight were taken to form the nucleus of the newly formed No. 63 Squadron RAF. In February 1938, the Squadron was re-equipped with Fairey Battles, the squadron leaving RAF Andover in May 1939.In October 1929 No. 101 Squadron RAF, the second experimental bomber squadron, was also posted to RAF Andover, to enable its Boulton-Paul Sidestrand bombers to work alongside 12 Squadron with its Fairy Fox light bombers. The high performance of the Sidestrand amazed crowds at the Hendon Air Pageants, where it flew mock combat aerobatics with the fighters of the day. 101 Squadron Sidestrands won a number of bombing and reconnaissance competitions and carried out trial anti-shipping strikes against Royal Navy battleships. In December 1934 the squadron left RAF Andover.|$|R
