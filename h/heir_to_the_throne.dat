Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind {{at the last moment}} and got off to await another vessel, either out of concern for overcrowding on board the ship, or because he was suffering from diarrhoea. The ship foundered en route, and all but two of the passengers died, including William Adelin.|$|E
5|$|Louis Stanislas {{travelled}} more through France {{than other}} members of the royal family, who rarely left the Île-de-France.

His role in the war, although limited, led to his great popularity among veterans of the conflict.|$|E

In return for the advantageous alliance with the English <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne,</b> and a sizeable dower for the bride, William offered 132 transport vessels and 8 warships to assist in the invasion of England. Prince Edward and Philippa were betrothed on 27 August, and Isabella and Mortimer prepared for their campaign.|$|E

5|$|Gorman {{said that}} his Catholic {{grandmother}} had secretly married Albert Victor, and that his mother, as the legitimate daughter of Albert Victor, was the rightful <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b> He claimed that the Ripper murders were staged {{as part of a}} conspiracy to hush up any potential scandal by murdering anyone who knew of the birth. In the original television series, the story is depicted as the belief of Gorman but not of the detectives. Captivated by Gorman's story, journalist Stephen Knight decided to investigate the claims further, and eventually published his research as the book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution in 1976.|$|E
5|$|In 1261, Alexander III, King of Scots (died 1286) sent an {{emissary}} to Norway {{to discuss}} the Isles. Negotiations proved fruitless, and the following year William I, Earl of Ross (died 1274) is recorded to have launched a vicious attack on Skye. The assault was likely carried out on behalf of Alexander, {{in response to the}} failure of Scottish mission to Norway the year previous. In response, Hákon organised a massive military force to re-assert Norwegian control along the western seaboard of Scotland. At this time, the Norwegian king was {{at the height of his}} power, and his only son had just recently been recognised as <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Muhammad, Onneca bore Abdullah two daughters: al-Baha' and Fatima the Younger. Abdullah became emir in 888, and Onneca's son Muhammad was named <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b> However, Muhammad was assassinated by his younger half-brother al-Mutarrif on 28 January 891. There is disagreement among historians {{as to whether}} al-Mutarrif acted on his own or at the instigation of his father Abdullah. Al-Mutarrif himself was beheaded in 895 under orders of his father. As a result, Muhammad's son Abd-ar-Rahman, who was born three weeks prior to his father's assassination, {{was the one who}} succeeded his grandfather Abdullah as emir of Córdoba. Known in the West as Abd-ar-Rahman III, he later elevated himself to the position of caliph.|$|E
