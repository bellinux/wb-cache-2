40|$|Despite the {{development}} of new technologies, manual labour still continuous to play a large role within most modern agricultural operations, especially during harvest. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for new machines to reduce labour as a mean to limit costs, while increasing efficiency in a sustainable manner. This thesis concern itself with the design of a mechanism and control system for a robot arm that can substitute workers in logistical operations during strawberry harvest. More specifically, by lifting berry crates onto a robot platform and transporting them from the fields and to the packaging facilities. The robot arm is to be mounted on the platform composing a vehicle- manipulator system. As this thesis is connected to a general research project on agricultural robotics at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, the chosen platform is the associated field robot Thorvald II. The thesis is divided into two parts, where Part I concerns the mechanical design of the robot arm, while Part II propose a system for controlling the mechanism. The design development process has involved assessments of available solutions before selecting components on the basis of controllability, mechanical properties and costs. The process of selection in Part II is however, based on finding solutions that are compatible with the robot platform’s network (Controller Area Network) and operating system (Robotic Operating System). Part I: Design and Mechanics The design of the robot arm presented in this thesis begun with a preliminary feasibility study conducted by Bjurbeck in September 2016. Following the assessment of this study, the robot arm is designed to have two degrees of freedom operating in the xz-plane. When mounted on the platform, the arm will be free to operate in a 3 -dimensional space, as the platform moves in x and y-direction, and rotates around the z-axis. The arm is assembled from two parallel link pairs made from rectangular aluminium tubes, and a revolute and prismatic joint. Both joints are actuated by LinAk LA 36 linear electric actuators. The end effector of the arm is a gripper head designed to grasp the handles of the strawberry crate. The gripper head is self-aligning with the crate’s orientation {{in order to reduce the}} precision of control needed to envelop and grasp the crate. The frame of the gripper head is made from aluminium angle profiles and sheet metal. A worm drive DC motor actuate the <b>gripper</b> <b>claws</b> via a double link mechanism. Part II: Modeling and Control The geometry of the design presented in Part I is modelled mathematically and the inverse kinematics solved analytically. The kinematics will be used in future implementation of a position control system. Two RoboteQ SDC 2160 dual-channel controllers are chosen to control all four actuator mo- tors. The linear actuators are controlled in closed loop position tracking mode with absolute feedback. The gripper motor is controlled in open loop mode with end stop switches detecting the position of the claws. Experiments was conducted to match the controllers with the actuator motors. The experiments revealed firmware issues with the controller. The experiments also affirmed the controller need a script to operate the actuators efficiently. The thesis provides the foundations to build a prototype and write an operating script to test the mechanical design and control system...|$|E
50|$|The first {{production}} series of B.A.Ts {{was developed by}} Doctor Mindbender. These models had a humanoid form, with exposed electronics in their chest cavity for easy battlefield maintenance. The right forearm could be equipped with a flamethrower, laser cannon, <b>gripper</b> <b>claw,</b> or standard robotic hand. Doctor Mindbender has overseen subsequent modifications and customization of the B.A.Ts, including a streamlined appearance, increased targeting accuracy, and modular missile launcher systems. Though they have become more mindless with each successive design, their manufacturing process and weapons systems are continually being upgraded.|$|R
5000|$|There was an {{instance}} where Frank Elstner lost a private bet himself; he had bet {{with his family}} that his colleague and friend Kurt Felix would never fool him. (Kurt Felix ran a show similar to Candid Camera, called Verstehen Sie Spaß? ("Can You Take a Joke?"). On the 29th show (21 September 1985), after a successful outdoor challenge which involved uncorking {{a bottle of wine}} and filling four glasses with a <b>gripper</b> <b>claw</b> fixed to a helicopter's skid within the space of 3 1/2 minutes, the pilot was invitedalong with the guestsfor a drink of wine. But the contents of the bottle turned out to be pure vinegar, as Elstner discovered when {{he was the first to}} take a sample, and the red-haired and bearded pilot revealed himself to the laughing audience as Kurt Felix in disguise. As Felix would later admit in one of his later Verstehen Sie Spaß? broadcastings, it was he and his production team who had sent the bet to the ZDF in the first place.|$|R
