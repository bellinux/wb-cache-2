Xaira and Adobe Audition were used to collect, convert and extract the excerpts and PRAAT was used to get the intonation pattern and annotate the sample examples. The study has found that rising intonation is used in all <b>feedback</b> eliciting <b>units</b> and in <b>units</b> where <b>feedback</b> has a giving non-accept function. All the other <b>feedback</b> giving <b>units</b> in Nepali have a falling intonation pattern. However, when these units function as turn holders they have rising intonation. 1...|$|R

The forms that this assessment takes, however, can vary widely from simple acknowledgement to a detailed analysis of output, structure and code. This study focusses on output analysis of submitted student assignment code {{and the degree to which}} changes in automated feedback influence student marks and persistence in submission. Data was collected over a four year period, over 22 courses but we focus on one course for this paper. Assignments were grouped by the number of different <b>units</b> of automated <b>feedback</b> that were delivered per assignment to investigate if students changed their submission behaviour or performance as the possible set of marks, that a student could achieve, changed.

40|$|Traditional cascade {{multilevel}} inverter {{can only}} transmit one-direction of energy. This paper proposes a new cascade multilevel inverter topology and control strategy based on part units {{to realize the}} energy feedback. By using PWM converter to replace uncontrollable converter in part units of the traditional inverter, and combining the inverter with H-bridge inverter, the two-direction running of the cascade inverter is realized. A double closed loop control strategy is used to obtain fine control characteristic of input current. The carrier phase-shifted SPWM technology is adopted in the cascade inverter to reduce harmonious wave of output voltage and current, meanwhile, {{a new type of}} bypass control method is proposed to collect all the feedback energy and restore it into the energy <b>feedback</b> <b>units.</b> According to the simulation of a three-phase and five-unit cascaded inverter with three energy <b>feedback</b> <b>units,</b> the results demonstrate that the proposed inverter can be input near sinusoidal current, and realize two-way flow of energy automatically with simplified phase shifting transformer structure, and show its feasibility and effectiveness...|$|R

In these techniques, multimedia servers use light-weight messages called <b>feedback</b> <b>units</b> transmitted by media display sites (such as audiophones and videophones, generically referred to as mediaphones) to detect asynchronies among those sites. We present strategies by which the multimedia server, based on its most recent estimate of how soon playback may go out of synchrony at each mediaphone, can adaptively control the feedback transmission rate from that mediaphone, so as to minimize the associated overheads without permitting the asynchrony to exceed tolerable limits.

In future integrated networks, mediaphones that possess bare minimum capability to playback media but which lack the sophistication to run elaborate time synchronization protocols may be connected directly to the network. We present rate-based feedback strategies by which, during retrieval, a multimedia server uses light-weight messages called <b>feedback</b> <b>units</b> transmitted periodically by mediaphones, to accurately estimate the playback instants of media units.

40|$|In this paper, a {{hardware}} {{implementation of a}} recurrent neural fuzzy network (RNFN) used for identification and prediction is proposed. A recurrent network {{is embedded in the}} RNFN by adding feedback connections in the second layer, where the <b>feedback</b> <b>units</b> act as memory elements. Although the back propagation (BP) learning algorithm is widely used in the RNFN, BP is too complicated to be implemented using hardware. However, we use the simultaneous perturbation method as a learning scheme for hardware implementation to overcome the above-mentioned problems. The hardware implementation of the RNFN uses random access memory (RAM), which stores all the parameters of a network. This design method reduces the number of logic gates used. The major findings of the experiment show that field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) implementation of the RNFN retains good performance in identification and prediction problems...|$|R
40|$|This thesis mainly {{studies the}} {{downlink}} of a wireless multiuser system, where the transmitter has limited {{knowledge about the}} communication channels of the users. Key techniques to improve the performance of such systems are, for instance, multiple antennas, multiuser diversity and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Common for these techniques is that, to exploit them fully, a cross-layer approach has to be adopted. This means that the scheduling and the signal designs are done jointly and based on parameters from several communication layers. Multiuser diversity {{can be used to}} significantly increase system throughput in wireless communication systems. The idea is to schedule users when they experience good channel conditions and let them wait when the channels are weak. In this thesis, several aspects of OFDMA systems that exploit multiuser diversity are investigated. An adaptive reduced feedback scheme for OFDMA is proposed. It significantly reduces the total feedback overhead while maintaining a multiuser diversity gain. The scheme uses clusters of sub-carriers as <b>feedback</b> <b>units</b> and feed...|$|R

The endocrine controller includes the traditional control unit, the ultra short <b>feedback</b> <b>unit</b> and so on. First the control signal of the endocrine controller is operated by the traditional control unit. Then the control signal is processed by the ultra short <b>feedback</b> <b>unit</b> according to the regulation of hormone.

40|$|Abstractâ€”An {{adaptive}} dynamic cerebellar model articulation controller (DCMAC) {{neural network}} used for solving the prediction and identification problem is proposed in this paper. The proposed DCMAC has superior capability {{to the conventional}} cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network in efficient learning mechanism, guaranteed system stability and dynamic response. The recurrent network {{is embedded in the}} DCMAC by adding feedback connections in the association memory space so that the DCMAC captures the dynamic response, where the <b>feedback</b> <b>units</b> act as memory elements. The dynamic gradient descent method is adopted to adjust DCMAC parameters on-line. Moreover, the analytical method based on a Lyapunov function is proposed to determine the learning-rates of DCMAC so that the variable optimal learning-rates are derived to achieve most rapid convergence of identifying error. Finally, the adaptive DCMAC is applied in two computer simulations. Simulation results show that accurate identifying response and superior dynamic performance can be obtained because of the powerful on-line learning capability of the proposed DCMAC.

40|$|Haptic {{visualization}} {{is a key}} aid {{in presenting}} real or simulated data to individuals who are blind {{in a form that}} is suitable for comprehension. Conventional techniques in haptic visualization convert complex multidimensional data into a visual form such as points, lines, graphs etc. and subsequently add haptic features such as friction and texture to the rendered form. This allows individuals to feel the visual plots. However, this approach is limited to small datasets and restricted visualizations. Human tactile perception is based on numerous tactile sensors perceiving information in parallel. Current haptic visualization schemes have only limited <b>feedback</b> <b>units</b> that cannot present information in a realistic manner.
