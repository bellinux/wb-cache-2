Leonard's father, Benjamin Hanna, a Quaker of Scotch-Irish descent, was a wealthy store owner in New Lisbon. Dr. Hanna practiced in Columbiana County, where New Lisbon was located, until he {{suffered}} a spinal injury while riding. After the accident, he joined the family business, B., L., and T. Hanna, by now a major <b>grocery</b> <b>and</b> goods brokering firm.

5|$|The square itself held {{an array}} of coal mining offices, privately owned business, <b>grocery</b> <b>and</b> {{department}} stores, pharmacies and bars. During {{the closing of the}} coal mining era, most of the businesses left the square and moved to the main drag of Rt. 45, constructed in 1926. The courthouse built by John W. Gaddis was replaced with a modern, more efficient building in 1967 after the older building was condemned. Over the years, the architecture that graced Harrisburg square has slowly turned to rotting older structures mixed in with a hodge-podge of newer updated buildings. Currently there are a few privately owned downtown renovation projects in progress on and around the square.|$|E
5|$|Till {{arrived in}} Money, Mississippi, on August 21, 1955. On August 24, he and cousin Curtis Jones skipped church where his great-uncle Mose Wright was preaching and joined some local boys {{as they went}} to Bryant's <b>Grocery</b> <b>and</b> Meat Market to buy candy. The {{teenagers}} were children of sharecroppers and had been picking cotton all day. The market mostly served the local sharecropper population and was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old wife Carolyn. Carolyn {{was alone in the}} store that day; her sister-in-law was {{in the rear of the}} store watching children. Jones left Till with the other boys while Jones played checkers across the street.|$|E

5|$|After the E.coli outbreak, Odwalla {{improved}} {{the safety of}} several of its production processes. Before the fruit enters the factory, it is washed, sorted and sanitized. Once it has reached the plant, the apples, carrots, and citrus fruits are separated and washed again. The fruit is pressed to get the juice, which is then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample undergoes quality testing, and, if it passes, the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States. Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated. However, after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001, the shelf life has been considerably extended. Generally, Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at <b>grocery</b> <b>and</b> convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products.|$|E

Ruth's parents, George Herman Ruth Sr. (1871–1918) and Katherine Schamberger, were both of German American ancestry. According to the 1880 census, his parents were born in Maryland.

The elder Ruth then became a counterman in a family-owned combination <b>grocery</b> <b>and</b> saloon business on Frederick Street.

25|$|The name Mercer Street {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in the Survey of Birmingham of 1553. This {{was a result of}} the prominence of the area in the cloth trade. In the 16th century and 17th century, Mercer Street rapidly developed and became cramped. In the early 18th century Mercer Street was known as Spicer Street, reflecting the growing <b>grocery</b> <b>and</b> meat trade that had begun to take over from the cloth trade. By {{the end of the century}} the street was known as Spiceal Street. Despite being overcrowded and cramped, many houses on the street had gardens as indicated by an advertisement for a residential property in 1798. Houses were constructed close to St Martin's Church, eventually encircling it. These became known as the Roundabout Houses.|$|E

He opened a bicycle repair shop in 1891 with his two brothers. A successful entrepreneur, he expanded his business and became involved in bicycle racing and later, automobile racing. During his many promotional stunts, he was frequently injured on the dirt and gravel roadways, leading him {{to become one of}} the early developers of automotive safety features. A highly publicized stunt involved dropping a bicycle from the roof of the tallest building in Indianapolis, which brought on a confrontation with the police.|$|E
25|$|The Co-operative Central Exchange (CCE) was a {{cooperative}} federation established {{at a meeting}} of representatives of 19 Finnish-American consumers' co-operatives held in Superior, Wisconsin, on July 30, 1917. The idea for a central coordinating agency to unit the existing network of cooperative stores in the Upper Midwest of the United States had been brewing for several years, based upon a desire to buy commonly sold goods more cheaply if purchased in bulk. Also driving the cooperatives to action was discriminatory credit practices practiced by the largest regional <b>grocery</b> <b>and</b> hard goods wholesaler, who restricted the extension of credit to the cooperatives {{at the behest of the}} privately-owned retailers who were competing with them. The magazine Pelto ja Koti (Farm and Home) was instrumental in coordinating the launch of the central cooperative initiative.|$|E
