40|$|We {{study the}} nonequilibrium steady {{state of the}} Bose Hubbard model coupled to Lindblad reservoirs, using the density matrix {{renormalization}} group in operator space. We observe a transition from a <b>flat</b> <b>particle</b> density profile in the noninteracting limit to the linear profile with onset of the interparticle interaction. Analyzing the effect of coherent pumping on the nonequilibrium steady state we find a subspace which remains unaffected by the pumping in the noninteracting limit with the protection gradually diminishing due to interparticle interaction. In the equilibrium situation {{with one or more}} symmetric reservoirs we show analytically that the steady state of the system is a product state for any interaction strength. We also provide analytical results in the noninteracting limits, using the method of the third quantization in operator space. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|The role of MHD {{turbulence}} in {{the cosmic}} ray acceleration {{process in a}} volume with a reconnecting magnetic field is studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We performed modelling of proton acceleration with the 3 D analytic model of stationary reconnection of Craig et al. (1995) providing the unperturbed background conditions. Perturbations of particle trajectories due to a turbulent magnetic field component were simulated using small-amplitude pitch-angle momentum scattering, enabling modelling of both small and large amplitude turbulence in a wide wave vector range. Within the approach, no second-order Fermi acceleration process is allowed. Comparison of the acceleration process in models involving particle trajectory perturbations to the unperturbed one reveals that the turbulence can substantially increase the acceleration efficiency, enabling much higher final particle energies and <b>flat</b> <b>particle</b> spectra.

40|$|Ice {{accretion}} {{on various}} surfaces can cause destructive effect of our lives, from cars, aircrafts, to infrastructure, power line, cooling and transportation systems. There {{are plenty of}} methods to overcome the icing problems including electrical, thermal and mechanical process to remove already accumulated ice on the surfaces and {{to reduce the risk}} of further operation. But all these process required substantial amount of energy and high cost of operation. To save the global energy and to improvement the safety issue in many infrastructure and transportation systems we have to introduce some passive anti-icing coating known as ice-phobic coating to reduce the ice-formation and ice adhesion onto the surface. Ice-phobic coatings mostly devoted to utilizing lotus-leaf-inspired superhydrophobic coatings. These surfaces show promising behavior due to the low contact area between the impacting water droplets and the surface. In this present study we investigate systematically the influence of chemical composition and functionality as well as structure of surfaces on wetting properties and later on icing behavior of surfaces. Robust anti-icing coating has been prepared by using modified silica particles as a particles film. Polymer brushes were synthesized on <b>flat,</b> <b>particle</b> surfaces by using Surface initiated ATRP. We have also investigated the effect of anti-icing behavior on the surfaces by varying surface chemistry and textures by using different sizes of particles. This approach is based on the reducing ice accumulation on the surfaces by reducing contact angle hysteresis. This is achieved by introducing nano to micro structured rough surfaces with varying surface chemistry on different substrates. Freezing and melting dynamics of water has been investigated on different surfaces by water vapour condensation in a high humidity (80 %) condition ranging from super hydrophilic to super hydrophobic surfaces below the freezing point of water. Kinetics of frost formation and ice adhesion strength measurements were also performed for all samples. All these experiments were carried out in a custom humidity and temperature controlled chamber. We prepared a superhydrophobic surface by using Poly dimethyl siloxane (PDMS) modified fumed silica which display very low ice-adhesion strength almost 10 times lower than the unmodified surface. Also it has self-cleaning behavior after melting of ice since whole ice layer was folded out from the surface to remove the ice during melting. Systematic investigation of the effect of three parameters as surface energy, surface textures (structure, geometry and roughness) and mechanical properties of polymers (soft and stiff) on icing behavior has also been reported...|$|E

40|$|The NASA-JPL Deep Space 1 Mission (DS 1) {{encountered}} the short-period Jupiter-family Comet 19 P/Borrelly on September 22, 2001, about 8 days after perihelion. DS 1 's payload contained a remote-sensing package called MICAS (Miniature Integrated Camera Spectrometer) {{that included a}} 1024 square CCD and a near IR spectrometer with ~ 12 nm resolution. Prior to its closest approach of 2171 km, the remote-sensing package on the spacecraft obtained 25 CCD images of the comet and 45 near-IR spectra (L. Soderblom et al., 2002, Science 296, 1087 – 1091). These images provided the first close-up view of a comet's nucleus sufficiently unobscured to perform quantitative photometric studies. At closest approach, corresponding to a resolution of 47 meters per pixel, {{the intensity of the}} coma was less than 1 % of that of the nucleus. An unprecedented range of high solar phase angles (52 – 89 degrees), viewing geometries that are in general attainable only when a comet is active, enabled the first quantitative and disk resolved modeling of surface photometric physical parameters, including the single particle phase function and macroscopic roughness. The disk-integrated geometric albedo of Borrelly's nucleus is 0. 029 ± 0. 006, comparable to the dark hemisphere of Iapetus, the lowest albedo C-type asteroids, and the uranian rings. The Bond albedo, 0. 009 ± 0. 002, is lower than that of any Solar System object measured. Such a low value may enhance the heating of the nucleus and sublimation of volatiles, which in turn causes the albedo to decrease even further. A map of normal reflectance of Borrelly shows variations far greater than those seen on asteroids. The two main terrain types, smooth and mottled, exhibit mean normal reflectances of 0. 03 and 0. 022. The physical photometric parameters of Borrelly's nucleus are typical of other small dark bodies, particularly asteroids, except preliminary modeling results indicate its regolith may be substantially fluffier. The nucleus exhibits significant variations in macroscopic roughness, with the oldest, darkest terrain being slightly smoother. This result suggests the infilling of low-lying areas with dust and particles that {{have not been able to}} leave the comet. The surface of the comet is backscattering, but there are significant variations in the single particle phase function.

40|$|Particle {{shape is}} {{evaluated}} on three scales corresponding to form, roundness and roughness. Shape {{at each of}} these scales uniquely influences material behavior. The shape of sand grains is largely formed as magma cools. Subsequent cleavage and abrasion change the roundness and roughness of particles. Published results indicate that particle shape influences several aspects of granular systems behavior including stiffness, strength, the evolution of strength anisotropy, dilation, {{and the development of}} strain localization. The crushing of granite creates a particulate material with a unique angular shape. A wide range of experimental studies implemented as part of this research permit assembling a unique database of material parameters and comparing the behavior of several crushed and natural sands. In general, the low roundness of crushed sands leads to higher maximum void ratios, lower small strain stiffnesses, and higher critical state friction angles than more rounded natural sands. It also impacts mortar strength and workability. Previous studies have emphasized size-controlled segregation. New experimental results show that differences in particle shape can also lead to segregation in a binary granular material. Round or spherical particles are more mobile than angular or <b>flat</b> <b>particles.</b> Then, the greater motion of round or spherical particles in a binary mixture subjected to horizontal or vertical vibration results in their segregation from their angular or <b>flat</b> neighbors. <b>Particle</b> shape may change significantly with stress in the case of soft particles. Therefore, the presence of shape-deformable particles decreases the stiffness of binary rigid-soft particle mixtures. However, macro-scale measurements with rigid-soft mixtures show higher stiffness than would be expected by volume averaging techniques.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{discrete}} {{numerical simulation}} {{is used to}} investigate the properties of close-packed frictionless granular assemblies {{as a function of}} particle polydispersity and shape. Unlike some experimental results, simulations show that disordered packings of pinacoids (eight-face convex polyhedron) achieve higher solid fraction values than amorphous packings of spherical or rounded particles, thus fulfilling the analogue of Ulam's conjecture stated by Jiao and co-workers for random packings [Y. Jiao and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. E 84, 041309 (2011) ]. This seeming discrepancy between experimental and numerical results is believed to lie with difficulties in overcoming interparticle friction through experimental densification processes. Moreover, solid fraction is shown to increase further with bidispersity and peak when the volume proportion of small particles reaches 30 %. Contrarywise, substituting up to 50 % of flat pinacoids for isometric ones yields solid fraction decrease, especially when <b>flat</b> <b>particles</b> are also elongated. Nevertheless, particle shape seems to play a minor role on packing solid fraction compared to polydispersity. Additional investigations focused on the packing microstructure confirm that pinacoid packings fulfill the isostatic conjecture and that they are free of order except beyond 30 to 50 % of flat or flat & elongated polyhedra in the packing. This order increase progressively {{takes the form of a}} nematic phase caused by the reorientation of flat or <b>flat</b> & elongated <b>particles</b> to minimize the packing potential energy. Simultaneously, this reorientation seems to increase the solid fraction value slightly above the maximum achieved by monodisperse isometric pinacoids, as well as the coordination number. Finally, partial substitution of elongated pinacoids for isometric ones has limited effect on packing solid fraction or order. Comment: 12 figures, 12 page...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhen a porous {{agglomerate}} {{immersed in}} a fluid is submitted to a shear flow, hydrodynamic stresses acting on its surface may cause a size reduction if they exceed the cohesive stress of the agglomerate. The aggregates forming the agglomerate are slowly removed from the agglomerate surface. Such a behaviour is known when the suspending fluid is Newtonian but unknown if the fluid is viscoelastic.
