5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one <b>even</b> <b>knows</b> exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E

This sudden emotional jump (along with {{the pattern of the}} [...] "state") displays the Speaker's [...] "wild mood swings". Frank believes that the last sestet, however, is not as [...] "happy" [...] as some may believe. Using line 10 as his example, Frank points out that the Speaker says he simply [...] "thinks" [...] of his beloved while he is alone which leads one to wonder if the said [...] "sweet love" [...] (line 13) <b>even</b> <b>knows</b> the Speaker exists.|$|E

Undaunted, Carter resolves to go to Kadath, where the gods live, to beseech them in person. However, {{no one has ever}} been to Kadath and none <b>even</b> <b>knows</b> how to get there. In dream, Randolph Carter descends [...] "seventy steps" [...] and speaks of his plan to the priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah, whose temple - the Cavern of Flame - borders the Dreamlands. The priests warn Carter of the great danger of his quest and suggest that the gods withdrew his vision of the city on purpose.|$|E

Has resentment towards Green Lantern since they are both portrayed by Ryan Reynolds. Often paired with Rorschach, who often gets annoyed and then shoots him.

This proves to be critical information during Zero Hour as he uses one of Darkseid's own devices to forcefeed his knowledge of what lies beyond the fourth wall into Darkseid's mind, causing him to collapse. His relationship with Rorschach is expanded during Zero Hour, as he becomes enraged by his death and embraces Rorschach when Death revives him after he tells her that Rorschach was effectively his perfect foil due to having such a strong conviction about right and wrong which Deadpool lacked.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, J. C. C. Mays {{pointed out}} that [...] "Coleridge's {{claim to be a}} great poet lies in the {{continued}} pursuit of the consequences of 'The Ancient Mariner,' 'Christabel' and 'Kubla Khan' on several levels." [...] Adam Sisman, in 2006, questioned the nature of the poem itself: [...] "No one <b>even</b> <b>knows</b> whether it is complete; Coleridge describes it as a 'fragment,' but there is a case for doubting this. Maybe it is not a poem at all. Hazlitt called it 'a musical composition' ... Though literary detectives have uncovered some of its sources, its remains difficult to say what the poem is about." [...] In describing the merits of the poem and its fragmentary state, he claimed, [...] "The poem stands for itself: beautiful, sensuous and enigmatic." [...] During the same year, Jack Stillinger claimed that [...] "Coleridge wrote only a few poems of the first rank – perhaps no more than a dozen, all told – and he seems to have taken a very casual attitude toward them ... he kept 'Kubla Khan' in manuscript for nearly twenty years before offering it to the public 'rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the grounds of any supposed poetic merits'". Harold Bloom, in 2010, argued that Coleridge wrote two kinds of poems and that [...] "The daemonic group, necessarily more famous, is the triad of The Ancient Mariner, Christabel, and 'Kubla Khan.'" [...] He goes on to explain the [...] "daemonic": [...] "Opium was the avenging daemon or alastor of Coleridge's life, his dark or fallen angel, his experiential acquaintance with Milton's Satan. Opium was for him what wandering and moral tale-telling became for the Mariner – the personal shape of repetition compulsion. The lust for paradise in 'Kubla Khan,' Geraldine's lust for Christabel – these are manifestations of Coleridge's revisionary daemonization of Milton, these are Coleridge's countersublime. Poetic genius, the genial spirit itself, Coleridge must see as daemonic when it is his own rather than when it is Milton's." ...|$|E
