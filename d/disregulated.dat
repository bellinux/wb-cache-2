It becomes increasingly evident that astrocytes are significant contributors to HIV- 1 associated neurological disorders by modulating the microenvironment in the central nervous system and releasing proinflammatory cytokines. Recent studies have revealed direct metabolic interactions between neurons and astrocytes observed particularly in HIV- 1 -associated neurological disorders by which astrocytic dysfunctions <b>disregulate</b> extracellular K+ homeostasis, intracellular calcium concentration, glutamate clearance, and blood brain barrier integrity and permeability.

40|$|The bone wasting {{induced by}} {{estrogen}} deficiency is, in part, {{a consequence of}} increased T cell production of the osteoclastogenic cytokine TNF-α. This phenomenon is due to an expansion of T cells, but the responsible mechanism is unknown. We now show that ovariectomy (ovx) <b>disregulates</b> T lymphopoiesis and induces bone loss by stimulating, through a rise in IL- 7 levels, both thymic-dependent differentiation of bone marrow-derived progenitors and thymic-independent, peripheral expansion of mature T cells. Attesting to {{the relevance of the}} thymic effects, thymectomy decreases by ≈ 50 % the bone loss and the stimulation of T lymphopoiesis induced by ovx. In contrast, in vivo attenuation of the elevated IL- 7 completely prevents the stimulation of T lymphopoiesis and the bone loss that follow ovx. Thus, the disruption of both T cell and bone homeostasis induced by ovx is mediated by IL- 7 and due to both the thymic and extrathymic mechanisms. We conclude that IL- 7 is a pivotal upstream target through which estrogen regulates hematopoietic and immune functions that are critical for bone homeostasis...|$|R

This long precursor sequence is a component of the mir-17-92 cluster which contains 6 additional mir precursor sequences: mir-17, mir-18a, mir-19a, mir-20a and mir19b-1. The components have related functions and also exist in their mature form as part of RNP complexes. The cluster is called Oncomir-1 because all members have been connected with inducing enhanced cell proliferation and suppression of apoptosis. Oncomir-1 has 2 paralogs, miR-106a-363 and mir-106b-25. These are located on different chromosomes and contain individual miRNAs that are highly similar to those encoded by the mir-17-92 cluster. Mir-92-1 for example, appears on the mir-17-92 cluster and mir-92-2 appears on the mir-106a-363 cluster.

40|$|Puberty is {{regulated}} by the endocrine system. Disruption of that system by exposure to environmental hormone-mimicking substances (i. e. endocrine disruptors) may, therefore, affect this development profoundly. There {{has been a great}} secular trend in the earlier timing of puberty such as both puberty onset and menarche age. This is apparently caused by environmental factors such as improved socioeconomic status, better healthcare and improved nutrition. However, part of the phenomenon could be associated with exposure to endocrine disruptors that have intrinsic estrogen activity or increase endogenous sex hormone levels. These estrogen pollutants tend to degrade slowly in the environment, to bioaccumulate in the food chain and to have long half-lives in humans. Because most of environmental chemicals, called estrogen disruptors or xenoestrogens, are toxic and estrogen/antiandrogen active, they can <b>disregulate</b> hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis potentially inducing reproductive disorders. There are several case reports of accidental exposure to estrogenic compounds in cosmetic products, food and pharmaceuticals. The outbreak of epidemics of premature thelarche in some geographical areas has also been suggested to be linked to exposure to estrogen disrupters such as dioxins, furans and organohalogens.

Other human postthymic leukemias, such as T-prolymphocytic leukemias, involve mostly the CD 4 cellular subset and share many similarities to ATLs (aggressive course, cutaneous involvement, CD 4 (+), CD 29 (+), CD 45 RA(-) phenotype, and alphanaphthyl-acetate esterase positivity).

40|$|To ensure genomic integrity, {{the genome}} must be {{duplicated}} exactly once per cell cycle. Disruption of replication licensing mechanisms {{may lead to}} re-replication and genomic instability. Cdt 1, also known as Double-parked (Dup) in Drosophila, is a key regulator of the assembly of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) and its activity is strictly limited to G 1 by multiple mechanisms including Cul 4 -Ddb 1 mediated proteolysis and inhibition by geminin. We assayed the genomic consequences of <b>disregulating</b> the replication licensing mechanisms by RNAi depletion of geminin. We found that not all origins of replication were sensitive to geminin depletion and that heterochromatic sequences were preferentially re-replicated {{in the absence of}} licensing mechanisms. The preferential re-activation of heterochromatic origins of replication was unexpected because these are typically the last sequences to be duplicated in a normal cell cycle. We found that the re-replication of heterochromatin was regulated not at the level of pre-RC activation, but rather by the formation of the pre-RC. Unlike the global assembly of the pre-RC that occurs throughout the genome in G 1, in the absence of geminin, limited pre-RC assembly was restricted to the heterochromatin by elevated cyclin A-CDK activity. These results suggest that there are chromatin and cell cycle specific controls that regulate the re-assembly of the pre-RC outside of G 1...|$|R
50|$|The fifth {{proposed}} major {{mechanism for}} cell {{death is the}} breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB has three cell types which tightly regulate the flow of molecules {{in and out of the}} brain: endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. In neurodegenerative diseases, BBB breakdown has been measured and identified in specific regions of the brain, including the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease and hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease. Protein aggregates or cytokines from neuroinflammation may interfere with cell receptors and alter their function in the BBB. Most notably, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptors are thought to be <b>disregulated</b> in neurodegenerative diseases. The interaction between the VEGF protein and its receptors leads to cell proliferation, but is believed to be disrupted in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This then causes cells to stop growing and therefore, prevents new capillary formation via angiogenesis. Cell receptor disruption can also affect the ability for cells to adhere to one another with adherens junctions.|$|E
5000|$|Production of C-1-P {{bolsters}} cell {{survival and}} proliferation. It {{has been shown}} that C-1-P promotes DNA synthesis in fibroblasts. C-1-P also prevents apoptosis by inhibiting the caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway and preventing DNA fragmentation in macrophages. This is thought to occur via C-1-P interacting with and blocking functionality of acid sphingomyelinase. This results in diminished ceramide production, which precludes apoptosis. Recently, phosphorylation of ceramide via CERK has been shown to stimulate myoblast proliferation. It was demonstrated that C-1-P perpetuates the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 β and retinoblastoma protein, which contributes to transition from the G1 phase to M phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, production of C-1-P appears to result in increased expression of Cyclin D. [...] CERK has demonstrated an ability to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt), ERK1/2, and mTOR. CERKs ability to produce signaling molecules that facilitate the activation of cell proliferation as well as its interaction with PI3K/Akt, and mTOR indicate that <b>disregulated</b> CERK expression may lead to cancer.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{researchers}} noticed protrusions {{coming from the}} ventral membrane of cells that had been transformed by the Rous Sarcoma Virus {{and that they were}} at the sites of cell-to-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion.

Since then, researchers have often used the two names interchangeably, but it is generally accepted that podosomes are the structures involved in normal biological processes (like when immune cells need to cross tissue barriers or in bone remodeling) and invadopodia are the structures in invading cancer cells. However, there remains controversy around this nomenclature, with some scientists arguing that the two are different enough to be considered distinct structures while others argue that invadopodia are simply <b>disregulated</b> podosomes and cancer cells don’t simply invent new mechanisms. Due to this confusion and the high similarity between the two structures, many have begun to group the two under the collective term invadosomes.|$|E

We then realized that in mammals Wnt signaling...was not only important in embryos but also crucial in adults, which is novel.

40|$|AbstractAimsOxidative {{stress and}} neurohumoral factors play {{important}} {{role in the development of}} hypertension-induced vascular remodeling, likely by <b>disregulating</b> kinase cascades and transcription factors. Oxidative stress activates poly(ADP-ribose) -polymerase (PARP- 1), which promotes inflammation and cell death. We assumed that inhibition of PARP- 1 reduces the hypertension-induced adverse vascular changes. This hypothesis was tested in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Methods and resultsTen-week-old male SHRs and wild-type rats received or not 5 mg/kg/day L- 2286 (a water-soluble PARP-inhibitor) for 32 weeks, then morphological and functional parameters were determined in their aortas. L- 2286 did not affect the blood pressure in any of the animal groups measured with tail-cuff method. Arterial stiffness index increased in untreated SHRs compared to untreated Wistar rats, which was attenuated by L- 2286 treatment. Electron and light microscopy of aortas showed prominent collagen deposition, elevation of oxidative stress markers and increased PARP activity in SHR, which were attenuated by PARP-inhibition. L- 2286 treatment decreased also the hypertension-activated mitochondrial cell death pathway, characterized by the nuclear translocation of AIF. Hypertension activated all three branches of MAP-kinases. L- 2286 attenuated these changes by inducing the expression of MAPK phosphatase- 1 and by activating the cytoprotective PI- 3 -kinase/Akt pathway. Hypertension activated nuclear factor-kappaB, which was prevented by PARP-inhibition via activating its nuclear export. ConclusionPARP-inhibition has significant vasoprotective effects against hypertension-induced vascular remodeling. Therefore, PARP- 1 can be a novel therapeutic drug target for preventing hypertension-induced vascular remodeling in a group of patients, in whom lowering the blood pressure to optimal range is harmful or causes intolerable side effects...|$|R

We recently demonstrated that PAN RNA interacts with several viral and cellular factors and can <b>disregulate</b> the expression of genes that modulate immune response. In an effort to define the role of PAN RNA {{in the context of the}} virus genome we generated a recombinant BACmid that deleted the PAN RNA locus. Because of the apparent duplication of the PAN RNA locus in BAC 36, we generated BAC 36 CR, a recombinant BACmid that removes the duplicated region. BAC 36 CR was used as a template to delete most of the PAN RNA locus to generate BAC 36 CRDPAN. BAC 36 CRDPAN failed to produce supernatant virus and displayed a general decrease in mRNA accumulation of representative immediate early, early and late genes. Most strikingly, K-Rta expression was decreased in lytically induced BAC 36 CRDPAN-containing cell lines at early and late time points post induction. Expression of PAN RNA in trans in BAC 36 CRDPAN containing cells resulted in an increase in K-Rta expression, however K-Rta over expression failed to rescue BAC 36 CRDPAN, suggesting that PAN RNA plays a wider role in virus replication.

50|$|Cyclin {{levels can}} easily be {{determined}} through immunohistological analysis of tumor biopsies. The fact that cyclin B is often <b>disregulated</b> in cancer cells makes cyclin B an attractive biomarker. Many studies have been performed to examine cyclin levels in tumors, {{and it has been}} shown that levels of cyclin B is a strong indicator of prognosis in many types of cancer. Generally, elevated levels of cyclin B are indicative of more aggressive cancers and a poor prognosis. Immunohistologically assessed levels of cyclin B could determine if women with stage 1, node negative, hormone receptor positive breast cancer were likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy. In general women with this cancer have a very good prognosis, with mortality in 10 years of only 5%. Therefore, it is rare for oncologists to recommend adjuvant chemotherapy in these cases. However, in a small subset of patient this type of cancer is unexpectedly aggressive. These rare patients can be identified through their elevated cyclin B levels. In addition high levels of cyclin B also indicate poor prognosis and lymph node metastasis in gastric cancers. However, not all cancers which overexpress cyclin B are more aggressive. A study in 2009 found that cyclin B overexpression in ovarian cancer indicates that the cancer is unlikely to be malignant while more aggressive ovarian cancers of epithelial cell origin do not show elevated cyclin B.|$|E

The differences in protein expression between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the corresponding non-HCC liver tissues were investigated in a cohort of 20 patients using two-dimensional fluorescence difference in gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). The up- and down-regulated protein spots that exhibited 1. 5 -fold difference signal intensity with statistical significance (p< 0. 05, t-test, confidence intervals 95 %) were excised from the gel and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).

40|$|Alteration of mitotic gene {{function}} {{has recently been}} discovered to {{play a key role}} in tumor formation and cancer progression through the induction of chromosomal aberrations and genomic instability. Polo-like-kinase- 1 is a critical mitotic regulator, overexpressed in human tumors, that functions in mitotic entry after cellular stress, centrosome maturation, mitotic spindle control, and cytokinesis, which are all <b>disregulated</b> in cancer cells. To study the role of Polo-like kinases we took advantage of the recent discovery that the polo-box domain of Polo-like kinases is a phosphorylation-dependent binding module that regulates targeting of Polo-like kinases to their substrates. To identify the interactors of Polo-box domains we developed and performed a mitotic-specific yeast two hybrid and a pulldown mass spectrometry screen. This yielded a large number of specific interactors known to be involved in a vast variety of mitotic processes including those previously described to be involved in tumor progression. We demonstrate that Polo-like kinase regulation of cytokinesis-specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for the small G-protein Rho is necessary for proper actomyosin ring contraction and cytokinesis. Additionally we demonstrate that Polo-like-kinase- 1 directly regulates the activity of the Rho-effector-kinase ROCK 2, and thus Polo-like kinases modulate Rho signaling both upstream and downstream of Rho during cytokinesis. In addition to Polo-box domains we also worked on two other phosphorylation-dependent binding domains involved in cell cycle checkpoints that become <b>disregulated</b> in cancer cells, tandem BRCT domains and WW domains. (cont.) We examined the molecular basis for phosphorylation-dependent recognition by the tandem BRCT domains of BRCA 1 through oriented-peptide-library screening and determination of an X-ray crystal structure of the domain bound to a phosphopeptide. This allowed us to rationalize why inherited mutations within the tandem BRCT domains of BRCA 1 promote breast and ovarian cancer in humans. Secondly, we assayed WW domains that were generated from in silicon determined sequences for natural-like function to more fully understand the folding and binding requirements of this domain class. All three domains (tandem BRCT domains, Polo-box domains, and WW domains) are attractive targets for cancer therapeutics as they participate in control of processes necessary for genomic stability that become <b>disregulated</b> in cancer. by Drew M.

Here, we review a number of current findings indicating that <b>disregulated</b> ectopic re-activation of cell cycle-mediated events, akin to neoplasia, represent an important early pathway associated with neuronal death and, more importantly, one that involves virtually the entire spectrum of the pathological events described in Alzheimer's disease...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Identification of the {{underlying}} cancer causation mechanism is extremely important in understanding how to treat the disease. The disregulation of a given cellular pathway may {{show up in the}} gene expression profile of the cell. If such is the case, computational techniques that can detect this profile change can be used to detect the pathways that have been <b>disregulated.</b> The present study demonstrates a classification based scheme to detect these pathways. The scheme has been applied on publicly available breast cancer data. Our results show that a mechanism that avoids immune surveillance may be implicated in the more aggressive kind of cancer studied...|$|E
40|$|Androgens are {{important}} sex steroid hormones. The androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) {{are essential for}} normal male sexual differentiation and for the development and maintenance of male reproductive tissues, including the prostate. Androgens mediate their effects by binding to, and activation of, the androgen receptor (AR), which is a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor (NR) family. Upon androgen binding, the AR is able to recognize specific DNA sequences from where it regulates the expression of its target genes. A <b>disregulated</b> androgen-AR pathway is involved in several diseases, such as prostate cancer, androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), and Kennedy’s disease or spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) ...|$|E

A large body of evidence supports the involvement of <b>disregulated</b> adaptive immunity in atherogenesis and its complications (Libby et al. 2009; Shah 2007; Matusik et al. 2012). Firstly, plaque instability has been associated with an increased numbers of intra-plaque activated T-cells (Jonasson et al. 1986) and with CD 4 + T lymphocytes preferentially differentiated into Th 1 cells (Martens et al. 1997; van der Wal et al. 1994). Secondly, postmortem studies showed that this CD 4 + subset accumulates preferentially in ruptured plaques and produces high levels of Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (Eid et al. 2009; Giubilato et al. 2011; Liuzzo et al. 2000).|$|E
