40|$|In {{this article}} we will discuss the use of {{two-level}} factorial and fractional factorial experiments with binary responses (defectives/non-defectives) where {{the purpose is to}} reduce the rate of defectives. Contrary to a traditional fixed sample size scheme, we will consider one where each factorial combination is sampled until a fixed number of defectives is observed. The total number of items until that occurs is then used as the response. Such an Inverse Binomial sampling scheme has many practical and economical benefits that will be discussed. For the design of experiments based on this idea, we provide a methodology for choosing the necessary number of defectives r, to detect a given change in the probability of producing a <b>defective</b> <b>unit</b> with fixed levels of type I and type II errors...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} an unreliable production process which produces nondefective items when operating in control, but produces defective items with a probability α when {{the process has}} shifted to an out-of-control state. Following a JIT philosophy, we stop the entire line and repair the machine as soon as detect that the process has shifted to an out-of-control state. To test whether a process shift has occurred, we inspect the last m units for every n units produced and stop the machine if a <b>defective</b> <b>unit</b> is found. More important, we place a "delay buffer" immediately after the unreliable process, which serves to delay the movement of items from the unreliable machine to other processes (or customers) downstream in the production system. When we detect that the machine has shifted to an out-of-control state, we stop the entire line and examine all previously uninspected items in the delay buffer; in this way, the buffer serves to reduce the expected rework and penalty (e. g., warranty) costs downstream when a process shift has occurred. In this paper, we develop a model for this approach and use this model to test the operating characteristics of our system. Computational results illustrate our hypothesis that a delay buffer may significantly reduce expected total costs of a quality control process. quality management, sampling/inspection policies, unreliable production processes, delay buffer...|$|E

40|$|We study a {{planning}} problem of an imperfect {{production of a}} single product. The product {{is assumed to be}} continuously divisible. There are two facilities: a main facility dedicated to the original production and a facility dedicated to re-manufacturing <b>defective</b> <b>units</b> coming from the main facility. Units fabricated on the main facility are inspected for quality in batches. The quality inspection requires some time and can be performed on-line or off-line. After the inspection has been completed, <b>defective</b> <b>units</b> of the inspected batch are transported to the re-manufacturing facility. The transportation also requires some time. We assume that the fraction of the <b>defective</b> <b>units</b> is the same in each batch on the manufacturing facility and that the re-manufacturing facility is perfect. Given a demand for good quality units of the product and an upper bound K on the number of batches, the problem is to find a sequence of batch sizes such that the makespan, i. e., the time of the demand satisfaction, is minimized. We suggest a linear programming formulation, prove several properties of an optimal solution, and finally develop an time solution algorithm. A similar per time unit cost minimization problem is studied as well. Production Batching Rework Reverse logistics...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn many {{reliability}} analyses, {{the probability}} of obtaining a <b>defective</b> <b>unit</b> in a production process {{should not be considered}} constant even though the process is stable and in control. Engineering experience or previous data of similar or related products may often be used in the proper selection of a prior model to describe the random fluctuations in the fraction defective. A generalized beta family of priors, several maximum entropy priors and other prior models are considered for this purpose. In order to determine the acceptability of a product based on the lifelengths of some test units, failure-censored reliability sampling plans for location-scale distributions using average producer and consumer risks are designed. Our procedure allows the practitioners to incorporate a restricted parameter space into the reliability analysis, and it is reasonably insensitive to small disturbances in the prior information. Impartial priors are used to reflect prior neutrality between the producer and the consumer when a consensus on the elicited prior model is required. Nonetheless, our approach also enables the producer and the consumer to assume their own prior distributions. The use of substantial prior information can, in many cases, significantly reduce the amount of testing required. However, the main advantage of utilizing a prior model for the fraction defective is not necessarily reduced sample size but improved assessment of the true sampling risks. An example involving shifted exponential lifetimes is considered to illustrate the results...|$|E
40|$|Quality and {{performance}} are very often the design drivers of engineers working on Space Projects. Reliability {{and availability of}} space systems are requirements on a single unit. In case the unit fails or underperforms, the mission is not accomplished or seriously compromised. The Quality Assurance has the task {{of making sure that}} the satellite complies with the specifications and operates flawless for the entire life. In mass production, the role of Quality Assurance is to minimize, not to eliminate, the number of defects. A certain number of defective units are acceptable. They are repaired or replaced during the guarantee period. How far are satellites from the point where the production cost is so low that replacing a <b>defective</b> <b>unit</b> is cheaper than ensuring it is defective free? Once the satellite market has reached that point, we can say that quantity matters more than quality. In recent years, space projects have seen the deployment of recurrent units for constellations, as GPS, Iridium, Globalstar, and others. Still the number of recurrent units is too small to make a difference. We still need to reach the point where satellites can be built and launched for a fraction of the present cost. Do technologies and methodologies of small satellites play a role to reach the turning point where quantity makes the difference? Is there any market requiring enough recurrent units to push down the development cost per unit to a negligible level?The paper analyzes the technology maturity of small satellites and shows how far small satellites are from the point where the quantity matters more than quality.

40|$|PURPOSE The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of defective positron emission tomography (PET) detectors on clinical PET image quality in simultaneous PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for both time-of-flight (TOF) and non-TOF reconstructed images. PROCEDURES A total of six patients with various malignant tumors were included and underwent a 2 -deoxy- 2 -[(18) F]fluoro-D-glucose PET scan in a fully functional simultaneous TOF PET/MRI. TOF and non-TOF PET images were reconstructed before and after simulating defective detector units. All images were clinically assessed and scored. In addition, a quantitative assessment was performed. Differences were ascertained and compared using the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed-rank test. RESULTS Without TOF, the image artifacts introduced by one defective detector unit already started to degrade the overall image quality. It reduced the confidence and could lead to a change in diagnosis. Simulating three or five defective detector units resulted in more artifacts and further reduced overall image quality and confidence. By including TOF information, the effects were mitigated: Images reconstructed with one defective detector unit had similar scores as the ones without defective units. The average absolute percentage error for one, three, and five defective detector units were respectively 8, 20, and 37  % for the non-TOF cases and only 5, 11, and 19  % for the TOF cases. CONCLUSION Our study indicates that PET image artifacts due to (simulated) defective detectors are significantly mitigated with the integration of TOF information in simultaneous PET/MR. One defective detector unit introduces, on average, a 5  % absolute percentage error. However, in TOF imaging, even in cases with one or three defective units for head and neck imaging and one <b>defective</b> <b>unit</b> for chest and abdominal imaging, overall image quality, artifact scoring, and reader confidence are not significantly degraded...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA profit {{maximization}} inventory {{model for a}} differential item, units of which are not in perfect conditions and are sold from two shops (primary and secondary shops) that are owned by a single management is formulated with variable demand. Here, differential units (both perfect and defective) are received at the primary shop with an infinite rate of replenishment. At the primary shop, the perfect/good products whose demand is a deterministic linear function of current stock level are sold and the <b>defective</b> <b>units</b> spotted {{at the time of}} selling the good products from the lot are transferred continuously to the secondary shop for sale at a reduced price and demand for these units is linearly proportional to the selling price only. In both the shops, shortages are allowed and fully backlogged out of a differential lot which is sorted out into good and <b>defective</b> <b>units</b> in “no-time” {{at the beginning of the}} subsequent schedule. For this model, there are three scenarios depending upon the time of occurrence of shortages at the shops. The time of shortages at the secondary shop occurs (i) exactly at the same time or (ii) before or (iii) after the time of shortages at the primary shop. Again, in each scenario, there are three different cases when the <b>defective</b> <b>units</b> spotted “in-no-time” sorting at the beginning of subsequent schedule are (i) exactly equal to or (ii) less than or (iii) greater than the actual backlogged units at the secondary shop. Thus, for each case under each scenario, profit is maximized and optimum order quantities are evaluated using the computer algorithm based on a gradient method (generalised reduced gradient method). The models are illustrated with numerical examples...|$|R

Failure is detected upon encountering <b>defective</b> <b>units</b> in the second stage, at which time the first stage process may be restored to good condition. To enhance quality, a production lot in Stage 1 is subdivided into sublots which are transferred as soon as possible to Stage 2 for inspection and processing.

40|$|We {{study the}} buyer-seller {{relationship}} in {{a supply chain}} {{from the perspective of}} quality. In particular, we examine situations where quality levels of the product can be observed, yet, conformance cannot be enforced unless the buyer engages in costly, legally-binding activity, which we call audit. We assume that the cost of audit is borne by the buyer. We examine three types of remedies that can be taken in case an audit confirms the existence of quality problems, namely â Full Rebate", â Compensate" and â Repair" contracts. Under the Full Rebate regime, the seller rebates the buyer the purchase price of <b>defective</b> <b>units.</b> Under the Compensate regime (Expectation Damages), the buyer is compensated for his loss of profit due to defects. Finally, under the Repair regime (Specific Performance), the seller is made to repair all the <b>defective</b> <b>units</b> at his own expense. We examine the effects of these contracts on the performance of the supply-chain, and point out the implications for offshore and onshore supply networks, respectively. Our results indicate conditions where the buyer is not motivated to â squeeze" all the profits out of the supply chain, even in a setting of complete information, and even if the relationship is short-term.
