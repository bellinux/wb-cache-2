5000|$|In {{respect of}} Blumberg who was charged {{in respect of}} the {{agreement}} entered into with ANZ Bank {{for the provision of}} a $95 million loan, the court found that Blumberg knew there was a good chance that Opes Prime was insolvent and wouldnt be able to repay the money. Justice Beach commented, [...] "Ultimately I accept that you knowingly engaged in this improper and <b>dishonest</b> <b>transaction</b> for the purpose of attempting to keep OPSL, a company in which you had a substantial interest, in business." ...|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, Mrázek, together with renowned Czech singer Karel Gott, established the foundation Interpo, dedicated to helping children of police officers killed in the line of duty. Gott however withdrew from the collaboration when the foundation became suspected of <b>dishonest</b> financial <b>transactions.</b> Gott later stated that he [...] "hadn't noticed Mrázek's connections with organized crime".|$|R
60|$|He did not, however, sail, {{for just}} {{as he was about to}} embark, a relation, who was engaged in stock {{exchange}} operations in conjunction with a foreign adventurer, carried out some <b>dishonest</b> <b>transactions,</b> those who were his dupes believing that he was acting under information obtained from Lord Cochrane. As soon as the latter heard a report of the affair he left his ship, came up to London, and demanded an investigation. Then followed one of the most disgraceful parodies of justice ever performed in this country. Lord Cochrane was arrested, tried, and by means of a partisan judge, false evidence, and measures more unscrupulous even than those of Judge Jeffreys, convicted and sentenced to imprisonment. A servile House of Commons obeyed the orders of ministers to expel him from their body. His name was struck off the order of the Bath, and his insignia torn down from St. George’s Chapel with every mark of indignity.|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{personal}} property security law {{in this country has}} been not unlike the history of a protracted guerrilla war. Right-thinking people seem always to have felt that there was something vaguely dishonorable, if not outright <b>dishonest,</b> about <b>transactions</b> in which a loan is secured by a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s personal property—particularly about transactions in which the debtor is allowed to remain in possession of the property and to enjoy its full use during the loan period. Exactly what it is that is dishonorable or <b>dishonest</b> about such <b>transactions</b> has never been made clear. Right-thinking people have usually found 2 ̆ 2 fraud 2 ̆ 2 the most helpful debating term—the transaction in question is constructively, even if it is not actually, fraudulent. And of course once you have characterized anything as 2 ̆ 2 constructive fraud, 2 ̆ 2 the possibility of further rational argument is at an end...|$|R
30|$|Beth et al. [14] first {{proposed}} a trust measurement method under open network environment. In their work, trust {{is regarded as}} direct trust and recommendation trust, and a probabilistic method is adopted to represent trust. The PeerTrust model [15] uses the transaction and the community background {{as the source of}} reputation feedback. It can act as a defense against some of the subtle malicious attacks, e.g., a seller develops a good reputation by being honest for small transactions and tries to make a big profit by being <b>dishonest</b> for large <b>transactions.</b> The EigenRep model [16] assumes that if the direct trust between a node and the destination node is higher, the recommendation trust is more reliable. The model uses direct trust to calculate the global trust. This model can effectively solve the bad effect caused by the malicious recommendation. Wang et al. [17] proposed a trust model based on Bayesian network. This model investigates how to describe different aspects of trust to obtain various properties of entities according to different scenes. Wang et al. [18] solved the problem of recommendation trust based on the Bayesian method. This method calculates recommendation trust based on experts’ experience. Lu et al. [19] proposed an evaluation method of software reliability. It is a bottom-up calculation process of trust level that can decompose and synthetically derive a parallel structure, so that the trust value of a system can be calculated accurately. However, there are still some shortages about this kind of models. They only adopt probabilistic model to establish subjective trust model. In other words, subjectivity and uncertainty of trust are equivalent to randomness. They also adopt the averaging method to calculate recommendation trust, which cannot reflect the real situations of a trust relationship.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{earliest}} inventions for keeping track of commercial transactions is the abacus, an instrument that helps a person make arithmetic calculations. Invented over 4500 {{years ago in the}} mid-east, it was further developed by the Egyptians and Chinese into its present form. A variety of different abacus designs exist. The word "abacus " comes from the Greek abax, meaning "counting board. " The device has other names in Asian languages. Cash registers today mechanically implement many of the functions of the abacus. In ancient times the abacus was composed of a row of grooves in sand into which pebbles were placed. Later, the use of a slate or a board made it a portable device, widely used throughout Asia. Today, it is composed of beads strung on parallel wires in a rectangular frame, and is still in use where electricity and batteries are scarce or expensive. For example, a Russian version, the schoty, was still in widespread use within the last decade. The abacus works on the principle of place-value notation: the location of the bead determines its value. In this way, relatively few beads are required to depict large numbers. The beads are counted, or given numerical values, by shifting them in one direction. The Cash Drawer By the middle of the 19 th century, the cash drawer, with its dividers to hold bills and coins, was a common feature of retail establishments all over the world. But as business volume grew under the imputus of the industrial revolution and increasing urbanization, there arose a need for quick and accurate summeries of a daily transactions for each point of sale. Because {{there was no way to}} easily audit <b>transactions,</b> <b>dishonest</b> cashiers frequently augmented their incomes by removing cash when their supervisors were not present...|$|R
