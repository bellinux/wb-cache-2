25|$|In October 2007, McTell {{released}} an 'audio book' titled As <b>Far</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Tell. The three CDs included readings from the autobiography interspersed with new {{recordings of the}} songs they inspired. The As <b>Far</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Tell treble CD was promoted by a tour that included a concert at St Mary’s church in Banbury, a location that featured in {{the first volume of}} autobiography.|$|E
25|$|So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{recollect}} it {{was voted}} a bore {{at the end}} of the 'seventies and, except in suburban homes, such as my own, was never referred to except with a yawn or a smile after the early eighties.|$|E
25|$|During 2008, McTell {{combined}} the two volumes of his autobiography {{into a single}} volume under the title As <b>Far</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Tell for publication to coincide with his autumn tour. The new edition featured additional chapters illustrated by photos from the May family album.|$|E
5000|$|As <b>far</b> back <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{remember}} <b>I</b> {{have always}} loved art—drawing, painting, making music. What I like most {{about it is}} the freedom to create something—anything—from nothing. - Ryan Singer, 2009 ...|$|R

I feel I have taken the club as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> {{and that it would}} be in the best interests of all concerned if I resigned now. I wish the club and everyone concerned with it all the best for the future.|$|E
25|$|After their Defeat the Rebels {{retired to}} the Isle aux Noix, where they {{continued}} till lately, sending out some Parties, and many Emissaries, to debauch the Minds of the Canadians and Indians, {{in which they}} have proved too successful, and for which they were too well prepared by the Cabals and Intrigues of these two last years; We knew of their being reinforced, and very considerably, I suppose, as they appeared in Numbers near St. John's last Sunday Evening; where or when they landed, or the Particulars since, we have but very imperfect Accounts of, all Communications with the Forts of St. John's and Chambli, being, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find, entirely cut off.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said; [...] "and {{you know}} what we talked about. So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> {{anything}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do may count, you are safe. That, of course, was all you wanted to know." ...|$|R

25|$|Sa Ngalan ng Ina was {{the first}} project of Aunor after her return, she starred with Christopher de Leon and Bembol Roco. It was also the last directorial job of the late Mario O'Hara. Sa Ngalan ng Ina is a movie made for {{television}} or a miniseries is a political drama about a widow that ran as a governor when her husband was assassinated. In his review, film critic Noel Vera {{point out that the}} show is rare creature in Philippine television, the political melodrama. Longer and more complex soap operas have been mounted on Philippine television before, and politics has been touched upon before, but <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> recall {{there has never been a}} series (the exact name of the genre is, I believe, the teleserye) fully driven by politics, hinging upon the election into office and subsequent administration of the main character. All of the performances were great especially Aunor which gave her a nomination from Golden Screen TV Awards and a best actress trophy from 2012 Star Awards for Television. This miniseries would be the last collaboration between Aunor and O'hara before his death from leukemia.|$|E
500|$|The {{subjects}} of the band's songs are frequently related to Elmore's relationships. She stated [...] "as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell, I am too brutally honest and opinionated for most people." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{this stage}} Darwin had an acute {{interest}} in island biogeography, and {{his description of}} St Helena as [...] "a little centre of creation" [...] in his geological diary reflects Charles Lyell's speculation in Volume 2 of Principles of Geology that the island would have acted as a [...] "focus of creative force". He later recalled believing in the permanence of species, but [...] "as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember, vague doubts occasionally flitted across my mind". When organising his Ornithological Notes between mid June and August, Darwin expanded on his initial notes on the Galapagos mockingbird Mimus thenca: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} there's any chance, anyway, of my getting over in time now," [...] he remarked. [...] "If you'll take me {{on with you}} <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Norwich, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go quietly home from there!" ...|$|R

500|$|During Casino Royale's {{final draft}} stages, Fleming allowed his friend William Plomer {{to see a}} copy, and remarked [...] "so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see the element of {{suspense}} is completely absent". Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape. At first, they were unenthusiastic about the novel, but Fleming's brother Peter, whose books they managed, persuaded the company to publish it. On 13 April 1953 Casino Royale was released in the UK in hardcover, priced at 10s 6d, with a cover designed by Fleming. It was a success and three print runs were needed {{to cope with the}} demand.|$|E
500|$|Customarily the ship's surgeon {{took the}} {{position}} of naturalist, and the Beagles surgeon Robert McCormick sought fame and fortune as an explorer. When they first met {{at the start of}} the voyage, Darwin had commented that [...] "My friend [...] is an ass, but we jog on very amicably". They walked into the countryside of St. Jago together, and Darwin, influenced by Lyell, found the surgeon's approach old-fashioned. They found a remarkable baobab tree, which FitzRoy measured and sketched. Darwin went on subsequent [...] "riding expeditions" [...] with Benjamin Bynoe and Rowlett to visit Ribeira Grande and St Domingo. FitzRoy extended their stay to 23 days, to complete his measurements of magnetism. Darwin subsequently wrote to Henslow that his collecting included [...] "several specimens of an Octopus, which possessed a most marvellous power of changing its colours; equalling any chamaelion, & evidently accommodating the changes to the colour of the ground which it passed over.—yellowish green, dark brown & red were the prevailing colours: this fact appears to be new, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find out." [...] Henslow replied that [...] "The fact is not new, but any fresh observations will be highly important." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Steiger's acclaim as an actor, he was {{frequently}} accused of overacting and won his {{fair share of}} critics, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. His acting was so dynamic at times that critics found him excessive and overbearing, and even uncomfortable or laughable to watch. Steiger once clashed with Armenian director Rouben Mamoulian, during a theatrical production of Oklahoma!, as he was intolerant of Steiger's [...] "unusual acting technique". Steiger ignored the director's concerns that he was mumbling his lines, and when he began chomping loudly on an apple during a scene with Gordon MacRae, Mamoulian exclaimed: [...] "Get out of my theater. Get out of my life!", and fired him. Even Kazan found several of the Actors Studio's techniques disagreeable, preferring [...] "more humor and verve and less self-indulgence, self-pity and self-awareness". Kazan felt that Steiger often displayed a competitive edge as an actor and tried to steal scenes from his co-stars. Steiger rejected these claims, insisting that he was merely [...] "trying to take the medium of acting to as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go, and that why I sometimes go over the edge".|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh," [...] said Bob, parenthetically, as {{he looked}} over the fields {{on the other side}} of the river, [...] "there goes that crooked young Wakem. I know him or his shadder <b>as</b> <b>far</b> off <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see 'em; I'm allays {{lighting}} on him o' that side the river." ...|$|R

5000|$|Kaplan joined Digital Trends on April Fools' Day in 2014, {{describing}} the {{position as a}} dream job: [...] "As <b>far</b> back <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember, <b>I</b> {{always wanted to be}} a gangster. That’s how Goodfellas begins. But me? Ever since way back when, I always wanted to be involved in technology." ...|$|R
500|$|Although her {{research}} was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was {{not satisfied with}} her position at the University. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions. In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, [...] "I have decided that I must look for another job. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make out, {{there is nothing more}} for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me." [...] Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university. McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she knew she would be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942. Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.|$|E
500|$|There is {{controversy}} over authorship of Frankenstein, as both Shelley {{and her husband}} collaborated on the story. The extent to which Percy Shelley contributed to the novel is unknown. Since Frankenstein was published anonymously in 1818, readers and critics argued over its origins and {{the contributions of the}} two Shelleys to the book. [...] There are differences in the 1818, 1823, and 1831 editions, and Mary Shelley wrote, [...] "I certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident, nor scarcely of one train of feeling, to my husband, and yet but for his incitement, it would never have taken the form in which it was presented to the world." [...] She wrote that the preface to the first edition was Percy's work [...] "as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> recollect." [...] James Rieger concluded Percy's [...] "assistance at every point in the book's manufacture was so extensive that one hardly knows whether to regard him as editor or minor collaborator", while Anne K. Mellor later argued Percy only [...] "made many technical corrections and several times clarified the narrative and thematic continuity of the text." [...] Charles E. Robinson, editor of a facsimile edition of the Frankenstein manuscripts, concluded that Percy's contributions to the book [...] "were no more than what most publishers' editors have provided new (or old) authors or, in fact, what colleagues have provided to each other after reading each other's works in progress." ...|$|E
2500|$|Howe {{was educated}} at Boston Latin School, {{where he was}} cruelly treated, and even beaten, {{according}} to his daughter. Laura (Howe) Richards later wrote: “So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember, my father had no pleasant memories of his school days." ...|$|E

5000|$|Tony Bennett's {{version was}} {{used at the}} {{beginning}} of the film Goodfellas, just after Henry Hill closes the trunk of the car and says in voice-over, [...] "As <b>far</b> back <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember, <b>I</b> always wanted to be a gangster." [...] The song was also used in an episode of Columbo.|$|R

"Yes," [...] said Mrs. Gray, [...] "I think I {{should like}} to go up at least <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> there. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> take a book to read, to while away the time while you are up the mountain; or <b>I</b> <b>can</b> ramble about, <b>I</b> suppose.

2500|$|Since {{the enemy}} began to {{attack on the}} main island of Okinawa, the Army and the Army devoted {{themselves}} to defensive warfare and could hardly {{look back on the}} prefecture's people.

2500|$|Writing as Archie Goodwin, Ken Darby {{suggests}} that [...] "the actual location was on East 22nd Street in the Gramercy Park District. … Wolfe merely moved us, fictionally, {{from one place}} to the other in order to preserve his particular brand of privacy. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> discover, there never were brownstone houses on West 35th Street." ...|$|E

5000|$|Biddle {{was born}} and raised in Wilmington, Delaware, the son of Robert D. and Blanche V. Biddle. His parents {{frequently}} discussed politics, and they welcomed his input. Biddle later remarked that such debates took place [...] "from almost <b>as</b> <b>far</b> back <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember" [...] and that his father expressly encouraged him to think for himself. Biddle spent a lot of his childhood reading about military history and foreign affairs.|$|R
