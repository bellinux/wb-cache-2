2500|$|According to David Thomson, Rivette was [...] "famous {{for having}} {{little or no}} home life, {{certainly}} not a private life that overlaps with his work.

Bulle Ogier described Rivette as very secretive about his life: [...] "I've {{no idea what he}} does. I only see him when we're filming" [...] or when she bumped into him in public, although she felt close to him. According to Ogier, he had neuroses and anxiety which often prevented him from answering the phone, and talking about his personal life would be indiscreet and a betrayal. Laurence Côte said that joining Rivette's inner circle of trusted friends was difficult and required [...] "a number of hurdles to overcome and to respect codes." [...] Martine Marignac said that Rivette was very modest and shy, and that his circle of close friends grew used to not hearing from him for prolonged periods of time.

[...] Jonathan Romney reported that in the 1970s [...] "Rivette sometimes went AWOL from his own shoots, he would invariably be found watching some rarity in one of the Left Bank art cinemas." [...] Jean-Pierre Léaud, who described Rivette as a close friend, said that he [...] "was the only person who saw <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> film.

2500|$|After {{working for}} CMLL {{for over a}} decade, Mr. Niebla left CMLL to work for their main rival Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) in later 2007. Niebla made his debut as one of Los Vipers, a long {{existing}} faction of villains (known as Rudos in Lucha Libre), and soon began challenging Los Vipers' leader Abismo Negro for the leadership role. In the spring of 2008 the storyline saw the two physically fight over the leadership in matches where the job was on the line. Each time Abismo Negro won, but each time AAA head booker Joaquín Roldan announced that the decision was overturned and that Negro, despite winning, did not lead Los Vipers. After the second match the rest of Los Vipers turned on Abismo Negro and kicked {{him out of the}} group. The storyline was supposed to end in a Luchas de apuestas match between Niebla and Negro at Triplemanía XVI. Later on the match was changed to a multi-man steel cage match including all of Los Vipers (Mr. Niebla, Black Abyss, Psicosis II and Histeria) and Abismo Negro with the last person in the cage being forced to unmask. A few days before the event the matchw as cancelled with AAA claiming that Abismo Negro had suffered a neck injury. On the night of Triplemanía XVI Mr. Niebla quit AAA, opting to return to CMLL instead. Mr. Niebla later states that he left AAA because the big mask vs. mask match he was promised fell through the Abismo Negro was unable to work the Triplemanía match and that he came back to CMLL looking to make his mark unmasking a [...] "big name" [...] such as Místico or Dr. Wagner, Jr. He also apologized to AAA if they were upset with the way he left but believed he handled <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> professional manner and that he was up front about his ambitions for a [...] "big name" [...] mask vs. mask match.|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, Final Fantasy V {{improved}} on the ATB {{system by}} introducing a time gauge to indicate to the player which character's turn is next, and it expanded the job system by offering more customization options {{with more than}} 22 job classes and giving each character greater flexibility {{by allowing them to}} learn secondary abilities from each job before changing classes. The job and ATB systems continued to be used in later Final Fantasy titles, and helped differentiate the series from the character class systems and turn-based systems of traditional CRPGs. 1992 also saw the release of Dragon Quest V, a game that has been praised for its involving, emotional family-themed narrative divided by different periods of time, something that has appeared in very few video games before or since. It has also been credited as the first known video game to feature a playable pregnancy, a concept that has since appeared in later games such as Story of Seasons, The Sims 2 and Fable II. Dragon Quest V's monster-collecting mechanic, where monsters can be defeated, captured, added to the party, and gain their own experience levels, also influenced many later franchises such as Pokémon, Digimon and Dokapon. In turn, the concept of collecting <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> game, in the form of achievements or similar rewards, has since become a common trend in video games. Dragon Quest V also expanded the AI [...] "Tactics" [...] system of its predecessor by allowing each ally's AI routines to be set individually. Shin Megami Tensei, released in 1992 for the SNES, introduced an early moral alignment system that influences the direction and outcome of the storyline. It gave the player the freedom to choose between three different paths: Chaos, Law, and Neutral, none of which is portrayed as right or wrong. The deep personal choices the player makes throughout the game affects the protagonist's alignment, leading to different possible paths and multiple endings. This has since become a hallmark of the Megami Tensei series. Another non-linear RPG released that year was Romancing Saga, an open-world RPG by Square that offered many choices and allowed players to complete quests in any order, with the decision of whether or not to participate in any particular quest affecting the outcome of the storyline. The game also allowed players to choose from eight different characters, each with their own stories that start in different places and offer different outcomes. Romancing SaGa thus succeeded in providing a very different experience during each run through the game, something that later non-linear RPGs such as SaGa Frontier and Fable had promised but were unable to live up to. The SaGa series has since become known for its open-ended gameplay. The series is also known for having an activity-based progression system instead of experience levels, and since Romancing Saga, a combo system where up to five party members can perform a combined special attack. Unlike other RPGs at the time, Romancing SaGa also required characters to pay mentors to teach them abilities, whether it was using certain weapons or certain proficiencies like opening a chest or dismantling a trap. Data East's Heracles no Eikō III, written by Kazushige Nojima, introduced the plot element of a nameless immortal suffering from amnesia, and Nojima would later revisit the amnesia theme in Final Fantasy VII and Glory of Heracles. Climax Entertainment's [...] was an early isometric RPG that combined the gameplay of an open-world action RPG with an isometric platformer, alongside an emphasis on varied puzzle-solving as well as strong characterization and humorous conversations. The TurboGrafx-CD port of Dragon Knight II released that year was also notable for introducing erotic adult content to consoles, though such content had often appeared in Japanese computer RPGs since the early 1980s. That same year, Game Arts began the Lunar series on the Sega CD with , one of the first successful CD-ROM RPGs, featuring both voice and text, and considered one of the best RPGs in its time. The game was praised for its soundtrack, emotionally engaging storyline, and strong characterization. It also introduced an early form of level-scaling where the bosses would get stronger depending on the protagonist's level, a mechanic that was later used in Enix's The 7th Saga and extended to normal enemies in Square's Romancing Saga 3 and later Final Fantasy VIII.|$|E
