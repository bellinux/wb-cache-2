50|$|In Saarbrücken Hauptbahnhof, {{the speed}} is {{generally}} limited to 60 km/h. In the following Saarbrücken-Schafbrücke and Rentrisch-St. Ingbert sections the maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> is 90 km/h. Between Schafbrücke and Rentrisch it is 100 km/h and from Scheidt (Saar) it is 110 km/h. Shortly after St. Ingbert station the maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> is gradually increased to 120 km/h, 140 km/h and 160 km/h. The maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> shortly after Limbach is 150 km/h, but, {{due to a}} narrow curve radius before Homburg (Saar) Hauptbahnhof, it is reduced to 110 km/h (120 km/h in the opposite direction). After this curve, the maximum allowed speed is restored to 160 km/h but in Einsiedlerhof marshalling yard it is reduced to 140 km/h again. From the entrance signal to Kaiserslautern Hauptbahnhof it is reduced to 100 km/h (90 km/h in the opposite direction) but the maximum speed is returned at the next curve to 140 km/h and raised to 150 km/h outside the station.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The {{main purpose}} of the article is to {{determine}} the <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> of the air-cushioned tilting train in curved track and to justify the expediency of operating this type of rolling stock on the railways of Ukraine to increase the speed, improve the passenger comfort and save the energy due to more uniform high-speed train driving. Methodology. The determination of the maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> of the tilted train in curved track involves the use of methods of linear and vector algebra and empirical formulas for applied scientific and technical research. The calculation of the maximum speed is based on the principle of calculating centrifugal force for the velocities that meet the safety criteria of movement on the horizontal unbalanced acceleration in the stable radius curve. Findings. The results of the calculations showed that in the 1000 m radius curved track section, provided the passenger comfort, the maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> of the train without forced tilt is 132 km/h, and with the forced tilt – 189 km/h. The velocity gain in the curve is about 30 % and up to 10 % on the section (depending on the number of curves). Originality. The method of determining the <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> of the tilted train in curved track is improved, which consists in determining the permissible centrifugal force acting on the train in the stable radius curve, taking into account the passenger comfort conditions. Practical value. This method allows accurately determining the <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> on the condition of passenger comfort in the curved section and the required additional tilt angle of the train, depending on the speed, curve radius and canting. Enhanced speed and comfort of passenger trains in the future will increase the demand for rail services among the population and strengthen the position of rail transport in Ukraine’s transport system...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the research results of cuts braking modes on the gravity humps. The {{objective of this}} paper is developing the methods for assessment of braking modes of cuts under conditions of fuzziness of their rolling properties, as well as selecting the <b>permissible</b> starting <b>speed</b> range of cuts from retardant positions. As a criterion for assessing the modes of target control of cut rolling speed, it was proposed to use an average gap size on a classification track at the established norms of probable exceeding of <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> of cars collision and their stop in retarders. As a criterion for evaluating the modes of interval control of cuts rolling speed, using the risk of their non-separation on the switches was proposed. Using the simulation modeling and mathematical statistics, the configuration of the range of <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> of cuts coming out from retardant positions has been set. The conducted researches allow simplifying the choice of cut braking modes in systems of automatic control of cut rolling speed. ...|$|R

50|$|In Neustadt Hauptbahnhof, {{the maximum}} <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> of 100 km/h (90 km/h in the {{opposite}} direction) is raised via 130 km/h to 140 km/h and after a subsequent right curve is restored to 160 km/h. This maximum speed continues to Ludwigshafen-Mundenheim, where the top speed is reduced from 130 km/h to 80 km/h and then 60 km/h.
