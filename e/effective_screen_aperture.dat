50|$|A player may at {{any time}} during the auction, by written {{question}} only, ask for an explanation of an opponent's call; the screen-mate must respond in writing. Any questions during the play period must be made with the <b>screen</b> <b>aperture</b> closed; again, both question and answer must be in writing. The <b>screen</b> <b>aperture</b> is opened after the response has been made. Failure to observe the requirements for written questions and responses constitutes an offence subject to penalty.

50|$|<b>Screens</b> with <b>apertures</b> {{small enough}} to block {{termites}} were developed in Australia and have widely used in the United States, mostly for plumbing penetrations, since the 1990s. One of the early uses of screens for pest exclusion was the implementation of screen doors and window coverings. Screens are required by building codes at vent openings. To exclude rats, screen openings must be ½” (13.7 mm) or smaller. To exclude mice, a <b>screen</b> <b>aperture</b> size of ¼” or smaller is required. Most insects can be excluded with screens measuring 1/16” (1.59mm) in aperture size, but to effectively exclude subterranean termites, required <b>screen</b> <b>apertures</b> measure 1/55” (0.46 mm). Application areas for screens in the building envelope include weep holes, soffits, gable and ridge vents, among others.|$|R

50|$|A trommel screen, {{also known}} as a rotary screen, is a {{mechanical}} screening machine used to separate materials, mainly in the mineral and solid-waste processing industries. It consists of a perforated cylindrical drum that is normally elevated at an angle at the feed end. Physical size separation is achieved as the feed material spirals down the rotating drum, where the undersized material smaller than the <b>screen</b> <b>apertures</b> passes through the screen, while the oversized material exits {{at the other end of}} the drum.|$|R

The functional {{dependence of the}} barrier height on the inner metal thickness is formulated {{in terms of the}} metal <b>effective</b> <b>screening</b> length and the interface trap states. This model is used to describe experimental results on Pt-Ti-GaAs and Ti-Pt-GaAs diodes. It is found that the <b>effective</b> <b>screening</b> lengths for Pt and Ti are 6. 5 and 7. 0 angstrom, respectively, significantly greater than the ideal values of the theory of N. F. Mott and H. Jones (1958). This indicates that the potential drop inside the metal electrode can evolve over several monolayers in a Schottky contact. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The massive-band {{effects on}} {{screening}} behavior of metallic carbon nanotubes are theoretically investigated using two different methods; continuous and lattice quantum theories. Both approaches show screening of a localized external perturbation with an <b>effective</b> <b>screening</b> {{length of the}} order of the nanotube diameter. Calculating the nonlinear deformation of the local density of states near the charged perturbation, we show that the perturbative effects of the massive bands are effectively canceled by direct massive band interactions, such that a good agreement between the two methods can be achieved. The <b>effective</b> <b>screening</b> is important in nanoscale integration of nanotube-based electronic devices. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundCervical cancer {{incidence}} {{remains high}} in several Baltic, central, and eastern European (BCEE) countries, mainly {{as a result}} of a historical absence of <b>effective</b> <b>screening</b> programmes. As a catalyst for action, we aimed to estimate the number of women who could be spared from cervical cancer across six countries in the region during the next 25 years, if <b>effective</b> <b>screening</b> interventions were introduced. MethodsIn this population-based study, we applied age–period–cohort models with spline functions within a Bayesian framework to incidence data from six BCEE countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Bulgaria, and Russia) to develop projections of the future number of new cases of cervical cancer from 2017 to 2040 based on two future scenarios: continued absence of screening (scenario A) versus the introduction of <b>effective</b> <b>screening</b> from 2017 onwards (scenario B). The timespan of available data varied from 16 years in Bulgaria to 40 years in Estonia. Projected rates up to 2040 were obtained in scenario A by extrapolating cohort-specific trends, a marker of changing risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, assuming a continued absence of <b>effective</b> <b>screening</b> in future years. Scenario B added the effect of gradual introduction of screening in each country, under the assumption period effects would be equivalent to the decreasing trend by calendar year seen in Denmark (our comparator country) since the progressive regional introduction of screening from the late 1960 s. FindingsAccording to scenario A, projected incidence rates will continue to increase substantially in many BCEE countries. Very high age-standardised rates of cervical cancer are predicted in Lithuania, Latvia, Belarus, and Estonia (up to 88 cases per 100   000). According to scenario B, the beneficial effects of <b>effective</b> <b>screening</b> will increase progressively over time, leading to a 50 – 60 % reduction of the projected incidence rates by around 2040, resulting in the prevention of cervical cancer in 1500 women in Estonia and more than 150   000 women in Russia. The immediate launch of <b>effective</b> <b>screening</b> programmes could prevent almost 180   000 new cervical cancer diagnoses in a 25 -year period in the six BCEE countries studied. InterpretationBased on our findings, there is a clear need to begin cervical screening in these six countries as soon as possible to reduce the high and increasing incidence of cervical cancer over the next decades.

50|$|However more {{material}} can be screened at once for a vibrating screen {{compared to a}} trommel screen. This is because {{only one part of}} the screen area of the trommel screen is utilised during the screening process whilst the entire screen is used for a vibrating screen. Trommel screens are also more susceptible to plugging and blinding, especially when different sized <b>screen</b> <b>apertures</b> are in series. Plugging is when material larger than the aperture may become stuck or wedged into the apertures and then may be forced through which is undesirable. Blinding is when wet material clump up and stick {{to the surface of the}} screen. The vibrations in the vibrating screens reduce the chance of plugging and blinding.|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{existence}} of an <b>effective</b> <b>screening</b> technique for cancer of the cervix, incidence and mortality from this disease have not declined in the United Kingdom. The basic problem is that women most at risk of the disease are under-represented in the screened population. The evidence for two different points of view to explain this situation is examined. These viewpoints are the failure of the women to attend, and the failure of the service {{to meet the needs of}} women. This paper argues that the evidence supports the view that the organisation of the existing screening service impedes the maximum participation of at-risk women. We discuss the features that an effective service needs to incorporate, and put forward principles for the development of a more <b>effective</b> <b>screening</b> system, namely, that it should be provider-initiated and user-oriented. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} whether to screen {{individuals}} for Barrett’s esophagus (BE) to prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is highly controversial. Important considerations are that BE is not highly prevalent {{in the general population}} and that not many patients with BE develop or die from EAC. Studies that suggest an improved prognosis from surveillance programs are susceptible to lead-time bias. Most of the principles for <b>effective</b> <b>screening,</b> as outlined by the World Health Organization, are not met by endoscopic screening and surveillance protocols. The diagnosis of BE (and dysplasia) is often unclear. Most patients with BE are not identified by screening, and few deaths would be prevented by surveillance. A decision analysis found that the most cost <b>effective</b> <b>screening</b> protocol would be every five years, but the costs associated with prolongation of life are very high, even if a group at high risk for EAC could be identified...|$|R

50|$|There is no {{significant}} increased risk in future hospital admissions after a prophylactic salpingectomy.
