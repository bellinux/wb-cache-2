5000|$|The ISO 4217 {{standard}} {{includes a}} crude mechanism for expressing {{the relationship between}} a major currency unit and its corresponding minor currency unit. This mechanism is called the currency [...] "exponent" [...] and assumes a base of 10. For example, USD (the United States dollar) is equal to 100 of its minor currency unit the [...] "cent". So the USD has exponent 2 (10 to the power 2 is 100, which is the number of cents in a dollar). The code JPY (Japanese yen) is given the exponent 0, because its minor unit, the sen, although nominally valued at 1/100 of a yen, is of such negligible value that it is no longer used. Usually, as with the USD, the minor currency unit has a value that is 1/100 of the major unit, but in some cases (including most varieties of the dinar) 1/1000 is used, and sometimes ratios apply which are not integer powers of 10.

40|$|Abstract‚ÄîIn this work, {{we present}} a radix- 10 {{division}} unit {{that is based on}} the digit-recurrence algorithm. The previous <b>decimal</b> <b>division</b> designs do not include recent developments in the theory and practice of this type of algorithm, which were developed for radix- 2 k dividers. In addition to the adaptation of these features, the radix- 10 quotient digit is decomposed into a radix- 2 digit and a radix- 5 digit {{in such a way that}} only five and two times the divisor are required in the recurrence. Moreover, the most significant slice of the recurrence, which includes the selection function, is implemented in radix- 2, avoiding the additional delay introduced by the radix- 10 carry-save additions and allowing the balancing of the paths to reduce the cycle delay. The results of the implementation of the proposed radix- 10 division unit show that its latency is close to that of radix- 16 division units (comparable dynamic range of significands) and it has a shorter latency than a radix- 10 unit based on the Newton-Raphson approximation.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for {{high-speed}} arithmetic co-processors for use in applications with computationally intensive tasks. For instance, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) co-processors are used in real-time multimedia services and financial applications use decimal co-processors to perform large amounts of decimal computations. Using redundant number systems to eliminate word-wide carry propagation within interim operations is a well-known technique {{to increase the speed}} of arithmetic hardware units. Redundant number systems are mostly useful in applications where many consecutive arithmetic operations are performed prior to the final result, making it advantageous for arithmetic co-processors. This thesis discusses the implementation of two popular arithmetic co-processors based on redundant number systems: namely, the binary FFT co-processor and the decimal arithmetic co-processor. FFT co-processors consist of several consecutive multipliers and adders over complex numbers. FFT architectures are implemented based on fixed-point and floating-point arithmetic. The main advantage of floating-point over fixed-point arithmetic is the wide dynamic range it introduces. Moreover, it avoids numerical issues such as scaling and overflow/underflow concerns at the expense of higher cost. Furthermore, floating-point implementation allows for an FFT co-processor to collaborate with general purpose processors. This offloads computationally intensive tasks from the primary processor. The first part of this thesis, which is devoted to FFT co-processors, proposes a new FFT architecture that uses a new Binary-Signed Digit (BSD) carry-limited adder, a new floating-point BSD multiplier and a new floating-point BSD three-operand adder. Finally, a new unit labeled as Fused-Dot-Product-Add (FDPA) is designed to compute AB+CD+E over floating-point BSD operands. The second part of the thesis discusses decimal arithmetic operations implemented in hardware using redundant number systems. These operations are popularly used in decimal floating-point co-processors. A new signed-digit decimal adder is proposed along with a sequential decimal multiplier that uses redundant number systems to increase the operational frequency of the multiplier. New redundant <b>decimal</b> <b>division</b> and square-root units are also proposed. The architectures proposed in this thesis were all implemented using Hardware-Description-Language (Verilog) and synthesized using Synopsys Design Compiler. The evaluation results prove the speed improvement of the new arithmetic units over previous pertinent works. Consequently, the FFT and decimal co-processors designed in this thesis work with at least 10 % higher speed than that of previous works. These architectures are meant to fulfill the demand for the high-speed co-processors required in various applications such as multimedia services and financial computations...|$|E
