This is worn to the classroom, the dining hall, on weekends, and during social hours. The key {{differences}} between summer and winter daily colours are that a green safari hat is often worn in summer (instead of the cap) and the school's sweatshirt, gloves and scarf may be worn during the winter term. In wet seasons, the boys may be allowed to wear Wellington boots instead of chukka boots.|$|R

5000|$|Traditional Thai {{clothing}} is called chut thai (ชุดไทย [...] ) which literally means [...] "Thai outfit". It {{can be worn}} by men, women, and children. Chut thai for women usually consists of a pha nung or a chong kraben, a blouse, and a sabai. Northern and northeastern women may wear a sinh instead of a pha nung and a chong kraben with either a blouse or a suea pat. Chut thai for men includes a chong kraben or pants, a Raj pattern shirt, with optional <b>knee-length</b> white <b>socks</b> and a sabai. Chut thai for northern Thai men is composed of a sado, a white Manchu styled jacket, and sometimes a khian hua. In formal occasions, people may choose to wear a so-called formal Thai national costume.|$|R
40|$|Skin {{tears are}} {{traumatic}} injuries occurring {{mostly on the}} extremities due to shearing and friction forces that separate the epidermis and the dermis from underlying tissues. They are common and occur mostly in older adults and those taking medications that compromise skin integrity. Pretibial skin tears can develop into leg ulcers, which require lengthy, expensive treatment to heal. Traumatic injuries are {{the second most common}} type of wounds after pressure ulcers in care homes and are the commonest reason for older adults to require the attention of a community nurse. Common causes of skin tear injuries are bumping into furniture and other obstacles, using mobility aids, transfer to/from wheelchairs, getting in and out of bed and falls.

5000|$|The summer term usually commences {{one week}} after each new year. During this term, new boys (known as [...] "lighties") join the school whilst {{existing}} boys progress to the next grade, which requires moving into a new dormitory house ("dorms"). Unlike the other two terms, all boys must take part in compulsory cross country running every morning and sometimes in the afternoon too. Junior boys (grades 3 and 4) complete a 3 kilometre course known as the [...] "sadac" [...] because its route winds around SADC headquarters, while senior boys (grades 5 to 7) take a longer route colloquially {{referred to as the}} [...] "dip tank" [...] which is approximately 5 kilometres. Most boys participate in track and field athletics and long-distance running, with few taking part in racquet sports such as tennis. The daily uniform in summer consists of short-sleeved khaki shirts, khaki shorts, <b>knee-length</b> grey <b>socks,</b> veldskoen chukka boots and, on weekends, a safari hat. This is worn to lessons, the dining hall, and during social time but is substituted for full colours for Sunday chapel service.|$|R
5000|$|The players wore white shorts, black <b>knee-length</b> <b>socks</b> and [...] "white tunics" [...] {{with a red}} sash worn diagonally. Early {{photographs}} {{show the}} sashes worn from either shoulder in a rather haphazard fashion.

5000|$|Raj pattern (ราชปะแตน, , [...] ) refers {{either to}} a Thai men's costume {{consisting}} of a white Nehru-style jacket with five buttons, a chong kraben, <b>knee-length</b> <b>socks</b> and dress shoes, or to the specific form of the jacket itself. It was worn chiefly during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries by government officials and the upper class in Bangkok, and nowadays is used in select circumstances as a national costume.|$|E
50|$|The xout lao, the {{traditional}} clothing of Laos, {{is composed of}} different parts. The style varies between genders from regions to regions, and it often depends on the occasions. For instance, in formal settings men typically wear a white silk Nehru-style jacket with a pha hang with white <b>knee-length</b> <b>socks</b> and dress shoes. Men can also optionally wear a pha biang with checkered patterns on their left shoulders. Women typically wear a sinh matching in colors with a pha biang and a silk suea pat.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Skin {{tears are}} {{traumatic}} injuries occurring {{mostly on the}} extremities due to shearing and friction forces that separate the epidermis and the dermis from underlying tissues. They are common and occur mostly in older adults and those taking medications that compromise skin integrity. Pretibial skin tears can develop into leg ulcers, which require lengthy, expensive treatment to heal. Traumatic injuries are {{the second most common}} type of wounds after pressure ulcers in care homes and are the commonest reason for older adults to require the attention of a community nurse. Common causes of skin tear injuries are bumping into furniture and other obstacles, using mobility aids, transfer to/from wheelchairs, getting in and out of bed and falls. No effective preventative measures currently exist but <b>knee-length,</b> protective <b>socks</b> are now available that contain impact-resistant Kevlar fibres (of the type used in stab-proof vests) and cushioning layers underneath. METHODS/DESIGN: In this pilot parallel group, randomised controlled trial, 90 people at risk of skin-tear injury will be randomised with equal allocation to receive the intervention or usual care. They will be recruited from care homes and from the community via general practices and a research volunteer database. Pilot outcomes include recruitment, eligibility, attrition, ascertainment of injuries and completion of outcome measures. Acceptability of the intervention and of study participation will be explored using semi-structured interviews. The proposed primary outcome for the future definitive trial is skin tear-free days. Secondary outcomes are skin tear severity, health status, specific skin-tears quality of life, capability and fear of falling, measured at baseline {{and the end of the}} study and in the event of a skin tear. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will be used to inform the development and design of a future randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a unique and innovative approach to skin tear prevention. Approval was granted by the NRES - Cornwall and Plymouth Research Ethics Committee (13 /SW/ 013). Dissemination will include publication of quantitative and qualitative findings, and experience of public involvement in peer-reviewed journals.

5000|$|Goddet {{was educated}} {{at a private}} school near Oxford, England, and {{maintained}} a love for both Britain and the enthusiasm for sport encouraged in his school. He wrote in the thunderous, literary terms established by Henri Desgrange and referred not to finish lines but [...] "les arrivées magistrales". He wrote of the French rider Louison Bobet [...] "accepting gallantly the delay attributed {{to him by the}} celestial handicapper". In the heat of southern France, he adopted khaki shorts and shirt, <b>knee-length</b> <b>socks</b> and a pith helmet.|$|E
5000|$|The {{last two}} characters, {{on the outer}} edges of the group, are playing rough music on bladder fiddles. One has his face {{disguised}} with a simple (cloth?) mask and wears a peaked cap. He wars white trousers, and possibly a dark, sleeveless jerkin over a paler, long-sleeved garment. The other [...] "musician" [...] is more smartly dressed, in top hat, a long riding jacket, breeches, tight, <b>knee-length</b> <b>socks</b> or gaiters and polished shoes. He has {{what appears to be}} a false beard and bushy eyebrows.|$|E
50|$|They are so-named {{because of}} their {{popularity}} in Bermuda, a British Overseas Territory, where they are considered appropriate business attire for men when made of suit-like material and worn with <b>knee-length</b> <b>socks,</b> a dress shirt, tie, and blazer. They are considered more appropriate in hot subtropical and tropical climates than the typical heavier clothing favored in Europe. Many businesses in the West today that have a business casual policy similarly allow this kind of clothing in the hotter seasons, especially in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. They are available {{in a variety of}} colours, including many pastel shades as well as darker shades.|$|E
50|$|For boys, {{the uniforms}} {{generally}} include a button-up shirt together with either shorts (especially for summer wear) or long trousers, usually in gray. Some schools allow boys to wear shorts only in younger years, {{and they must}} wear long trousers from around the age of puberty (13-14 years). At others, even older boys wear shorts in summer due to the heat. Where short trousers are to be worn, long (near <b>knee-length)</b> <b>socks</b> in school colors are often required. Girls' uniforms generally include a checkered or striped dress (usually sleeveless or short-sleeved) worn over a blouse for summer and, in most secondary schools, girls wear a skirt {{as well as a}} button-up in winter with a blazer and tie. In a number of schools, girls are also permitted to wear a button-up shirt and dark trousers.|$|E
50|$|Stanway had {{a summer}} and winter uniform. The winter uniform {{consisted}} of: brown shoes, grey tights, grey knickers, a white vest, a white shirt, a long purple tie, a purple tunic dress, a grey blazer with purple ribbon edging and the school logo emblazoned on the breast pocket, and a grey felt hat, with a purple ribbon, tied in a bow at the back and secured with black elastic. The summer uniform consisted of: a white and purple knee-length patterned summer dress, with yellow accents, with a sash-belt and short sleeves, a grey cardigan, white <b>knee-length</b> <b>socks,</b> white knickers, brown sandals, the same blazer as above and a straw boater hat, with a purple ribbon, tied in a bow at the back, and secured with white elastic. School swimming costumes and gym leotards were purple, sports kit was white, with a grey skirt or jogging bottoms for netball and white plimsolls. There was also a grey sweatshirt, with the school logo on it, which was optional. Swimming caps were compulsory and were the colour of the Set you were in. (Yellow for Swallows, Red for Swifts and Blue for Skylarks: the same colour as the badges, which were small, round and plain.) Ballet dresses were pink and sleeveless, with a sash around the middle, and the shoes were pink leather, secured with pink satin ribbon or pink string for the juniors.|$|E
