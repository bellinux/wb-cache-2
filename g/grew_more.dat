5|$|Bethlehem paid {{taxes on}} wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were {{organized}} into separate communities, each having its own leader. Five leaders represented {{the village in}} the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or <b>grew</b> <b>more</b> grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).|$|E

5|$|Paris grew in {{population}} from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780.

5|$|After Boroughbridge Pembroke {{found himself}} in a {{difficult}} situation. The opponents of Hugh Despenser and his father had lost all faith in him, {{but at the same time}} he found himself marginalised at court where the Despensers' power <b>grew</b> <b>more</b> and more complete. On top of this came his financial problems. On 24 June 1324, while on an embassy to France, he suddenly collapsed and died while lodging somewhere in Picardy.|$|E
5|$|During her reign, Anne favoured {{moderate}} Tory politicians, {{who were}} more likely to share her Anglican religious views than their opponents, the Whigs. The Whigs <b>grew</b> <b>more</b> powerful {{during the course of the}} War of the Spanish Succession, until 1710 when Anne dismissed many of them from office. Her close friendship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, turned sour as the result of political differences. The Duchess took revenge in an unflattering description of the Queen in her memoirs, which was widely accepted by historians until Anne was re-assessed in the late 20th-century.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{appreciation}} of Bashō's poems <b>grew</b> <b>more</b> fervent, and commentators such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru {{went to great}} length to find references in his hokku to historical events, medieval books, and other poems. These commentators were often lavish in their praise of Bashō's obscure references, {{some of which were}} probably literary false cognates. In 1793 Bashō was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, and for a time criticizing his poetry was literally blasphemous.|$|E

5|$|Llywelyn the Great {{initially}} {{controlled the}} princedom of Gwynedd, but <b>grew</b> <b>more</b> powerful {{over the course}} of his reign, extending his influence over much of Wales during the early years of the 13th century. Llywelyn was faced by several challenges, including dealing with the threat from the kings of England, and maintaining his authority over the native Welsh. As part of this strategy, Llywelyn built Castell y Bere, an innovative stone Welsh castle, in the 1220s. Shortly afterwards he began the first phases of Dolbadarn Castle, constructing the initial stone fortifications on the site, including two square stone towers.|$|E
5|$|Most {{settlers}} in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed {{within a few}} decades {{as varied as the}} settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply. Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land <b>grew</b> <b>more</b> expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.|$|E

5|$|Nils Melzer {{presents}} an historical, legal and moral examination of targeted killing. The author observes that after September 11, the Western world <b>grew</b> <b>more</b> supportive of targeted killing than ever before. The book recounts in depth how state-sanctioned targeted killing is perceived in other countries. He defines targeted killing as the premeditated selection {{of an individual}} person not yet in custody for elimination by force. Melzer analyzes {{all areas of the}} topic.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Giolitti {{acknowledged}} {{the need to}} stifle the agitation. From May 1893 onwards, leaders of the Fasci were arrested occasionally and police and military reinforcements were sent to Sicily. In the autumn of 1893 the leadership lost control over the Fasci and the popular agitation got out of hand. Peasant squatters seized land, violent crowds demonstrated for work and against local misgovernment, tax offices were burnt down and clashes with the police <b>grew</b> <b>more</b> frequent and bloody. The violent social conflict almost rose {{to the point of}} insurrection. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the game's {{mechanisms}} for contacting players <b>grew</b> <b>more</b> complex.

5|$|Replacement {{pilots were}} pushed through an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions <b>grew</b> <b>more</b> desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{referred}} to the Natural Resources Committee, which then referred it to its Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans, chaired by Bordallo. Hearings were held a week later, at which Shelley Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London who studies the shark-fin trade, observed that transshipment operations such as the KD IIs were common and would likely continue as the competition in Hong Kong, the industry's traditional center, <b>grew</b> <b>more</b> intense. While the transshipment ban was an effective response to the decision, she suggested that shipments of containerized fins be allowed {{if they had been}} separated from their carcasses after landing.|$|E
5|$|The {{rulers of}} the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650BC) {{continued}} building pyramids and their associated complexes. The rare remains from Middle Kingdom temples, {{like the one at}} Medinet Madi, show that temple plans <b>grew</b> <b>more</b> symmetrical during that period, and divine temples made increasing use of stone. The pattern of a sanctuary lying behind a pillared hall frequently appears in Middle Kingdom temples, and sometimes these two elements are fronted by open courts, foreshadowing the standard temple layout used in later times.|$|E
