5|$|At the FBI safe house, {{a police}} car arrives with Modell. Modell enters the room that Linda is in and locks the door behind him. Mulder tells Scully {{the news of the}} therapist's death and urges her to keep Linda away from a phone. At the safe house, Skinner finds Linda's room door locked. He kicks the door down to find Modell and Linda, with Modell calmly saying that he has a gun. Without hesitation, Skinner shoots Modell when he sees a gun in Modell's hand, but once he is on the ground Skinner sees that <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> curled into the shape of the gun.|$|E
5|$|Some pundits {{have argued}} that the top was not in fact Cobb's totem, {{rendering}} the discussion irrelevant. They say that the top was Mal's totem; Cobb's was his wedding ring, as he can be seen wearing it whenever he is in a dream and without it whenever he isn't. As he hands his passport to the immigration officer, <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> shown with no ring; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children. Furthermore, the children were portrayed by different actors, indicating they had aged.|$|E
5|$|Years later, after Ferreira has died, Kichijiro asks Rodrigues to absolve him again, but Rodrigues refuses, {{saying he}} is no longer a priest. Kichijiro later is caught with a pouch he claims to have won while {{gambling}} containing a religious amulet which he disclaims as being his own. He is taken away and never heard from again. Many years later, Rodrigues dies. He is placed in a large round wooden casket, and his body is cremated. In <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> the tiny crudely-made crucifix that was given to him when he first came to Japan.|$|E

5|$|The grandsons are {{depicted}} {{in very different}} styles: Alessandro acts in a formal manner and wears clothes of similar colour and tones to Paul. Ottavio, by contrast, wears the browns of the upper right-hand passage, {{an area of the}} painting that cuts him physically from the pope. His pose is awkward and difficult to interpret, but he is rendered in a more naturalistic manner than his brother. Alessandro has a distracted, brooding expression. He holds the knob of Paul's backrest, in an echo of Raphael's portrait where Clement VII holds the chair of Leo X as an indicator of his ambitions of succession. Thus Alessandro seems better placed politically, standing to Paul's right in a pose that recalls traditional depictions of Paul the Apostle, and <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> raised as if in blessing. In the end, Paul was unable to influence his succession after Charles V weakened the Medici hold on the office.|$|E
5|$|Book Four, The Alchemist, {{takes place}} in Samarkand, in the 17th century. An alchemist named Khalid, {{attempts}} to fool the Khan into believing that he has discovered the Philosopher's stone (which supposedly can turn Lead into Gold), but his fraud is uncovered and <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> chopped off as punishment. Khalid becomes depressed and disenchanted with Alchemy (the prevailing belief of the scholars of the time) and decides to destroy all his Alchemical books (which come to Samarkand via the trade routes {{from all over the}} known world). However, his friends Iwang (a Tibetan Buddhist mathematician) and Bahram (a Sufi blacksmith) instead convince him to test the veracity of the claims in the books and thus see if there is any true wisdom to be gained. They devote themselves to practical demonstrations and experiments that greatly improve knowledge of various aspects of physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and weaponry, and in the process create the scientific method. Their discoveries create interest (and alarm) amongst the religious madrasahs of the city, many of whom also go along with the new fashion of building and testing scientific apparatuses. But most of all, they catch the eye of the Khan's powerful advisor, who sees in their inventions the possibility of great military technology, to fight the rising Chinese threat to the East.|$|E

Michael and Serena were able to re-attach the hand but while the operation appeared to be successful, there is uncertainty regarding Malick's future as a surgeon as only partial use of <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> expected to return with physiotherapy.|$|E

25|$|In Blackest Night #1, Garth {{returns to}} Atlantis and tells Orin's wife Mera {{that he is}} angry {{at the notion of}} Aquaman's body being buried on land. Mera relays to Tempest that Orin felt safe on land and that it is indeed what he wanted. Sometime later, a black power ring is seen {{entering}} Orin's grave, bidding him to rise. Aquaman's corpse rises, along with those of Tula and Dolphin as revenant members of the Black Lantern Corps, and demands that Mera reunite with him in death, offering her a chance to see her son again. Garth is killed and joins the Black Lanterns himself. Mera rejects the corpse before fleeing. In the climax of the miniseries, Aquaman is among those resurrected by The White Lantern Entity, and is reunited with Mera. Because the Black Lantern Ring helps reconstruct Orin's body, when he is resurrected <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> restored as well.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, he {{held two}} sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall in New York. In March 2017, Yoshiki {{performed}} with a 4-piece string quartet at Hong Kong’s Asia Film Awards. In April 2017, Yoshiki debuted a special collaboration T-Shirt with rock group KISS titled “YOSHIKISS”. During these performances, he lost sensation {{in his left}} hand and was rediagnosed with cervical foraminal stenosis. In May 2017, it was announced that Yoshiki would undergo emergency cervical artificial disc replacement surgery in Los Angeles on May 16, resulting in the cancelling of his schedule for May, and future events being possibly cancelled or rescheduled based on discussions after his surgery. The surgery was successful, with his surgical wound expected to take six weeks to heal, and for him to make a 90% recovery in six months. However, the recovery period for the pain in <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> unknown.|$|E

During Buster's long psychological recovery, he bonds with George Sr.'s stoner twin brother Oscar, who moves in with Lucille {{in an attempt to}} rekindle a past love affair. Uncle Oscar slowly reveals himself as Buster's presumptive biological father. Eventually, George Sr. takes revenge on the adulterous Oscar and Lucille by kidnapping Oscar, knocking him unconscious, exchanging appearances with him, and sending him to prison in his place.|$|E

500|$|Chet {{believes}} {{the loss of}} <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> due to his unfaithfulness to his wife; as a child his mother read Chet {{the story of a}} Saint Justin who cuts off his right hand to avoid sinning, and Chet assumes his lost hand is a like punishment from God. [...] He tries to atone for it by killing his girlfriend, Josie, in the woods. [...] Penis-worshipping, rat-eating pygmy cannibals drag the bodies of both Josie and Ed into the sewers. [...] As they are about to sever Ed's penis Josie reanimates in time to save him.

500|$|On the {{direction}} of the film, Selick reflected, [...] "It's as though he [...] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> in it. It was my job {{to make it look like}} 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films." [...] When asked on Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, [...] "I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total." [...] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some use of second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was directing Batman Returns and in pre-production of Ed Wood.|$|E
500|$|Written and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker, [...] "201" [...] was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 21, 2010. The episode continued multiple storylines from the previous episode [...] "200", the 200th entry of the series. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone decided to celebrate their 200th episode by revisiting several subplots that had been featured throughout the show's 14 seasons. Multiple celebrities have been lampooned throughout the series' history, inspiring Parker and Stone {{to have all the}} past celebrities join in a class action lawsuit against the town of South Park. The ginger kids—children with fair skin, freckles and red hair—have been featured in several past episodes, where they were ridiculed by Cartman, who views them with prejudice. Cartman uses a hand-puppet con-artist named Mitch Conner who originally appeared in the seventh season episode [...] "Fat Butt and Pancake Head", in which Cartman pretends <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> Jennifer Lopez and uses many Hispanic stereotypes in his portrayal of her. Cartman regards Connor as a separate entity and has conversations with him, while Stan and Kyle do not accept this idea at all.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 13, 1910. It states: [...] "The story centers on Harry Willard, a plodding farmer. A city gentleman promises Harry's frivolous wife a life of ease and luxury - {{and it is the}} old, old story. She takes her tiny daughter, Agnes, with her, and leaves a note announcing the fact for Harry. The young farmer, who loves his wife and child with an all-consuming love, loses his reason as he reads the announcement of his betrayal. Although without the bare means for his subsistence, he searches for days for his loved ones. Eventually the strain, mental and physical, tells on him - he comes out of it all a maniac. His wrath takes the form of an aversion to all mankind. He wants to forget the world that has treated him so ill - he decides to become a hermit and betakes himself to a desolate cave, where he spends the years execrating humanity. A quarter century goes by. Rarely in that time does he venture on beaten paths for fear that he may meet a hated human, but one day he forgets his resolve long enough to cross a carriage drive. He hears the clatter of hooves and sights a horse tearing toward him with a swaying carriage and screaming occupants - runaway! As the carriage passes by him, a woman flings a bundle to him; he catches it and finds it a pink and white bit of humanity. Dazed he runs into the wilderness with a baby and makes for his cave. Arrived at the cave the maniac resolves to even his score with society by taking the babe's life. But his eyes light on the baby's locket and <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> stayed. For the locket bears a picture of the child of the wife who betrayed him!" ...|$|E
