25|$|On a {{philosophical}} level, homological algebra teaches us that certain chain complexes associated with algebraic or geometric objects (topological spaces, simplicial complexes, R-modules) contain {{a lot of}} valuable algebraic information about them, with the homology being only the most readily available part. On a technical level, homological algebra provides the tools for manipulating complexes and extracting this information. <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> general illustrations.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics and the style {{has been compared}} to that of West's The College Dropout album. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breiham praised the song, saying [...] "Jay and Kanye trade off verses and never pause for a chorus, each one building on whatever the last one said-- an old-school rap-collab style you almost never hear anymore. And since these guys are working loose and casual, it gives them chances to show how funny and clever they are without telegraphing their own importance. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone gave the song a four stars rating out of five wrote that [...] "West twists a few seconds of Otis Redding's [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] into a Blueprint-style barrage, setting the stage for some slick collar-popping from Jay-Z ("Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth / I'm about to call the paparazzi on myself"). Jay's performance, in turn, inspires Ye to step up his wordplay ("Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses / Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive"); the younger star sounds like he pulled an all-nighter trying to outdo his mentor's rhymes." [...] Frank Berg of NME gave the song a mostly positive review, stating that [...] "What we have <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> titans of black music duetting with another from beyond the grave. For that reason, it's unquestionably An Event", though feeling [...] "In all honesty, if this winds up being the highlight of Watch the Throne we'll all be a bit disappointed." ...|$|E

2500|$|... <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> {{seemingly}} explicit {{references to}} Offenbach's La Périchole, for both Carboy's comic attempt at suicide {{and the efforts}} of the chorus to revive the swooning nobleman have their parallels in the Offenbach work. [...] The particular point of this imitation seems to lie in the fact that La Périchole was at that time sharing the bill with Sullivan's own Trial by Jury at a theatre not too distant from the St James', and the audience at The Zoo might reasonably be expected to know this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{actually}} {{starting to}} dig in a location, remote sensing {{can be used to}} look where sites are located within a large area or provide more information about sites or regions. There are two types of remote sensing instruments—passive and active. Passive instruments detect natural energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene. Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. Satellite imagery is an example of passive remote sensing. <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> active remote sensing instruments: ...|$|E

2500|$|Lexa, and her {{relationship}} with Clarke, have been well received by critics and fans. Maureen Ryan, writing for The Huffington Post, stated, [...] "In a show packed with morally compromised characters, Lexa stood out; she led a tribe of Earth inhabitants named Grounders {{with a combination of}} deftness, intelligence and unhesitating ferocity." [...] Ryan felt Lexa [...] "does not suffer fools gladly, yet Debnam-Carey made Lexa's vulnerability and her attraction to Clarke Griffin (Eliza Taylor) not just believable, but engrossing." [...] Linda Ge of TheWrap referred to her as a fan-favorite, while Eric Goldman of IGN called her [...] "a standout, highly popular character". The staff for SheWired stated that she [...] "had the best character introduction ever and never stopped being great" [...] and [...] "has proven to be endlessly engaging, even when she's making choices that make us want to crawl into a ball and cry." [...] Dana Piccoli of AfterEllen.com characterized Lexa as a [...] "mysterious queer character" [...] that has caught the audience's attention, and complimented the [...] "chemistry and increasing bond between Lexa and Clarke," [...] adding, [...] "Both are smart, and somehow manage to see the bigger picture. [...] <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> young women, leading their people to salvation or at least as close to salvation as they can get." [...] The A.V. Clubs Kyle Fowle reasoned that Lexa's resolve while facing the reality of protecting the Sky People, the 13th clan, while risking an uprising from the other clans and her own people [...] "is exactly what makes her one of the better characters on TV." [...] Hypable.com's Selina Wilken said that she was [...] "one of the best and, yes, most divisive characters in recent TV history." ...|$|E
