5000|$|The Belgian Underground Research Laboratory, {{located at}} a depth of -223 m in Boom Clay. It allows the in situ {{characterization}} of this clay layer presently studied as a reference host formation for the geological disposal of nuclear waste. HADES acronym stands for [...] "High Activity Disposal Experimental Site". HADES facility is operated by the EURIDICE economic interest group (EIG). The main tasks presently performed in the HADES facility are large scale demonstration tests. The on-surface Ophelie mock-up lasted 5 years (1997-2002) and was intended to study the thermo-hydraulic-mechanical behaviour of a bentonite buffer emplaced around a central <b>heating</b> <b>tube</b> simulating a high level waste (HLW) canister. Amongst other results, this experiment allowed to detect an important microbial activity in the bentonite buffer and in the water of the hydration system of the experiment. Concentration as high as 0.5 mM in dissolved sulfide and thiosulfate were measured in the water and microbially induced corrosion (MIC) was observed on stainless steel after the dismantling of the experiment. The next large scale in situ experiment is the Praclay experiment aimed at studying the thermo-hydraulic-mechanical behaviour of the clay formation at depth at the scale of a disposal gallery for a period of 10 years. The Praclay experiment is expected to start in 2012 after sufficient hydration of the hydraulic seal.|$|E
5000|$|Sir Charles Parsons was {{the first}} to attack the problem of {{generating}} high pressure simultaneously with high temperature. [...] His pressure apparatus consisted of piston-cylinder devices that used internal electrical resistance heating. He used a solid pressure transmitting material, which also served as thermal and electrical insulation. His cylindrical chambers ranged in diameter from 1 to 15 cm. The maximum pressure at the temperature he reported was of the order of 15000 atm (corresponding to ~1.5 GPa) at 3000 °C.Loring L. Coes, Jr., of the Norton Co., {{was the first}} person to develop a piston-cylinder device with capabilities substantially beyond those of the Parsons device. He did not personally publish a description of this equipment until 1962. The key feature of this device is the use of a hot, molded alumina liner or cylinder. The apparatus is double ended, pressure being generated by pushing a tungsten carbide piston into each end of the alumina cylinder. Because the alumina cylinder is electrically insulating, heating is accomplished, very simply, by passing an electric current from one piston through a sample <b>heating</b> <b>tube</b> and out through the opposite piston. The apparatus was used at pressures as high as 45000 atm (corresponding to ~4.5 GPa) simultaneously with a temperature of 800 °C. Temperature was measured by means of a thermocouple located in a well. At these temperature and pressure conditions, only one run is obtained in this device, the pistons and the alumina cylinder both being expendable. Even at 30000 atm (corresponding to ~3.0 GPa) the alumina cylinder is only useful for a few runs, as is also the case for the tungsten carbide pistons. The expense of using such a device is great.Nowadays both the piston and the cylinder are constructed of cemented tungsten carbide and electrical insulation is provided in a different manner than in the device of Coes. In particular, the basis for the modern piston-cylinder apparatus is given by the design described by Boyd and England in 1960, which has been the first machine that allowed experiments under upper mantle conditions to be routinely carried out in a laboratory.|$|E

40|$|The {{volatility}} of sub-micrometer atmospheric aerosol particles was studied {{in a rural}} background environment in Finland {{using a combination of}} a <b>heating</b> <b>tube</b> and a scanning mobility particle sizer. The analysis focused on nanoparticles formed through nucleation which were subsequently observed during their growth in the diameter range between 5 and 60 nm. During the 6 days of new particle formation shown in detail, the concentrations of newly formed particles increased up to 10 000 cm − 3. The number of nucleation mode particles measured after volatilization in the <b>heating</b> <b>tube</b> at 280 °C was up to 90 % of the total number under ambient conditions. Taking into account the absolute accuracy of the size distribution measurements, all ambient particles found in the rural atmosphere could have a non-volatile core after volatilization at 280 °C. As the regional new particle formation events developed over time as a result of further vapor condensation, the newly formed particles grew at an average growth rate of 2. 4 ± 0. 3 nm h − 1. Importantly, the non-volatile cores of nucleation mode particles were also observed to grow over time, however, at a lower average growth rate of 0. 6 ± 0. 3 nm h − 1. One implication of the volatility analysis is that the newly formed particles, which have reached ambient diameters of 15 nm, are unlikely to consist of sulfuric acid, ammonium sulfate, and water alone. A relatively constant ratio between the growth rate of the ambient particles as well as their non-volatile cores indicates that non-volatile matter is formed only gradually in the growing particles. The non-volatile fraction of the particles showed some correlation with the ambient temperature. The composition and formation mechanism of this non-volatile material in nucleation mode particles are, to date, not known...|$|E

The test tubes used were: (1) smooth tubes and (2) deformed surface (TURBO-B) enhanced tubes. The effects of tube spacing/configuration and lower <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> flux on the heat transfer performance of the upper tube were investigated. For both tube arrays, the enhancing effect of bubbles from a lower tube was dramatic. This enhancement increased as lower <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> flux increased. However, when upper <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes were greater than 20 kW/sq. meters all enhancement disappeared. For a smooth tube array in natural convection, {{the effect of a}} lower <b>heated</b> <b>tube</b> on the <b>heat</b> transfer from an upper tube was small. In nucleate boiling, a P/D of 1. 8 gave the best upper <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> transfer performance and a vigorously nucleating lower tube eliminated upper tube hysteresis. With the lower tube unheated and an upper <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> flux of greater than 3 kW/m 2, the performance using R- 124 was generally better than for R- 114.
