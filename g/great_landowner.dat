5|$|Piers Gaveston's {{father was}} Arnaud de Gabaston, a Gascon knight {{in the service}} of Gaston VII of Béarn. Gabaston had come into a {{substantial}} amount of land in Gascony through his marriage to Claramonde de Marsan, who was co-heir with her brother of the <b>great</b> <b>landowner</b> Arnaud-Guillaume de Marsan. Through the possessions of his wife, Gabaston also became a vassal of the King of England, in the King's capacity of Duke of Aquitaine. His service to Edward I of England stretched {{over a long period of}} time, starting in the Welsh Wars of 1282–83, in which he participated with a substantial contingent. Sometime before 4 February 1287, Claramonde died, and for the rest of his life Gabaston struggled to retain his wife's inheritance from rival claims by relatives and neighbours. Because of this, he became financially dependent on the English king, and was continuously in his service. He was used as a hostage by Edward twice: first in 1288 to Aragon, secondly in 1294 to the French king, when he managed to escape and flee to England in 1297. After returning home, he was back in England in 1300, where he served with Edward I in the Scottish Wars. He died at some point before 18 May 1302.|$|E

25|$|John Sydenham as in infant {{inherited}} the estate from his grandmother the original Joan Sydenham (née Stourton). However, {{at this time}} Brympton D'Evercy was not the principal family residence. In 1534 John Sydenham made over the house to his son, also, John– having first built the North wing to be his private lodgings for later visits. The new owner John III, was a <b>great</b> <b>landowner</b> bequeathing to each of his many children an estate. This lack of primogeniture {{proved to be the}} Sydenham's downfall. John III's successor John IV (died 1585), and his son John V (died 1625) were considerably less wealthy than their forebears, and used the house as their sole residence, the result of which was, despite their comparative penury, they added much to the house. John IV built the present west front thus enlarging the hall, and John V built the large kitchen block.|$|E

2500|$|Luca Arbore or Arbure (Old Cyrillic: Renaissance Latin: Herborus or Copacius; died April 1523) was a Moldavian boyar, diplomat, and statesman, {{several times}} {{commander}} of the country's military. He first rose to prominence in 1486, during the rule of Stephen III, Prince of Moldavia, to whom he was possibly related. He became the long-serving gatekeeper (or castellan) of Suceava, bridging military defense and administrative functions with a diplomatic career. Arbore therefore organized the defense of Suceava during the Polish invasion of 1497, after which he was confirmed as one of Moldavia's leading courtiers. As a military commander he participated in Moldavian's occupation of Pokuttya in 1502. He is tentatively identified as [...] "Luca the Vlach", who served Stephen on crucial diplomatic missions to Poland and the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Also a <b>great</b> <b>landowner</b> and patron of the arts, Arbore commissioned the painting of Arbore Church. The building {{is one of the}} eight Moldavian churches on the UNESCO World Heritage list.|$|E

6000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the chapter}} I gave an account of an {{interview}} I [...] had with a <b>great</b> <b>landowner</b> who happened to be a collector, and [...] who cried out that such a law as the one I suggested would be [...] an unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the subject. [...] Another interview years later was with one who is not only a [...] landowner, the head of a branch of a great family in the land, [...] but a great power in the political world as well, and, finally, [...] (not wonderful to relate) a great [...] "protector of birds." [...] "No," [...] he said warmly, [...] "I will not for a moment encourage you to hope [...] that any good will come of such a proposal. If any person [...] should bring in such a measure I would do everything in my [...] power to defeat it. I am a collector myself and I am perfectly [...] sure that such an interference with the liberty of the subject [...] would not be tolerated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{first thought}} this morning, when Mr. Cotter {{told me that}} the money had mounted up to over 100,000 pounds, was that it would unseal my lips. You were still better off than I was, but the {{difference}} was now immaterial. I was a rich man, and had not the smallest occasion to marry for money. Whether I married a girl without a penny, or an heiress, could make but little difference to me, as I have certainly no ambition to become a <b>great</b> <b>landowner.</b> I still think {{that it would have been}} more fair to you to give you the opportunity of seeing more of the society of the world before speaking to you, but you see you are opposed to that, and therefore it would be the same did I wait patiently another year, which I don't think I should be able to do. I love you, Millicent. It is only during the past eighteen months, when I have thought that I had lost you, that I have known how much I love you, and how much my happiness depends upon you. I can truly say that were you penniless, it would make no shadow of difference to me. It is no longer a question of arranging matters comfortably: it is a question of love. The estate is nothing to me. It never has been anything, and it does not count at all in the scale. I hope that you will put it altogether out of your mind in giving me an answer; and that if you cannot say as truly and wholly as I do, 'I love you,' that you will say as frankly as you have always spoken to me, 'I love you very much as a cousin, Mark, but not in that way.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Another {{ancestor}} or great-uncle had {{chased the}} United Irishmen for a fortnight, fallen into {{their hands and}} been hanged, and the notorious Major Sirr who betrayed the brothers Shears, taking their children upon his knees to question them, if the tale does not lie, had been god-father to several of my great-great-grandfather's children; while to make a balance, my great-grandfather had been Robert Emmett's friend and been suspected and imprisoned though but for a few hours. A great-uncle had been Governor of Penang, and led the forlorn hope at the taking of Rangoon, and an uncle of a still older generation had fallen at New Orleans in 1813, {{and even in the}} last generation there had been lives of some power and pleasure. An old man who had entertained many famous people, in his 18th century house, where battlement and tower showed the influence of Horace Walpole, had but lately, after losing all his money, drowned himself, first taking off his rings and chain and watch as became a collector of many beautiful things; and once to remind us of more passionate life, a gun-boat put into Rosses, commanded by the illegitimate son of some great-uncle or other. Now that I can look at their miniatures, turning them over to find the name of soldier, or lawyer, or Castle official, and wondering if they cared for good books or good music, I am delighted with all that joins my life to those who had power in Ireland or with those anywhere that were good servants and poor bargainers, but I cared nothing as a child for Micky's tales. I could see my grandfather's ships come up the bay or the river, and his sailors treated me with deference, and a ship's carpenter made and mended my toy boats and I thought that nobody could be so important as my grandfather. Perhaps, too, it is only now that I can value those more gentle natures so unlike his passion and violence. An old Sligo priest has told me how my great-grandfather John Yeats always went into his kitchen rattling the keys, so much did he fear finding some one doing wrong, and how when the agent of the <b>great</b> <b>landowner</b> of his parish brought him from cottage to cottage to bid the women send their children to the Protestant school and all had promised till they came to one who cried, [...] "child of mine will never darken your door," [...] he had said [...] "thank you, my woman, you are the first honest woman I have met to-day." [...] My uncle, Mat Yeats, the Land Agent, had once waited up every night for a week to catch some boys who stole his apples and when he caught them had given them sixpence and told them not to do it again. Perhaps it is only fancy or the softening touch of the miniaturist that makes me discover in their faces some courtesy and much gentleness. Two 18th century faces interest me the most, one that of a great-great-grandfather, for both have under their powdered curling wigs a half-feminine charm, and as I look at them I discover a something clumsy and heavy in myself. Yet it was a Yeats who spoke the only eulogy that turns my head. [...] "We have ideas and no passions, but by marriage with a Pollexfen we have given a tongue to the sea cliffs." ...|$|E
