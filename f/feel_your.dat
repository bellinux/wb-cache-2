[...] "I can <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> body / pressed against my body / Wrap yourself around me / Love to feel you throbbing", the singer sang amid moans, elements of house music, C Music Factory-esque beats and a saxophone loop. Chuck Arnold from Philadelphia Daily News noted the song's [...] "surprisingly frank dirty talk" [...] with the lyric [...] "I can <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> body/Pressed against my body/When {{you start to}} poundin'/Love to feel you throbbin'". MuuMuse described the song writing that the track [...] "swells and deflates in an aching, circular motion–not unlike a musical orgasm".|$|E

According to Pope, she decided to sing the song {{in order to reach}} out to her father who {{divorced}} from her mother when she was still 11 years old.

500|$|In 1924, Ferdinand and Marie {{undertook}} a diplomatic tour of France, Switzerland, Belgium and the United Kingdom. In England, she was warmly welcomed by George V, who declared that [...] "apart {{from the common}} aims, which we pursue, there are other and dear ties between us. Her Majesty the Queen, my dear cousin, is British born." [...] Similarly, Marie wrote that {{the day of her}} arrival in England was [...] "a great day for me, one of emotions, sweet, happy and the same time glorious emotions to come back as Queen to my own country, to be received officially, in all honour and enthusiastically into the bargain – to <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> heart swell with pride and satisfaction, to <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> heart beat and tears start into your eyes, while something gave you a lump into your throat!" [...] These state visits were a symbolic recognition of the prestige Romania had gained after World War I. Whilst visiting Geneva, Marie and Ferdinand became the first royals to enter the newly established headquarters of the League of Nations.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a soul {{weighing}} 21 grams is mentioned in numerous media, including a 2013 issue of the manga Gantz, a 2013 podcast of [...] Welcome to Night Vale, the 2015 film The Empire of Corpses, and the 2015 song [...] "21 Grams" [...] by Niykee Heaton, which features the line [...] "I just want your soul in my hands, <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> weight of 21 grams."

500|$|Between verses, {{the rhythm}} is punctuated by samples of former glamour model Samantha Fox ("Touch me, touch me, I want to <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> body"), {{as well as}} a sample [...] "Ancients of Mu Mu" [...] (by The JAMs' {{associate}} rapper Chike) which recurred throughout the next ten years' work of Drummond and Cauty. [...] Also heard is a rendition by children of [...] "Ring a Ring o' Roses", rhythmic panting, and an original female vocal line concerning infant mortality. Sounds magazine stated that the deliberate placement of Fox's sexually provocative [...] "Touch Me" [...] alongside [...] "Ring a Ring O'Roses" [...] ("the nursery rhyme about the Plague") [...] "highlights explicitly the depth of contradiction embedded in society's attitude towards death through sex". More succinctly, NME said: [...] "'All You Need...' is by everyone" [...] (so many samples) [...] "and about everything" [...] (and a variety of thematic nuances).|$|E
500|$|It was '97 and I {{was leaving}} my {{marriage}} [...] which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's {{what he would}} say to me.

At that point I really believed that I was {{going to go back to}} the marriage – I didn't think I was going to leave forever. But then the things that happened to me during that time caused me to not go back. Had it been, 'Go be yourself, you've been with me since you were a kid, let's separate for a while,' I probably would've." ...|$|E

500|$|Finally, on May 19, Giuliani held what The New York Times again {{described}} as [...] "an emotional, riveting news conference" [...] that [...] "reached {{a new level}} of introspection" [...] to announce that he was dropping out of the senate race: [...] "This is not the right time for me to run for office. If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different, maybe it would be different. But it isn't different and that's the way life is." [...] He added that, [...] "I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably. It isn't. When you <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> mortality and your humanity you realize that, that the core of you is first of all being {{able to take care of}} your health." [...] He said that he would instead devote the remainder of his mayoralty trying to overcome the hostile relations he had with many of the city's minority groups.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} film and its allusions to The Empire Strikes Back, some deliberately placed references {{have been made to}} draw allusions with Return of the Jedi. The title is similar in style to the original planned [...] "Revenge of the Jedi". Some dialog is mirrored in both films especially the line [...] "I can <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> anger!" [...] spoken by Palpatine, who also orders his personal entourage/bodyguards to [...] "Leave us" [...] at important moments in both films. Darth Vader attempts to play on Luke's fear of loss by taunting him with threats against Leia. His own fear of the loss of Padmé is what draws him to the dark side. Prior to settling on the Ewoks as the main helpers, the Wookiee race was originally planned to be in Return of the Jedi. [...] Anakin's decision to save Palpatine over Master Windu parallels the decision he would eventually make as Darth Vader to save Luke from Palpatine in Return of the Jedi.|$|E
500|$|After {{enduring}} {{three years}} of [...] "carping" [...] from critics, Carey planned her return to music. On November 18, 2004, she revealed on her website that {{the name of the}} album would be The Emancipation of Mimi. While Carey was recording the album, Island Records executive L.A. Reid had learned that close friends referred to the singer as [...] "Mimi". He had told Carey, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> spirit on this record. You should use that name in the title, because that's the fun side of you that people don't get to see – the side that can laugh at the diva jokes, laugh at the breakdown jokes, laugh at whatever they want to say about you and just live life and enjoy it." [...] Carey explained that Mimi is a [...] "very personal nickname" [...] only used by those in her inner circle, and thus the title meant she was letting her guard down and inviting her fans to be that much closer to her. She thought that naming her album The Emancipation of Mariah Carey would be [...] "obnoxious".|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} team maintained heavily enforced security around the film. Karl Urban revealed, [...] " [...] {{level of security}} and secrecy that we have all been forced to adopt. I mean, it's really kind of paranoid crazy, but sort of justified. We're not allowed to walk around in public in our costumes {{and we have to}} be herded around everywhere in these golf carts that are completely concealed and covered in black canvas. The security of it is immense. You <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> freedom is a big challenge." [...] Actors like Jennifer Morrison were only given the scripts of their scenes. The film's shooting script was fiercely protected even with the main cast. Simon Pegg said, [...] "I read [...] with a security guard near me – it's that secretive." [...] The film used the fake working title of Corporate Headquarters. Some of the few outside of the production allowed to visit the set included Rod Roddenberry, Ronald D. Moore, Jonathan Frakes, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, Ben Stiller, Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg (who had partially convinced Abrams to direct because he liked the script, and he even advised the action scenes during his visit).|$|E
500|$|Nada Es Igual... is {{an album}} which {{consists}} of [...] uptempo [...] "jazzy, brassy, Al Jarreau-like" [...] pop songs and power ballads. [...] Its uptempo tracks include [...] "Si Te Vas" [...] and [...] "Todo Por Su Amor" [...] which utilize horn instruments and [...] "Cómo Es Posible Que a Mi Lado" [...] which incorporates house music. [...] "Dame" [...] is a R-lite" [...] with tune hip-hop influences. Los Angeles Times music critic Enrique Lopetegui wrote that the album is [...] "basically {{a continuation of the}} singer's favorite turf - ... woman-melting ballads." [...] The first track on the album, [...] "Si Te Vas", is a song about the narrator who yearns to remain with his lover: ("Every morning when I wake up, I feel anxiety in my soul, I want to listen to your voice, I want to <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> kisses"). The power ballads in the album are [...] "Que Tú Te Vas", [...] "Abrázame", [...] "Un Día Más", and the title track. For arrangements on the ballads, Miguel received assistance from the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The album also features the song [...] "Sueña", the Spanish-language version of [...] "Someday" [...] by All-4-One from the movie The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It was released as a single for the Latin American edition of The Hunchback of Notre Dame soundtrack and peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs, and number one on the Latin Pop Songs charts.|$|E
500|$|The caravan {{park was}} largely empty at the time, and closed for winter {{several days after}} filming ended. Both actors and crew slept in the same caravan in which the film was set. Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he {{felt that it was}} [...] "quite hectic but [...] a great atmosphere". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder {{remained}} in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they [...] "wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as you woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered." [...] During filming, he contracted swine flu, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline. He noted that [...] "I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll just stop eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to feel a lot calmer." [...] Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that [...] "When I was 14, I had– let's call it an existential crisis. I wondered if [...] was a case of me destroying that part of me. If you do have a breakdown that young, {{for the rest of your}} life you're very aware of it. It can make you <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> foundations are a little bit shaky. It's a devastating experience but we revisited it. I just went with my instincts and intuition." ...|$|E

500|$|Other {{reviews from}} the North American {{leg of the}} tour {{included}} Melissa Ruggierie writing for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution online blog. Ruggierie praised Beyoncé's performance, particularly the strong vocals demonstrated in [...] "1+1" [...] and concluded [...] "watching her command a stadium stage for two hours was another reminder of her limitless ambition". However, {{it was noted that}} Beyoncé did not speak to the crowd very often. After Beyoncé's hometown performance in Houston, Brandon Caldwell of the Houston Press introduced his article stating [...] "Hours after the slaying, the wig snatching, the fitted snatching, the life getting, the boy byes and various curses of shock, amazement and confusion, I stood with a perplexed look on my face. How? How does Beyoncé do this? On this level? With this magnitude?". Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times concluded her positive review of the Pasadena stop of the tour with [...] "Soaking wet and sitting onstage alone, she left the audience with the closing number, [...] "Halo". She'd been baptized and reborn into a less-perfect version of Queen Bey, allowing a more powerful Beyoncé to arise from that imperfection". Jim Harrington of the San Jose Mercury News began his article stating [...] "there were so many moving parts – a tremendous swirl of sharply choreographed dance routines, cool special effects, brilliant fireworks and other tactics for delighting tens of thousands", Harrington noted however that too many snippets of songs rather than their full versions were performed, feeling quality over quantity was missed. The first Canadian show of the tour in Edmonton was performed in cold and rainy conditions, with Beyoncé stating [...] "Can you <b>feel</b> <b>your</b> fingers? I can't feel mine" [...] and [...] "I have to say this is the coldest show I've ever done". Despite this, Sandra Sperounes of the Edmonton Journal commented [...] "not even rain or bitter wind could stop our Ms. Flawless, our Survivor, our Queen Bey from dazzling an estimated 40,000 fans at Commonwealth Stadium on a stormy Friday night." [...] Sperounes concluded [...] "the sun was nowhere to be found, but thanks to Bey's brilliant set, the crowd left beaming with giddiness, girl power and generosity".|$|E
