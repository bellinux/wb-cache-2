40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{knitting}} industry has expanded considerably due to the increased demand for knitted fabrics. Not only does the weft knitting industry produce more <b>of</b> the <b>fabrics</b> which are exclusive, to the kntting trade {{but it has also}} branched out into fields which were previously only open to the weaving trade. This increasing demand is partly due to the development of new fibres,but mainly to the technological improvements of the knitting machines,which now provide many new structures and more scope for patterned-fabrics. Another improvement in weft knitting machinery has been an increased rate <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>production,</b> but in this field the limitations of the machines have now almost been reached.

[...] The song was {{a good example of}} how producer Billy Sherrill had updated the sound of Jones' records, incorporating a laid back, R&B bass line.

In the case of the Saltire, variations in shades of blue have resulted in the background of the flag ranging from sky blue to navy blue. When incorporated as part of the Union Flag during the 17th century, the dark blue applied to Union Flags destined for maritime use was possibly {{selected on the basis of}} the durability of darker dyes, with this dark blue shade eventually becoming standard on Union Flags both at sea and on land. Some flag manufacturers selected the same navy blue colour trend of the Union Flag for the Saltire itself, leading to a variety of shades of blue being depicted on the flag of Scotland.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> authorized discourses about Information Technology (IT), i. e. of “organizing visions” (OVs), through {{the investigation of}} the discourses, practices, and sociomaterial contexts that make up their micro-social underpinnings. The case of a trade show allows us to explore the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> everyday discourses and practices about IT by gathering many of the parties involved in the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> organizing visions. Through a combination of direct observations, interviews, pictures, documents and a survey, we identify and analyze a number of micro-social practices related to the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> IT discourses. The trade show we studied was not a context in which new IT buzzwords and concepts emerged, but, rather, it was a setting where existing discourses about IT were repeated, refreshed, and materialized. Our three main findings reveal intriguing relationships between practices, discourses, and sociomaterial contexts: (1) practices and artifacts contribute to enclose the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> discourses; (2) practices and discourses aim at refining and updating an existing discourse about IT; and (3) many actors in the trade shows engage in discourses and practices that materialize the IT artifact. This research adds to the conceptualization of the dynamics of OVs through {{a better understanding of how}} they are affected by the relationships between the discourses and practices of multiple actors and by the sociomaterial context in which they take place. It draws several strategic implications concerning the dynamics of OVs at the industry level, how actors influence the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> OVs, as well as the roles and combination of artifacts, discourses and practices to build OVs...|$|R
