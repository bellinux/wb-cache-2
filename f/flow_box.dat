50|$|The {{consistency}} in the <b>flow</b> <b>box</b> is typically under 0.4% for most paper grades, with longer fibres requiring lower consistency than short fibres. Higher consistency causes more fibres to be oriented in the z direction, while lower consistency promotes fibre orientation in the x-y direction. Higher consistency promotes higher calliper (thickness) and stiffness, lower consistency promotes higher tensile and some other strength properties and also improves formation (uniformity). Many sheet properties continue to improve down to below 0.1% consistency; however, this is an impractical amount of water to handle. (Most paper machine run a higher headbox consistency than optimum {{because they have been}} sped up over time without replacing the fan pump and headbox. There is also an economic trade off with high pumping costs for lower consistency).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{transformation}} of soil from a plastic state to a viscous liquid state is primarily {{caused by a}} change in the water content of the soil mass. As the water content increases, the soil mass gradually starts to behave like a viscous liquid. In spite of viscosity being a key parameter to the initiation of mudflows, there have only been a few datasets on soil viscosity changes successfully measured continuously as the soil moves from a plastic state to a viscous liquid state. The aim of the current research is to design a new device to overcome this problem. Based on the trap door principle, formulated by Terzaghi (1943) and the Bingham model, a new device called the <b>flow</b> <b>box</b> was designed. The governing equation of the <b>flow</b> <b>box</b> was derived in this research in order to obtain the relationship between the initial viscosity and the liquidity index. In this study, the viscosities in both plastic and viscous liquid states were clearly defined by the <b>flow</b> <b>box</b> test. The expected decrease in initial viscosity was followed by an increase in the liquidity index, which corroborated with the test results. The initial viscosity readings were also validated with the results of other similar researches and the case study of the Maokong mudflow. Hence, the purpose of this research is to create a new device to successfully determine the viscosity levels as soil changes from the plastic state to the liquid state...|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} discrete fracture {{model was}} completed {{to investigate the}} potential effects of fractures on {{the flow of water}} at Yucca Mountain, Nye County, Nevada. A fracture network of the Exploratory Studies Facility starter tunnel area was simulated and calibrated with field data. Two modeled volumes were used to simulate three-dimensional fracture networks of the Tiva Canyon tuff. One volume had a width and length of 150 meters, and the other had a width and length of 200 meters; both volumes were 60 meters thick. The analysis shows that the fracture system in the Exploratory Studies Facility starter tunnel area has numerous connected fractures that have relatively large permeabilities. However, pathway analysis between three radial boreholes indicated there were few pathways and little connection, which is consistent with results of cross-boreholes pressure testing. Pathway analysis also showed that at the scales used there was only one pathway connecting one end of the <b>flow</b> <b>box</b> to the opposite end. The usual vertical pathway was along one large fracture, whereas in four horizontal directions the pathway was from multiple fracture connections. As a result, the fracture network can be considered sparse. The fracture network was refined by eliminating nonconductive fractures determined from field-derived permeabilities. Small fractures were truncated from the simulated network without any effect on the overall connectivity. Fractures as long as 1. 25 meters were eliminated (a large percentage {{of the total number of}} fractures) from the network without altering the number of pathways. Five directional permeabilities were computed for the 150 - and 200 -meter-scale <b>flow</b> <b>box</b> areas. Permeabilities for the 150 -meter scale vary by almost two orders of magnitude, with the principal permeability direction being easterly.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of mudflow, {{which is a}} type of mass movement, is different from that of landslide. A landslide has a discrete failure surface, whereas a mudflow has flow characteristics. Hence, the conventional approach of explaining the characteristics of landslide is not applicable in mudflow. The adaptation of rheological models, such as the Bingham and Herschelâ€“Bulkley models, is required to explain the characteristics of mudflow. Qualitative classifications of mudflow based on water content are also available. The mass movement of mudflow is initiated when the water content of the mudflow is equal to or higher than its liquid limit. Thus, the mass movement of mudflow occurs when the mud is in a viscous liquid state. However, up to now, a detailed explanation on how mudflow is initiated by using a rheological approach is nonexistent. In this study, a <b>flow</b> <b>box</b> test is developed to determine the rheological parameters of mud, including yield stress and viscosity. This test is established to overcome the lack of conventional viscometers, which can only measure the rheological properties of mud in a viscous liquid state. The <b>flow</b> <b>box</b> test utilized the Bingham model and a couple of trap door mechanisms. Results are then interpreted using a method similar to the Herschelâ€“Bulkley model. The <b>flow</b> <b>box</b> test provides reliable results for both plastic and viscous liquid states. Results show that the mudflow characteristics can be explained based on the changes in viscosity. Sudden changes in viscosity occur when the mud reaches its liquid limit, implying that mudflow is possibly triggered when the soil water content of the mud is equal to its liquid limit. The results of this study provide a detailed explanation of mudflow initiation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe phase concept {{implies that}} the state of soil changes from plastic to viscous liquid as a {{function}} of water content. This principle could be used to interpret the behavior of mudflows, the most dangerous mass movements today. When Typhoon Jangmi hit northern Taiwan in 2008, a mudflow occurred in the Maokong area {{as a result of the}} high-intensity rainfall. This case was studied using three simulations, each with a different water content. Based on the mudflow classifications, the primary criteria used in this study were flow velocity and solid concentration by volume, while the major rheology parameters directly obtained from our new laboratory device, the <b>flow</b> <b>box</b> test, were yield stress and viscosity. The results show that the mass movement confirmed the aforementioned criteria for mudflow when the water content reaches or exceeds the liquid limit. The <b>flow</b> <b>box</b> test can determine the viscosity for both plastic and viscous liquid states, which is advantageous. Viscosity is important for explaining the general characteristics of mudflow movement because it controls flow velocity. Therefore, the present study successfully elucidates the changes in mudflow from its initiation to its transportation and deposition via a numerical simulation using laboratory rheology parameters...|$|E

Stationary phases for the separation column were optimized using a conventional GC and contrasted with the results obtained with the MC.

Let f: M Ìƒ â†’ T be a weakly transverse map which is equivariant with respect to an action of pi 1 (M) on the tree T.
