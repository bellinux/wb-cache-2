40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{imputation}} techniques and strategies. Usually, imputation truly commences {{after the first}} data editing, but many preceding operations are needed before that. In this editing step, the missing or deficient items are to be recognized and coded, and then it is decided which of these, if any, should be substituted by imputing. There {{are a number of}} imputation methods and their specifications. Consequently, {{it is not clear what}} method finally should be chosen, especially when an imputation method may be best in one respect, and another method in the other. In this paper, we consider these questions through the following four imputation methods: (i) random <b>hot</b> <b>decking,</b> (ii) logistic regression imputation, (iii) linear regression imputation, and (iv) regression-based nearest neighbour <b>hot</b> <b>decking.</b> The last two methods are applied with the two different specifications. The two metric variables have been used in empirical tests. The first is very complex, but the second is more ordinary, and thus easier to handle. The empirical examples are based on simulations, which clearly show the biases of the various methods and their specifications. In general, it seems that method (iv) is recommendable although the results from it are not perfect either. ...|$|R

5000|$|In statistics, {{imputation}} is {{the process}} of replacing missing data with substituted values. When substituting for a data point, it is known as [...] "unit imputation"; when substituting for a component of a data point, it is known as [...] "item imputation". There are three main problems that missing data causes: missing data can introduce a substantial amount of bias, make the handling and analysis of the data more arduous, and create reductions in efficiency. Because missing data can create problems for analyzing data, imputation is seen as a way to avoid pitfalls involved with listwise deletion of cases that have missing values. That is to say, when one or more values are missing for a case, most statistical packages default to discarding any case that has a missing value, which may introduce bias or affect the representativeness of the results. Imputation preserves all cases by replacing missing data with an estimated value based on other available information. Once all missing values have been imputed, the data set can then be analysed using standard techniques for complete data. Imputation theory is constantly developing and thus requires consistent attention to new information regarding the subject. There have been many theories embraced by scientists to account for missing data but the majority of them introduce large amounts of bias. A few of the well known attempts to deal with missing data include: <b>hot</b> <b>deck</b> and cold deck imputation; listwise and pairwise deletion; mean imputation; regression imputation; last observation carried forward; stochastic imputation; and multiple imputation.|$|E
40|$|Background: Missing data {{resulting}} from premature study withdrawal {{are a common}} problem {{in the analysis of}} longitudinal data in clinical trials. To date, this subject has received little attention in the context of economic evaluations and with regard to the analysis of cost data. Objectives: To (i) demonstrate the impact of patients who drop out during the study on the outcomes of an economic evaluation, and (ii) to compare the mean and variation in costs after applying five different methods to deal with incomplete data: multiple imputation, complete cases analysis, linear extrapolation, predicted mean and <b>hot</b> <b>decking.</b> Study design: The study was performed using cost data collected in two randomised clinical trials comparing patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease receiving either tiotropium bromide or ipratropium bromide. The overall dropout rate was 17 %, with the daily costs of the dropouts approximately 4 times higher than the costs of the completers. Methods: Multiple imputation is a principled method that deals with missing observations by replacing each missing observation with a set of multiple plausible values. The variance between the resulting multiple datasets is combined with the variance between the datasets to take account of the extra uncertainty that results from missing data. The outcomes after multiple imputation were compared with the results of four naive methods to deal with missing observations: complete cases analysis, linear extrapolation, predicted mean and <b>hot</b> <b>decking.</b> All costs were expressed in 2001 euros. Results: In the tiotropium bromide group, mean (standard error) costs varied from Conclusion: This study showed that the method of dealing with the data of the dropouts had a large impact on the outcomes of an economic evaluation. Information about the rate of patient withdrawal and the way data of dropouts are treated is of vital importance in assessing the results of economic evaluations and should always be reported. Multiple imputation is a principled method {{that can be used to}} deal with the data of these patients.

40|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>deck</b> {{imputation}} is {{a method}} for handling missing data in which each missing value is replaced with an observed response from a "similar" unit.

30|$|The {{essence of}} <b>hot</b> <b>deck</b> {{imputation}} is that missing {{data in a}} recipient file (TALIS) are filled in with actual values from a donor data file (PISA) based on a pre‐specified algorithm. This approach requires that the donor data set {{be at least as}} large or larger than the recipient data set. Once a PISA donor is found for a TALIS recipient, the missing data for the TALIS recipient is given the value of the PISA donor. The resulting synthetic data set has a sample size equivalent to that of the original TALIS sample. A number of algorithms exist for <b>hot</b> <b>deck</b> matching, however for this paper we will focus our attention only on nearest neighbor <b>hot</b> <b>deck</b> matching.

We have employed the multiple imputation methodology of Rubin (1978) to estimate this variance. Our focus is on the impact on statistical inference of the present CPS variance estimation procedures which ignore the item nonresponse problem and, hence, lead to confidence intervals which are too short. (Scheuren, 1975) There are seven main sections to the paper. In section 1 we set the stage by providing a brief historical background of changes in CPS <b>hot</b> <b>deck</b> methodology since 1962, when the <b>hot</b> <b>deck</b> was first introduced into the income supplement pro-cessing. Some theoretical considerations in the estimation of the <b>hot</b> <b>deck</b> variance are taken up in section 2. Section 3 describes the results of the multiple imputation application we attempted with the March 1978 CPS. Areas for further study are suggested in section 4 which forms a bridge to our companion paper (Oh and Scheuren, 1980 b) on the impact of the CPS <b>hot</b> <b>deck</b> on reducing income nonresponse biases. The remaining three sections contain appendix material: acknowledgements, and seleoted <b>hot</b> <b>deck</b> references (section %), some de-tails on the derivation of the multiple imputation variance formulas used (section 6), and the basic tables (section 7).

40|$|Methods {{for dealing}} with missing data {{in the context of}} large surveys or data mining {{projects}} are limited by the computational complexity that they may exhibit. <b>Hot</b> <b>deck</b> imputation methods are computationally simple, yet effective for creating complete data sets from which correct inferences may be drawn. All <b>hot</b> <b>deck</b> methods draw values for the imputation of missing values from the data matrix that will later be analyzed.
