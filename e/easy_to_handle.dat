5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle,</b> and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these {{can be stored in}} a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division by the use of 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle,</b> transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord is large, with stallions {{weighing}} {{upwards of}} , and is bred for traction ability and pulling power. The breed {{is found in}} many solid colors, although bay and roan are the most common, and {{is known to be}} gentle and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle.</b> Two slightly different types of Trait du Nord are found – a larger type used for heavier pulling and a lighter type used for faster work. The breed is considered to be endangered by the French government, with fewer than 100 new foal births a year. The national breed registry in France is working with local groups in an attempt to promote this breed and bring population numbers back up. The breed currently has a high risk of inbreeding, due to the low number of breeding stallions, and is at risk of extinction.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the breed}} {{are not usually}} ridden until they are four years old, and {{structural}} development is not complete until age seven. Their most productive years are between eight and eighteen, although they retain their strength and stamina into their twenties. An Icelandic mare that lived in Denmark reached a record age of 56, while another horse, living in Great Britain, {{reached the age of}} 42. The horses are highly fertile, and both sexes are fit for breeding up to age 25; mares have been recorded giving birth at age 27. The horses tend to not be easily spooked, probably the result of not having any natural predators in their native Iceland. Icelandics tend to be friendly, docile and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle,</b> although also enthusiastic and self-assured. As a result of their isolation from other horses, disease in the breed within Iceland is mostly unknown, except for some kinds of internal parasites. The low prevalence of disease in Iceland is maintained by laws preventing horses exported from the country being returned, and by requiring that all equine equipment taken into the country be either new and unused or fully disinfected. As a result, native horses have no acquired immunity to disease; an outbreak on the island would be likely to be devastating to the breed. This presents problems with showing native Icelandic horses against others of the breed from outside the country, as no livestock of any species can be imported into Iceland, and once horses leave the country they are not allowed to return.|$|E

25|$|Atlantic salmon is, by far, {{the species}} most often chosen for farming. It is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle,</b> it grows well in sea cages, {{commands}} a high market value and it adapts well to being farmed {{away from its}} native habitats.|$|E
25|$|Groups of 2-rank 1. The Sylow 2-subgroups {{are either}} cyclic, which is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> using the {{transfer}} map, or generalized quaternion, which are handled with the Brauer–Suzuki theorem: in particular {{there are no}} simple groups of 2-rank 1.|$|E

25|$|The {{wide track}} and a {{steerable}} nosewheel made the aircraft <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> on the ground, {{and the short}} landing gear avoided the need for access ladders and service stands.

25|$|The {{several reasons}} for the {{popularity}} of gerbils as household pets include: The animals are typically not aggressive, and they rarely bite unprovoked or without stress. They are small and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle,</b> since they are sociable creatures that enjoy the company of humans and other gerbils. Gerbils also have adapted their kidneys to produce a minimum of waste to conserve body fluids, which makes them very clean with little odor.|$|E
25|$|This {{terrestrial}} {{species is}} known for its defense strategy that involves coiling into a tight ball when threatened, with its head and neck tucked away in the middle. In this state, it can literally be rolled around. Favored retreats include mammal burrows and other underground hiding places, where they also aestivate. In captivity, they are considered good pets, with their relatively small size and placid nature making them <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The whip {{usually has}} a stock of 6 feet (1.8 m), with a lash of 56 feet (1.51.8 m) (although some are longer). The whip is light, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle,</b> and well balanced. It is not {{safe to use}} a riding or driving whip for longeing because they are too short to reach the horse without {{bringing}} the handler {{close enough to the}} horse's hindquarters to risk being kicked by the horse. The longe whip is used as an encouragement to the horse but never as a punishment.|$|E

25|$|The EZ Flyer was {{the first}} {{aircraft}} design of Wayne Winters of Indus, Alberta. In 1991 Winters set out to design a high performance kit plane {{that he intended to}} produce commercially. While considering the design parameters of that proposed aircraft he saw a picture of a Breezy homebuilt and decided instead to design a smaller and lighter aircraft inspired by the Breezy instead. Winter's own past experience flying Ultraflight Lazairs provided the motivation for the design of a slow, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> aircraft with an open cockpit.|$|E
25|$|One {{model of}} horse {{domestication}} starts with individual foals being kept as pets while the adult horses were slaughtered for meat. Foals {{are relatively small}} and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle.</b> Horses behave as herd animals and need companionship to thrive. Both historic and modern data shows that foals can and will bond to humans and other domestic animals to meet their social needs. Thus domestication may have started with young horses being repeatedly made into pets over time, preceding the great discovery that these pets could be ridden or otherwise put to work.|$|E
25|$|During takeoff, {{both the}} ailerons and flaps are lowered, {{which is a}} {{relatively}} uncommon design approach but results in substantially elevated STOL performance. The flaps can be deployed to an extreme range, extending out at full to a 58 degree position; the flight manual notes that the full setting is recommended only for performing emergency landings. In the skies, the Beaver is relatively <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle,</b> having been described as possessing light and comfortable controls; however, effective application of the rudder is necessitated in order to counteract adverse yaw. It should be flown with a relatively nose-low pitch attitude to maintain airspeed. Reportedly, the aircraft {{is very easy to}} land, even upon less calm water condition.|$|E
