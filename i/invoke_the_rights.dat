50|$|The {{division}} in France {{was at an}} all-time high when even families had different views on juring and non-juring priest. The difference in families was primarily seen when the women would attend masses that where held by those who had defied the oath and men attended mass that was provided by clergymembers who had taken the oath. It {{is important to note that}} even though priests who had not taken the Oath had the right to use the churches many were not allowed to use the buildings (this was done by priest who had sworn their allegiance) this furthermore demonstrated the {{division in}} the state. On 29 November 1791, the Legislative Assembly, which had replaced the National Constituent Assembly, decreed that refractory priests could only exacerbate factionalism and aggravate extremists in the constituent assembly. The November 29th decree declared that no refractory priest could <b>invoke</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> in the Constitution of the Clergy and that all such priests were suspect and so to be arrested. Louis XVI vetoed this decree (as he also did with another text concerning the creation of an army of 20,000 men on the orders of the Assembly, precipitating the monarchy's fall), which was toughened and re-issued a year later. Anti-Catholic persecution by the State would intensify into de-Christianization and propagation of the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme Being in 1793-1794. During this time countless non-juring priests were interned in chains on prison ships in French harbors where most died within a few months from the appalling conditions.|$|E
40|$|Privacy {{and data}} {{protection}} rules are usually said {{to protect the}} individual against intrusive governments and nosy companies. These rights guarantee the individual's freedom, personal autonomy and human dignity, among others. More and more, however, legal persons are also allowed to <b>invoke</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> to privacy and data protection. Prima facie, it seems difficult to reconcile this trend with the standard interpretation of those rights, as legal persons do not enjoy freedom, personal autonomy or human dignity and it seems uncertain why business interests should be protected under privacy and data protection rules. On second thoughts, however, it appears rather unproblematic to grant legal persons partial protection under these regimes, especially when it recognizes general duties of care for data processors and governmental agencies...|$|E

This was first recognized by several Supreme Court Justices in Griswold v. Connecticut, a 1965 decision protecting a married couple's rights to contraception. It was recognized again in 1973 Roe v.

2500|$|The Fifth Amendment [...] (Amendment V) to the United States Constitution {{is part of}} <b>the</b> Bill of <b>Rights</b> {{and protects}} {{individuals}} from being compelled to be witnesses against themselves in criminal cases.
