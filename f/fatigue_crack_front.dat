40|$|The {{presented}} master’s thesis {{deals with}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> shape estimation. The {{aim of this}} thesis {{is to create an}} iterative process leading to the real <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> shape. Thesis is solved using finite element method. The work is divided into two logical parts. The first part of the thesis describes the basic concepts of linear elastic fracture mechanic (LEFM), methods used for estimation of stress intensity factor and stress singularity exponent. The first part further describes some phenomenon’s accompanying the mechanism of fatigue crack growth as for example crack tip curving and crack closure. In {{the second part of the}} thesis there is studied an affect of the free surface on the fracture parameters, especially the affected distance from the free surface is determined. Based on the assumption of a constant stress intensity factor and stress singularity exponent along the crack front, an iterative process leading to <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> shape is presented. The accuracy of the result is discussed by comparing of obtained crack front shapes with experimental data at the end of the thesis...|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional elastic or elasto-plastic models {{dominate}} the current fatigue crack growth assessment and life prediction procedures for plate components with through-the-thickness cracks. However, {{as demonstrated in}} many theoretical and experimental papers, the stress field near the crack tip is always three-dimensional and, as a result, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> is not straight. It is normally curved towards the plate faces. Over {{the past few years}} {{there were a number of}} very careful numerical studies focusing on the evaluation of <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> shapes. However, the application of the direct numerical techniques to fatigue phenomena is a very tedious and time consuming process and, sometimes, it is quite ambiguous. In the current paper we develop a simplified method for the evaluation of the front shapes of through-the-thickness fatigue cracks. Further, we validate the developed method against experimental results, investigate the influence of various parameters on the crack front shapes at stable (steady-state) propagation and analyse the differences in the results of fatigue crack growth evaluation obtained with two- and three-dimensional approaches.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{residual}} stresses, induced by cold water quenching, on the morphology of <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> <b>fronts</b> {{has been investigated}} in a powder metallurgy 8090 aluminium alloy, with and without reinforcement {{in the form of}} 20 wt-%SiC particles. Residual stress measurements reveal that the surface compressive stresses developed in these materials are significantly greater than in conventional metallurgy ingot 8090, because surface yielding occurs on quenching. The yield stresses of the powder route materials are greater than those of ingot produced 8090 and hence greater surface stresses can be maintained. In <b>fatigue,</b> severe <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> bowing is observed in the powder formed materials {{as a result of the}} reduction of the R ratio (minimum load/maximum load) by the compressive residual stresses at the sides of the specimen, causing premature crack closure and hence reducing the local driving force for <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth ΔKeff.

Fractographic examination revealed that the under carriage strut had failed under impact load, the crack being initiated from a notch {{in the form of a}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> <b>front.</b> Analysis suggests that the fatigue crack initiation was due to heavy landing over a period of time. Since a notch was already present, the load during the last landing was responsible for the final fracture. Considering the fact that the fatigue crack depth was only about 1. 0 mm, it can be stated that the last landing was quite severe.

40|$|Abstract. The {{thin walled}} {{structures}} as pipe-line are often unsuitable for standard testing of fracture toughness. One possibility is applying non-standard modified specimens with simple testing procedure, but measured fracture behaviour is consequence of loading conditions and geometry of specimen. In this paper {{the differences in}} fracture behaviour of single edge notch bending (SENB) and ring pipe-line bended specimens are discussed. Especially uneven <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> as consequence of complex fatigue loading caused different fracture behaviour, than standard single edge notch bending (SENB) specimens. The stress-strain conditions at the crack tip are analysed by finite element modelling. The critical crack tip opening displacement has been determined as a crack tip surface strain-relaxation by using stereo-optical grading method.

Evidences suggest that there was relative movement (slip) between the nut and the bolt which resulted in thinning of the threads on the bolt by wear process. Because of reduction in cross section, the load carrying capacity of the threads reduced drastically leading to initiation of a number of <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracks</b> on the threads.

40|$|This work {{raises some}} new {{questions}} {{about the validity of}} blindly assuming that Elber’s effective stress intensity factor is the actual <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> driving force, and that as so {{it can be used to}} explain all load sequence effects on <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth (FCG). Although plasticity-induced crack closure can be a quite reasonable heuristic explanation for many non-elementary FCG behaviors, it has some limitations that cannot be ignored. In fact, this never settled discussion is particularly important for the simulation of FCG lives under real service loads, a most important practical issue. After arguing that Keff can spoil the use of the most important similitude principle in FCG problems, simple but convincing experimental data that cannot be explained by this classical idea is presented here. This data involves the shape of <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> <b>fronts</b> and the FCG behavior under nominally plane stress and plane strain conditions...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical, {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} studies involving elastic plate components, weakened by through-the-thickness cracks {{and subjected to}} loading parallel to {{the plane of the}} plate, are often based on plane stress or plane strain simplifications. These simplifications essentially reduce the dimensionality of the physical three-dimensional problem and enable the achievement of effective analytical and numerical solutions for many important practical problems. The influence of various three-dimensional effects, such as the variation of stresses across the plate thickness, effects of the three-dimensional corner (vertex) singularities and coupling of fracture modes II and III, on the deformation and stresses near the crack front are at present largely ignored or viewed as negligible for all practical purposes. As a result of this view, the outcomes of experimental studies and fracture tests are also commonly analysed {{within the framework of the}} plane theories of elasticity. Nevertheless, a number of theoretical and experimental studies over the past two decades have demonstrated that the predictions made within these theories can be unsatisfactory and the effect of three-dimensional stress states at the crack front on deformation, fatigue and fracture of plate components can be significant. This thesis aims to elucidate the role of three-dimensional stress states in the deformation, fracture and fatigue phenomena further. The main outcomes of this thesis are: (1) the development and validation of a simplified method for the evaluation of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> shapes and their effect on the steady-state fatigue crack growth rates in plate components; (2) investigation of the effect of three-dimensional corner (vertex) singularities on the stress intensities and displacement field near the crack front; and (3) development and validation of a new experimental approach for the evaluation of mode I and mode II stress intensity factors from the measurement of the out-of-plane displacements in the near crack tip region, which are affected by three-dimensional effects, and, in particular, by the 3 D corner (vertex) singularity. This new research is important in many engineering contexts. For example, the new theoretical model, which takes into account the actual shape of the crack front, can be utilised in advanced fatigue life calculations, as well as in failure investigations. The latter is possible as the shape of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> can now be related to the parameters of fatigue loading. The new experimental approach developed in this thesis can be useful in fracture characterisation of thick plate components with through-cracks. This approach specifically addresses the situation when the Kdominance zone, or William’s solution convergence domain, are relatively small. In this case, the data extraction region can be affected by the three-dimensional stress states leading to significant errors in the evaluation of the stress intensity factors when using traditional approaches. This thesis is presented in the form of a compendium of published papers that are the summation of the research undertaken by the author. The five articles which form the main body of the thesis are united by a common theme, which is the investigation of three-dimensional effects near the crack front on stresses and displacements, fracture and fatigue phenomena.

40|$|This thesis {{was written}} under the {{supervision}} of Assoc. Prof. Luboš Náhlík, Ph. D. and Assoc. Prof. Pavel Hutař, Ph. D. The topic of this thesis is the study of a free surface effect and gradient change of material properties on a crack behavior. The common theme of the work is a fracture mechanics description of a crack behavior near a material nonhomogeneity. Here, the material nonhomogeneity can be understood either as a boundary of a body (interface between body and surrounding) or as a continuous change of material properties. The thesis is introduced by a review part where the state-of-the-art of the concerned topic is described. This part presents several stress state descriptions in the vicinity of some general singular stress concentrators, particularly a crack and a V-notch. The influence of the free surface on a <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> shape is discussed here. The review part follows with the fracture mechanics description of the graded materials. The problem formulation and the main aims of the thesis are stated in the following chapter. The core of this work is the fracture mechanical description of a crack propagating near the material nonhomogeneity. The thesis focuses on a stress field description near the free surface of the body where a change in a type of the singular stress field occurs. Methods used in generalized fracture mechanics are applied here to describe the stress field near the free surface. The difference between crack behavior in thin-walled and thick-walled structures is shown and supplied by relevant examples. Methods and procedures used are later utilized for estimation of a crack behavior in graded structures. The thesis is concluded by the discussion of obtained results in appropriate context...|$|E

The stable <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth rate (FCGR) was accelerated as specimen thickness increased. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> was extended {{in terms of the}} curve crack shape. The <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> at the surface was retarded compared to that at the interior along thickness direction, and the <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> at the mid-thickness plane reached the maximum value of the crack length. The similar curve crack shape was obtained in the stable crack growth stage.

It is shown that both local stress intensity factor range and energy release rate distributions do not correspond to the experimentally observed crack growth rate along the front. In addition, common criteria for mixed-mode propagation fail to predict the slanted crack growth direction. Focusing on the stress state, tensile mode could be characterized by very high normal stresses whereas shear stresses in the crack plane are negligible. In the shear mode, high shear stresses in the crack plane act together with some normal stress. Moreover, there is a larger plastic zone around the whole shear lip and, therefore, large plastic strain energy density dissipated ahead of the slant <b>crack</b> <b>front.</b> Plasticity induced closure is very intensive in the relatively thin surface layer. ...|$|R

A novel technique which facilitates striation counting and striation spacing measurements, is developed and used for extracting and analyzing the relevant statistical data for characterizing the stochastic <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> propagation in polycrystalline metals.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{calculate}} how the surface <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> and the dimensionless compliance evolve in cracked cylindrical bars subjected to cyclic tension or bending with different initial crack geometries (crack depths and aspect ratios). To this end, a computer application (in the Java programming language) that calculates the <b>crack</b> <b>front’s</b> geometric evolution and the dimensionless compliance was made by discretizing the <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> (characterized with elliptical shape) and assuming that every point advances perpendicularly to the <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> according to the Paris law, and using a three-parameter stress intensity factor (SIF). The results show that in <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> propagation, relative crack depth influences more on dimensionless compliance than the aspect ratio, because the <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> tends to converge when the crack propagates from different initial geometries, showing greater values for tension than for bending. Furthermore, during <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth, materials with higher values of the exponent of the Paris law produce slightly greater dimensionless compliance and a better convergence between the results for straight-fronted and circular initial cracks...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the present}} paper, some {{interesting}} questions concerning 3 D <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> propagation are discussed. The main {{focus is on}} experimental investigations of 3 D <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> propagation under Mode I loading conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Experimental and {{analytical}} studies are conducted {{to characterize the}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth behavior of precracked aluminum plates repaired with asymmetric bonded composite patch. For single-sided repairs, due to the asymmetry {{and the presence of}} out-of-plane bending, <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> shape would become skewed curvilinear starting from a uniform through crack profile, as observed from previous studies. As the stress intensity factor (SIF) calculated at the crack tip is much influenced by <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> shape, it is necessary to predict and consider the actual <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> shape evolution for the accurate analysis of fatigue behavior. Nevertheless, in most previous studies, <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> has been modeled as a uniform straight one, which may cause inaccuracy. In this study, the actual <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> evolution is predicted and considered in estimating the fatigue life by implementing the successive analysis technique based on the three-dimensional finite element scheme. Experimental tests with various plate thicknesses (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mm) are also carried out to verify the present approach. The analytical predictions of both the <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> shape evolution and the fatigue life are in good agreement with the experimental observations. By both experimental {{and analytical}} approaches, the characteristics of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth behavior and the effectiveness of single-sided repairs according to the plate thickness are investigated.

The two propagation criteria are compared in terms of shape of the propagated crack and in terms of SIFs along the <b>crack</b> <b>front.</b> The efficiency of the Dual Boundary Element Method in this study is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fatigue</b> surface <b>crack</b> {{growth is}} studied through {{experiments}} and computations for aluminum alloys D 16 T and B 95 AT (analogue of 2024 and 7075 aluminum). Subjects for studies are cylindrical hollow specimens with external semi-elliptical surface crack. The variation of <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth rate and surface crack paths behavior was studied under cyclic loading for different environmental conditions. Uniaxial tension tests {{were carried out}} at low (- 60 °C), room (+ 23 °C) and high (+ 250 °C) temperature. For the same specimen configuration and the different <b>crack</b> <b>front</b> position {{as a function of}} cyclic loading and temperatures conditions the distributions of governing parameter of the elastic-plastic stress fields in the form of In-factor along various <b>crack</b> <b>fronts</b> was determined from numerical calculations. This governing parameter was used as the foundation of the elastic-plastic stress intensity factor (SIF). Both elastic and plastic SIF approach was applied to the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> growth rate interpretation. It is found that there is a steady relationship between the crack growth rate and the plastic SIF in the form of general curve within a relatively narrow scatter band for all tested specimens at different temperatures...|$|R
