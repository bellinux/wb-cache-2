25|$|Anyway, I keep picturing {{all these}} little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I'm {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E
500|$|Kidd {{believed}} that dance needed {{to derive from}} life, saying that his [...] "dancing is based on naturalistic movement that is abstracted and enlarged", and that [...] "all my movements relate {{to some kind of}} real activity". He always wanted dance to serve the story, and when beginning a new work he would write a scenario, explaining how the plot drove the characters to dance. His biggest influences were Charlie Chaplin, [...] "because he expressed through movement the aspirations of the little man", and the dancer and choreographer Léonide Massine, [...] "because he expressed more than just balletic ability—he was always a character on stage, an exaggerated character, which <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> the time: an exaggeration of ordinary movement".|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E

2500|$|Owing to {{the success}} of [...] "The Sign of the Rose," [...] Beban was cast for most of the next decade in Italian {{character}} roles. [...] In 1917, Beban revealed to a reporter the irony that he could not speak a word of Italian. [...] Beban explained:"I understand the tongue when it is spoken – I couldn't be associated with it for so many years and not recognize and translate it – but I have never attempted to talk it myself. ... To portray the type of Italian that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> one needs is knowledge of the actions, mannerisms, etc., of the character. [...] Not knowing the language, from the viewpoint that the Italian speaks it, I am thus able to make my characterization more understandable to the American audience. [...] In other words, I Americanize him for the United States consumption – stage purposes." ...|$|E
