5|$|As part {{of their}} {{corporate}} philosophy, Linn intended significant dealer involvement in customer education and decision-making, and included teaching customers <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> correctly for musical attributes. The trial and evaluation of the product prior to purchase and dealer's expert installation are considered by Linn to be important parts of the value added of their top-end products. As such, no instructions were supplied with the product. The Isobaric PMS retailed at £2,400 including stands in May 1991, and the 4-ohm crossover was priced at just under £500.|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for The Wire, Peter Shapiro {{said he was}} impressed by how Ocean of Sound highlighted musical similarities among its disparate artists, calling it {{a manifestation of the}} book's discussion and [...] "a remarkable collection of great music". The Independent wrote that [...] "Toop navigates smoothly between the various strands that have contributed to the current techno/'' style of ambient-pop", because he used sources such as Oriental music, minimalism, and classical composers. Michaelangelo Matos from the Chicago Reader viewed it as an idyllic compilation whose songs segued fluently because of Toop's aesthetic, while noting they could also stand alone as interesting, if not excellent, separate pieces: [...] "Ocean of Sound is one of those records that have something to teach even the most jaded music fan about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to music." [...] In a four-and-a-half out of five-star review, AllMusic's John Bush recommended the album to any [...] "wide-ranging ambient fan" [...] and said that it illustrates the ideas in Toop's book [...] "beautifully".|$|E

3000|$|Definitely yes. I think English <b>listening</b> needs <b>to</b> be tested, but I {{feel that}} we {{teachers}} don’t really know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> teach <b>listening.</b> Because it wasn’t tested before, teachers didn’t teach it, and as time went by, we didn’t find out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> teach <b>listening.</b> For me, it’s {{hard to say what}} counts as an effective English listening course. The traditional way is to give students tests, but this isn’t teaching. I think we teachers need <b>to</b> learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> teach <b>listening.</b> You can’t just play the recordings and ask students to comprehend everything themselves.

He said [...] "throughout my career, I've never been a huge star, but I've made steady progress and that's the way I like it," [...] and [...] "It's fun coming in as {{the second or third}} lead. If the movie or TV show bombs, you aren't to blame." [...] Hartman was considered a [...] "utility player" [...] on SNL with a [...] "kind of Everyman quality" [...] which enabled him to appear in the majority of sketches, often in very distinct roles. Jan Hooks stated of his work on SNL: [...] "Phil never had an ounce of competition. He was a team player. It was a privilege for him, I believe, to play support and do it very well. He was never insulted, no matter how small the role may have been." [...] He was disciplined in his performances, studying the scripts beforehand. Hooks added: [...] "Phil knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen.</b> And he knew how to look you in the eye, and he knew the power of being able to lay back and let somebody else be funny, and then do the reactions. I think Phil was more of an actor than a comedian."

2500|$|Narratives can {{be shared}} to express the values or morals among family, relatives, or people who are {{considered}} part of the close-knit community. Many stories in indigenous American communities all have a [...] "surface" [...] story, that entails knowing certain information and clues to unlocking the metaphors in the story. The underlying message of the story being told, can be understood and interpreted with clues that hint to a certain interpretation. In order to make meaning from these stories, elders in the [...] community for example, emphasize the importance in learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen,</b> since it requires the senses to bring one's heart and mind together. For instance, a way in which children learn about the metaphors significant for the society they live in, is by listening to their elders and participating in rituals where they respect one another.|$|E

According to Klein, Haq then moved to another section of the building and Klein, bleeding profusely, crawled to her desk and dialed 911, despite Haq's threats to kill anyone who called the police. Haq eventually returned to Klein's office and discovered her on the phone, at which point he reportedly shouted [...] "Now since you don't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> ... <b>listen,</b> now you're the hostage, and I don't give a [...] if I kill you or your baby." [...] Klein told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that Haq [...] "...stated that he was a Muslim, [...] this was his personal statement against Jews and the Bush administration for giving money to Jews, and for us Jews for giving money to Israel, about Hezbollah, the war in Iraq, and he wanted to talk to CNN." [...] Klein then offered Haq the phone and suggested that he tell the dispatcher what he had just told her.|$|E

40|$|In {{this text}} {{we wanted to}} {{research}} which kind of music youths <b>listen</b> <b>to,</b> why they <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> music and <b>how</b> they <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> music.

We chose to interview 14 students attending middle- and highschool, both girls and boys, <b>to</b> find out <b>how</b> youths <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> music and <b>how</b> they perceive that music effects them. We concluded in our interview study that youths <b>listen</b> extensively <b>to</b> music. We could clearly see that our informants use music in different ways. Many informants use music to enhance their feelings and many use music to increase their ability to concentrate. It is also evident that the informants use different kinds of music for different situations and contexts, for example when they are sad they want <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> happy music or when they are doing sports they want <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> music with a high tempo to endure and to want more.

His hostess was quietly kind, and evidently a lady who had appreciated and was pleased to talk about what she had seen in England, which was, as it happened, a good deal. Brooke also knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen,</b> and now and then a curious little smile crept into his eyes as she dilated on scenes and functions which were very familiar to him. It was evident that she never for a moment supposed that the man who sat listening to her somewhat stiffly, from reasons connected with Jimmy's repairs to his clothes, could have taken a part in them, but he was once or twice almost embarrassed when Barbara, who seemed to take his comprehension for granted, broke in.|$|E
