5|$|The <b>introduction</b> of {{the euro}} has led to {{extensive}} discussion about its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in the population {{of the euro}}zone that the <b>introduction</b> of the euro had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies. A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the <b>introduction</b> of the euro on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after the <b>introduction</b> of the euro. The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased. It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the <b>introduction,</b> retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the <b>introduction</b> of the euro to do so.|$|E

This report therefore aims to answer the question: 'Does the way product <b>introductions</b> are handled by SMEs differ from the way product <b>introductions</b> are described in literature?' �We find that there are indeed differences, though these are mainly differences in level of detail and focus. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Introductions</b> of {{non-indigenous}} {{species to}} new ecosystems {{are one of}} the major threats to biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services. Globally, species <b>introductions</b> may lead to biotic homogenisation, in synergy with other anthropogenic disturbances such as climate change and coastal pollution. Successful marine <b>introductions</b> depend on (1) presence of a transport vector, uptake of propagules and journey survival of the species; (2) suitable environmental conditions in the receiving habitat; and (3) biological traits of the invader to facilitate establishment. Knowledge has improved of the distribution, biology and ecology of high profile seaweed invaders, e. g. Caulerpa taxifolia, Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides, Sargassum muticum, and Undaria pinnatifida. Limited, regional information is available for less conspicuous species. The mechanisms of seaweed <b>introductions</b> are little understood as research on introduced seaweeds has been mostly reactive, following discoveries of <b>introductions.</b> Sources of <b>introductions</b> mostly cannot be determined with certainty apart from those directly associated with aquaculture activities and few studies have addressed the sometimes serious ecological and economic impacts of seaweed <b>introductions.</b> Future research needs to elucidate the invasion process, interactions between invaders, and impacts of <b>introductions</b> to support prevention and management of seaweed <b>introductions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although high {{mountain}} lakes are naturally fishless, {{there have been}} numerous trout <b>introductions</b> to such ecosystems {{in many areas of the}} world with negative ecological consequences. In recent decades other fishes, such as minnows, have been introduced to some mountain areas, including the Pyrenees. These <b>introductions</b> may cause further ecological problems, since minnows also occupy the top of the food chain, and are difficult to manage since such <b>introductions</b> occur without permission from the authorities. In this study we have analyzed the process of minnow <b>introductions</b> in all {{high mountain}} lakes of the southern slope of the Pyrenees to find out which particular factors best explained their present distribution and to evaluate which management measures have been most effective for stopping <b>introductions.</b> We found 27 % of the lakes had minnows (Phoxinus sp.) present, 52 % had trout and 47 % were fishless. Trout presence was the most significant variable explaining 27 % of deviance of minnow presence data in a generalized additive model. Recreational fishing using minnows as live bait is likely responsible for these <b>introductions.</b> Minnow <b>introductions</b> are therefore mediated by a preceding invasive species and facilitated by human activity. We also compared the number of minnow <b>introductions</b> in non-fishing areas of National Parks with other areas where managed fishing takes place. We found that the number of lakes with minnow <b>introductions</b> was increasing in all areas except those where fishing was prohibited, indicating that prohibiting fishing is an effective management practice for stopping minnow <b>introductions.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

Moreover, we also find that the relationship between R&D expenditures and new product <b>introductions</b> is considerably smaller than previously reported. While measures of patenting remain important in predicting the arrival of product <b>introductions,</b> the most important predictor is the loss of exclusivity protection on a current product. Our evidence suggests that pharmaceutical firms are acting strategically with respect to new product <b>introductions.</b> Finally, we find no relationship between firm size and new product <b>introductions.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Genre-based {{studies of}} {{academic}} texts have mainly focused on research articles written by native English writers. The objectives {{of this study}} are to examine the rhetorical structure of Malaysian research article <b>introductions</b> and to investigate {{the ways in which the}} rhetorical structure of Malaysian research article <b>introductions</b> may differ from the internationally published research article <b>introductions.</b> This study explores the relation of texts generic structure and the context. A corpora of 30 research articles were selected. For the purpose of conducting a comparative study, 15 <b>introductions</b> from locally published journal ‘The English Teacher’ and 15 from internationally published ‘ELT’ Journal' were taken. This study developed a framework for the generic structure analysis based on Swales CARS and OARO model. It was found that the international research articles complied with the CARS model whereas the Malaysian research article <b>introductions</b> adhered to the OARO model. It must be mentioned that two of the Malaysian <b>introductions</b> opaquely complied with the CARS model. This may be due to the exposure that the authors may have had in writing <b>introductions</b> the conventional way. Overall, the findings tend to confirm Swales’s claim that the research in the nonnative speakers’ world tend to be less antagonistic and thus geared more towards establishing readership rather than establishing the research. One prominent feature o f both ELT related <b>introductions</b> is that they are prone to discussing theories, personal experience and personal thoughts. As a result, new terms were proposed, CARDS - Create a Research Discussion Space and OARDO - Open a Research Discussion Option.
