50|$|Most older {{fireplaces}} have {{a relatively}} low efficiency rating. Standard, modern, wood-burning masonry fireplaces though have an efficiency rating of at least 80% (legal minimum requirement for example in Salzburg/Austria). To improve efficiency, fireplaces can also be modified by inserting special heavy fireboxes designed to burn much cleaner and can reach efficiencies as high as 80% in heating the air. These modified fireplaces are often equipped with a large <b>fire</b> <b>window,</b> enabling an efficient heating process in two phases. During the first phase the initial heat is provided through a large glass window while the fire is burning. During this time the structure, built of refractory bricks, absorbs the heat. This heat is then evenly radiated for many hours during the second phase. Masonry fireplaces without a glass <b>fire</b> <b>window</b> only provide heat radiated from its surface. Depending on outside temperatures 1 to 2 daily firings are sufficient to ensure a constant room temperature.|$|E

50|$|The {{unglazed}} clay Furo {{coated with}} black lacquer was preferred for formal use. It {{was placed on}} a lacquered board to prevent heat damage. The iron type was set on a paving tile. On {{the edge of a}} Furo a <b>fire</b> <b>window</b> or cut-out opening provided the necessary draft to keep the Sumi burning properly. A bed of ashes Hai was laid inside the Furo and the Sumi placed on top was lighted. The Kama was then set directly on the bronze or iron brazier, but a trivet was used for a clay brazier. Kama for portable ranges is slightly smaller than those used for fixed hearths Ro (Sen, 1979, p. 22).|$|E

50|$|The Predator is {{a useful}} {{complement}} for Javelin since it has a significantly shorter minimum range, especially in direct attack mode {{where it can be}} <b>fired</b> <b>window</b> to window across a typical street. It is also much lighter than Javelin which makes carrying one or more additional rounds easier where the situation warrants or allows a lighter and shorter range solution. Additionally, because it utilizes a different guidance mechanism it is more difficult to defeat both threats with a single defense. It can also be carried by every member of the platoon, giving infantry units increased firepower and survivability against enemy armor.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn silicon solar cells, forming good {{ohmic contact}} between the emitter and the metal with minimum contact {{resistance}} is critical to achieve peak electrical performance [1]. In commercial solar cells, screen printable silver paste is commonly used to form contact. Factors related to paste chemistry, process conditions and the solar cell wafers influence the contact quality. In this paper, the effect of paste chemistry and emitter sheet resistance on contact quality is described. Several paste chemistries were tested for contact resistance with Transmission Line Model (TLM) measurements on wafers with sheet resistance between 45 - 100 Ω/□. The series resistance of the solar cells was recorded over 50 °C <b>firing</b> <b>window.</b> The paste chemistry was further refined to form low resistance contacts on solar cells with emitter sheet resistance on 100 Ω/□...|$|R
