50|$|On some vehicles, a {{temperature}} sensing switch will apply manifold vacuum to the vacuum advance system when {{the engine is}} hot or cold, and ported vacuum at normal operating temperature. This is a version of emissions control; the ported vacuum allowed carburetor adjustments for a leaner <b>idle</b> <b>mixture.</b> At high engine temperature, the increased advance raised engine speed to allow the cooling system to operate more efficiently. At low temperature the advance allowed the enriched warm-up mixture to burn more completely, providing better cold-engine running.|$|E
40|$|In {{the case}} of sub~components that are {{designed}} to prevent the tampering of adjustable, emission-related parameters beyond their specified ranges (e. g., a limiter cap that is pressfitted onto an <b>idle</b> <b>mixture</b> screw), the ARB does be 1 ieve that part numbers are necessary. Additionally, carburetor bodies that are cast with different stopper embossments but are otherwise identical should have different part numbers if the embossments alter the allowable range of calibration for such sub-components. If a manufacturer elects to use part numbers to assure the representativeness of its production engines, the manufacturer should report these part numbers in its application for certification. Such part numbers should be permanently attached to the part. A manufacturer should not use its inventory numbers for this purpose because these numbers ar...|$|E
50|$|Setting the <b>idle</b> speed, fuel/air <b>mixture,</b> {{carburetor}} balance, {{spark plug}} and distributor point gaps, and ignition timing were regular maintenance items for all older engines {{and the final}} but essential steps in setting up a racing engine. On modern engines, equipped with electronic ignition and fuel injection, {{some or all of}} these tasks are automated, although they still require periodic calibration.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} using {{pyrolysis}} oil (PO) derived from biomass via a fast pyrolysis route {{for power and}} heat generation encounters problems due to an incompatibility between properties (physical and chemical) of bio-oil and gas turbines designed for fossil fuels. An extensive research has been performed on the production and improvement of pyrolysis oil but only few investigations were carried out on its utilization. The latter have shown a major difference in behavior of pyrolysis oil compared to fossil fuels during combustion processes. In this work, pyrolysis oil is co-fired with diesel in a 50 kWe gas turbine operating in <b>idle</b> mode. Stable <b>mixtures</b> with up to 20 wt. % of pyrolysis oil and diesel fuel were produced with utilization of a surfactant agent. To prevent feeding line deterioration due to acidic character of pyrolysis oil, a stainless steel nozzle was employed. Furthermore, the fuel emulsion was preheated up to maximum temperature of 80 oC {{in order to reduce}} the effect of high viscosity on the atomization process. Diesel distillate # 2 was used as a reference fuel for a comparison of gas turbine performance and emissions with various PO content in the blends. During the combustion investigations, the amount of pyrolysis oil was gradually increased with simultaneous decrease of preheating temperature. In all investigated cases, the gas turbine was running stable at its maximum rotational speed (RPM). The CO level resulting from the study with different blends was generally slightly higher in relation to the diesel distillate fuel. NO emissions were in the range of few ppm and almost no detectable with common gas analyzing equipment. After a few hours of continuous operation, there were no signs of deterioration or contaminations inside the combustor. The study shows that pyrolysis oil gradually can be introduced in the market of fossil fuels and benefit to green power generation...|$|R
