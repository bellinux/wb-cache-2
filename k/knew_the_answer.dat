500|$|Host Regis Philbin {{described}} Carpenter {{as having}} [...] "cruised right through those first fourteen questions," [...] he had proceeded {{to reach the}} final question without using any of his lifelines. The $1 million question was, [...] "Which of these U.S. Presidents appeared on the television series 'Laugh-In'?", with the choices being A) Lyndon Johnson, B) Richard Nixon, C) Jimmy Carter, and D) Gerald Ford. Carpenter used his Phone-A-Friend lifeline to call his father not for help, but rather to inform him that he <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> Carpenter later explained, [...] "I thought I'd look so cocky if I didn't use any lifelines, so I faked it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Hanina (or {{some say}} Rabbi Josiah) taught that [...] when Moses found himself unable {{to decide the}} case of the daughters of Zelophehad, reports the {{punishment}} of Moses for his arrogance when he told the judges in [...] "the cause that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it." [...] Rav Nahman objected to Rabbi Hanina's interpretation, noting that Moses did not say that he would always have the answers, but merely that he would rule if he <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> or seek instruction if he did not. Rav Nahman cited a Baraita to explain {{the case of the}} daughters of Zelophehad: God had intended that Moses write the laws of inheritance, but found the daughters of Zelophehad worthy to have the section recorded on their account.|$|E
2500|$|The {{winning team}} {{advanced}} to the Semi-Finals, where they competed against {{each other for the}} right to play in the Finals. In this portion of the game, a second board with sixteen positions was used. Narz read a crossword-style clue, after which the letters of the answer were filled in one at a time as he said [...] "letter." [...] The contestants could buzz in at any time if they felt they <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> If a contestant buzzed in and gave an incorrect answer, the opponent was given a free guess. If he/she too came up with a wrong answer, play continued until either one of the contestants guessed the word, at which point all of its remaining letters were revealed, or only one letter was left in the word, at which point it would be revealed if neither of the contestants got it. The next word's clue was then given, and more letters were added; the start of each new word always overlapped the end of the previous one by at least one letter. If the row became too full to accommodate any more words, it was cleared before the next clue was read.|$|E

He would also try to guess whether <b>the</b> Player {{actually}} <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> or is bluffing. If the Seller feels that <b>the</b> Player <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer,</b> <b>the</b> Seller may have no option but to agree to the Player’s offer. But, if the Seller feels that the Player is bluffing, he would keep on increasing his bid. If the final amount agreed by the Player is not satisfactory to the Seller, he may give a misleading <b>answer</b> to <b>the</b> Player (remember the Seller would anyway get the agreed amount whether <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> is right or wrong). The Player then would have to decide whether to go with <b>the</b> sellers <b>answer</b> or not. If the Player goes with <b>the</b> Seller’s misleading <b>answer,</b> <b>the</b> player would have successfully sought revenge on the Seller for offering a very small amount.|$|R

50|$|Using a {{substantial}} number of trials, Pfungst found that the horse could get <b>the</b> correct <b>answer</b> even if von Osten himself did not ask the questions, ruling out the possibility of fraud. However, the horse got <b>the</b> right <b>answer</b> only when <b>the</b> questioner <b>knew</b> what <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> was, and <b>the</b> horse could see the questioner. He observed that when von Osten <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to <b>the</b> questions, Hans got 89 percent of <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> correct, but when von Osten did not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to <b>the</b> questions, Hans <b>answered</b> only six percent of the questions correctly.|$|R

6000|$|But {{there is}} this about such ghastly empty enigmas, that they always {{have an answer to}} the obvious answer, the reply offered by daily reason. Suppose a man's {{children}} have gone swimming; suppose he is suddenly throttled by the senseless--fear that they are drowned. The obvious answer is, [...] "Only one man in a thousand has his children drowned." [...] But a deeper voice (deeper, being as deep as hell) answers, [...] "And why should not you--be the thousandth man?" [...] What is true of tragic doubt is true also of trivial doubt. The voter's guardian devil said to him, [...] "If you don't vote to-day you can do fifteen things which will quite certainly do some good somewhere, please a friend, please a child, please a maddened publisher. And what good do you expect to do by voting? You don't think your man will get in by one vote, do you?" [...] To this he <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> of common sense, [...] "But if everybody said that, nobody would get in at all." [...] And then there came that deeper voice from Hades, [...] "But you are not settling what everybody shall do, but what one person on one occasion shall do. If this afternoon you went your way about more solid things, how would it matter and who would ever know?" [...] Yet somehow the voter drove on blindly through the blackening London roads, and found somewhere a tedious polling station and recorded his tiny vote.|$|E
60|$|When {{they arrived}} at the School gates, Monk and Danvers turned to go in the {{direction}} of their form-room, the Remove, leaving Farnie {{at the door of the}} Upper Fourth. At this point a small comedy took place. Monk, after feeling hastily in his pockets, requested Danvers to lend him five shillings until next Saturday. Danvers knew this request of old, and he <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> that was expected of him. By replying that he was sorry, but he had not got the money, he gave Farnie, who was still standing at the door, his cue to offer to supply the deficiency. Most new boys--they had grasped this fact from experience--would have felt it an honour to oblige a senior with a small loan. As Farnie made no signs of doing what was expected of him, Monk was obliged to resort to the somewhat cruder course of applying for the loan in person. He applied. Farnie with the utmost willingness brought to light a handful of money, mostly gold. Monk's eye gleamed approval, and he stretched forth an itching palm. Danvers began to think that it would be rash to let a chance like this slip. Ordinarily the tacit agreement between the pair was that only one should borrow at a time, lest confidence should be destroyed in the victim. But here was surely an exception, a special case. With a young gentleman so obviously a man of coin as Farnie, the rule might well be broken for once.|$|E
