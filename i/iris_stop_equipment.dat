40|$|In {{manufacturing}} systems, many maintenance tasks require {{equipment to}} be locked out for safety. However, such stoppage might directly cause short-term production losses although maintenance is performed to increase the long-term system reliability. In this paper, we investigate how long we can strategically <b>stop</b> <b>equipment</b> for maintenance during production operating without affecting system throughput. We extend the concept of maintenance opportunity windows (MOWs) to various system configurations and introduce a new concept of group maintenance opportunity windows (GMOWs). GMOW is the maximum time window that allows to perform a group maintenance without jeopardizing the flow of a production line. Moreover, we also provide how to calculate MOW and GMOW via simulations which can deal with uncertainties in production lines, such as random machine failures, starvations, blockages, etc. close...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the ship}} landed by his Thracian home, Phineus {{described}} his torment {{to the crew}} {{and told them that}} his brothers-in-law, the wing-footed Boreads, both Argonauts, were fated to deliver him from the Harpies. Zetes demurred, fearing the wrath of the gods should they deliver Phineus from divine punishment, but the old seer assured him that he and his brother Calais would face no retribution. A trap was set: Phineus sat down to a meal with the Boreads standing guard, {{and as soon as he}} touched his food the Harpies swept down, devoured the food and flew off. The Boreads gave chase, pursuing the Harpies as far as the [...] "Floating Islands" [...] before <b>Iris</b> <b>stopped</b> them lest they kill the Harpies against the will of the gods. She swore an oath by the Styx that the Harpies would no longer harass Phineus, and the Boreads then turned back to return to the Argonauts. It is for this reason, according to Apollonius, that the [...] "Floating Islands" [...] are now called the Strophades, the [...] "Turning Islands". Phineus then revealed to the Argonauts the path their journey would take and informed them how to pass the Symplegades safely, thus filling the same role for Jason that Circe did for Odysseus in the Odyssey.|$|R
50|$|Central {{controllers}} {{and most}} terminal unit controllers are programmable, meaning the {{direct digital control}} program code may be customized for the intended use.

The unit controllers typically have analog and digital inputs that allow measurement of the variable (temperature, humidity, or pressure) and analog and digital outputs {{for control of the}} transport medium (hot/cold water and/or steam). Digital inputs are typically (dry) contacts from a control device, and analog inputs are typically a voltage or current measurement from a variable (temperature, humidity, velocity, or pressure) sensing device.

40|$|The {{repetitive}} impacting {{of solid}} components in industry {{can result in}} wear damage which may significantly limit service life. Impact wear problems have been encountered in hydro-powered <b>stoping</b> <b>equipment</b> (eg rockdrills and impact rockbreakers) developed for deep level gold mining in South Africa. This research project was {{a study of the}} repetitive impact wear of reciprocating valve components (eg poppet valves within the impact rockbreaker) under simulated conditions. A laboratory apparatus, capable of producing impacts varying in energy from 2 - 5 J and varying in frequency from 5 - 50 Hz in an aqueous environment (distilled water), was designed and built for this purpose. Impact tests were conducted in order to: a) rank materials according to impact wear resistance, b) to determine modes and mechanisms of wear, c) to determine material, microstructural, design and operating parameters of importance in minimising wear, d) to make recommendations concerning the above, to facilitate productivity and longlife of poppet valves within impact rockbreakers. The materials selected for testing (817 M 40, 1210 and AISI 304, AISI 431 and AISI 440 C) are steels currently used by the gold mining industry in different applications and known to perform satisfactorily in service. These materials are not all ideally suited to application in valves. They were chosen in order to illustrate how different steel compositions, microstructures and heat treatments influence the rate and mode of wear...|$|R

50|$|By the 1980s, amateur use of 2-meter and 70-centimeter bands was at {{an all-time}} high while {{activity}} on 1.25 meters remained stagnant. In an attempt to increase use on the band, many amateurs called for holders of Novice-class licenses (the entry-level class at that time) to be given voice privileges on the band. In 1987, the FCC modified the Novice license to allow voice privileges on portions of the 1.25-meter and 23-centimeter (1.24-1.30 GHz) bands. In response, some of the bigger amateur radio equipment manufacturers started producing equipment for 1.25 meters. However, it never sold well, and by the early 1990s, most manufacturers had <b>stopped</b> producing <b>equipment</b> for the band.|$|R

Both of these events had a direct negative effect on the railroad industry, especially the locomotive builders.|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages 117 - 120. A {{high-speed}} reciprocating sliding {{wear test}} rig {{was used to}} examine the metal on metal surface interactions of materials under consideration for application in water powered <b>stoping</b> <b>equipment.</b> The suitability of this test rig was investigated by implementing a test programme covering self-mated stainless steel and stainless steel-on-bronze couples. These couples were examined under water lubricated conditions in a broad test matrix, covering sinusoidal peak velocities of 1, 5 and 10 m/s; loads of 5, 10 and 20 N and surface roughness values ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 4 μm, CLA. Due to poor reproducibility and inconclusive wear behaviours, no inferences could. be made as to the relative performance of the couples tested and no ranking tables could be compiled, In response to these findings, the emphasis changed to the design of a better test facility which could more accurately simulate the tribological interactions of interest. A new laboratory test rig, capable of investigating the performance of material surfaces, rubbing against one another under conditions of high speed reciprocating sliding in specific environments, was designed, built and commissioned. Subsequent tests conducted on this new facility showed average reproducibility for a 122 stainless steel rubbing against a CZ 114 manganese bronze to have improved by a factor of two to approximately ± 20 %. Initial results confirmed that adhesive wear is the dominant wear mode for the materials under consideration. This is manifested by homogeneous transfer layers and subsequent grooving of these layers...|$|R
