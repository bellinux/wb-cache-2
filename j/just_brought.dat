5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you <b>just</b> <b>brought</b> them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E
5|$|Quagmire {{returns home}} from a holiday in Florida and comes to the Griffins' house to tell Peter that he has smuggled some {{fireworks}} into Quahog by hiding them in his anus. Peter tells him that fireworks aren't illegal in Quahog, so he didn't need to hide them and could have <b>just</b> <b>brought</b> them in normally, but Quagmire doesn't see any fun in doing that. Later on, the Griffins and Quagmire start {{to play with the}} fireworks. Peter attaches ten M-80s together and shows Quagmire, but they explode, detaching all the fingers from his right hand. With Joe's help, Peter is able to find his fingers and later gets them reattached to his hand. The next day, Peter celebrates getting his fingers reattached by going to The Drunken Clam with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire, and they decide to continue their celebrations at Pawtucket Brewery after the bar closes. Peter is behind on his work at the brewery, as he is unable to type due to his hand injury, and Angela threatens him with the prospect of being fired if he fails to catch up, so he asks Lois to help him. When Lois agrees to help Peter catch up with his work, Peter attempts to seduce her numerous times. Later at the brewery, after a final attempt to seduce Lois in his office, she gives in and they have sex in front of their co-worker Opie, who runs away screaming. In the end, Peter is caught up with his work and enjoys having Lois help out and have sex with him.|$|E

25|$|Historically in Lutheranism {{there have}} been two parties {{regarding}} Eucharistic adoration: Gnesio-Lutherans, who followed Martin Luther's view in favor of adoration, and Philippists who followed Philipp Melanchthon's view against it. Although Luther did not entirely approve of the Feast of Corpus Christi, he wrote a treatise The Adoration of the Sacrament (1523) where he defended adoration but desired that the issue not be forced. In his reform of the Roman Mass Luther placed the Sanctus after the Institution Narrative to serve as a solemn act of worship of the Real Presence <b>just</b> <b>brought</b> about by the latter. After the death of Martin Luther, further controversies developed including Crypto-Calvinism and the second Sacramentarian controversy, started by Gnesio-Lutheran Joachim Westphal. The Philippist understanding of the Real Presence without overt adoration through time became dominant in Lutheranism, although it is not in accordance with Luther's teaching. The German theologian Andreas Musculus can be {{regarded as one of the}} warmest defenders of Eucharistic adoration in early Lutheranism.|$|E

Many of the other production staff were selected from people Whedon had worked with in the past, {{with the exception of the}} director of photography David Boyd, who was the [...] "big find" [...] and who was [...] "full of joy and energy".|$|E

500|$|Of the victory, Baffert said, [...] "this little horse deserves it. There's {{something}} about this horse that he <b>just</b> <b>brought</b> it every time. He's a joy to be around." [...] In a post-race interview, Zayat said that the colt's racing schedule {{for the remainder of}} the year would be decided by Baffert, and that the needs of the horse would come first. He also acknowledged the need for horse racing to have [...] "stars" [...] and for them to race as long as they could. Though American Pharoah's stud rights had been sold with plans to retire the horse at the end of 2015, Zayat expressed hope that the horse would continue racing as long as he was healthy and [...] "has it in him". His winning time of 2:26.65 was the sixth-fastest in Belmont history, the second-fastest for a Triple Crown winner, and his closing quarter-mile was run in 24.32 seconds, which was over a half-second faster than Secretariat's final quarter-mile time of 25.00 when the 1973 winner set a world record and won by 31 lengths.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2010, Singer re-teamed with screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie {{to rework}} the screenplay. Singer and McQuarrie had {{previously}} collaborated on Public Access, The Usual Suspects, Apt Pupil, and Valkyrie. Singer stated, [...] "Chris McQuarrie did a significant re-write for me. He brought a different structure. It {{was very much a}} page-one situation; a different storyline. It involved the same characters, but some we juggled around and switched around. He <b>just</b> <b>brought</b> a very different perspective". [...] McQuarrie's re-write included a deeper back story for the giants and explanation of their relationship with the humans, which Singer considered a [...] "vast improvement"; it also upped the budget. To get the budget back in line, Singer brought in television writer Dan Studney to work on the project.|$|E
2500|$|In a June 1960 {{letter to}} Allen Ginsberg, Kerouac {{said that he}} was pleased that Burroughs had {{credited}} him with the title. He states that Ginsberg misread [...] "Naked Lust" [...] from the manuscript, and only he noticed. Kerouac did not specify which manuscript and critics could only speculate until 2003 when Burroughs scholar Oliver Harris established that, in his Lower East Side apartment in fall 1953, Ginsberg had been reading aloud to Kerouac from the manuscript of Queer, which Burroughs had <b>just</b> <b>brought</b> with him from Mexico City. For the next five years, Burroughs used the title to refer to a three-part work made up of 'Junk,' 'Queer' and 'Yage,' corresponding to his first three manuscripts, before it came to describe the book later published as Naked Lunch, which was based largely on his 1957 'Interzone' manuscript.|$|E

2500|$|On October 7, at 8:09a.m., Iran Brown, a 13-year-old boy, {{was shot}} in the abdomen and {{critically}} wounded as he arrived at the Benjamin Tasker Middle School at 4901 Collington Road in Bowie, Maryland, in Prince George's County (Brown's name was concealed from the public but was later revealed). His aunt, a nurse who had <b>just</b> <b>brought</b> him to school, rushed him to a hospital emergency room. [...] Despite serious injuries, including damage to several major organs, Brown survived the attack and ultimately testified at Muhammad's trial.

There wasn't that much Satanic stuff, and what there was it wasn't exactly for the devil or anything like that; it was just around at the time and we <b>just</b> <b>brought</b> it to people's attention." [...] In the documentary The Black Sabbath Story, Vol. 1, Butler expresses his frustration at how fans misinterpreted the band's lyrics, stating that [...] "for instance, on 'Hand of Doom' they'll pick up one sentence out of that and blow it up into this big thing, like as if we're telling everyone to go and shoot smack.

2500|$|In early 1810, Hazard {{took part}} in the Invasion of Guadeloupe. During the invasion, Hazard led the fleet into Anse de Barque, {{arriving}} well before the other vessels. There she saw a French schooner anchored under the batteries and on fire. Robertson and a boarding party of marines boarded the burning schooner Mouche despite fire from the shore batteries that were trying either to sink them or the schooner. By the time Robertson was able to board the schooner part of her deck had burnt away; while the boarding party was cutting away her masts the intense heat discharged all her guns. Still the boarding party was able to bring her out and to seize the French [...] "general marine signal book", the signals of France's allies and other important documents that she had <b>just</b> <b>brought</b> out with her from France.

2500|$|In New South Wales, {{students}} are being issued with Lenovo laptops {{no bigger than}} a sheet of A4 paper. In 2009 the model issued was the IdeaPad S10e, in 2010, the ThinkPad Mini 10 in 2011, the ThinkPad Edge 11, in 2012 the ThinkPad X130e which has been uniquely designed [...] and in 2013, the ThinkPad X131e. The laptops also come with pre-installed software, such as Adobe CS5, Adobe LiveCycle ES2, Microsoft Office 2010, and Microsoft Forefront. In June 2010 a recall of laptop cases was issued after it was found that there was a flaw {{in the design of the}} case when several students reported that their screens had cracks. The New South Wales Department of Education and Training's Chief Information Officer Stephen Wilson said that the filtering system on the laptops is impervious and no student will be able to break through the system. [...] "Our internet filtering is unbreakable. We have a huge proxy array that does all the filtering.
