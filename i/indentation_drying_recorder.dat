30|$|However, {{for both}} 10 and 100  m/s speeds, the <b>indentation</b> force for <b>dry</b> <b>indentation</b> starts to {{overtake}} that for wet indentation when the indentation depth reaches 3.3  nm. This phenomenon {{can be attributed}} to the change of friction force between the indenter and the work material due to the addition of water. When the indentation depth is less than a critical value, the resultant reduction of indentation force is too small to compensate the resistant force of water molecules between the indenter and the work material. When the indentation depth is beyond the critical value, the beneficial tribological effect is sufficient to compensate the resistant force. As a result, the indentation force in the late stage for wet indentation is smaller than that for <b>dry</b> <b>indentation.</b>|$|R

30|$|The Braive and BK <b>drying</b> <b>recorder</b> is an {{instrument}} frequently {{employed in the}} coatings industry to measure the drying performance of a paint film operated with different lengths of a test strip; hence the two names used to denote it. This recorder consists of hemispherically ended needles, moving {{along the length of}} the test strip, which is made from plain glass and coated with a thin film. The drying characteristics of paint film are classified into four stages: the paint flows together (wet-edge time), the paint begins to polymerise (dust-free time), surface dries and finally lines become no longer visible on the film (total drying or through drying time) (Miccichè et al. 2005 a). However, Klaasen et al. classified the drying performance into three phases: open time (a scratch line traced by a pin closes up), dust free time (pin leaves a visible scratchy line, partially closed) and tack free time (a scratch line does not close) (Klaasen & van der Leeuw 2006). Clearly, assessing the drying of film suffers from subjective evaluation.|$|R
30|$|The {{hardness}} curve for wet indentation {{demonstrates the}} ISE, {{which means that}} the calculated hardness decreases with the increase of loading/penetration. On the other hand, the hardness-depth curve for <b>dry</b> <b>indentation</b> exhibits the reverse ISE, {{which means that the}} hardness increases with the increase of loading/penetration. These findings are not very common for numerical studies in the literature, but they are fairly consistent with experimental studies in the literature at larger scales. For instance, the reverse ISE in <b>dry</b> <b>indentation</b> is reported in several studies [30 – 32], and the regular ISE in lubricated indentation is also reported [14 – 16]. In particular, the reverse ISE phenomenon has not been fully understood. Speculated reasons include the existence of a distorted zone near the crystal-medium interface [33], the applied energy loss due to specimen chipping around the indentation [34], and the generation of median or radial cracks during indenter loading half-cycle [30].|$|R

40|$|Mineralized turkey leg tendon (MTLT) is an {{attractive}} model of mineralized collagen fibers, which are also present in bone. Its longitudinal structure is advantageous for the relative simplicity in modeling, yet its anisotropic elastic properties remain unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the extent of elastic anisotropy of mineralized collagen fibers by using nano- and microindentation to probe a number on MTLT samples in two orthogonal directions. The large dataset allowed the quantification of the extent of anisotropy, depending on the final indentation depth and on the hydration state of the sample. Anisotropy was observed to increase with the sample re-hydration process. Artifacts of indentation in a transverse direction to the main axis of the mineralized tendons in re-hydrated condition were observed. The indentation size effect, that is, the increase of the measured elastic properties with decreasing sampling volume, reported previously on variety of materials, was also observed in MTLT. Indentation work was quantified for both directions of <b>indentation</b> in <b>dried</b> and re-hydrated conditions. As hypothesized, MTLT showed a higher extent of anisotropy compared to cortical and trabecular bone, presumably due to the alignment of mineralized collagen fibers in this tissue...|$|R

The objective of this research is to determine parameters from a creep test to characterise the viscoelastic properties of on-progress dried longan. During 65 C hot-air drying, the whole longan was sampled every 2 hours to perform the creep test with a constant stress of 44 kPa using a texture analyser. Viscoelastic properties, viz. retardation time (ret), instantaneous compliance (J 0), retarded compliance (J 1), creep compliance (J), Newtonian viscosity ( 0), and modulus of elasticity (E) were analysed using the four-element Burger’s model. The ret and E decreased linearly as the moisture content decreased from approximately 70 % to 64 - 57 %, then they linearly increased as the moisture content further decreased to 11 %. The J and J 1 increased linearly and then decreased linearly as the moisture content decreased, showing the transition moisture content of 64 %. The J 0 decreased as the moisture content decreased. There was no marked change in , thus it was not involved in the <b>indentation</b> of <b>dried</b> longan. The moisture content of 64 - 57 % was found to be the critical range leading to the indentation of longan during the drying process...|$|R

The observation of CLSM shows the fundamental indentation responses for both the hydrated and dehydrated bone tissues were plastic deformation. No visible fracture was observed in the Vickers indentation patterns in the wet bone tissue, while non-propagating lamellar microcracks occurred in the dry bone tissue. This indicates that drying resulted in increased brittleness of the bone tissue.

30|$|Nano/micro-manufacturing under wet {{condition}} {{is an important}} consideration for various tool-based processes such as indentation, scratching, and machining. The existence of liquids adds complexity to the system, changes the tool/work interfacial condition, and affects material behaviors. For indentation, it may also affect material property measurements. However, little effort {{has been made to}} study this challenging issue at nano- or atomistic scale. In this study, we tackle this challenge by investigating nano-indentation processes submerged in water using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. Compared with <b>dry</b> <b>indentation</b> in which no water molecules are present, the existence of water molecules causes the increase of indentation force in initial penetration, but the decrease of indentation force in full penetration. It also reduces the sticking phenomenon between the work and tool atoms during indenter retraction, such that the indentation geometry can be better retained. Meanwhile, nano-indentation under {{wet condition}} exhibits the indentation size effect, while dry nano-indentation exhibits the reverse indentation size effect. The existence of water leads to higher computed hardness values at low indentation loads and a smaller value of Young's modulus. In addition, the friction along the tool/work interface is significantly reduced under wet indentation.|$|R

40|$|In this study,Three {{kinds of}} drying oils for the {{manufacturing}} water soluble air-drying alkyd resins,then blend {{it with a}} high imino methylated melamine resin crosslinker, neutralizing agents and other additives for wood coatings and then the properties of paints were investigated. The molecular weight and its distribution were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). The rheological properties were measured by Viscometer, and the drying time of film was obtained by <b>drying</b> <b>recorder.</b> The crosslinking reaction and weatherability were determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) {{was used to evaluate}} the curing kinetics. It was found that the nature of drying oils, neutralizing agents, and cosolvents would significantly influence on the molecular weight, viscosity, stability, drying time and curing kinetics of the paints. When the tung/castor oil, was used as resin generally it showed a higher molecular weight and viscosity than those using soybean or linseed oil. The diethylamine neutralizing agent for paints exhibited the best stability and lower viscosity, In contrast, ammonia exhibited lower stability. The paints which included the resin that using linseed oil,ammonia and butyl cellosolve (EGMBE), showing the fastest drying time for coating film. However, the drying time of the film was found to be significantly decreased, due to blending it with high imino methylated melamine resin. But the crosslinking peak was very weak on the FTIR plot. It was also found that below 109 ℃ during the solvent evaporation stage,the endothermic peak occurred and it would suppress the DSC exotherm associated with the autooxidation crosslinking reaction. However,the temperature was above 109 ℃,the solvent would be completely evaporated,and exothermic reaction would occur,therefore the crosslinking reaction of amino alkyd resin at high temperature would be performed. It was found that the solvent may significantly influence on thermal behavior, and it was also found that the alkyd resin with more iodine value and lower preexponential constant (InZ) and lower activation energy, generally it would have a short drying time. The physical and chemical properties of the coating film depended on the rate of evaporation and stability of the neutralizing agent and the number of unsaturated double bond and hydroxyl group of oil modified alkyd resin. The paints those including the neutralizing agent and using ammonia, showed the best film hardness and water-resistance; but the paint using diethylamine system, exhibited a higher thermal degradation than that of the other 2 kinds of neutralizing agents. Regarding the evaluation of paint which contained a drying oil, linseed oil modified resin, it had a higher film hardness. In contrast, a blend of the drying oil which soybean oil was used as modified resin, it showed both better water-resistance and thermal degradation-resistance. In addition, whatever the substrate was used as coating, {{it was found that the}} film had good flexibility after 15 cycles of cold and hot treatment. In order to qualify the weatherability, the coated wood was placed in the artificially accelerated weatherometer (enclosed carbon-arc type) for 240 hours. The paint system which included ammonia and soybean oil modified resin still maintained a higher gloss retention than that of the other formulations. In addition,the film of the coated wood appeared to have better appearance after 240 hours of exposure. According to the SRS-FTIR measurement, the absorption peak of the methoxyl group (915 cm- 1) and alkyl group (1376 cm- 1) disappeared after 240 hours of exposure. The absorption peak of the triazine ring (1556 cm- 1) disappeared after 268 hours, while the absorption peaks of the carbonyl group(1710 cm- 1, 1721 cm- 1) increased after 268 hours. It was found that the fastest drying time for coating film in air was the alkyd resin containing 5 % trimethylol propane diallyl ether (TMPDAE). Alkyd resin containing 10 % or 15 % had a longer drying time, therefore it would not have any improved effect. With a relative humidity under 65 % and various temperature, it was found that in creasing the temperature resulted in an increased speed of the drying of the film. It also indicated the synergism of both temperature and relative humidity in affecting the drying rate of film. The alkyd resin coating containing 5 % TMPDAE in air at 50 ℃ and under 45 % RH, 2 hours drying time would be required. When UV illumination was applied, the drying time was reduced to 1 hour. Under these condition, the drying time of film was 9 - 18 times faster than drying in air at 25 ℃ and under 65 %RH condition. With a DSC experiment, it was found that increasing the TMPDAE content, resulted in an increasing in the speed of the crosslinking reaction of the film. This indicated that the synergism of temperature and TMPDAE would affect the rate of crosslinking reaction. 高亞胺型甲基化三聚氰胺樹脂可作為水溶性醇酸樹脂之架橋劑，在不需添加酸觸媒下能夠調配氣乾型水性塗料。使用膠體滲透層析儀 (GPC) ， 霍氏 轉換紅外線光譜儀(FTIR) ，示差掃瞄熱卡儀(DSC) 及其他相關儀器 ，評估 樹脂塗料系統之性質及塗膜性能，結果歸納如下： 1. 樹脂塗料之分子量、黏度、穩定性、乾燥性、硬化動力學及塗膜物理 化學性能，主要受乾性油種類，中和劑種類所影響。桐油／篦麻油者 顯示最高分子量及黏度，依次為大豆油及亞麻仁油者；二乙胺中和之 塗料具有最佳穩定性及低黏度；氨者則穩定性最差，含亞麻仁油變性 之結合劑、氨中和劑及乙二醇單丁醚(EGMBE) 共溶劑之配方，塗膜乾 燥速度最快。 2.

40|$|Multiphase flows {{are fairly}} complex {{and they are}} usually studied as a bulk. In this thesis, these flows are {{approached}} by looking at single particle interactions (particle-particle and particle-wall). This work presents experimental measurements of the approach and rebound of a particle colliding with a "deformable' surface in a viscous liquid. The complex interaction between the fluid and the solid phases is coupled through {{the dynamics of the}} flow as well as the deformation process. A simple pendulum experiment was used to produced single controlled collisions; steel particles were used to impact different aluminum alloy samples (Al- 6061, Al- 2024, and Al- 7075) using different aqueous mixtures of glycerol and water as a viscous fluid. The velocity of the particle before and after the collision was estimated by post-processing the particle position recorded with a high speed camera. For the combination of materials proposed, the elastic limit is reached at relatively low velocities. The deformations produced by the collision were analyzed using an optical profilometer. The measurements showed that the size of the indentations is independent of the fluid media. It was found that the size of the indentations was the same for collisions in air than {{for the rest of the}} collisions using various viscous fluids. The results show that the plastic deformation is only a function of the impact velocity and the material properties. The normal coefficient of restitution and deformation parameters account for losses due to lubrication effect and inelasticity, identifying then, the dominant energy loss mechanism during the collision process. According to the strain imposed in the samples due to the collision, the deformations were either elastic or elastic-plastic. The equivalent load due to the impact velocities used in this work did not reach the fully-plastic regime. For the collisions in air, different models were used to compare the experimental results showing that the elastic-plastic regime is not well characterized by only the material properties and the impact velocity. The time-resolved contact force was measured during the process of the <b>indentation</b> for the <b>dry</b> collision experiments using a quartz load transducer. The experiments clearly show four different regimes depending on the impact Stokes number: lubrication effect and elastic deformation, lubrication effect and elastic-plastic deformation, elastic deformation with no hydrodynamic effects, and elastic-plastic deformation with negligible lubrication effect. An analysis of the erosion of ductile materials during immersed collisions is presented. The size of the crater formed by the impact of a single particle against a ductile target can be estimated from theory, and these estimates agree well with experimental measurements...|$|R
