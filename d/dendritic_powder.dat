40|$|Polarization {{characteristics}} of the electrodeposition processes of Fe powders from sulfate and chloride electrolytes and the morphology of the obtained powders were investigated. The morphology depended on the anion presence in the electrolyte {{but not on the}} current density in the investigated range. A characteristic feature of the <b>dendritic</b> <b>powder</b> with cauliflower endings obtained from sulfate electrolyte is the presence of cone-like cavities and the crystallite morphology of the powders surface. On the other hand, Fe powders electrodeposited from chloride electrolyte appear in the form of agglomerates. A soap solution treatment applied as a method of washing and drying provides good protection from oxidation of the powders...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to the worldwide increase in consumption of galvanized steel for automobiles in the last fifteen years, {{and the cost of}} environmental compliance associated with remelting larger quantities of galvanized steel scrap, processes are being developed to separate and recover the steel and zinc from galvanized ferrous scrap. In the process discussed here, zinc is dissolved from the scrap in hot caustic and is recovered electrolytically as <b>dendritic</b> <b>powder.</b> The dezinced ferrous scrap is rinsed and used directly. The process is effective for zinc, lead, and aluminum removal on loose and baled scrap and on all types of galvanized steel. Pilot testing has been conducted in Hamilton, Ontario for batch treatment of 900 tonnes of mostly baled scrap. A pilot plant in East Chicago, Indiana, now in its second generation, has dezinced in a continuous process mode about 1, 800 tonnes of loose clips and shredded stamping plant scrap; this scrap typically has residual zinc below 0. 05 % and sodium dragout below 0. 001 %. This paper reviews caustic dezincing pilot plant performance and economics...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of particle shape and temperature on the compaction of copper powder at micro scale. Copper powder particles were compressed inside a cylindrical die cavity with 2 mm diameter to form compacts with about 3 mm height. Two kinds of particle shapes, spherical and dendritic, and two forming temperatures, room temperature and 400 째C, were considered in the experiments. Some of the produced compacts were further sintered at 600 째C. The study also used simple upsetting tests to investigate {{the characteristics of the}} deformation of the compacts under compressive stresses. The results showed that the compacts produced at room temperature demonstrated brittle deformations. However, by increasing the forming temperature to 400 째C, ductile deformations have been observed on the compacts of dendritic particles. Furthermore, the sintering treatment resulted in increases in dimensions, decreases in relative density and hardness, and an increase in ductility. It also led to pore growths which have been seen on scanning-electron microscope images. These phenomena were most significant in the <b>dendritic</b> <b>powder</b> compacts which were produced at 400 째C and treated by the sintering process...|$|E
5000|$|Exact {{composition}} of the brush depends on the application. Graphite/carbon powder is commonly used. Copper is used for better conductance (rare for AC applications and not on automotive fuel pumps which run on carbon commutators).In order to maximize electrical conductivity and green strength, highly <b>dendritic</b> (electrolytic) copper <b>powder</b> is used [...] Binders, mostly phenol- or other resins or pitch, are mixed in so the powder holds its shape when compacted. Other additives include metal powders, and solid lubricants like MoS2, WS2. Much know-how and research is {{needed in order to}} define a brush grade mixture for each application or motor.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePowder {{metallurgy}} is {{a preferred}} method of processing copper-carbon composites {{due to the}} non-wetting nature of these materials. Porosities are inherently introduced in these material systems, and adversely affect the thermal conductivity of the composite material, among other factors including interfaces and reinforcement distribution. In this work, {{we focus on the}} matrix material of pure copper and systematically analyzed the effect of volume fraction of porosities on the thermal conductivity. Spherical and <b>dendritic</b> copper <b>powder</b> materials were processed and {{it was found that the}} surface chemistry and morphology of particles affected the thermal conductivity apart from the porosity values. In order to study the effect of porosities alone, dentritic powder was used in the study. The thermal conductivity vs. porosity behavior showed three distinct domains. In all the domains the thermal conductivity decreases as volume fraction of porosities increases; however, in domain II, the decrease was much steeper than the other two. We are able to explain the variation based on the presence of interconnected and open pores in domain III to closed pores in domain I, and the transition occurring in domain II. None of the existing models capture the overall behavior. However, if we specifically account for the variation of number of grain boundaries with sintering, then the modified EMT model can match the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Pure {{coherent}} boron {{has been}} electrodeposited from a fused fluoride mix-ture. A eutectic mixture of L iF and KF {{is used as}} the electrolyte, with BF 3 gas dissolved to form the tetrafluoborate ion which reacts at the cathode to produce boron. The boron as plated is of 95 % or better purity, and is homo-geneous and uncracked, up to 25 mils thickness. The substrates plated include steel, copper, graphite, tungsten, and molybdenum. Temperatures of plating range from 600 ~ to 700 ~ with plating rates up to 6 mils/hr. Pure boron has been produced electrolytical ly in fused salts by Cooper (1) and others (2). However, these methods for producing boron electrolyt ical ly have produced spongy, <b>dendritic,</b> or compacted <b>powder</b> deposits. These deposits were crushed and treated with hot water and acid to leach out salts and other im-purities. In contrast, the method presented in thi...|$|R
