5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of <b>e-beam</b> power.|$|E

50|$|The {{electron}} beam prober (<b>e-beam</b> prober) is a specialized adaption {{of a standard}} scanning electron microscope (SEM) that is used for semiconductor failure analysis. While a conventional SEM may be operated in a voltage range of 10-30 keV, the <b>e-beam</b> Prober typically operates at 1 keV. The <b>e-beam</b> prober is capable of measuring voltage and timing waveforms on internal semiconductor signal structures. Waveforms may be measured on metal line, polysilicon and diffusion structures that have an electrically active, changing signal. The operation of the prober {{is similar to that}} of a sampling oscilloscope. A continuously looping, repeating test pattern must be applied to the device-under-test (DUT). <b>E-beam</b> probers are used primarily for front side semiconductor analysis. With the advent of flip-chip technology, many <b>e-beam</b> probers have been replaced with back side analysis instruments.|$|E
50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} is {{that current}} optical rectennas are produced using electron beam (<b>e-beam)</b> lithography. This process {{is slow and}} relatively expensive because parallel processing is not possible with <b>e-beam</b> lithography. Typically, <b>e-beam</b> lithography is used only for research purposes when extremely fine resolutions are needed for minimum feature size (typically, {{on the order of}} nanometers). However, photolithographic techniques have advanced to where it is possible to have minimum feature sizes on the order of tens of nanometers, making it possible to produce rectennas by means of photolithography.|$|E

In a Coolidge tube, the <b>e-beam</b> filament for is at ground, heating a tungsten filament with several amperes of current. A transmission target must be grounded, and the <b>e-beam</b> filament is negatively biased for peak voltage; the several-ampere filament cannot be readily supplied from a high-voltage cable. Therefore, the X-ray transmission tube and its high-voltage power supply are integrated to avoid {{the use of a}} high-voltage cable (see illustration).|$|E

It demonstrates the significance of electromagnetic potentials (proportional to fluxes) against the electromagnetic fields through the simple paradigm of two electron beams (<b>e-beams).</b> Even though they are both traveling through a null field space, their wave functions are not equal: the difference is in their phases and it {{is related to the}} magnetic flux through the area defined by their trajectories. Inspired by this fact, we formulate an inverse problem for the magnetic permeability of a bio-chemical sample positioned inbetween two magnets. The data can be taken by measuring the phase difference between the wave functions of two split <b>e-beams</b> with parallel trajectories passing through the samples. The case of only radial dependence of magnetic permeability is fully solved and certain insights are provided for the arbitrary radial/azimuthal distributions...|$|R

50|$|Ion beam {{lithography}} offers {{higher resolution}} patterning than UV, X-ray, or {{electron beam lithography}} because these heavier particles have more momentum. This gives the ion beam a smaller wavelength than even an <b>e-beam</b> and therefore almost no diffraction. The momentum also reduces scattering in the target and in any residual gas. There is also a reduced potential radiation effect to sensitive underlying structures compared to x-ray and <b>e-beam</b> lithography.|$|E

The <b>e-beam</b> range in an X-ray target {{is only a few}} micrometres; for a 30 μm thick transmission X-ray target, most of the target thickness would absorb low-energy photons and transfer high-energy photons into the fluorescent K- or L-lines characteristic of the target element. Monochromatic line emissions are emitted from the refined X-ray focal point. The illustration demonstrates K-line emissions of molybdenum and silver targets, demonstrating that the transmission target would deliver bright, monochromatic X-rays from the small focal point defined by the <b>e-beam.</b>|$|E

This form of direct-write, maskless lithography has high resolution and low throughput, limiting single-column <b>e-beams</b> to photomask fabrication, low-volume production of semiconductor devices, and research&development.

Calculated for metallic (silver and gold) and insulating (SiO 2 and MgO) nanoplatelets, new radiative features are revealed above the main surface plasmon-polariton peak, and dramatic enhancements in the electron energy loss probability at gaps of the 'classical' spectra, are found.

5000|$|The {{criticism}} {{most often}} directed at DPN is the patterning speed. The {{reason for this}} {{has more to do}} with how it is compared to other techniques rather than any inherent weaknesses. For example, the soft lithography method, microcontact printing (μCP), is the current standard for low cost, bench-top micro and nanoscale patterning, so it is easy to understand why DPN is compared directly to microcontact printing. The problem is that the comparisons are usually based upon applications that are strongly suited to μCP, instead of comparing them to some neutral application. μCP has the ability to pattern one material over a large area in a single stamping step, just as photolithography can pattern over a large area in a single exposure. Of course DPN is slow when it is compared to the strength of another technique. DPN is a maskless direct write technique that can be used to create multiple patterns of varying size, shape, and feature resolution, all on a single substrate. No one would try to apply microcontact printing to such a project because then it would never be worth the time and money required to fabricate each master stamp for each new pattern. Even if they did, microcontact printing would not be capable of aligning multiple materials from multiple stamps with nanoscale registry. [...] The best way to understand this misconception is to think about the different ways to apply photolithography and <b>e-beam</b> lithography. No one would try to use <b>e-beam</b> to solve a photolithography problem and then claim <b>e-beam</b> to be [...] "too slow". Directly compared to photolithography's large area patterning capabilities, <b>e-beam</b> lithography is slow and yet, <b>e-beam</b> instruments can be found in every lab and nanofab in the world. The reason for this is because <b>e-beam</b> has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by photolithography, just as DPN has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by microcontact printing.|$|E

30|$|The {{dynamics}} of nanopore formation in metal membranes using the highly focused and high energy electron beams (<b>e-beams)</b> of {{transmission electron microscopy}} instruments was investigated. Various metals such as Al, Ti, Cr, Cu, and Au were selected to investigate {{the effect of the}} atomic mass of the metal on nanopore drilling, namely, elastic versus inelastic scattering. We demonstrated that the effect of elastic scattering (pore formation by sputtering) decreased as the atomic mass of the metal increased. Furthermore, experimental cross-sections obtained from normalized drilled volume vs. electron dose curves (characteristic contrast curves) matched well the calculated atomic displacement cross-sections determined from elastic scattering data. The sputtering energies of Ti, Cr, and Cu were determined to be approximately 10, 9, and 7  eV, respectively, which were in good agreement with the reported range of sputtering energy values.|$|R
40|$|Typical bunch {{compression}} for a high-gain free-electron laser (FEL) {{requires a}} large compression ratio.
