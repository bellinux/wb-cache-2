EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The major objective of this study was to assess the performance of <b>grain</b> <b>markets</b> in Ethiopia at the individual market levels and for groups of markets which are spatially linked. By examining the nature of relationships among producer, wholesale, and retail prices in individual markets and among different markets, the study is also aimed at improving the understanding of the <b>grain</b> <b>market</b> operation under the emerging new <b>grain</b> <b>market</b> structure. Such information, can encourage informed policy debate and dialogue among planners, policy makers, researchers, NGO’s and donor agencies and contributes toward the formulation of effective <b>grain</b> <b>marketing</b> policies. Various analytical techniques such as the descriptive assessment of the levels and volatilities of grain prices and price spreads and the econometric tests of price transmission within and across markets were used to assess the efficiency of vertical and spatial integration of <b>grain</b> <b>markets</b> in Ethiopia. The price analysis was also complemented by field level knowledge of the operation of <b>grain</b> <b>markets</b> in Ethiopia. Th...|$|R

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} <b>grain</b> <b>market</b> reform in Ethiopia on grain prices and price spreads between major wholesale markets. The experience of Ethiopia during the 1990 s represents {{a case in which}} a relatively consistent and internally-driven program of <b>grain</b> <b>market</b> liberalization has been pursued with the general approval of international lenders and donors. The state marketing board, while not abolished, has been substantially downsized and has become a marginal actor in the current <b>grain</b> <b>marketing</b> system. Hence, the case of Ethiopia between 1990 and 1997 may constitute a particularly important test of the hypothesis expressed by reform advocates that the removal of regulatory constraints on private trade and the transition to a market-oriented system would reduce <b>grain</b> <b>marketing</b> costs and pass along benefits to both farmers and consumers. food security, food policy, <b>grain</b> <b>market</b> reform, Ethiopia, International Relations/Trade, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies, Downloads June 2008 - July 2009 : 37, Q 18,...|$|R

40|$|A {{market economy}} will not {{emerge from a}} redistributive economy {{automatically}} once the state abolishes a redistributive system. Because of the cognitive incompleteness of market actors in post-redistributive societies, and {{also because of the}} conflicts between the state and local interests and among local interests, selective state interventions are inevitable and necessary for a successful market transition. This paper examined the evolution of market pattern in the new market transition economies based on the emergence of an internal <b>grain</b> <b>market</b> under market reform in China. I found that local markets, tightly "protected" by local officials, tried to curtail long-distance trade beyond local territories and thus were not starting points of an internal market in China's national <b>grain</b> <b>market.</b> The approximate internal <b>grain</b> <b>market</b> {{at the beginning of the}} 21 st century in China is the result of deliberate actions of the reform-oriented state. <b>market</b> reform, <b>grain</b> <b>market,</b> blockmodeling, selective intervention...|$|R

40|$|While <b>grain</b> <b>marketing</b> is {{considered}} a difficult challenge facing producers every year, it represents a very important component for producers to convert their bushels into dollars and ensure farm survival. <b>Grain</b> <b>marketing</b> involves both strategic behavior {{and knowledge of the}} <b>grain</b> <b>market.</b> Local and global supply and demand conditions, grain storage costs, transportation costs etc. present constantly changing risk and reward opportunities for producers. Efficient training and consistent monitoring of the market can help producers reduce risk (i. e., reduce the chance of farm failure) by making good use of pricing opportunities. Since these concepts may not necessarily be intuitive and strategic behavior can often be cognitively taxing, the University of Nebraska- Lincoln has developed an interactive <b>grain</b> <b>marketing</b> simulation game, called Marketing in a New Era (MINE) for this purpose. The first section of this article describes how the MINE simulation game can fit Extension meetings and help Specialists communicate <b>grain</b> <b>marketing</b> principles.

Findings – This paper finds that a partially integrated national <b>grain</b> <b>market</b> had emerged at the beginning of the twenty-first century in China in spite of local protectionism. Additionally, the emergence of this market is found to be partly a result of the reform-oriented state's attempt to create national wholesale <b>grain</b> <b>markets.</b> Originality/value – The findings of the paper might have implications for market development in both China and other transition economies.
