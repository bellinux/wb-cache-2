500|$|Influenced by such blues-rock guitarists as Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page, {{and such}} jazz fusion players as John McLaughlin, and Al Di Meola, Lukather {{is known for}} a [...] "melodic and intense" [...] playing style. He has also cited Steely Dan as a major long-time influence—one that emerges {{prominently}} in later solo work such as All's Well That Ends Well. Journalist Jude Gold notes that his vibrato is very pronounced and his [...] "exaggerated wide bends" [...] are distinctive and quickly recognizable. Well-versed in music theory, Lukather can follow chord charts and changes in a way typical of jazz musicians—this ability enhances his value as a session musician. In interviews, he has explained how <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guitar in a [...] "chordal cluster" [...] format, and not the typical [...] "linear scale" [...] format.|$|E
500|$|The {{architectural}} style adopted by William Curtis Green, {{largely based on}} Owen William's design, was {{a departure from the}} Neoclassical with its reinforced concrete covered over with terrazzo slabs. British Modernists were disappointed with the result, describing Green's adaptation as, [...] "a genteel period piece which looks the compromise it is". In comparison to some of the other hotels in London such as the Lanesborough, the building's exterior is unremarkable. It is eight storeys high aside from the ground floor, with the central bay containing three windows on each floor. Christopher Matthew has stated that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dorchester as a [...] "rather American hotel", {{not only because of the}} strong association with American actors such as Elizabeth Taylor, but because the sweeping 1930s facade reminded him of many of those which appeared in American film musicals. However, he notes that the hotel still remains [...] "very much an English hotel". The hotel became a Grade II Listed Building in January 1981.|$|E
2500|$|Lucy expresses {{her deep}} infatuation with Schroeder and asks him what <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea of {{marriage}}. Schroeder {{is aware of}} her feelings, but remains aloof as he plays his piano. Lucy then exclaims: [...] "My Aunt Marion was right. Never try to discuss marriage with a musician" [...] ("Schroeder"). Sally is sad because her jump rope tangled up.|$|E
60|$|Josiah Crabtree {{was still}} groaning {{in the next}} room, but Dick paid little {{attention}} to the man. Nor did <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rascals who had escaped. All his thoughts were centered on Tom.|$|R
6000|$|... "And is <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white-headed chief soft, {{and will}} <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> babes that his squaws have given him? He {{is hard to}} his warriors, and his eyes are made of stone!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We will," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "And you be {{sure and}} have Uncle Randolph up and well when we do come back," [...] he added. Poor Tom! little did <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grave perils that waited {{for him in the}} far West! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{world was}} made a sphere in order that men should not push one another off, but the {{landowner}} smiles when <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea.|$|E
6000|$|... [Here {{is another}} opportunity, gentle Reader, for playing a [...] trick on your {{innocent}} friend. Put the proposed Syllogism before [...] him, {{and ask him}} what <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Conclusion.|$|E
6000|$|I don't {{believe in}} these {{innocent}} {{people who do}} not know what they are doing half their time. Ask any London magistrate what <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lady who explains that she picked up the diamond brooch:- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh no--no--so good, so noble, so heroic as he is. How could <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{poor little}} French teacher! And he will pay my aunt's fifty pounds! I told him all, {{and he knew}} it before, and yet he loves me! Oh! why are people so very good to me?' ...|$|R
60|$|By no {{conceivable}} mental gymnastics could <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two as antagonists. Between {{them there}} was no imaginable issue. They had both {{very much the same}} scientific disposition; with perhaps more dash and inspiration in <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> Hugh; more docility and method in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> Karl. Until war had smashed them one against the other....|$|R
60|$|When he was gone, Diane {{pressed her}} hands {{together}} with a strange sense of misery. He, who had shrunk from <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> little Diane's untruthfulness, what would <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present Diane's treachery? Yet it was {{to save his life}} and that of her brother--and for <b>the</b> assertion <b>of</b> her victory over the little robber, Eustacie.|$|R
6000|$|Yet {{he hears}} thy dear {{voice in the}} summer winds sighing, Mild accents of {{happiness}} lisp in his ear, [...] 10 When the hope-winged moments athwart him are flying, And <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> friend to his bosom so dear.-- ...|$|E
60|$|Sneer. Pray, Mr. Puff, how came Sir Christopher Hatton {{never to}} ask that {{question}} before? Puff. What before the play began?-how the plague could he? Dang. That's true, i'faith! Puff. But you will hear what <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter. Sir Christ.|$|E
6000|$|Up the Haymarket hill he oft {{whistles}} his way, [...] Thrusts {{his hands}} in a waggon, and smells at the hay; [30] [...] <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fields he so often hath mown, [...] And is happy as if the rich freight were his own. [31] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A scandal!" [...] moaned the Duchess piteously, [...] "a {{scandal in}} my department! Oh, I shall never survive it! If Her Majesty should hear of it, {{who is so}} austere, so pious! [...] . . . And with my lord Cardinal staying in the Palace just now. [...] . . . What would <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morals <b>of</b> an English Court! [...] . . . Oh! the naughty, wicked child, thus to bring disgrace upon us all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The more <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> Davis, <b>the</b> better he'll <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me if I {{can make}} him believe that I am {{not likely to}} want a Davis again.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> was. <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor lepers {{annoyed with}} this dirty comrade! But the clean Dr. Hyde {{was at his}} food in a fine house.|$|R
6000|$|From that Benham {{drove on}} to discoveries. [...] "When a man {{thinks of the}} past he {{concentrates}} on self; when <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future he radiates from self. Call me a neo-Confucian; with the cone opening forward away from me, instead of focussing on me...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is exactly}} what he wanted, my dear, if you will not fly at me for saying so. Nothing else could teach him that {{patients}} are not cases but persons; and here he comes {{to tell you what}} <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trouble of a sick wife.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your husband's tranquillity," [...] I added, [...] "is as {{precious}} to me as my own. As for your son, you know what <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mother who deserted him. Your secret is safe in my keeping--safe from your husband, safe from your son, {{to the end of}} my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. John {{will always}} have his say;" [...] one remarked: and then Mr. Effingham {{dismissed}} the party, by telling them <b>he</b> would <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter.|$|R
50|$|The narrator {{states that}} {{even though he is}} no longer with his former lover, {{whenever}} he dances with another person <b>he</b> still <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former lover.|$|R

"The good works are rather spotty!" Hanya was brought to the center by Len White, left, public relations director for the center. ...|$|R
60|$|He is {{a selfish}} old beggar anyhow. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loaves and fishes {{even when he}} {{believes}} {{he is in a}} real Presence. His manias make a startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger. He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man.|$|E
60|$|And when {{he comes}} to the next inn, and snuggles in his well-warmed, bed, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wild waste of heather where he might have had to spend the night alone beneath the stars; nor does it, I think, occur to him that the broad road he treads all day was once a {{trackless}} heath itself.|$|E
6000|$|... accuses Sir Walter Scott {{of having}} taken the Elliot version--till then the only version--and of having altered stanzas vii.-xi. (in which Jamie goes to Branksome, and is refused succour) {{into his own}} stanzas vii.-xi., in which Jamie goes to Stobs and is refused succour. This evil thing Scott did, thinks Colonel Elliot. Scott had no copy, <b>he</b> <b>thinks,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ballad except an Elliot copy, which he {{deliberately}} perverted.|$|E
6000|$|... "You will then,--I {{can assure}} you of that. It is not only me, but your own son. I was up with him to-day, and <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> it <b>the</b> same as I do." ...|$|R
60|$|It was, indeed, {{a desperate}} {{undertaking}} {{for him to}} follow these men into the wilderness where he could not call upon his friend for assistance; but never for a moment did <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> shirking <b>the</b> responsibility.|$|R
5000|$|Killer {{whales are}} {{intensely}} social, and boats and people provided the companionship and physical contact that Luna would normally have received {{from his mother}} and from other whales. A Canadian federal fisheries officer said in 2003, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> realizes he's a whale. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he's</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boys." ...|$|R
60|$|A mysterious charm {{is given}} to the poem by the way in which Keats endows inanimate things with a sort of half-conscious life. The knights and ladies of stone arouse the bedesman's shuddering sympathy when <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cold they must be enduring; 'the carven angels' 'star'd' 'eager-eyed' from the roof of the chapel, and the scutcheon in Madeline's window 'blush'd with blood of queens and kings'.|$|E
60|$|By-and-by {{his mother}} {{gives him a}} piece of cake, and he goes out into the garden to play. His sister is there and asks him {{to give her a}} piece of his cake. He hesitates. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> request long enough to form a {{distinct}} image in his mind of giving her half of it, but finally concludes not to do so, and eats it all himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR GIRL--Your letter has charmed {{and touched}} me. Your excuses have gone {{straight}} to my heart; and your {{confidence in my}} humble abilities has followed in the sa me direction. The pulse of the old militia-man throbs with pride as <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trust you have placed in him, and vows to deserve it. Don't be surprised at this genial outburst. All enthusiastic natures must explode occasionally; and my form of explosion is--Words.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly he {{believed}} it. He was most kind and sympathetic. We {{had a nice}} chat. He {{told me all about}} himself. He used to be very good at football. He doesn't play now, but <b>he</b> often <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He don't dare {{to so much}} as {{raise his}} hands, except he's up 'round Ninety-four's house, where <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firemen will back him!" [...] Sam cried derisively as he redoubled his efforts to provoke the amateur.|$|R
6000|$|... "What an old fossil it is!" [...] cried Pagett, as Orde {{returned}} from seeing his guest to the door; [...] "just like some old blue-blooded hidalgo of Spain.
