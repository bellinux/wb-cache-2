50|$|Central <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus,</b> {{also called}} neurogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus,</b> {{is a type}} of <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> {{due to a lack of}} {{vasopressin}} (ADH) production in the brain. Vasopressin acts to increase the volume of blood (intravascularly), and decrease the volume of urine produced. Therefore, a lack of it causes increased urine production and volume depletion.|$|R
40|$|Under {{physiological}} conditions, {{fluid and}} electrolyte homoeostasis is {{maintained by the}} kidney adjusting urine volume and composition according to body needs. <b>Diabetes</b> <b>Insipidus</b> is a complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome affecting water balance and characterized by constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine. With respect to the similarly named Diabetes Mellitus, a disease already known in ancient Egypt, Greece and Asia, <b>Diabetes</b> <b>Insipidus</b> has been described several thousand years later. In 1670 s Thomas Willis, noted the difference in taste of urine from polyuric subjects compared with healthy individuals and started the differentiation of Diabetes Mellitus from the more rare entity of <b>Diabetes</b> <b>Insipidus.</b> In 1794, Johann Peter Frank described polyuric patients excreting nonsaccharine urine and introduced the term of <b>Diabetes</b> <b>Insipidus.</b> An hystorical milestone was the in 1913, when Farini successfully used posterior pituitary extracts to treat <b>Diabetes</b> <b>Insipidus.</b> Until 1920 s the available evidence indicated <b>Diabetes</b> <b>Insipidus</b> as a disorder of the pituitary gland. In the early 1928, De Lange first observed that some patients with <b>Diabetes</b> <b>Insipidus</b> {{did not respond to}} posterior pituitary extracts and subsequently Forssman and Waring in 1945 established that the kidney had a critical role for these forms of <b>Diabetes</b> <b>Insipidus</b> resistant to this treatment.

40|$|Background: lithium {{can cause}} nephrogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> {{in up to}} 20 to 40 percent of {{patients}} currently taking the medication, and a subset of these patients will have a persistent concentrating defect long after lithium is discontinued.

Methods: MEDLINE as used to search the key words "nephrogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> " and "lithium " from 1990 to the present. A case report describes a patient who had been off lithium for 8 years and who developed hypematremia after she was transferred to a new long-term facility and the staff attempted to control the patient's polydipsia. The diagnosis and treatment of nephrogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> are also discussed.

40|$|A few rare syndromes {{have been}} {{delineated}} in which diabetes mellitus is inherited {{in association with}} other conditions.

The importance of diagnosing <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> is that all these patients had dilatation of the urinary tract varying from mild hydroureter to severe hydronephrosis and this improved with treatment of the <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus.</b> It is suggested that patients with diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy should have regular screening tests for <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> since it is likely that they represent cases of the full syndrome with incomplete clinical expression.

40|$|Lithium-associated primary {{hyperparathyroidism}} {{complicated by}} nephrogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> Lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism {{is the leading}} cause of hypercalcemia in lithium-treated patients. Lithium may lead to exacerbation of pre-existing primary hyperparathyroidism or cause an increased set-point of calcium for parathyroid hormone suppression, leading to parathyroid hyperplasia. Lithium may cause renal tubular con-centration defects directly by the development of nephrogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> or indirectly by the effects of hypercalcemia. In this study, we present a female patient on long-term lithium treatment who was evaluated for hypercalcemia. Preoperative imaging studies indicated parathyroid adenoma and multinodular goiter. Parathyroid-ectomy and thyroidectomy were planned. During the postoperative course, prolonged intubation was necessary because of agitation and delirium. During this period, polyuria, severe dehydration, and hypernatremia developed, which responded to controlled hypotonic fluid infusions and was unresponsive to parenteral desmopressin.

Drug induced DI is a well-known entity with an extensive list of medications. Polyuria is generally defined as urine output exceeding 3 liters per day in adults. It is crucial to identify the cause of <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> and to implement therapy {{as early as possible}} to prevent the electrolyte disturbances and the associated mortality and morbidity. It is very rare to have an idiosyncratic effect after a short use of a medication, and physicians should be aware of such a complication to avoid volume depletion. The diagnosis of <b>diabetes</b> <b>insipidus</b> is very challenging because it relies on laboratory values, urine output, and the physical examination of the patient.
