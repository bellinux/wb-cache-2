The {{present study}} reports the {{synthesis}} of carbonate apatite foam with fully interconnecting pores from βTCP foam by hydrothermal treatment in 1 mol·L- 1 <b>disodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> solution at 200 ºC. The βTCP foam were prepared; 1) using 3 mol % Mg as βTCP stabilizer, 2) using αTCP foam as a precursor by heat treatment at 900 ºC for 100 hours. The βTCP foam containing Mg could not transform to carbonate apatite foam completely. Meanwhile, the βTCP foam heat-treated at 900 ºC transformed to carbonate apatite after hydrothermal treatment for 10 days without morphological change. Compressive strength measurement indicated {{that the value of}} carbonate apatite foam derived from βTCP was significantly higher than that from αTCP...|$|E

According to the components of hair dye X, it contains a lot of chemicals that may have serious side effects. The listed ingredients in the hair dye X brochure—in order—are P-phenylenediamine sulfate, sodium perborate, cellulose gum, m-aminophenol, sodium <b>carbonate,</b> <b>disodium</b> lauryl sulfosuccinate, magnesium stearate, p-aminophenol, fragrance (perfume), and algin, sapindus mukurossi peel extract.|$|R
40|$|Oral {{sustained}} release gastroretentive dosage forms offer many advantages for drugs having absorption {{from the upper}} gastrointestinal tract and improve the bioavailability of medications that are characterized by the narrow absorption window. A new gastroretentive {{sustained release}} delivery system using the novel effervescent system was developed with floating, swellable, and bioadhesive properties. Various release retarding polymers like psyllium husk, HPMC K 15 M, and a swelling agent crosspovidone in different combinations were tried and optimized to get the release profile for 12 hours. The formulations were evaluated for physicochemical characteristics, in vitro drug release profile, swelling characteristics, floating capacity, and in vitro bioadhesive property. i 0 n vitro drug release followed the Higuchi kinetics and the release mechanism {{was found to be}} of a non-Fickian type. The swelling properties were increased with increasing crosspovidone concentration and contributed to the drug release from the tablet matrix. In this study, an attempt has been made to explore novel effervescent agents such as citroglycine and <b>disodium</b> glycine <b>carbonate</b> for achieving the desired floating time...|$|R
40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 {{has recently}} gained great attention {{for its ability}} to directly convert CO 2 into renewable chemicals upon genetic engineering. Thus, it is of great interest to increase the growth speed and lower the medium requirement for cultivating this cyanobacterium. The cultivation medium of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 has been developed, which consists of many inorganic and metal ingredients with a specific composition, known as the BG- 11 medium. In this work, we analyzed the concentration effect of each ingredient and identified the absolutely essential components in BG- 11 medium for cyanobacteria growth using the concentration gradient generator chip (CGGC) fabricated by MEMS technology. As shown by our results, removal of the individual component sodium nitrate, potassium phosphate, or magnesium sulfate from the BG- 11 medium led to severe growth inhibition of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Contrary to our expectation, increasing concentration of the crucial ingredients showed either insignificant or negative impact on cell growth. Overall, standard growth could be achieved without supplementation of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) <b>disodium,</b> sodium <b>carbonate,</b> or sodium citrate to the culture medium. Further improvement of the CGGC-based microfluidic system based on this preliminary study may broaden its application range to analyze more complicated correlations...|$|R
40|$|A 1999 {{desk study}} assesses the {{environmental}} risks of 93 industrial or other non-agricultural pesticides. The risks for aquatic ecosystems are emphasised, and various data on use pattern, dosages, emissions, physicochemistry, environmental fate and ecotoxicity are listed. The biocides {{have not been}} included {{in any of the}} environmental policy spearheads for biocides in the Netherlands, primarily due to lack of data. This lack is partially confirmed by the present study: e. g. experimental data on the effects to purification processes in sewage treatment plants are available for only four substances. This study also shows that 11 biocides can have an adverse impact on aquatic organisms (e. g. 2, 2 -dibromo- 3 -nitrilopropionamide as a slimicide in paper industries) and that 11 biocides probably have no adverse impact on aquatic organisms (e. g. zinc oxide as antifouling). A group of 17 biocides cannot be characterised for the environmental impact - although emission to surface water is indicated -, because there are no models, no ecotoxicological data or no data on the actual yearly industrial or domestic use. Some of these biocides are very toxic as seen in acute toxicity tests in the laboratory (e. g. <b>disodium</b> cyanodithioimido <b>carbonate).</b> As the environmental risk assessments in this study reflect realistic worst-case conditions, a follow-up study will be aimed at adequate risk assessments under more general conditions. In this way, the assessments for the potentially hazardous 11 biocides will be specified by a more precise exposure assessment and additional ecotoxicity data, if available. More precise data on the actual use of biocides by industries are also required...|$|R
