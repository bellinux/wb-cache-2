5|$|It is {{impossible}} to judge the truth of these diary entries, but Reich's second daughter, the psychiatrist Lore Reich Rubin, told Christopher Turner that she believed Reich had {{been a victim of}} child sexual abuse, and that this <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> lifelong interest in sex and childhood sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Ancient authors {{agreed that}} the worship of Terminus was of Sabine origin, ascribing its {{introduction}} to Rome either to Titus Tatius, the Sabine colleague of Rome's founding king Romulus (traditional reign 753717 BC), or to Romulus' successor Numa Pompilius (717673 BC). Those authors who gave the credit to Numa <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> motivation as the prevention of violent disputes over property. Plutarch further states that, in keeping with Terminus's character as a guarantor of peace, his earliest worship did not involve blood sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, Major Ralph Bagnold {{learned how}} to {{maintain}} and operate vehicles, how to navigate, and how to communicate in the desert. On 23 June 1940 he met General Archibald Wavell, {{the commander of the}} Middle East Command in Alexandria and <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> concept for a group of men intended to undertake long-range reconnaissance patrols to gather intelligence behind the Italian lines in Libya.|$|E

5|$|In January 1960 McClory visited Fleming's Jamaican home Goldeneye, where Fleming <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> {{intention}} of delivering the screenplay to MCA, with a recommendation {{from him and}} Bryce that McClory act as producer. Additionally, Fleming told McClory that if MCA rejected the film because of McClory's involvement, then McClory should either sell his services to MCA, {{back out of the}} deal, or file suit in court.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, 2009, Eiland-Hall {{wrote to}} Beck, giving him {{control of the}} domain free of charge, and {{providing}} Beck with its username and password. Eiland-Hall wrote {{that he had made}} his point, and the act of filing the complaint exacerbated the situation for the complainant. Eiland-Hall <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> rationale for giving away the domain name, citing his desire to protect the applicability of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution had been satisfied.|$|E
5|$|Tharoor was in {{the news}} again for {{publicly}} criticising the new visa guidelines adopted by the Indian government {{in the wake of}} the gaps exposed by the arrest of 26/11 terror suspects, David Headley and Tahawwur Rana. For this he was criticised for breaking ranks with the official position of the government. He later met External Affairs Minister, S.M. Krishna, and <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> position on the issue. The rules were subsequently partly modified.|$|E

5|$|Ambassador Bishop clearly <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> {{rationale}} to {{the security}} detail, which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu. He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes {{got the impression that}} the US was intervening in the conflict. To this effect, he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict. The Marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling were able to take a shower and wash their clothes.|$|E
5|$|Another Canadian {{admirer of}} the painted turtle is Jon Montgomery, {{who won the}} 2010 Olympic gold medal in {{skeleton}} (a form of sled) racing, while wearing a painted turtle painting on the crown of his helmet, prominently visible when he slid downhill. Montgomery, who also iconically tattoed his chest with a maple-leaf, <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> visual promotion of the turtle, {{saying that he had}} assisted one to cross the road. BC Hydro referred to Montgomery's action when describing its own sponsorship of conservation research for the turtle in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Berg {{returned}} to Columbia {{after the season}} to continue working on his law degree. Despite White Sox owner Charles Comiskey offering him more money to come to spring training, Berg declined, and informed the White Sox {{that he would be}} reporting late for the 1927 season. Noel Dowling, a professor to whom Berg <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> situation, told Berg to take extra classes in the fall, and said that he would arrange with the dean a leave of absence from law school the following year, 1928.|$|E

5|$|In a July 2006 {{interview}} with Live-Metal.net, Santos stated {{the band was}} planning on recording a tribute EP of cover versions on old Bay Area music, including such bands as Sacred Reich, Death Angel, Exodus and Testament. The band is touring on The Sweet Revenge Tour with Kittie, It Dies Today and Bring Me The Horizon {{and by the end}} of the year Santos hopes to establish the band as a headlining act. On December 28, 2007 in a statement released to Blabbermouth.net, Mora <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> departure from the band was based on personal reasons.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy was {{released}} from his WWE contract on May 29, 2009, just four days after his return. In a March 2010 interview with wrestlezone.com, Ken Anderson <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> release was due to fellow wrestler Randy Orton complaining to WWE management that Anderson was reckless in the ring, citing a botched backdrop that caused Orton to land {{on his head and}} neck instead of on his back. Orton argued that this could potentially end his career. According to Anderson, Randy Orton also persuaded his friend and fellow wrestler John Cena to complain to Vince McMahon about Anderson's in ring performance, which prompted McMahon to release Kennedy from his contract.|$|E
5|$|Make Way for Ducklings, {{published}} in 1941, was McCloskey's second book {{and was the}} winner of the Caldecott Medal in 1942. In his acceptance speech, McCloskey <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> motivation for the story. While attending the Vesper George Art School in the early 1930s, he would spend time in the Public Garden feeding the ducks. After some time away, he returned to Boston to paint a mural and created a draft of the book after inspiration from May Massee. To better illustrate the story, McCloskey spent time at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, visited an ornithologist, and eventually brought home for models six ducklings to live in his studio at 280 West 12th Street, apartment 4C, in New York's West Village.|$|E

5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed {{were excluded from the}} report. Also, the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the torture of the four pardoned death row inmates. Among the final costs were $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were disappointed to learn that the statute of limitations meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days. Egan <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E
5|$|Seale {{suggests}} that Abu Nidal's childhood <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> personality, described as chaotic by Abu Iyad and as psychopathic by Issam Sartawi, the late Palestinian heart surgeon. His siblings' scorn, {{the loss of}} his father and his mother's removal from the family home when he was seven, then {{the loss of his}} home and status in the conflict with Israel, created a mental world of plots and counterplots, reflected in his tyrannical leadership of the ANO. Members' wives (it was an all-male group) were not allowed to befriend each another, and Abu Nidal's wife was expected to live in isolation without friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, in Brno (Czech Republic), he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2ncombinations where n {{is the number}} of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured Wilhelm Johannsen's distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{aspect of the}} book was Wright's method for dividing the meridian; an explanation of how he had constructed a table for the division; and the uses of this information for navigation. Essentially, the problem that occupied Wright was how to depict accurately a globe on a two-dimensional map according to the projection used by Gerardus Mercator in his map of 1569. Mercator's projection was advantageous for nautical purposes as it represented lines of constant true bearing or true course, known as loxodromes or rhumb lines, as straight lines. However, Mercator had not <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> method.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Triple H and Ric Flair began at WWE Homecoming, when Triple H {{returned}} to WWE television after {{an absence of}} three months. The two had been aligned since 2002, as members of Evolution, and were partners in a tag team match on the show. After they won the match, Triple H attacked Flair with a sledgehammer. The week after, Triple H <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> actions, saying that he realized Flair {{was no longer the}} legend he was, and he needed to stop Flair. Flair and Triple H met in a steel cage match at Taboo Tuesday, which Flair won. A Last Man Standing match was made between the two for Survivor Series.|$|E
5|$|As Zwingli {{was working}} on {{establishing}} these political alliances, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the Augsburg Diet to present their views {{so that he could}} make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, Memmingen, and Lindau produced the Tetrapolitan Confession. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the Burgrecht cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, Fidei ratio (Account of Faith) in which he <b>explained</b> <b>his</b> faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the Apostles' Creed. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, Johann Eck, counter-attacked with a publication, Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor.|$|E
