500|$|Markus and McFeely {{wanted to}} adapt Ed Brubaker's Winter Soldier storyline from the comics, which they {{described}} as [...] "the tone of Cap’s modern franchise", {{but it took}} the duo six months to convince themselves {{that they could do}} it. In the meantime, while thinking how to progress from the war film tone of The First Avenger, the writers settled on the conspiracy genre for the screenplay, and cited Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, and Marathon Man as influences, feeling it better conveyed Captain America's trust issues and contrasting values in the new world he was living in, with Markus saying, [...] "If you put that 1940s man into present day geo-politics <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> seem like a conspiracy. It's just going to seem dirty and underhanded and shifty, and people won't be telling the truth." [...] Three Days of the Condor in particular was used as the main source of the script structure, following the idea that the protagonist is being chased by a threat they, along with the audience, only discover halfway through the film.|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing the 2014 reissue of Extra Texture, for Paste magazine, Robert Ham views [...] "the desperate 'Grey Cloudy Lies'" [...] as a [...] " [...] when Harrison's focus returns", and a ballad that [...] "cut deep". Writing for vintagerock.com, Shawn Perry {{considers}} the track to be {{a highlight of}} [...] "a creative and introspective album that's aged well", and [...] "a song that, despite its solemn, down-trodden lyrics, resonates {{with a level of}} reflection that somehow makes you feel <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be OK". In his review for Classic Rock, Paul Trynka similarly opines that this and other [...] "confessional songs" [...] on Extra Texture have [...] "worn well". Trynka continues: [...] " [...] a dark exploration of the depression into which he'd sunk in 1974, after being mocked for his spiritual homilies. Today, when pop stars swig Cristal and flash their pecs on Instagram, we can appreciate the irony of Harrison being attacked for preaching enlightenment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fertility Hollis : A {{friend of}} Tender's. [...] She meets him at her dead brother Trevor's crypt. At first, Fertility {{says she is}} repulsed by him, but as the novel {{progresses}} the two grow close. [...] "Fertility" [...] is {{not her real name}} but a pseudonym she uses for her job, which is acting as a surrogate mother for couples who cannot conceive. Her job is fraudulent in that she is actually sterile and has never managed to carry a child for a client. Fertility has the psychic ability to predict the future; she knows when, where, how, and to whom <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen, which takes all the fun out of life for her. She strikes up a friendship with Tender and helps him throughout the novel because she believes he is the only person who can surprise her. It is Fertility who leads Tender to hijack the plane. She also tells him that there is a way for him to [...] "survive", but her meaning is ambiguous.|$|E

50|$|In March 2011, after a {{new health}} {{minister}} was appointed following a general election, Lynch went on radio {{to make the case}} that the a city centre location for the new hospital would be inaccessible and have parking difficulties. He said that the 'people who designed the M50, when that <b>was</b> agreed on, <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen outside of that' and described the city centre as a 'cul-de-sac'.

6000|$|All {{this was}} very {{unpleasant}} and made the club less social {{than it used to}} be in old days. There was an attempt that night to get up a game of cards; but Nidderdale would not play because he was offended with Dolly Longestaffe; and Miles Grendall was away in the country,--a fugitive from the face of Melmotte, and Carbury was in hiding at home with his countenance from top to bottom supported by plasters, and Montague in these days never went to the club. At the present moment he was again in Liverpool, having been summoned thither by Mr Ramsbottom. 'By George,' said Dolly, as he filled another pipe and ordered more brandy and water, 'I think <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come to an end. I do indeed. I never heard of such a thing before as a man being done in this way. And then Vossner has gone off, and it seems everybody is to pay just what he says they owed him. And now one can't even get up a game of cards. I feel as though there were no good in hoping that things would ever come right again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|If I {{thought my}} opinion was desired {{and would be}} {{properly}} revered, I should say that in my judgment that {{is as good a}} piece of carpentering as any of those eleven Commandment--experts could do with the material after all their practice. I notice only one doubtful place. [...] "Lead us not into temptation" [...] {{seems to me to be}} a very definite request, and that the new rendering turns the definite request into a definite assertion. I shall be glad to have that turned back to the old way and the marks of the Spiral Twist removed, or varnished over; then I shall be satisfied, and will do the best I can with what is left. At the same time, I do feel that the shrinkage in our spiritual assets is getting serious. First the Commandments, now the Prayer. I never expected to see these steady old reliable securities watered down to this. And this is not the whole of it. Last summer the Presbyterians extended the Calling and Election suffrage to nearly everybody entitled to salvation. They did not even stop there, but let out all the unbaptized American infants we had been accumulating for two hundred years and more. There are some that believe they would have let the Scotch ones out, too, if they could have done it. <b>Everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ruin; in no long time we shall have nothing left but the love of God.|$|E

Chief Scout Brunton asked Larson to look at Hillcourt's plan, and Larson reported back that it was the same camping-oriented skills content, just reordered and rewritten. Larson's plan for Wood Badge was approved and he moved ahead to begin testing the proposed changes.|$|R
