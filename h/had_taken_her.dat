5|$|It is {{said that}} Emperor Akbar (r. 15561605) who was enamored by Parveen's beauty <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> to his palace in Agra to be his courtesan.

5|$|Hunter Gordon Walker (Brown), who {{believes}} that Sam Winchester (Padalecki) will one day turn evil and become involved in a demonic war against humanity, escapes from prison. He tracks down Bela Talbot (Cohan)—a thief and frequent thorn in the Winchesters' sides—and threatens to kill her unless she reveals {{the location of the}} brothers. She refuses at first, but eventually acquiesces in exchange for a priceless mojo bag. Meanwhile, Sam and Dean (Ackles) capture the vampire Lucy (McNab), who has previously taken two victims. They interrogate her, and discover that another vampire named Dixon spiked her drink with his own blood at a club, transforming her. Dixon <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> back to his home, but she escaped to feed. Lucy, still believing that she has only been drugged, is then killed by Dean, as there is no known cure for vampirism.|$|E

25|$|In 1803, at the {{outbreak}} of the Napoleonic Wars, Hazard carried despatches for the Channel Fleet and then operated as part of the blockade squadron off Northern Spain. While she was on the blockade a rumour circulated first that four ships of the line, and then that four French frigates, had captured Hazard and that the French <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> into service. However, the rumors turned out to be mistaken. Hazard was with the fleet under Admiral the Honourable William Cornwallis when Minotaur captured the French frigate Franchise on 28 May 1803.|$|E

She achieved a milestone on 27 July 2012, when she departed Pascagoula on her 300th research cruise, an annual assessment of red snapper and shark populations in the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic Ocean. By that time, she had logged 10,000 days at sea and more than 1,000,000 nautical miles (1,850,000km), and her projects <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> {{as far south as}} the Amazon River delta in Brazil and as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts.|$|E

Without having recovered from the death of Sigismund, the Crown Princess was devastated with the loss of another child, especially since he died of the same disease that <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> sister Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine and her niece, Princess Marie just a few months earlier. Victoria, however, tried to keep her suffering secret because, except for her husband, no other family member was willing to comfort her.|$|E
25|$|The USS Constitution {{captured}} and destroyed Pictou on 14 February 1814, windward of Barbados. At {{this time the}} ship was escorting the armed merchant Lovely Ann from Bermuda to Surinam.

A few hours before, Constitution had already captured Lovely Ann and <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> as a prize. Captain Stewart decided to keep the merchant vessel but commanded that Pictou be destroyed. Pictou was one of five British warships that Constitution captured or destroyed during the war.|$|E
25|$|Leon and Alexandra soon {{separated}} and divorced, but maintained a friendly relationship. Their children were later raised by Trotsky's parents in Ukraine. Both daughters married and Zinaida had children, but the daughters died before their parents. Nina Nevelson died from tuberculosis, cared for {{in her last}} months by her older sister. Zinaida Volkova died after following her father into exile in Berlin. She <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> son by her second marriage, and left her daughter in Russia. Suffering also from tuberculosis, then a fatal disease, and depression, Volkova committed suicide.

Zhou came upon the sixteen-year-old Sun crying outside of the Eighth Route Army Liaison Office {{because she had been}} refused permission to travel to Yan'an, due to her youth and lack of political connections. After Zhou befriended and adopted her as his daughter, Sun was able to travel to Yan'an. She pursued a career in acting and direction, and later became the first female director of spoken drama (huaju) in the PRC.|$|E
25|$|Small {{and highly}} agile {{paramilitary}} mobile teams {{spread out over}} the countryside to meet with locals and gather information about the Taliban and al-Qa'ida. During that time, one of the teams was approached in a village and asked by a young man for help in retrieving his teenage sister. He explained that a senior Taliban official <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> as a wife and had sharply restricted the time she could spend with her family. The team gave the man a small hand-held tracking device to pass along to his sister, with instructions for her to activate it when the Taliban leader returned home. The team responded to her emergency signal, capturing the senior Taliban official and rescuing the sister. The siblings' tearful reunion left the team {{at a loss for}} words—a rarity for the normally loud warriors of CIA's Special Activities Division.|$|E
25|$|Entreprenante next saw {{action on}} 25 April. Williams <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> into Málaga Bay under a {{flag of truce}} to deliver {{a letter to the}} Governor, General Sabastini. Whilst on this duty, the British spotted two French privateers coming into the harbour, escorting a prize. (The privateers were two of the vessels that Entreprenante had repulsed in December 1810.) Williams {{collected}} a reply from the Governor for Lieutenant-General Colin Campbell at Gibraltar, and Entreprenante made her way out of the harbour. One privateer had already anchored off the mole, but the other and the prize were still under way. Williams closed on the privateer that was still sailing and brought her to battle. After a sharp engagement lasting 15 minutes, Entreprenante drove her on shore, severely hulled. She had been armed with six guns and had a crew of 50 men.|$|E

25|$|While she {{was still}} an infant, Helen's father died from influenza. Helen was raised by her mother, who often blamed her husband's death on the birth of Helen. She {{believed}} that God <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> husband because she had wished so much for a baby girl. Helen had three older brothers: Harry, Ed, and Sam. The family relocated to Brooklyn when Helen was in her early teenage years. Her mother married a house painter, a man that Helen disliked. Soon, Helen's mother and stepfather turned the family's home into a brothel. At age 14, Helen was nearly raped by her stepfather. Helen defended herself with a kitchen knife, injuring him. Following this, she was permitted by her mother {{to live with her}} piano teacher, Honey Silverman, and her family. While teaching her piano, Honey noticed Helen's singing ability and encouraged her to focus on singing instead. Anxious to find a career in singing, Helen {{dropped out of high school}} to pursue her dream.|$|E
25|$|Aged 17, {{she agreed}} to marry Nikifor Vladimirovich Blavatsky, {{a man in his}} forties who worked as Vice Governor of Erivan Province. Her reasons for doing so were unclear, {{although}} she later claimed that she was attracted by his belief in magic. Although she tried to back out shortly before the wedding ceremony, the marriage took place on 7 July 1849. Moving with him to the Sardar Palace, she made repeated unsuccessful attempts to escape and return to her family in Tiflis, to which he eventually relented. The family sent her, accompanied by a servant and maid, to Odessa to meet her father, who planned to return to Saint Petersburg with her. The escorts accompanied her to Poti and then Kerch, intending to continue with her to Odessa. Blavatsky claimed that, fleeing her escorts and bribing the captain of the ship that <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> to Kerch, she reached Constantinople. This marked the start of nine years spent traveling the world, possibly financed by her father.|$|E
25|$|The steam {{turbines}} were plagued with problems {{from the time}} the ship first entered service and, despite being technically advanced and fuel-efficient in 1968, her consumption of 600 tons of fuel oil every twenty four hours was more than expected for such a ship by the 1980s. After seventeen years of service the availability of spare parts was becoming difficult due to the outdated design of the boilers and turbines, and Cunard decided that the options were to either do nothing {{for the remainder of the}} ship's life, re-configure the existing engines, or re-engine the vessel with a more efficient diesel-electric powerplant. Ultimately it was decided to replace the engines, as it was calculated that the savings in fuel costs and maintenance would pay for themselves over four years, and give the vessel a minimum of another twenty years of service, whereas the other options would only provide short-term relief. Her {{steam turbines}} <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> to a record breaking total of 2,622,858 miles in 18 years.|$|E
