5|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, No. 1 engine {{on the port}} wing developed a fuel leak. The flight crew responded by shutting down the engine and feathering its propeller. The flight crew declared an emergency and requested a blind approach to RAF Abingdon. The controller alerted emergency services on the ground. A short time later, cockpit instruments alerted the flight crew to a large loss of fuel from No. 2 fuel tank, the second of four such tanks in the port wing. In an effort to stop the leak, the crew de-activated the fuel cocks and boosters <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 2 tank, but left them on <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 1 tank. As the Beverley turned on to final approach for RAF Abingdon the crew attempted to increase power from the remaining three Bristol Centaurus engines but No. 2 engine – also on the port wing – failed to respond and {{the aircraft}} began to lose speed and height.|$|E

5|$|A pre-Le Mans testing day {{was held}} at the circuit on 31 May, {{involving}} all 56 entries as well as the KCMG Oreca-Nissan, Ibañez Oreca-Nissan, Gulf Racing Porsche, and Formula Racing Ferrari reserve entries. Two LMP3 class Ginetta vehicles and two additional AF Corse Ferrari cars also participated. The two four-hour sessions were held under mixed weather conditions as rain swept through the area several times. Neel Jani set the fastest time in the early session with a three minutes and 21.945 seconds <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 18 Porsche, but Hartley improved to a three minutes and 21.061 seconds in the sister No. 17 Porsche. Audi's best time was a three minutes and 22.307 seconds for Marco Bonanomi in the No. 9 car, while Toyota could only muster a three minutes and 25.321 seconds lap. Laurens Vanthoor was the fastest LMP2 driver in the No. 34 OAK Ligier-Honda. Darren Turner's No. 97 Aston Martin was quickest in LMGTE Pro while Pedro Lamy helped Aston Martin also lead in LMGTE Am. The session served as the first appearance for the trio of Nissan GT-R LM Nismo amongst its World Endurance Championship competitors, although the cars were not on pace with the LMP1 field.|$|E
5|$|In the 2009 off-season, the Trail Blazers traded the No. 24 pick to Dallas <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 22 {{pick and}} {{selected}} Víctor Claver. They also selected Villanova forward Dante Cunningham with the No. 33 pick, Jon Brockman and guard Patrick Mills. Brockman {{was traded to}} the Kings in exchange for No. 31 pick Jeff Pendergraph. Free agent Channing Frye signed with the Phoenix Suns and Sergio Rodríguez {{was traded to the}} Kings. The Blazers attempted to sign free agent small forward Hedo Türkoğlu, who led the Orlando Magic to the 2009 NBA Finals, but after a verbal agreement he decided to sign with the Toronto Raptors. The Blazers then attempted to sign restricted free agent Paul Millsap; however, their offer was matched by the Utah Jazz. On July 24, 2009, the Trail Blazers signed point guard Andre Miller.|$|E
5|$|Initial weather {{forecasts}} predicted rain for the Thursday qualifying sessions, but {{it failed}} to materialise. The teams had two full sessions of clear but hot and humid conditions. Nick Tandy's Porsche led the session with a three minutes and 18.862 seconds lap, but remained in third position on the provisional grid. Audi No. 7 {{was the only other}} car to put in an improved lap time amongst the top ten cars. TDS Racing was the fastest LMP2 car in the session with a three minutes and 40.441 seconds yet still over two seconds behind the pole time of KCMG. The LMGTE categories also remained much the same, as Aston Martin still occupied the top four qualifying positions. Twice the session was stopped for heavy accidents, first <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 55 AF Corse Ferrari of Duncan Cameron who became stuck in a gravel trap for about fifteen minutes. The second stoppage occurred when Jan Magnussen suffered a mechanical failure in his No. 63 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R and hit the barriers twice in the Porsche Curves. Repairs to the barriers forced the cancellation of the remainder of the session, although half an hour was added to the final qualifying session. Magnussen was transported to the track's medical centre for a check-up and later released by the race organiser's medical staff. The Corvette was unable to be repaired and the team was forced to withdraw from the race because they did not bring a spare chassis to Le Mans.|$|E

5|$|The {{match was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} played on Wednesday 23 May at Worcestershire's New Road ground in Worcester, but no play was possible due to bad weather, and so the match {{was moved to the}} following day. The same thing happened in Watford, where Glamorgan and the Minor Counties were due to be playing. Although it was overcast and slightly wet the next morning, play started on time. Rose won the toss for Somerset, and chose to bat first. The Somerset captain himself opened the batting, alongside Peter Denning. Worcestershire's West Indian bowler, Vanburn Holder, bowled the first over. Holder bowled seven deliveries—six denoted a normal over, but he had to bowl one extra due to a no ball—all to Rose, who did not play any scoring shots, and declared Somerset's innings complete {{at the end of the}} over. Somerset had scored just one run, which they were awarded <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>no</b> ball, and Worcestershire only needed to score two to win. The players left the field for the ten-minute break between innings, and when they returned Glenn Turner and Alan Ormrod were the batsmen. Colin Dredge bowled the first over for Somerset, and Turner scored one run from it. Keith Jennings bowled the second over, and Turner scored another single from the fourth delivery to grant Worcestershire the victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{second session}} started several minutes late {{due to the}} damp {{conditions}} from the earlier rain. A red flag briefly came out <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 5 Swiss Spirit Lola {{a few minutes after}} the session began due to the car being stopped {{at the side of the}} track. Although the track was drying, it was not until the last half hour that teams were able to improve on their first session times. The No. 2 Audi and No. 8 Peugeot swapped the pole position multiple times before the session ended with the No. 8 Peugeot claiming the top position on the final lap of the session with a time of 3:26.344. In GT1 the No. 008 Larbre Aston Martin took the class lead on the final lap with a 3:50.761. The LMP2 and GT2 classes saw very little improvement; the class leading teams remained the same.|$|E
