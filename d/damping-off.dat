25|$|Springtails {{are well}} known as pests of some {{agricultural}} crops. Sminthurus viridis, the lucerne flea, {{has been shown to}} cause severe damage to agricultural crops, and is considered as a pest in Australia. Onychiuridae are also known to feed on tubers and to damage them to some extent. However, by their capacity to carry spores of mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhiza-helper bacteria on their tegument, soil springtails play a positive role in the establishment of plant-fungal symbioses and thus are beneficial to agriculture. They also contribute to controlling plant fungal diseases through their active consumption of mycelia and spores of <b>damping-off</b> and pathogenic fungi. It has been suggested that they could be reared to be used for the control of pathogenic fungi in greenhouses and other indoor cultures.|$|E
2500|$|Cucumeropsis mannii is {{reported}} to be pest and disease free. [...] Primary issues include the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina which attacks the roots and lower stems of the crop causing <b>damping-off</b> disease. The fruit fly species Dacus punctifrons may also attack the fruit of this plant. The fruit generally rots due to the existence of larvae. Halticus tibialis is a flea hopper similar to an aphid and may also cause problems for egusi-itoo crops, often killing the leaves of the plant by sucking out sap. After harvesting many beetle species including the red flour beetle and the cigarette beetle may feed on seeds which are not properly stored in air-tight containers [...] Cucumeropsis mannii provides ground cover, effectively suppressing weeds. Intercropping with sorghum, cassava, coffee, cotton, maize, or banana crops can reduce weedings during the growing season from 2-3 to just one. This has significant positive effects on the female farmer who spends the majority of her time weeding.|$|E
50|$|The fungus phytophthora blight causes <b>damping-off,</b> root rot, stem rot, stem girdling, {{and fruit}} rot. <b>Damping-off</b> happens in young plants by wilting and death. The spots on {{established}} plants {{start out as}} white, water-soaked lesions at the fruit and branch scars. These spots enlarge and eventually cause death. The most dangerous feature of the disease is the infection of the fruit which may be toxic to consumers. The roots can also be severely and rapidly infected, causing the plant to brown and wilt away, collapsing within days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Damping-Off</b> is {{a disease}} in {{temperate}} areas caused by soil inhabiting oomycetes like Phytophthora cactorum and Pythium spp. The disease concerns seedlings, which often collapse and die.|$|E

50|$|F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis attacks {{muskmelon}} and cantaloupe. It causes <b>damping-off</b> in seedlings {{and causes}} chlorosis, stunting and wilting in old plants. Necrotic streaks can {{appear on the}} stems.|$|E
5000|$|Validamycin is an {{antibiotic}} and fungicide produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus. It {{is used as}} an inhibitor of trehalase. [...] It {{is used for the}} control of sheath blight of rice and <b>damping-off</b> of cucumbers.|$|E
50|$|General Symptoms: General {{symptoms}} on the solanaceous {{crops and}} cucurbits include seed rot and seedling blight which discolors {{the roots and}} causes seedlings to topple over. Preemergence and postemergence <b>damping-off</b> are also possible symptoms that may occur.|$|E
50|$|Damping off (or <b>damping-off)</b> is a horticultural {{disease or}} condition, {{caused by a}} number of {{different}} pathogens that kill or weaken seeds or seedlings before or after they germinate. It is most prevalent in wet and cool conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{diseases}} affecting S. rostrata are <b>damping-off</b> caused by Pythium spp. and Rhizoctonia spp., Cercospora leafspot caused by Cercospora spp., and leaf mosaic virus. For information on control methods go to: [...] Cercospora leafspot {{can be controlled}} with copper oxychloride, Captan, Maneb, Zineb and Ziram.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{symptoms}} caused by A. euteiches {{can be difficult}} to distinguish from symptoms caused by other root-infecting plant pathogens (such as Pythium, Rhizoctonia, and Fusarium), there are some distinct differences. Aphanomyces root rot rarely results in seed rot and/or pre-emergent <b>damping-off.</b> The characteristic lesions caused by the different pathogens also differ. Fusarium infection results in black or reddish vascular tissue, and Rhizoctonia infection results in sunken, cankerous lesions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{potential}} of Lysobacter species as biological control agents for plant diseases {{has been recognized}} recently. Among L. enzymogenes strains, C3 is the most thoroughly characterized strain at both the molecular and biological levels. The ecological versatility of the strain is reflected by the range of diseases {{it is able to}} control, as well as the various plant hosts and plant parts it is capable of colonizing. For example, L. enzymogenes strain C3 (erroneously identified as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) has been reported to control foliar diseases such as leaf spot of tall fescue caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana, bean rust caused by Uromyces appendiculatus [...] and Fusarium head blight of wheat. L. enzymogenes strain C3 also has been reported to suppress soilborne diseases, such as brown patch in turfgrass caused by Rhizoctonia solani, the seedling disease Pythium <b>damping-off</b> of sugarbeet [...] and summer patch disease of Kentucky bluegrass caused by the root-infecting Magnaporthe poae. Lysobacter sp. SB-K88 has been found to suppress <b>damping-off</b> disease in sugar beet and spinach through antibiosis and characteristic root colonization in perpendicular fashion Islam et al. (2005).|$|E
50|$|A major growth {{area for}} biopesticides {{is in the}} area of seed {{treatments}} and soil amendments. Fungicidal and biofungicidal seed treatments are used to control soil borne fungal pathogens that cause seed rots, <b>damping-off,</b> root rot and seedling blights. They {{can also be used to}} control internal seed-borne fungal pathogens as well as fungal pathogens that are on the surface of the seed. Many biofungicidal products also show capacities to stimulate plant host defence and other physiological processes that can make treated crops more resistant to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses.|$|E

His MS and PhD theses were involved in understanding cell biology of flagellar motility, taxis, viability and differentiation of zoospores of the oomycete phytopathogens when interacting with host and nonhost plant secondary metabolites. He elucidated mechanisms of <b>damping-off</b> disease control in spinach and sugar beet by Lysobacter sp. SB-K88. He has awarded a fellowship (2003-2005) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) to work on ‘signaling systems between root and rhizoplane microorganisms including oomycetes and their agricultural usage’ at the said laboratory of Hokkaido University.|$|E
50|$|Numerous plant pathologists {{have noted}} F. circinatum {{as a serious}} threat to the pine tree species. Due to the high tree {{mortality}} rate, reduced growth, and degradation of wood quality, the economic and ecological importance are greatly affected by this disease. Not only can the spread of infection go from branch to branch, but also infect pine seeds, leading to <b>damping-off</b> of younger seedlings and resulting in death from the fungal infection. The environmental interactions that take place to favor the spread and development of this disease play a large role in transmission. Factors such as soil nutrient ratio, abiotic stressors, air pollution, temperature, and humidity can all contribute to the spread of this disease.|$|E
5000|$|Pythium ultimum is a plant pathogen. It {{causes the}} <b>damping-off</b> and root rot {{diseases}} {{of hundreds of}} diverse plant hosts including corn, soybean, potato, wheat, fir, and many ornamental species. [...] P. ultimum belongs to the peronosporalean lineage of oomycetes, along with other important plant pathogens such as Phytophthora spp. and many genera of downy mildews. Py. ultimum is a frequent inhabitant of fields, freshwater ponds, and decomposing vegetation in most areas of the world. Contributing to the widespread distribution and persistence of Py. ultimum {{is its ability to}} grow saprotrophically in soil and plant residue. This trait is also exhibited by most Pythium spp. but not by the related Phytophthora spp., which can only colonize living plant hosts.|$|E
5000|$|... == Hosts and {{symptoms}} == The fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum affects {{a wide variety}} of hosts of any age. Tomato, tobacco, legumes, cucurbits, sweet potatoes and banana {{are a few of the}} most susceptible plants, but it will also infect other herbaceous plants. Fusarium oxysporum generally produces symptoms such as wilting, chlorosis, necrosis, premature leaf drop, browning of the vascular system, stunting, and <b>damping-off.</b> The most important of these is vascular wilt. [...] Fusarium wilt starts out looking like vein clearing on the younger leaves and drooping of the older lower leaves, followed by stunting of the plant, yellowing of the lower leaves, defoliation, marginal necrosis and death of the plant. On older plants, symptoms are more distinct between the blossoming and fruit maturation stages.|$|E

50|$|Symptoms of A. dauci appear {{first as}} greenish-brown, then water-soaked, and finally {{necrotic}} lesions 8-10 days following an infection event. These lesions {{will appear on}} carrot leaflets and petioles, and have a characteristic chlorotic, yellow halo. The lesions can be irregularly shaped, and will often appear on older leaves first. Older leaves are the most susceptible to infection; when approximately 40% of the leaf surface area has become infected by Alternaria dauci, the leaf will completely yellow, collapse, and die. It is during extended conditions of warm, moist weather that lesions can coalesce and cause entire tops of carrot plants to die off, a phenomenon that is sometimes mistaken for frost damage. The symptoms of this disease are also commonly confused with Cercospora Leaf Blight of carrots as well as bacterial blight, and microscopic analysis is frequently needed to accurately diagnose the pathogen. A. dauci produces characteristically dark to olive-brown hyphae and elongated conidiophores, with conidia typically borne singly. Petiole infection can also occur without any lesion development on leaflets, and A. dauci can additionally result in <b>damping-off</b> of seedlings, seed stalk blight, and inflorescence infections. These symptoms can significantly reduce yield due to lost photosynthetic activity, prevention of mechanical harvest, and infection of commercial carrot seeds.|$|E

40|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{test was}} conducted in 2011 and 2012 growing seasons at Giza Agricultural Research Station to evaluate the reaction of six cotton genotypes to <b>damping-off</b> incited by Fusarium oxysporum. <b>Damping-off</b> incidence on the genotypes ranged from 70 - 88 %. In general, the genotypes could be divided into highly susceptible, susceptible, and moderately susceptible. Data for <b>damping-off</b> incidence and level or activity of some biochemical components (phenols, peroxidase, and polyphenoloxidase) were entered into a computerized linear regression analysis. The analysis contrasted seven predictive models by using the biochemical components, singly or in combination, as biochemical predictors.

40|$|<b>Damping-off</b> is {{a disease}} {{that leads to the}} decay of germinating seeds and young seedlings, which {{represents}} for farmers {{one of the most important}} yield constraints both in nurseries and fields. As for other biotic stresses, conventional fungicides are widely used to manage this disease, with two major consequences. On the one hand, fungicide overuse threatens the human health and causes ecological concerns. On the other hand, this practice has led to the emergence of pesticide-resistant microorganisms in the environment. Thus, there are increasing concerns to develop sustainable and durable <b>damping-off</b> management strategies that are less reliant on conventional pesticides. Achieving such a goal requires a better knowledge of pathogen biology and disease epidemiology in order to facilitate the decision-making process. It also demands using all available non-chemical tools that can be adapted to regional and specific production situations. However, this still is not the case and major knowledge gaps must be filled. Here, we review up to 300 articles of the <b>damping-off</b> literature in order to highlight major knowledge gaps and identify future research priorities. The major findings are (i) <b>damping-off</b> is an emerging disease worldwide, which affects all agricultural and forestry crops, both in nurseries and fields; (ii) over a dozen of soil-borne fungi and fungus-like organisms are a cause of <b>damping-off</b> but only a few of them are frequently associated with the disease; (iii) <b>damping-off</b> may affect from 5 to 80 % of the seedlings, thereby inducing heavy economic consequences for farmers; (iv) a lot of research efforts have been made in recent years to develop biocontrol solutions for <b>damping-off</b> and there are interesting future perspectives; and (v) <b>damping-off</b> management requires an integrated pest management (IPM) approach combining both preventive and curative tactics and strategies. Given the complex nature of <b>damping-off</b> and the numerous factors involved in its occurrence, we recommend further research on critical niches of complexity, such as seeds, seedbed, associated microbes and their interfaces, using novel and robust experimental and modeling approaches based on five research priorities described in this paper...|$|E
