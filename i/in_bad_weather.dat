5|$|YA-10B Night/Adverse Weather: Two-seat {{experimental}} prototype, {{for work}} {{at night and}} <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather.</b> The one YA-10B prototype was converted from an A-10A.|$|E
5|$|In August 1997, {{the first}} {{production}} laser {{adaptive cruise control}} on a Toyota vehicle was introduced on the Celsior version (Japan only) It controlled speed only through throttle control and downshifting, but did not apply the brakes. Because of laser technology limitations, it deactivated <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{prototype}} {{crashed on}} 14 May 1946 in Warsaw <b>in</b> a <b>bad</b> <b>weather,</b> its pilot, who was Stankiewicz himself, survived.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 April, three Blenheims of the Yugoslav 8th Bomber Regiment took off from Rovine to bomb the railway {{junction}} at Feldbach, but became disoriented <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather.</b> Only one aircraft found a target in Austria, bombing a bridge and road near Steyr before continuing on to Wiener Neustadt where it was hit by anti-aircraft fire and made an emergency landing.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} US market Lexus with {{adaptive}} cruise control (called Dynamic Laser Cruise Control). It employed a lidar sensor and (unlike the laser ACC introduced in 1997 on the Celsior) was able to activate brakes for deceleration. However, because of laser technology limitations, it would deactivate <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tall eucalypts {{that are}} {{emergent}} over other trees in wooded areas are selected for roosting sites. It {{is here that}} the cockatoos rest for the night, and also rest to shelter from {{the heat of the}} day. They often socialise before dusk, engaging in preening, feeding young, and flying acrobatically. Flocks will return to roost earlier <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>In</b> 1954, <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> {{forced a}} light plane {{to land on}} the {{hospital}} property. Robert S. Miller was the pilot of the plane.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 2015, <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> {{caused the}} Tour organisers {{to declare the}} overall {{classification}} neutralised upon entry to the Champs-Élysées, 70 km before the stage finished.|$|R

5|$|Alvarez {{spent the}} summer of 1943 in England testing GCA, landing planes {{returning}} from battle <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather,</b> and also training the British {{in the use of}} the system. While there he encountered the young Arthur C. Clarke, who was an RAF radar technician. Clarke subsequently used his experiences at the radar research station as the basis for his novel Glide Path, which contains a thinly disguised version of Alvarez. Clarke and Alvarez developed a long-term friendship.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May, while {{rounding}} {{the southern tip}} of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less accurate navigation methods. Navigation via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation.|$|E
5|$|Originally the {{operation}} was due to begin on January 1, but poor ice conditions on the Neva caused the offensive to be delayed until January 10–12. A number of measures were taken to prevent the details of {{the operation}} being revealed to the Germans. Only a limited number of senior officers were involved in the planning, all redeployments took place <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> or at night and simulated attack preparations were made elsewhere to confuse the German side.|$|E
5000|$|Melbourne {{was one of}} {{seventeen}} sites equipped with FIDO fog dispersant system. This made the airfield a popular diversion for other squadrons returning from operations to Yorkshire <b>in</b> extreme <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> conditions.|$|R
25|$|Rome lost 700 ships (<b>in</b> part to <b>bad</b> <b>weather)</b> with {{an unknown}} number of crew deaths.|$|R
50|$|The {{disarmed}} soldiers marched eastward to Portsmouth <b>in</b> continuing <b>bad</b> <b>weather,</b> being continually robbed {{and threatened}} by local people. About 1,000 died of exposure and hunger, and 1,000 more deserted or fell sick.|$|R
5|$|Another {{criticism}} from locomotive crews concerned the exposed cab <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather,</b> which necessitated {{the installation of}} a tarpaulin sheet over {{the rear of the}} cab and the front of the tender, restricting rearward vision. The 1921 Coal Miners’ strike meant that two class members (Nos.737 and 739) were converted to oil-burning. One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed, and both were reverted to coal firing {{by the end of the}} year. When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s, and it fell to his successor to improve the class.|$|E
5|$|Because of the ship's high profile, {{there were}} {{concerns}} about her stability <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> {{as she had}} {{a significant amount of}} weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft guns. To increase her stability, two lateral tanks were fitted with a pressurized butterfly valve connecting them so that water could flow between the tanks to counter her rolling motion. On trials in 1933, the system was judged successful as it deadened the ship's roll by 37-65%. However, maintenance of the system proved to be problematic as the tanks were difficult to access.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{hydroelectricity}} {{works very}} well in conjunction with solar power, water can be held back or released from a reservoir behind a dam as required. Where a suitable river is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again. However, this cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power.|$|E
5000|$|The writer Roger St Pierre said of Gaul <b>in</b> the <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> of the 1956 Giro d'Italia, {{in which}} a stage through the Dolomites ended with the 12 km climb of Monte Bondone: ...|$|R

50|$|Depending on the weather, up to 100,000 {{participants}} (in 2005) attend, either cycling or walking. <b>In</b> 2008, <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> resulted <b>in</b> {{the lower}} attendance number of 58,000. The 2010 edition saw more than 80,000 participants.|$|R
5|$|Hood was {{initially}} fitted with flying-off platforms mounted {{on top of}} 'B' and 'X' turrets, from which Fairey Flycatchers could launch. During her 1929–31 refit, the platform was removed from 'X' turret and a trainable, folding catapult was installed on her quarterdeck, along with a crane to recover a seaplane. She embarked a Fairey IIIF from No. 444 Flight of the Royal Air Force. During the 1932 West Indies cruise, the catapult proved {{to be difficult to}} operate in anything but a calm sea, as it was frequently awash <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather.</b> The catapult and crane were removed in 1932, along with the flying-off platform on 'B' turret.|$|E
5|$|In September 1956, the RAF {{received}} its first Vulcan B.1, XA897, which immediately embarked upon a round-the-world tour. The tour {{was to be}} an important demonstration of the range and capabilities of the aircraft, but it also had other benefits in the form of conducting goodwill visits in various countries; in later life Vulcans routinely visited various nations and distant parts of the former British Empire as a show of support and military protection. This first tour, however, was struck by misfortune; on 1 October 1956, while landing <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> at London Heathrow Airport at the completion of the world tour, XA897 was destroyed in a fatal accident.|$|E
5|$|On average, {{just over}} 50% of {{breeding}} pairs {{are successful in}} producing at least one fledged young from a nest, with early breeding and low population density being factors increasing success. In the UK, more than 50% of the failures are due to predation and about 30% result from food shortages <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather.</b> The annual survival rate is about 50% for adults and 26% for juveniles in their first year. The typical lifespan is two years, but a bird in Sweden lived to tenyears and twomonths Much greater ages, up to 24years, have been recorded in captive garden warblers.|$|E

50|$|Departure {{north for}} Papua New Guinea took Cythera to Gladstone and while {{anchored}} behind Heron Island, <b>in</b> more <b>bad</b> <b>weather,</b> raising the anchor created an accident for the crewman, Bob. Peter motored the ship 90 miles West, to Rockhampton for the crewman's hospital needs.|$|R
50|$|Maj Jayal {{organised}} {{an expedition}} to Nanda Devi <b>in</b> 1957. <b>Bad</b> <b>weather</b> thwarted the expedition but Jayal, never one to give up, went next to the Karakoram where he conquered Saken (24,130 ft) and Sakang (24,150 ft), the third highest peak in the Karakoram range.|$|R
5|$|Taiwan (Republic of China) {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with the U.S. to purchase 30 AH-64Es with weapons, and associated equipment in June 2011. On 5 November 2013, Taiwan received the first 6 AH-64s. On 25 April 2014, a Taiwanese AH-64E crashed into a three-story building during a training flight <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> conditions, the first airframe loss of an AH-64E. An investigation ruled out mechanical failure and concluded human error as responsible, that the pilots descended too fast through clouds at low altitude without checking flight panels to maintain adequate height; the Army responded by stepping up simulator training for pilots. In October 2014, the fifth and final batch of AH-64Es was delivered to Taiwan, completing the order.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair was not {{convinced}} when {{the class was}} being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship, especially at night or <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> that would prevent air operations. Thus the carriers' design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55-caliber Mk 9 eight-inch guns in four twin gun turrets. These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side, two before the superstructure, and two behind the funnel, numbered I to IV from bow to stern. In theory the guns could fire to both sides, but {{it is probable that}} firing them to port would have damaged the flight deck. They could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +41°.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift {{is found}} {{in a wide range}} of climatic zones and habitats. It breeds in {{sheltered}} locations such as caves, natural rock crevices or under the roofs of houses. The nest is a half-cup of dry grass and other fine material that is gathered in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a vertical surface. The two or three white eggs are incubated for about seventeen days to hatching. Subsequently, the chicks have a long but variable period in the nest before they are fully fledged. When the parents cannot find sufficient food <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>weather,</b> the young can survive for days without being fed by metabolising body fat.|$|E
50|$|In 1853, balloonist M. Louis Deschamps {{was killed}} during his 120th {{flight from the}} Arena of Nîmes. <b>Bad</b> <b>weather</b> had already forced the mayor to call off a {{parachute}} performance, but the balloon took off as planned and got caught <b>in</b> the <b>bad</b> <b>weather.</b> Deschamps was thrown from the basket and the balloon went down {{about half a mile}} further.|$|R
