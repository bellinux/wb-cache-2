Diesel fuel however, was superior in terms of specific fuel consumption and brake mean effective pressure. The blends would be suitable as fuel for an engine operating within a speed range of 1600 - 1930 rpm.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the long-term effects of}} total and partial replacement of dietary fish meal (FM) by a mixture of agricultural products on sperm quality of African catfish Clarias gariepinus. Four isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were formulated containing graded levels of either 50 % FM and maize meal (diet 1); 25 % FM mixed with crude sunflower oil cake (SFOC) and bean meal (BM) (diet 2); 12. 5 % FM mixed with sunflower oil cake, BM and <b>ground</b> <b>nut</b> <b>oil</b> cake (GOC) (diet 3) and 0 % FM mixed with de-hulled sunflower oil cake (SFOCD), BM and <b>ground</b> <b>nut</b> <b>oil</b> cake (diet 4). Gonadosomatic index (GSI), sperm quality, plasma sex steroids (11 -keto testosterone [11 -KT]; testosterone [T]; estradiol- 17 beta [E 2]) were evaluated on 10 to 24 fish fed on each diet. Sperm quality was assessed using computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Total replacement of fish meal by plant products markedly increased sperm volume, spermatocrit, spermatozoa integrity, and sperm motility. Fish fed diet 3 (12. 5 % fish meal) provided intermediate results on sperm quality whereas the lowest values were obtained in fish fed diets 1 and 2. In fish fed 0 % fish meal (diet 4), androgen levels were higher and estrogen levels were lower than in fish fed fish meal diets. Based on dietary lipid and fatty acid analyses, these results suggest a positive impact of short chain n- 6 fatty acids on androgen synthesis and sperm quality. In conclusion, a combination of <b>ground</b> <b>nut</b> <b>oil</b> cake, bean meal and sunflower oil cake (preferably when the sunflower is dehulled) in African catfish diet improves the sperm quality...|$|E

Thrombosis is a serious event in the arterial diseases and a major cause in the development of myocardial infarction, stroke and venous thrombo-embolism which justify prominent morbidity and mortality rate. The knowledge of molecular and cellular mechanism of the formation of thrombus has developed considerably in the recent studies by using different in-vitro and in-vivo models of diseases. P. gerardiana <b>nut</b> <b>oil</b> has been reported to possess anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-septic, anti-neuralgic, diuretic, expectorant, hypertensive properties. However, hardly, any data is available regarding effects of <b>nut</b> <b>oil</b> on platelet function. In this study, fibrinolytic activity and effect on platelet aggregation were investigated. Method: P. gerardiana <b>nut</b> <b>oil</b> was extracted by using n-Hexane and then concentrated by rotary evaporator.
