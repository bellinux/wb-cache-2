40|$|This paper applies Hofstede’s {{cultural}} dimensions {{into the}} shipping industry and analyzes the culture effects on vessel detention. All ships {{have their own}} nationality but the <b>flag</b> <b>control</b> is manageably sophisticated. Substandard ships are aware of high risks, and quality control of ships {{is critical to the}} maritime safety and security. It has been proved that the detention rate depends on the flag of registry together with ship age, inspecting authority, type of ship, and recognized organization influencing. Previous research has focused on the performance of individual flag of registry in terms of casualty and detention rate. This study considers the collective characteristics of flags according to culture effects and their influences on ship quality. Based on Hofstede’s five‐dimension culture theory, we map the flag states on culture dimensions. From 12, 635 detention records of the Tokyo MOU region from 2000 to 2009, we determine the effect of culture dimensions against the vessel detention. The findings can be summarised in two aspects. First, the power distance index has little influences on the detention rate. Second, more importantly, the individualism, uncertainty avoidance index and long‐term orientation have positively impacts on the number of detentions. Our findings show that culture indeed has an effect on the vessel detention taken by different Port State Controls. A further look on the flag of registry is that the performance of individual flags may be better illustrated if individual flags are classified according to culture dimensions. This paper is organised as follows: Section 1 introduces the background; Section 2 discusses related literature; Section 3 considers the data collection and methodology; Section 4 concerns the findings; and Section 5 addresses conclusions and further research.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of common threads found in criticisms of the flag of {{convenience}} system. One is that these flag states have insufficient regulations and that those regulations they do have are poorly enforced. Another is that, in many cases, the flag state cannot identify a shipowner, much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship's actions. As a result of this lack of <b>flag</b> state <b>control,</b> <b>flags</b> of convenience are criticized on grounds of providing an environment for conducting criminal activities, supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.|$|R

This study uses individual ship registration data to analyse flag selection behaviour, including flagging out decision using a binary choice model, and final flag choice by applying a nested logit model. Operators from traditional maritime countries are found to flag out high-quality vessels, whereas those from open-registry countries tend to flag out low-quality ones. Flag preferences are more sensitive to the registration fee than to the annual due; full-open flags are more elastic than quasi-open ones and substitution among flags within the same group is higher than across different groups. Port State <b>Control,</b> <b>Flag</b> State <b>Control</b> and safety records have opposite impacts on flag choice for ships from closed registry countries and those from open registers.
