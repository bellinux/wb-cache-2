40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} within {{the scientific community}} that a single species approach to European mixed fisheries can result in species-specific advice inconsistent with multi-species management objectives. Within the reformed Common Fisheries Policy a move toward mixed fisheries and ecosystem based management is encouraged. The overall objective {{of this research was}} to improve understanding of the complex targeting behaviour undertaken by commercial fishers. Whereby, improved understanding will enhance the ability to predict the responses to future mixed fisheries management measures and changing economic conditions within the Irish fishing industry. Irish métiers (groups of homogeneous fishing trips) highlight the complexity of fishing activities within the Irish fleet, having identified 33 otter trawl métiers and 19 in the remainder of the fleet. Métier dynamics identified over compensation to introduced management, resulting in effort displacement and increased temporal specific fishing pressure. Therefore were deemed as appropriate base units for all subsequent analyses. Two economic variables, operational fishing cost and trip landings value, considered to represent important drivers were developed. This lead to application of a general additive model to estimate and predict fuel consumption estimates according to fleet segment definitions. A linear mixed effects model with random vessel effect was developed as a method of standardising value generating an index of value per unit effort. This identified <b>kilowatt</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>days</b> as the most appropriate effort measure. The final investigation stage successfully amalgamated the knowledge gained into the formulation of novel Markov transition probability for a multinomial model to predict fisher métier strategy choice. This is to be incorporated into management strategy evaluation, aiding the assessment and possible impacts of future management proposals on the Irish fleet and commercial stocks around Ireland. Developments presented will benefit the progression toward optimising sustainability within a mixed fisheries approach to management through incorporation of economic considerations.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the input utilization, the techno-economic efficiency of fishing operations is commonly assessed by employing various production function models. In view of the contribution of mechanized trawlers to the total marine fish production of India, {{an attempt was made}} to assess the input-output relationship in trawler operations at three major landing centres along the Kerala coast using the model Cobb-Douglas production function. The functional relationship indicated that there was ample scope to enhance the net profit of trawlers by increasing <b>fishing</b> <b>days</b> and area of operation at Neendakara and Munambam, whereas at Cochin Fisheries Harbour, the present operation is almost at the optimum level. At Neendakara landing centre, the <b>fishing</b> <b>days</b> in a year could be increased from the average level of 193 to 204 and in Munambam from 203 to 229 days to get the maximum profit. There is also a provision for increasing oil consumption in all three landing centers to achieve optimum level of utilisation. Even though the number of <b>days</b> <b>fished</b> in a year is not up to the optimum in all the major centers selected for the study, the existing socio-economic conflicts and inter-sectoral disputes should be addressed while increasing the number of <b>fishing</b> <b>days</b> of mechanized trawlers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Even {{with the}} rapid changes {{in the level of}} {{complexity}} and the uncertainty of the environment in which Belgian sea fisheries operate, fisheries management in Belgium is still mainly based on restrictive policy instruments founded in the biological approach of fisheries management science. Since they will continue to play an important role, this paper evaluated changes in three restrictive policy instruments and their effect on future fleet performance and dynamics, i. e. maximum <b>fishing</b> <b>days,</b> total quota-restrictions and licences. These effects are tested through scenarios in a microeconomic simulation model, including sensitivity analysis. This study opts for a dynamic simulation model based on a microeconomic approach of fleet dynamics using system dynamics as a modelling technique (operational base: Vensimr©DSS). The results indicated that changes in maximum <b>fishing</b> <b>days</b> and total quota resulted in higher fluctuations in fleet performance and dynamics compared to changes in licences. Furthermore, changes in maximum <b>fishing</b> <b>days</b> and total quota had a direct impact on fleet performance, though not always as expected, whereas licences only affected fleet performance indirectly since they only limit the entry of new vessels to the fleet and they can block the growth of successful sub fleets. The outcomes of this study are translated into practical recommendations for improving fisheries management. Firstly, policy makers need to be more aware of misperceptions of feedback...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop and}} apply a new method for {{estimating}} {{the economic benefits}} of an environmental amenity. The method {{is based upon the}} notion of estimating the derived demand for a privately traded option to utilize an open access good. In particular, the demand for state fishing licenses is used to infer the benefits of recreational fishing. Using panel data on state fishing license sales and prices for the continental United States over a 15 -year period, combined with data on substitute prices and demographic variables, a license demand function is estimated with instrumental variable procedures to allow for the potential endogeneity of administered prices. The econometric results lead to estimates of the benefits of a fishing license, and subsequently to the expected benefits of a recreational <b>fishing</b> <b>day.</b> In contrast with previous studies, which have utilized travel cost or hypothetical market methods, our approach provides estimates that are directly comparable across geographic areas. Our findings show substantial variation in the value of a recreational <b>fishing</b> <b>day</b> across geographic areas in the United States. This suggests that current practice of using benefits estimates from one part of the country in national or regional analyses may lead to substantial bias in benefits estimates.
