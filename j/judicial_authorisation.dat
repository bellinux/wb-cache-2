25|$|Post World War II, Project SHAMROCK was {{established}} in 1945, for the accumulation of all telegraphic data entering into or exiting from the United States. Major communication companies such as Western Union, RCA Global and ITT World Communications actively aided the U.S. government in the latter's attempt {{to gain access to}} international message traffic. There was no <b>judicial</b> <b>authorisation,</b> and no warrants were issued for surveillance. The project was terminated in 1975.|$|E
2500|$|Following a {{decision}} by the European Union’s council of ministers in Brussels, in January 2009, the UK's Home Office adopted a plan to allow police to access the contents of individuals' computers without a warrant. The process, called [...] "remote searching", allows one party, at a remote location, to examine another's hard drive and Internet traffic, including email, browsing history and websites visited. Police across the EU are now permitted to request that the British police conduct a remote search on their behalf. The search can be granted, and the material gleaned turned over and used as evidence, {{on the basis of a}} senior officer believing it necessary to prevent a serious crime. Opposition MPs and civil liberties advocates are concerned about this move toward widening surveillance and its possible impact on personal privacy.

50|$|The UK {{is unusual}} in the {{arrangement}} that Ministers sign off on warrants when the inspection of bulk collected data is requested by the security services. Just under 3 thousand warrants were requested and authorized in 2014 by the Secretary of State.

50|$|R v Spencer is a Canadian {{constitutional}} law {{decision of the}} Supreme Court of Canada, concerning search and seizure law under section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. At issue was whether the police could request subscriber information associated with an IP address from an Internet service provider, {{on a voluntary basis}} under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and without prior <b>judicial</b> <b>authorisation.</b> The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the request for an IP address infringed the Charters guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the powers of}} the Commissioner of Taxation to enter and search premises, and gather information under ss. 263 and 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). A critical assessment is made of ss. 263 and 264 with reference to (i) Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), (ii) the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission Privacy Report 1983 and (iii) relevant overseas experience. An important issue for discussion is the lack of <b>judicial</b> <b>authorisation</b> over the Commissioner of Taxation's powers of entry and search of premises. An aim of the study is to recommend appropriate reforms for ss. 263 and 264. The study also assesses the potential impact of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) on the operation of ss. 263 and 264...|$|E
40|$|Morocco has {{maintained}} its identity and {{adherence to the}} Islamic faith since before colonialism and after. As {{a result of such}} identity the Moroccan monarchy over the years developed the Code of Personal Status (referred to as the mudawana) which affected only the Muslim population. This type of family law was drawn mostly from Islamic doctrines with little or no participation of women. The mudawana has been criticised by many as being one-side and feminist groups have made numerous calls for a reformed mudawana that addressed the plight of women and to improve their status within the wider community. In 2004, the monarchy decided to reform the mudawana as a result of women’s groups pressuring the monarchy to do so. The 2004 reforms has the possibility of enhancing the rights of Moroccan women, for example, a wife is no longer legally obliged to obey her husband, contrary to a widely-held custom which regards obedience as an absolute duty of a Muslim wife, the minimum age for marriage for both parties eighteen years of age, including free and full consent. Polygyny has also been addressed. Although the 2004 version kept the concept of polygyny, there are severe restrictions to curtail this practice, for example, <b>judicial</b> <b>authorisation</b> is required as well as informing the current wife of the prospect. There are certain obstacles that seem to be hampering the full implementation of 2004 reforms which are discussed in this contribution...|$|E
40|$|M. Com. Abstract: The Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service (hereafter SARS Commissioner) is {{empowered}} with information-gathering powers, including {{search and}} seizure powers, enabling them to enforce inter alia {{the provisions of the}} Income Tax Act (58 of 1962) (hereafter the Act). This study examined the {{search and seizure}} provisions, previously contained in the Act and as they currently exist under the Tax Administration Act (28 of 2011) (hereafter the TAA), to determine whether they are aligned to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. The search and seizure provisions of the Act previously contained in section 74 (3), authorised search and seizure operations to be conducted at the sole discretion of the Commissioner for SARS. These provisions could not be sustained following the enactment of the Constitution which required that a person’s constitutionally enshrined rights are not unduly violated in the process of exercising and enforcing these powers. Section 74 (3) was thus repealed and replaced by section 74 D of the Act, which authorised, the SARS Commissioner to conduct search and seizure operations with prior authorisation, {{in the form of a}} warrant obtained from a judge. The TAA introduced provisions regulating and authorising a senior SARS official to carry out warrantless search and seizure operations, within specifically defined criteria. The safeguards preventing the undue infringement of taxpayers’ constitutional rights, by the enforcement of search and seizure provisions, include the obligation placed on the Commissioner to obtain prior <b>judicial</b> <b>authorisation,</b> in the form of a warrant; and the requirements pertaining to the existence of objective, reasonable grounds for the search, as a basis for issuing the warrant. To be effective and satisfy their objective, safeguards must strike a balance between a person’s constitutionally enshrined rights and the enforcement of the legislation [...] ...|$|E
40|$|By utilising {{the latest}} {{cellphone}} technology, non-communicative personal information, such as, {{the number that}} is dialled, the time the call is made, the movement and location of both the caller and the recipient of a call, can be obtained. This information is not ordinarily available {{to the police and}} it usually requires prior <b>judicial</b> <b>authorisation</b> to access this information. The problem is, that the cellphone companies, their employees, and criminals who want to know the location and movement of other citizens in order to commit crime, can access this information. The Protection of Personal Information Bill suggests new methods of operating with regard to the collection and/or dissemination of any personal information and aims to protect individual's right to data privacy and protection of personal information. If an individual has a right to privacy in his movement and location is not addressed by the Bill. This bill must, however still be passed by Parliament. On the other hand, this type of information, if utilised by the police services, can {{play a crucial role in}} solving crime, and the use thereof should be encouraged to solve crimes, provided that the proper legal authorisation is obtained. Are the nature and extent of non-communicative information, and details obtained from cellphone records, such as, the location and movement of users, worthy of being protected by the right to privacy? The key issue with regard to cellphones is whether the keeping and use of this non-communicative information by cellphone companies are intrusions on an individual's right to privacy. Does the right to privacy protect non-communicative personal information obtained from cellphone records? The right to privacy has been included in the South African Constitution as a fundamental right and enjoys both common law and constitutional protection. DHE...|$|E
