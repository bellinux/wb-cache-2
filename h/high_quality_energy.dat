40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{modeling}} of various low-exergy system components and their {{integration into the}} energy system for buildings and small communities. The exergy content of {{a certain amount of}} energy is defined as the part of this energy {{that can be used to}} produce mechanical energy. The quality of a certain amount of energy is defined as the relative exergy content of this energy. Most of our buildings with their heating and cooling systems today are built for conversion of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> sources to low quality use with a huge destruction of the available exergy as a result. Globally we have a huge potential for transforming our processes to more efficient use of the exergy and also for feeding our processes directly from renewable energy sources without the use of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> sources. To develop our building concepts towards a low exergy building we have to analyze all the processes for energy conversion that take place through the operation of the building, to bring down the needed level of quality for the energy used and then make a holistic analysis of the system. Different processes for energy conversion in buildings are discussed especially giving the potential for saving energy and shifting the energy use to lower quality levels, i. e. in many cases to reduce the temperature levels needed for heating and cooling.

40|$|Distributed Generation (DG) {{systems are}} often {{fluctuating}} power sources and may cause a fluctuating voltage {{in the network}} common coupling point (PCC), causing the occurrence of flickers. To overcome such phenomenon, the voltage control on PCC is crucial. In the connection of the DG unit to the network, via an electric energy static conversion system with bidirectional power flow (AFE), the power quality (PQ) depends on the harmonic content of the current supplied to the PCC. The paper proposes a strategy, based on the control of both point PCC voltage and current in the network filter inductance, and point bus DC voltage, thus allowing to obtain a high quality for the AFE provided or absorbed power. A model-based approach is used, in order to design controllers with pre-fixed stability, performance and robustness characteristics.

The Whole Building Design Guide puts forth the goals well: “As the preeminent symbol of Federal authority in local communities, a Federal courthouse must express solemnity, stability, integrity, rigor and fairness. ” The courtrooms themselves must {{have a sense of}} majesty and be aesthetically inspiring. When paired with the visual needs in a courtroom—given the wide variety of tasks and the critical nature of the courtroom proceedings—one has a challenge indeed. In consideration of these issue, this report reviews existing conditions in courtrooms and provides specific guidance about solutions that will accomplish the dual objectives of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> and <b>energy</b> efficiency. The material covers all aspects of courtroom lighting, including design criteria, design and application strategies, energy efficient technologies, procurement and team selection, design process and implementation, and education. A detailed energy analysis was performed to develop a baseline for energy consumption in courtroom lighting, and the primary root cause was found to be a high use of incandescent technology. Point-by-point calculations were completed to provide an energy efficient alternative that met the high level of criteria for performance in courtrooms. Additional detailed guidance has been provided in the spirit of a holistic solution. It is hoped and anticipated that the recommended solutions will transform courtroom lighting towards both <b>energy</b> efficiency and <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> lighting. This is more important than ever before given the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which significantly changes the energy usage requirements in Federal Buildings.
