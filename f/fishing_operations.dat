The size of the vessels varies from open boats to large specialised drifters operating on the high seas. The wheelhouse is usually located aft, and the front deck is used for handling gear. Normally the nets are set at the stern by steaming ahead. Hauling is done over the side at the forepart of the deck, usually using hydraulic driven net haulers. Wet fish is packed in containers chilled with ice. Larger vessels might freeze the catch.|$|E

40|$|Fishing gear {{effectiveness}} is a main parameter to measure effiency rate of <b>fishing</b> <b>operation.</b> At same time, fishing gear selectivity becomes a main consideration in preserving fish resources. Nowadays, {{the sustainability of}} fish resources is threatened because all fishers are attempting to narrow their net mesh size to increase their haul. The scarcity of fish resources and the increase of operational cost are dilemmas that can obstruct the implementation of effective and selective <b>fishing</b> <b>operation</b> {{based on the principle}} of fish resources conservation. The objective of research is to understand the effectiveness and selectivity rates of fishing gear. The indicators used to measure the effectiveness of fishing gear are boat speed during fishing activity and fish haul rate. Fishing gear selectivity is measured by comparing fish length during gonad mature and fish length during firstly-caught. This fishing gear selectivity is also used as the indicator of environmentally friendliness rate of purse seine. The calculation of fishing gear selectivity is begun by determining fish size at caught (Lc) and fish size at gonad mature (Lm) and then comparing both sizes with mesh size of purse seine. Result of research indicates that effective speed of <b>fishing</b> <b>operation</b> is achieved when boat speed is 7. 1 knots with fish haul rate of 1, 000 kg and with <b>fishing</b> <b>operation</b> time of 2, 853 seconds. <b>Fishing</b> <b>operation</b> speed above 8 knots is not efficient because it produces quite significant increase of fuel consumption although fish haul rate remains similar. Purse seine used in Sampang waters is not selective because the size of mackerel fish (selaroides spp) at firstly-caught (Lc) is smaller than fish length at gonad mature (Lm), thus Lc < Lm. Fish size at gonad mature (Lm) is 19. 35 cm, while fish size at firstly-caught is 18. 6 cm. Regression analysis indicates that there is a close relationship between fish length and fish weight, which is scored at 84...|$|R

25|$|Discards are {{the portion}} of a catch of fish which is not {{retained}} on board during commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>operations</b> and is returned, often dead or dying, to the sea. The practice of discarding is driven by economic and political factors; fish which are discarded are often unmarketable species, individuals which are below minimum landing sizes and catches of species which fishermen {{are not allowed to}} land, for instance due to quota restrictions. Discards form part of the bycatch of a fishing operation, although bycatch includes marketable species caught unintentionally. Discarding can be highly variable in time and space as a consequence of changing economic, sociological, environmental and biological factors.|$|E
25|$|There is {{substantial}} incidental catches in <b>fishing</b> <b>operations.</b> Often, the Harbour Porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is killed by incidental by-catch (10, 11, 12). Gillnets pose {{a serious threat}} to the harbour porpoise as they are extremely susceptible to entanglement. A study by Caswell et al. in the western North Atlantic combined the mean annual rate of increase of the harbour porpoise with the uncertainty of incidental mortality and population size. It was found that the incidental mortality exceeds critical values and therefore by-catch is a significant threat to the harbour porpoise. Harbour porpoises become entangled in nets due to their inability to detect the nets before collision. In 2001, 80 harbour porpoises were killed in salmon gillnet fisheries in British Columbia, Canada.|$|E
25|$|The spill had {{a strong}} {{economic}} impact on the Gulf Coast's economy sectors such as fishing and tourism. According to NOAA, Gulf fisheries were recovering in 2011, but in late 2012 local fishermen reported that crab, shrimp, and oyster <b>fishing</b> <b>operations</b> had not yet recovered from the oil spill. In late 2011 and May 2012, press reports indicated a rebound in tourism, aided by BP advertising dollars and concurrent with a nationwide rise in hotel occupancy rates. However, {{it was not clear}} if states most affected by the oil spill would still lag behind others as tourism improves nationally. A 2013 study in the Journal of Travel Research found that the hotel industry weathered the spill better than the vacation rental industry, and that the overall impact was complex and difficult to determine.|$|E

25|$|Overfishing {{has been}} cited as a {{possible}} reason for a decrease in population of various whitefish, important because of their culinary desirability and, hence, economic consequence. Moreover, between 1879 and 1899, reported whitefish harvests declined from some 24.3 million pounds (11 millionkg) to just over 9 million pounds (4 millionkg). By 1900, commercial fishermen on Lake Michigan were hauling in an average of 41 million pounds of fish annually. By 1938, Wisconsin's commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>operations</b> were motorized and mechanized, generating jobs for more than 2,000 workers, and hauling 14 million pounds per year. The population of giant freshwater mussels was eliminated as the mussels were harvested for use as buttons by early Great Lakes entrepreneurs. Since 2000, the invasive quagga mussel has smothered the bottom of Lake Michigan almost from shore to shore, and their numbers are estimated at 900 trillion.|$|E

His plans for their future {{prosperity}} centred upon the application of modern science and his own business skills in establishing a large and thriving fishing industry. Although Stornaway had a good harbour, there were many disadvantages to Leverhulme’s plans for the port.

25|$|By {{the time}} that European contact with Newfoundland {{began in the early}} 16th century, the Beothuk were the only {{indigenous}} group living permanently on the island. Unlike other groups in the Northeastern area of the Americas, the Beothuk never established sustained trading relations with European settlers. Instead, their trading interactions were sporadic, and they largely attempted to avoid contact in order to preserve their culture. The establishment of English <b>fishing</b> <b>operations</b> on the outer coastline of the island, and their later expansion into bays and inlets, cut off access for the Beothuk to their traditional sources of food. In the 18th century, as the Beothuk were driven further inland by these encroachments, violence between Beothuk and settlers escalated, with each retaliating against the other in their competition for resources. By the early 19th century, violence, starvation, and exposure to tuberculosis had decimated the Beothuk population, and they were extinct as a cultural group by 1829.|$|E
