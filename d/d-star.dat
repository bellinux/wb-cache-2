50|$|ThumbDV <b>D-STAR</b> DV USB is a USB {{device with}} the AMBE codec built in. Amateurs {{can use this}} with a {{personal}} computer's audio system to communicate over the <b>D-STAR</b> network. This is an option for using <b>D-STAR</b> if there isn't a local <b>D-STAR</b> repeater with a gateway.|$|E
50|$|As of late 2009, {{there are}} around 10,800 <b>D-STAR</b> users talking through <b>D-STAR</b> {{repeaters}} with Internet connectivity via the G2 Gateway. There are approximately 550 G2 enabled repeaters now active. Note, these numbers {{do not include}} users with <b>D-STAR</b> capabilities that are not within range of a repeater, or working through <b>D-STAR</b> repeaters {{that do not have}} Internet connectivity.|$|E
5000|$|Another form of {{repeater}} {{is used in}} amateur packet radio, a form {{of digital}} computer-to-computer communications, and are dubbed [...] "digipeaters" [...] (for DIGItal rePEATERS). These repeaters are used for activities and modes such as packet radio, Automatic Packet Reporting System, and <b>D-STAR's</b> digital data mode.|$|R
40|$|A Distributed Stars (<b>D-Stars)</b> {{topology}} {{is proposed}} for microgrids, consisting of distributed generators and loads. The benefits and operational modes of the topology are discussed. Further, the topology creates {{an environment in}} which the control scheme for power balancing can be improved. The power balancing algorithms presented in [1] and [2] are extended using local current measurements, from local load branches. SABER simulations show the improvement in control achieved by the new algorithms...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} spherically symmetric static {{composite structures}} {{consisting of a}} boson star and a global monopole, minimally or non-minimally coupled to the general relativistic gravitational field. In the non-minimally coupled case, Marunovic and Murkovic have shown that these objects, so-called boson <b>D-stars,</b> can be sufficiently gravitationally compact so as to potentially mimic black holes. Here, we present {{the results of an}} extensive numerical parameter space survey which reveals additional new and unexpected phenomenology in the model. In particular, focusing on families of boson <b>D-stars</b> which are parameterized by the central amplitude of the boson field, we find configurations for both the minimally and non-minimally coupled cases that contain one or more shells of bosonic matter located far from the origin. In parameter space, each shell spontaneously appears as one tunes through some critical central amplitude of the boson field. In some cases the shells apparently materialize at spatial infinity: in these instances their areal radii are observed to obey a universal scaling law {{in the vicinity of the}} critical amplitude. We derive this law from the equations of motion and the asymptotic behavior of the fields. Comment: 17 pages, 24 figure...|$|R

5000|$|DV-AP: A DVAP Dongle (DV Access Point Dongle) {{is also a}} USB {{device that}} creates a {{connection}} to the <b>D-STAR</b> network through an Internet connected computer. But instead of using the computer's audio system, the DVAP Dongle has an antenna and a 10 mW two-meter transceiver that provides short-range over-the-air access using a <b>D-STAR</b> radio (usually a handheld). Note that a <b>D-STAR</b> radio is required. The DVAP does not convert an analog FM signal to <b>D-STAR.</b>|$|E
50|$|As of 2011, Repeatergruppen SK7RNQ is {{the fastest}} {{deploying}} <b>D-STAR</b> group within Sweden, currently owning and maintaining two RP2C controlled <b>D-STAR</b> repeaters and one experimental GMSK HotSpot.In the middle of March 2011, the first 23 cm <b>D-STAR</b> repeater in northern Europe will be installed in Malmö Municipality, Sweden by Repeatergruppen SK7MQ.The repeater will act as a pure PS (Digital Data) repeater, and will at first be experimentally used by SA7BOS and SM7ZDV {{through the use of}} the ICOM-ID 23 cm transceiver.In addition to the 23 cm repeater, a 70 cm <b>D-STAR</b> repeater will be installed at the same QTH with the aim to provide portable <b>D-STAR</b> users full coverage within Malmö.|$|E
50|$|<b>D-STAR</b> {{compatible}} radios {{are available}} for HF, VHF, UHF, and microwave amateur radio bands. In addition to the over-the-air protocol, <b>D-STAR</b> also provides specifications for network connectivity, enabling <b>D-STAR</b> radios {{to be connected to}} the Internet or other networks, allowing streams of voice or packet data to be routed via amateur radio.|$|E
5000|$|FLEX-6300: HF-6m all mode {{including}} digital voice transceiver (2 receivers). Power is selectable from 1 W to 100 W. Open API including <b>D-STAR</b> access. <b>D-STAR</b> source {{available online}} ...|$|E
50|$|In 2015, FlexRadio Systems added <b>D-STAR</b> {{support to}} their line of HF {{transceivers}} and receivers via a software upgrade. <b>D-STAR</b> support requires {{the addition of}} the ThumbDV device from NW Digital Radio.|$|E
50|$|DV-Dongle: The dongle is a USB {{device with}} the AMBE codec built in. Amateurs {{can use this}} with a {{personal}} computer's audio system to communicate over the <b>D-STAR</b> network. This is an option for using <b>D-STAR</b> if there isn't a local <b>D-STAR</b> repeater or {{if there is a}} repeater but it's not associated with an Internet gateway. The dongle works along with the DVTOOL software, a simple application that mimics the controls on a <b>D-STAR</b> radio, although the interface doesn't actually look like a radio panel. Note: Now available from a number of amateur radio dealers or by homebrew using documentation at Moetronix.|$|E
50|$|In Icom's radio line, <b>D-STAR</b> does {{significantly}} add to {{the cost}} of a radio, which is a barrier to the adoption of the technology. In 2006 the cost of a <b>D-STAR</b> radio was compared to that of a standard analog radio, and the price difference was nearly double. This is due partly to the per-unit cost for the voice codec hardware and/or license and partly to manufacturer research and development costs that need to be amortized. As is the case with any product, as more units are sold, the R&D portion of the cost will decrease over time. The <b>D-STAR</b> capable radios also cost more than their equivalents from other brands, even before the <b>D-STAR</b> options boards are added (in the UK as of April 2011, Martin Lynch & Sons' website lists the Icom 2820 (without <b>D-STAR)</b> at £489, while the equivalent Yaesu, the FT8800, is listed at just £337).|$|E

5000|$|Many {{advanced}} <b>D-STAR</b> features rely {{on internet}} connections although simplex, repeated and crossband gateway voice and data communications do not. During widespread disasters that compromise commercial telecommunications infrastructure, <b>D-STAR</b> systems (as {{well as other}} modes that rely on the internet) may suffer outages or feature degradation that impacts operations. Without simulating such outages during drills, {{it is difficult to}} assess the impact of or establish <b>D-STAR</b> service recovery procedures in the event of such failures. As of the fall of 2011, there has been almost no discussion in the ham radio literature regarding actual drills where <b>D-STAR</b> systems were tested with completely failed or even intermittent telecommunications infrastructure. Comprehensive emergency communications plans used by ARES and other such organizations should address the possibility that such systems may not function as intended during major disasters.|$|E

Primary emergency traffic for the American Red Cross and the Vernonia, Oregon Fire Department was handled by the group using traditional FM voice because the group had no <b>D-STAR</b> repeater equipment available. Once the situation's communication needs became established the D*Chat messaging function was used to send small text transmissions via <b>D-STAR</b> simplex at distances of up to seventeen miles.|$|E
