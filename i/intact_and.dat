5|$|After the NBA Finals, Durant {{declined}} his $27.7 million player {{option for}} the 2017–18 season and became an unrestricted free agent {{with the intention of}} re-signing with the Warriors for less money, helping the franchise create enough salary cap space to keep their core roster <b>intact</b> <b>and</b> add free agents. On July 25, 2017, he re-signed with the Warriors.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{large-scale}} {{evacuation of}} supplies from Warsaw was ordered, the Modlin Fortress was well {{prepared for a}} lengthy siege. Its magazines contained over 25,000 cannonballs, almost 900 thousand musket and rifle rounds and enough provisions for several months of full siege. The treasury of the Polish government was still <b>intact</b> <b>and</b> contained more than 6.5 million złotys.|$|E
5|$|Following the crash, the aircraft's cockpit voice {{recorder}} was recovered from the wreckage and the data recorded found to be <b>intact</b> <b>and</b> usable. Under Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 Air Taxi rules, no flight data recorder was required {{for this type of}} flight and one had not been installed.|$|E

5|$|Only Kronshtadts hull {{survived the}} war {{reasonably}} <b>intact</b> <b>and</b> was about 10% complete in 1945. She was judged obsolete and the Soviets considered converting her into an aircraft carrier, {{but the idea}} was rejected and both hulls were scrapped in 1947.|$|E

5|$|A cube-shaped {{concrete}} {{building was}} constructed {{on the top}} of the hill, next to the dome. This was intended to be used as the bomb-proof outlet for a ventilation and air conditioning shaft. It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing <b>intact</b> <b>and</b> is still prominently visible today.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the Australians' {{visit to}} England in 1930 {{there was some}} {{confidence}} in English cricketing circles, since Chapman's victorious 1928–29 side was largely <b>intact</b> <b>and</b> on paper looked formidably strong, especially in batting. England duly won the first Test, at Trent Bridge, by 93 runs, despite a second-innings century from Bradman that for a time threatened to turn the match. Larwood's active participation was curtailed by an attack of gastritis; he took 2 wickets in the match for 21 runs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its surface}} {{circulation}} had dissipated, its circulation aloft remained <b>intact</b> <b>and</b> {{led to a}} burst of rainfall early on August 20. The 11.94inches/303.3mm that fell at Miller became the wettest Missouri rainfall total associated with a tropical cyclone, or its remains, since at least 1972. One person died in Sleeper when he drove into flood waters which had swept away a bridge he was attempting to navigate onto. Nine water rescues occurred along the I-44 corridor, mostly caused by Erin's rainfall. Damage totaled about $19.8million (2007USD) in the state, primarily in Polk County.|$|E
50|$|Examination of mouse {{full-length}} cDNA sequences for alternatively spliced phosphatase genes {{identified two}} novel forms of PTPRU predicted {{to result in}} two PCP-2 splice variants: a tethered variant of PCP-2, expressing an <b>intact</b> extracellular <b>and</b> transmembrane domain, and a PCP-2 variant that lacked a signal peptide, but encoded <b>intact</b> transmembrane <b>and</b> cytoplasmic domains.|$|R

5|$|Asama was {{reclassified}} as {{a training}} ship in 1942 {{and became a}} gunnery training ship later that year. She was disarmed {{at some point during}} the war, only retaining several 8cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft guns. The ship survived the war <b>intact</b> <b>and</b> she and Tokiwa were stricken from the navy list in November 1945. Asama was scrapped in 1946–47 while Tokiwa was refloated in 1947 and scrapped that same year.|$|E
5|$|Director Reeves {{featured}} many {{scenes of}} intense onscreen torture and violence that were considered unusually sadistic at the time. Upon its theatrical release throughout {{the spring and}} summer of 1968, the movie's gruesome content was met with disgust by several film critics in the UK, despite having been extensively censored by the British Board of Film Censors. In the US, the film was shown virtually <b>intact</b> <b>and</b> was a box office success, but it was almost completely ignored by reviewers.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{extensive}} coastal defences erected by the Germans {{to protect the}} installation from a seaborne raid, {{it was believed that}} a commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the garrison at the installation to destroy the Würzburg radar set. It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation would be the most practicable way to surprise the garrison of the installation, seize the technology <b>intact,</b> <b>and</b> minimise casualties to the raiding force.|$|E

5|$|Finding himself totally {{alone in}} a {{shattered}} world with food to last him a lifetime but no one to share it with, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees {{the ruins of the}} public library in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still <b>intact</b> <b>and</b> readable; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) learns that he has {{all the time in the}} world to read them without interruption.|$|E
5|$|German Army {{headquarters}} {{wanted to}} capture the bridges over the Drava <b>intact,</b> <b>and</b> from 1 April had issued orders to the German 2nd Army to conduct preliminary operations aimed at seizing the bridge at Barcs and the railway bridge at Gyékényes by coup de main. As a result, limited objective attacks were launched {{along the line of}} the Drava by the XLVI Motorised Corps, {{despite the fact that they}} were not expected to launch offensive operations until 10 April.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kathleen was a {{tropical}} cyclone that caused destructive impacts in California. On September 7, 1976, {{a tropical}} depression formed; {{two days later}} it accelerated north towards the Baja California Peninsula. Kathleen brushed the Pacific coast of the peninsula as a hurricane on September 9 and made landfall as a fast-moving tropical storm the next day. With its circulation <b>intact</b> <b>and</b> still a tropical storm, Kathleen headed north into the United States and affected California and Arizona. Kathleen finally dissipated late on September 11.|$|E

5|$|In 1430 the 1280 Sheffield parish church {{building}} was pulled down and replaced. Parts {{of this new}} church still stand today {{and it is now}} Sheffield city centre's oldest surviving building, forming the core of Sheffield Cathedral. Other notable surviving buildings from this period include the Old Queen's Head pub in Pond Hill, which dates from around 1480, with its timber frame still <b>intact,</b> <b>and</b> Bishops' House and Broom Hall, both built around 1500.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an Argentine Army {{expedition}} found additional wreckage—including a propeller and wheels (one {{of which}} had an <b>intact</b> <b>and</b> inflated tyre)—and noted that the wreckage was well localised, a fact which pointed to a head-on impact with the ground, and which also ruled out a mid-air explosion. Human remains were also recovered, including three torsos, a foot in an ankle boot and a manicured hand. By 2002, the bodies of five of the eight British victims had been identified through DNA testing.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, MBTA Framingham/Worcester Line and Amtrak {{operations}} were shifted {{to a new}} set of platforms nearby, which have high-level sections for handicapped-accessible boarding and a footbridge for crossing the tracks. This new Framingham station is among the busiest on the MBTA system, with 41 daily MBTA and 2 Amtrak trains on weekdays. The H. H. Richardson-designed station building remains largely <b>intact</b> <b>and</b> is currently used as a restaurant.|$|E
