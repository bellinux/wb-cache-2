5000|$|The GHS {{includes}} {{directions for}} {{application of the}} hazard communication elements on the label. In particular, it specifies for each hazard, and for each class within the hazard, what signal word, pictogram, and hazard statement should be used. The GHS hazard pictograms, signal words and hazard statements should be located together on the label. The actual label format or layout is not specified in the GHS. National authorities may choose to specify where information should appear on the label or allow supplier discretion. There has been discussion {{about the size of}} <b>GHS</b> <b>pictograms</b> and that a GHS pictogram might be confused with a transport pictogram or [...] "diamond". Transport pictograms are different in appearance than the <b>GHS</b> <b>pictograms.</b> Annex 7 of the Purple Book explains how the <b>GHS</b> <b>pictograms</b> are expected to be proportional {{to the size of the}} label text so that generally the <b>GHS</b> <b>pictograms</b> would be smaller than the transport pictograms.|$|E
30|$|Adding pictograms, {{icons and}} symbols to PCP labels is another {{recommended}} addition. Comprehensibility testing of potential pictograms, however, {{should be conducted}} before any pictograms are legislated for use. For example, the <b>GHS</b> <b>pictograms</b> were not subjected to global comprehensibility testing prior {{to the development of}} the first purple book. Comprehensibility testing, based on the University of Cape Town’s testing methodology, took place too late [82] as there was no option for changing or adapting these pictograms. The GHS building block approach does, however, allow for countries to add additional pictograms that are relevant for the country context [5]. We do not recommend introducing more pictograms with a global scope since pictograms are not cross-culturally transferable or intuitively obvious [69]. Research has shown that pictograms are not clearly understood by consumers - especially the GHS pictogram for acute toxicity (Figure  1 a) [4]. We recommend that a mechanism be put in place for countries to evaluate and upgrade legally binding pictograms to improve RC. We therefore support the plan proposed by ECHA to perform a new analysis by 2015 before mixtures will have to be labeled with the new <b>GHS</b> <b>pictograms</b> [66]. The question of cross-cultural comprehension of pictograms as scientifically intended is illustrated by whether these are understood in the same way by an illiterate South African farm worker as by a Finnish professor. Importantly, misinterpretations of label information can even increase the health risk [69]. To reduce misinterpretations, we recommend clear hazard statements on the label with precautionary advice. We also recommend that any pictograms or icons used on labels have the meaning printed in clear and concise words underneath.|$|E
40|$|Regularly, {{teaching}} laboratories use chemicals {{hazardous to}} health. Students {{must be aware}} of such hazards, to safely perform didactic experiments. The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) is a hazard communication tool designed to harmonize the classification with a standardized labeling system worldwide. This work aimed at investigating whether undergraduate students correctly identify the hazards associated with a series of chemicals handled during practical laboratory classes. A questionnaire was administered to the students using the hazard classification established by the GHS as reference. They had to match each chemical with one or more pictograms and hazard classes. Statistical tests were performed to correlate the association between right answers and background items, such as having contact with chemicals during earlier classes, having contact with chemical labels at work or having received training courses in hazard communication. The overall assessment showed that students do not recognize <b>GHS</b> <b>pictograms,</b> especially those representing health hazards and thus, they were not aware of the hazards they were exposed to. Many are the reasons for that. At last, strategies to embed health and safety practices into formal education are needed to strengthen the prevention culture in such a learning environment...|$|E
40|$|Sweeping {{globalization}} {{has resulted in}} unparalleled economic growth, including increased international trade of hazardous chemicals. Fundamental differences between nations trading these materials, including language, literacy rates, cultural values, and technical and governmental infrastructures has created an urgent need for a common system of risk communication to reduce the occurrence of deaths and serious injuries that result from unintended chemical exposures. To accomplish this goal, the United Nations (UN) created the Globally Harmonized System for the Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) in 1992. Unfortunately, there was no requirement for testing of the GHS labeling components, including pictograms intended to depict specific hazards, before their deployment. In Experiment 1, twenty GHS hazard pictograms were subjected to comprehension testing in two non-student samples from the U. S. and Brazil, respectively. In Experiment 2, alternatives for five of the <b>GHS</b> <b>pictograms</b> that were least well understood were created and then re-tested for comprehension. Several of the new pictograms outperformed their “original ” GHS counterparts in terms of comprehension and participant preference. Overall, the results of testing showed {{that only a small}} portion of the original GHS hazard pictograms reached acceptable levels of comprehension. Therefore, additional systematic work is needed to develop GHS pictogram alternatives that effectively convey safety hazards to a global audience...|$|E
