25|$|Another G-IIB (N779LC, cn 88) {{has been}} {{modified}} {{with the same}} large <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> as N178B, as the HALO IV aircraft for the Missile Defense Agency.|$|E
25|$|A second G-IIB (N178B, cn 125) was {{modified}} {{by the addition}} of a large <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> housing a telescope by Aeromet as the HALO II aircraft for the Missile Defense Agency.|$|E
25|$|Although Gull {{variants}} were {{powered by}} five different engines, those were all inverted inline air-cooled types driving two-bladed propellers, making for a neatly faired installation. The rear fuselage was of square cross section with a rounded top. The glazed cabin joined smoothly into a raised <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing,</b> {{and placed the}} pilot in front and two passenger seats, slightly staggered behind. Entry into the early models was via the sliding canopy. The main undercarriage was fixed and spatted, each wheel mounted on three struts in the early models; {{there was a small}} steerable tail wheel.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} with the D.I, the pilot sat higher in his cockpit, to improve his view over the top wing. This required a <b>dorsal</b> turtleback <b>fairing</b> over the rear fuselage, to improve its lines.|$|R
50|$|The kit adds a 40 kg GPS/INS {{navigation}} {{system in a}} tail fairing and pop-out wing in a <b>dorsal</b> saddleback <b>fairing</b> enabling a 7:1 glade ratio aiming to increase standoff range up to 80 km.|$|R
50|$|The Erieye AEW&C {{mission system}} radar is an active, phased-array, pulse-doppler sensor that can feed an onboard {{operator}} architecture or downlink data (via an associated datalink subsystem) to a ground-based air defence network. The system employs a large aperture, dual-sided antenna array {{housed in a}} <b>dorsal</b> 'plank' <b>fairing.</b> The antenna is fixed, and the beam is electronically scanned, which provides for improved detection and significantly enhanced tracking performance compared with radar-dome antenna systems. Erieye detects and tracks air and sea targets out to the horizon, and sometimes beyond this due to anomalous propagation — instrumented range has been measured at 450 km. Typical detection range against fighter-sized targets is approximately 425 km, in a 150° broadside sector, {{both sides of the}} aircraft. Outside these sectors, performance is reduced in forward and aft directions.|$|R
500|$|The F-16 has a cropped-delta wing {{incorporating}} wing-fuselage blending and forebody vortex-control strakes; a fixed-geometry, underslung {{air intake}} (with splitter plate) {{to the single}} turbofan jet engine; a conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement with all-moving horizontal [...] "stabilator" [...] tailplanes; a pair of ventral fins beneath the fuselage aft of the wing's trailing edge; and a tricycle landing gear configuration with the aft-retracting, steerable nose gear deploying a short distance behind the inlet lip. There is a boom-style aerial refueling receptacle located behind the single-piece [...] "bubble" [...] canopy of the cockpit. Split-flap speedbrakes are located at the aft end of the wing-body fairing, and a tailhook is mounted underneath the fuselage. A fairing beneath the rudder often houses ECM equipment or a drag chute. Later F-16 models feature a long <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> along the fuselage's [...] "spine", housing additional equipment or fuel.|$|E
2500|$|The Typhoon {{was first}} {{produced}} with forward-opening [...] "car door" [...] style cockpit doors (complete with wind-down windows), with a transparent [...] "roof" [...] hinged to {{open to the}} left. The first 162 Typhoons featured a built-up metal-skinned <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> behind the pilot's armoured headrest; the mast for the radio aerial protruded through the fairing. From mid- to late 1941 the solid metal aft <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> was replaced with a transparent structure (later nicknamed [...] "The Coffin Hood"), the pilot's head armour plate was modified to a triangular shape and the side cut-outs were fitted with armoured glass; the first production Typhoon to be fitted with this new structure was R7803. All earlier aircraft were quickly withdrawn and modified. From early 1942 a rear-view mirror was mounted in a perspex blister moulded into the later [...] "car-door" [...] canopy roofs. This modification was not very successful, because the mirror was subject to vibration. Despite the new canopy structure, the pilot's visibility was still restricted by the heavy frames and the clutter of equipment under the rear canopy; from August 1943, as an interim measure, pending {{the introduction of the}} new [...] "bubble" [...] canopy and cut-down <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing,</b> the aerial mast and its associated bracing was removed and replaced with a whip aerial further back on the rear fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to the {{previous}} Scout B. These early Scout Cs, in a total run of 36 aircraft — twelve for the Royal Flying Corps, and 24 for the RNAS — also had their main oil tank moved to a position directly behind the pilot's shoulders, requiring a raised rear <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> immediately behind the pilot's seat to accommodate it. These aircraft used a small-central opening, [...] "dome-fronted" [...] cowl that were only intended for use with the 80 hp Gnome Lambda seven cylinder rotary engine, curiously the rotary engine choice the Royal Naval Air Service favored.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, BAC Warton {{was working}} on the {{preliminary}} design of a two-seat Lightning development with a variable-geometry wing, based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the variable-sweep wing, which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged <b>dorsal</b> fin <b>fairing,</b> an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the Royal Navy's existing aircraft carriers carrier-based aircraft, the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year. Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer Rolls-Royce Spey engine; it is also likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.|$|R
2500|$|The fighter {{plane is}} {{different}} from the MiG-29 flown by Indian Air Force. The aircraft has been modified for aircraft carrier operation by hardening the undercarriage. It also has much better 'over-the-nose' vision to make it easy to land aboard a carrier at a high angle of attack. Modifications made for Indian Navy requirement featured Zhuk-ME radar, RD-33MK engine, combat payload up to 5,500kg, 13 hardpoints (inclusive of the multi-lock bomb carriers), additional fuel tanks situated in <b>dorsal</b> spine <b>fairing</b> and wing LERXs, increased total fuel capacity by 50% comparing to first variant of MiG-29 and an updated 4-channel digital fly-by-wire flight control system. With special coatings, the MiG-29K radar reflecting surface is 4–5 times smaller than of basic MiG-29. Cockpit displays consist of wide HUDs, 3 [...] colour LCD MFDs (7 on the MiG-29KUB), a French Sigma-95 satellite GPS module and Topsight E helmet-mounted targeting system compatible with the full range of weapons carried by the MiG-29M and MiG-29SMT.|$|R
5000|$|The D.II was the {{production}} {{version of the}} experimental D.I. Lightened to improve performance, it also featured staggered wings and a more powerful 120 hp Mercedes D.II engine. The side and frontal radiators that had been tried in the D.I were replaced by a wing mounted radiator, similar to that later used by the Albatros D.III and D.V. The two bay wings were very strongly braced, with the trailing edge a wooden member, {{as opposed to the}} wire or cable common on many World War I German single-engined aircraft. Photographic evidence indicates that many examples were rigged with washout on the lower wings - giving the impression of a curved or twisted lower wing trailing edge. In some photos even the upper wings have a similar sort of [...] "trailing edge droop" [...] on the fixed section inboard of the ailerons. In comparison with the D.I, the pilot sat higher in his cockpit, to improve his view over the top wing. This required a <b>dorsal</b> turtleback <b>fairing</b> over the rear fuselage, to improve its lines.|$|R
2500|$|Its {{fuselage}} was slender, with {{a rounded}} cross-section. [...] The [...] water-cooled, double-supercharged, inverted V-12 Delage engine drove a large diameter, two blade propeller. Its radiators {{were in the}} wing. There were two on each side, one inboard and one outboard, both occupying the full chord and forming the wing skin. An open cockpit was placed a little {{in front of the}} trailing edge of the wing, within a narrow <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> which stretched over half the fuselage, starting close to the nose. The fuselage tapered rearwards to a conventional tail, with a round-tipped triangular tailplane, mounted at mid-fuselage, which had an adjustable angle of incidence. Its vertical tail was tall and slightly rounded and the unbalanced rudder extended down to the keel.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in January 1943, R8809 {{was used}} to test a new, clear, one piece sliding [...] "bubble" [...] canopy and its {{associated}} new windscreen structure which had slimmer frames which, together with the [...] "cut-down" [...] rear <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing,</b> provided a far superior all-around field of view to the car-door type. From November 1943 all production aircraft, starting with JR333, were to be so fitted. However, the complex modifications required to the fuselage and a long lead time for new components to reach the production line meant that it took some time before the new canopy became standard. In order to have as many Typhoons of 2nd TAF fitted before [...] "Operation Overlord" [...] conversion kits were produced and Gloster, Hawker and Cunliffe-Owen modified older Typhoons still fitted with the car-door canopy.|$|E
2500|$|The Handcross [...] was {{constructed}} from wood and fabric throughout. It was a three-bay biplane with equal-span wings without stagger or sweep. [...] The wings had parallel chord but the lower planes were significantly narrower than the upper; only the lower planes carried dihedral. [...] Ailerons, with back-set hinges to provide aerodynamic balance, were {{mounted on the}} upper planes alone. The wide-track divided main undercarriage had legs mounted on the wing front spar below the innermost interplane struts, braced to the fuselage. [...] The fuselage was flat-sided with a pronounced <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> or decking and a similar ventral fairing below. [...] The pilot sat in an open cockpit below the upper wing, with the gunner in a dorsal position behind him. [...] The gunner could also access two spaces in the belly: a prone position below the pilot for bomb aiming, or a rearward-firing gun position behind this. [...] The tail surfaces were conventional, rudder and elevators being horn-balanced; the rudder reached down below the fuselage bottom, protected by a small tailskid. [...] The V-12 watercooled Condor engine was cooled by a radiator in the nose below the boss of the two bladed metal Leitner-Watts propeller.|$|E
50|$|Externally, the XB-40 had the {{symmetrical}} waist {{windows of}} the standard B-17F and the second dorsal turret integrated into a <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing.</b> In contrast, most of the YB-40s had {{the positions of the}} waist windows staggered for better freedom of movement for the waist gunners, and the aft dorsal turret was moved slightly backwards so that it stood clear of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing.</b>|$|E

50|$|Series 600A and 600B - Change to Viper 601-22 engines, {{increased}} {{weights and}} operating speeds, 3 ft 1 in (0.94 m) fuselage stretch {{to increase capacity}} to 14 passengers, increased fuel capacity including an additional tank in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing,</b> revised aileron tab arrangements and aileron control gearing and improved aerodynamics. from 1976 the Series 600A aircraft were marketed as the Beechcraft Hawker BH.125 Series 600A.|$|E
50|$|The F-16 VISTA is a Block 30 F-16D {{based on}} the {{airframe}} design of the Israel Air Force version, which incorporates a <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> running {{the length of the}} fuselage aft of the canopy and a heavyweight landing gear derived from the Block 40 F-16C/D. The fairing houses most of the variable-stability equipment and test instrumentation. The heavyweight gear will permit simulation of aircraft with higher landing sink rates than a standard F-16.|$|E

50|$|Changes in the B95 version {{included}} a 19 in cabin stretch to increase rear cabin {{area and the}} horizontal stabilizer and elevators were enlarged for better pitch control. A curved vertical stabilizer <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> is the most noticeable change. It also {{included a}} fifth seat, wider chord flaps, and an increased gross weight of 100 pounds. The 1961 Model B95A featured fuel injected Lycoming IO-360-B1A engines. A total 150 B95's were built in 1960, and 81 B95A's were built between 1961 and 1962 (serial numbers TD-453 through TD-533). The 1960 model was priced at $51,500 and the 1961-62 model was priced at $49,500.|$|E
50|$|Messerschmitt M 23s {{had won the}} Circuit of Europe or Challenge International de Tourisme in both 1929 and 1930, {{assisting}} {{sales of}} the aircraft. The M.29 was designed to repeat this success. It was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of slightly smaller span than the M.23, with an enclosed continuous cockpit for two in tandem which blended smoothly into a <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> that extended aft to the fin. The latter carried a wide chord rudder and an all-moving tailplane, mounted on bracing towards {{the top of the}} fin. It had a clean cantilever spatted undercarriage. The wings could be folded at wing root hinges, back along the fuselage sides.|$|E

50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided and essentially rectangular, {{though there was}} decking to fair in the open cockpit, which had a small windshield, and a <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> to merge {{the rear of the}} pedestal to the tail. Under the cockpit, where the fuselage was deepest, there was a typical glider landing skid. Its conventional undercarriage had two balloon tyre mainwheels, each mounted on V-form split axles attached to the skid and with a shock absorbing strut fixed to the lower longeron. At the rear there was a tailskid. Both tail surfaces were straight tapered and straight cropped. Both rear control surfaces were much larger in area than their fixed counterparts and balanced; the rudder extended to the keel and operated in an elevator cut-out as the tailplane was mounted on the fin just above the fuselage, braced from above and below.|$|E
5000|$|The F-16 has a cropped-delta wing {{incorporating}} wing-fuselage blending and forebody vortex-control strakes; a fixed-geometry, underslung {{air intake}} (with splitter plate) {{to the single}} turbofan jet engine; a conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement with all-moving horizontal [...] "stabilator" [...] tailplanes; a pair of ventral fins beneath the fuselage aft of the wing's trailing edge; and a tricycle landing gear configuration with the aft-retracting, steerable nose gear deploying a short distance behind the inlet lip.

5000|$|Waldemar Voigt of Messerschmitt's Oberammergau {{project and}} {{development}} offices started a redesign of the 163 {{to incorporate the}} new twin-chamber Walter rocket engine, as well as fix other problems. The resulting Me 163C design featured a larger wing through {{the addition of a}}n insert at the wing root, an extended fuselage with extra tank capacity through the addition of a [...] "plug" [...] insert behind the wing, and a new pressurized cockpit topped with a bubble canopy for improved visibility, on a fuselage that had dispensed with the earlier B-version's <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing.</b> The additional tank capacity and cockpit pressurization allowed the maximum altitude to increase to 15850 m, as well as improving powered time to about 12 minutes, almost doubling combat time (from about five minutes to nine). Three Me 163 C-1a prototypes were planned, but it appears only one was flown, but without its intended engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Mita 3 is steel framed {{with wooden}} stringers, polygonal in cross-section and fabric covered {{apart from a}} glass reinforced plastic (GRP) nose cone and a short GRP <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> behind the cockpit. The rear of the single piece, starboard side hinged canopy rises upwards above the rear fuselage line, allowing the instructor to be placed above the pupil pilot in the front seat, with an upper and two small side transparencies to assist his view. The fuselage tapers gently rearwards to the straight tapered tail surfaces; the tailplane is mounted {{on the top of}} the fuselage and is, like the wing, a ply box structure with fabric covering aft and carrying fabric covered elevators with a cut out for rudder movement. The fin is similarly plywood skinned, with a small GRP fillet; the rudder, which extends to the keel, is fabric covered, mass balanced and has a GRP tip. The Mita 3 lands on a fixed, rubber sprung monowheel undercarriage and a fixed tailskid.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1980, General Dynamics began {{converting}} the sixth FSD F-16A {{to serve as}} the technology demonstrator aircraft for the joint Flight Dynamics Laboratory-NASA Advanced Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI) program. The AFTI F-16 built upon GD's experience with its YF-16 CCV program, and the AFTI F-16 even received the twin pivoting vertical ventral fins from the CCV aircraft, which were likewise installed under the air intake. The aircraft was also fitted with a narrow <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing</b> along its spine to house additional electronics. Technologies introduced and tested on the AFTI F-16 include a full-authority triplex Digital Flight Control System (DFCS), a six-degree-of-freedom Automated Maneuvering Attack System (AMAS), a 256-word-capacity Voice-Controlled Interactive Device (VCID) to control the avionics suite, and a helmet-mounted target designation sight that permitted the forward-looking infrared (FLIR) device and the radar to be automatically [...] "slaved" [...] to the pilot's head movement. First flight of the AFTI F-16 occurred on 10 July 1982. The Air Force Association gave its 1987 Theodore von Karman Award for the most outstanding achievement in science and engineering to the AFTI F-16 team.|$|E

The gunner could also access two spaces in the belly: a prone position below the pilot for bomb aiming, or a rearward-firing gun position behind this. The tail surfaces were conventional, rudder and elevators being horn-balanced; the rudder reached down below the fuselage bottom, protected by a small tailskid. The V-12 watercooled Condor engine was cooled by a radiator in the nose below the boss of the two bladed metal Leitner-Watts propeller.|$|E
40|$|Tests {{were made}} of an {{airplane}} model having a 45. 1 degree swept-back wing with aspect ratio 2. 50 and taper ratio 0. 42 and a 42. 8 degree swept-back horizontal tail with aspect ratio 3. 87 and taper ratio 0. 49 to determine its low-speed stability and control characteristics. The test Reynolds number was 2. 87 x 10 (6) based on a mean aerodynamic chord of 2. 47 feet except {{for some of the}} aileron tests which were made at a Reynolds number of 2. 05 x 10 (6). With the horizontal tail located near the fuselage juncture on the vertical tail, model results indicated static longitudinal instability above a lift coefficient that was 0. 15 below the lift coefficient at which stall occurred. Static longitudinal stability, however, was manifested throughout the life range with the horizontal tail located {{near the top of the}} vertical tail. The use of 10 degrees negative dihedral on the wing had little effect on the static longitudinal stability characteristics. Preliminary tests of the complete model revealed an undesirable flat spot in the yawing-moment curves at low angles of attack, the directional stability being neutral for yaw angles of plus-or-minus 2 degrees. This undesirable characteristic was improved by replacing the thick original vertical tail with a thin vertical tail and by flattening the top of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fairing...</b>|$|E
