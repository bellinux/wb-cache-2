50|$|<b>Draft</b> <b>angle</b> {{design is}} an {{important}} factor when designing plastic parts. Because of shrinkage of plastic material, injection molded parts have a tendency to shrink onto a core. This creates higher contact pressure on the core surface and increases friction between the core and the part, thus making ejection of the part from the mold difficult. Hence, draft angles should be designed properly to assist in part ejection. This also reduces cycle time and improves productivity. Draft angles should be used on interior and exterior walls of the part along the pulling direction. The minimum allowable <b>draft</b> <b>angle</b> is harder to quantify. Plastic material suppliers and molders are the authority on what is the lowest acceptable draft. In most instances, 1degree per side will be sufficient, but between 2 degree and 5 degree per side would be preferable. If the design is not compatible with 1 degree, then allow for 0.5 degree on each side. Even a small <b>draft</b> <b>angle,</b> such as 0.25 degree, is preferable to none at all.|$|E

During demolding, the forces that take place at the component-tool interface due to adhesion and friction need to be overcome.

50|$|The {{automatic}} {{hot forging}} process involves feeding mill-length steel bars (typically 7 m or 24 ft long) into {{one end of}} the machine at room temperature and hot forged products emerge from the other end. This all occurs very quickly; small parts can be made at a rate of 180 parts per minute (ppm) and larger can be made at a rate of 90 ppm.

The main advantages to this process are its high output rate and ability to accept low cost materials. Little labor is required to operate the machinery.

Layer thickness and <b>draft</b> <b>angle</b> selection for stereolithography injection mould tooling. International Journal of Production Research, 40 (3), pp. 719 - 729, is available at: [URL] introduction of rapid prototyping has allowed engineers and designers to generate physical models of required parts very early on in the design and development phase. Further to this, the use of stereolithography (SL) cavities as a rapid tooling method has allowed plastic prototype parts to be produced in their most common production manner [...] by injection moulding. The process is best suited to small production runs where the high costs of conventionally machined tooling is prohibitive. One of the major drawbacks of the SL injectionmoulding process is the susceptibility of the tools to premature failure. SL tools may break under the force exerted by part ejection when the friction between a moulding and a core is greater than the tensile strength of the core, resulting in tensile failure. Very few justified recommendations exist about the choice of mould design variables that can lower the part ejection force experienced and reduce the risk of SL tool failure. This research investigates the ejection forces resulting from SL injection moulding tools which are identical in all respects except for their build layer thickness and incorporated draft angles in an attempt to identify appropriate evidence for recommendations with respect to these design variables and SL injection moulding. The results show that adjustment of <b>draft</b> <b>angle</b> results in a change of part ejection force as a reasonably linear relationship. An adjustment of the build layer thickness results in a change in part ejection force as a more non-linear relationship. The adjustment of build layer thickness had a greater effect on ejection force than the adjustment of <b>draft</b> <b>angle.</b> The results also show that the surface roughness of all tools remains unchanged after moulding a number of parts in polypropylene. A mathematical model was used in an attempt to predict ejection forces according to the moulding material used. This model reflected the experimental results in terms of relative values but not in absolute values, which may be due to inappropriate specific values used in their calculation. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used in an attempt to identify the factors involved in the ejection process.
