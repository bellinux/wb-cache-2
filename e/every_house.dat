5|$|Along the Odishan coast, the cyclone {{generated}} a 5–6m (16–20ft) storm surge that brought {{water up to}} 35km (20mi) inland, inundating a large swath of coastal areas. The Indian Ministry of Urban Development estimated a peak storm surge height of 6.7m (22ft). One visually estimated storm surge of 9m (30ft) was reported; however, this estimate was determined to have been too high. Regardless, no in-situ measurement of the peak storm surge exists as all potential instruments were destroyed by the storm. Storm surge was responsible {{for a majority of}} the fatalities linked to the 1999Odisha cyclone, accounting for around 7,000deaths. The intense wave action sank 9,085fishing boats and caused the loss of 22,143fishing nets. Some fishing trawlers were carried and deposited 1.5–2.0km (0.9–1.2mi) inland. A 4km (2.5mi) stretch of road leading out of Paradip was covered by sand dunes measuring 1m (3.3ft) in height and 0.5km (0.3mi) in width. Paradip Port sustained severe damage to several components including various warehouses and its power transmission system, though its core infrastructure remained intact. Damage at the port was estimated at around ₹300million (US$6.9million). The storm surge destroyed nearly <b>every</b> <b>house</b> in Paradip near the point of landfall. In Gopalpur, 27villages were submerged by the surge. To the south in southern Andhra Pradesh, 48trawlers sank.|$|E
5|$|Aware {{that the}} Parliamentarians under Fairfax {{were on their}} way, Hopton {{increased}} {{the attacks on the}} town on 6 May. Further attacks the following day focused {{on the east side of}} the town, first bombarding it with cannon shot, and then storming the earthen redoubt that Blake had established. After some early success in which they captured one of the earthen forts, the attackers were forced back by a combination of musket shot, stones and boiling water. The next day, after yet more attacks made little impact, Hopton staged a battle on the south side of the town between two parties of his own army in an attempt to make Blake believe the Parliamentarian army had arrived. Hopton hoped that Blake would send out some of his own men to support the relieving force, but the feint failed. That evening, at around 7 pm, the Royalist force, which consisted of around 4,200 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, launched an all-out assault against the town. In heavy fighting, the attackers captured two of the earthen forts on the eastern side of town, and broke through the defences. Once inside Blake's outer perimeter, the besieging army discovered that there were Parliamentarian musketeers within <b>every</b> <b>house,</b> which prevented them advancing any further, though they did set fire to buildings, hoping to force the defenders to retreat. The tactic failed when the wind blew the flames back towards the Royalists, halting their attack.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the night}} of 2/3 April 1946, there were several attacks on railway {{installations}} around the country. One at Yibna occurred {{at the same time}} as a patrol from the 9th Parachute Battalion was entering the village. The patrol's leading two vehicles exploded mines that had been laid on a bridge, wounding three men. At daylight the tracks of around 30 men were found, and a section from the 8th Parachute Battalion eventually cornered 24 armed men. In the firefight that followed, 14 of them were wounded and the remainder surrendered, with no British casualties. On 29 June Operation Agatha started; the brigade had been rotated to cover the south of Palestine, and were to search for arms and arrest any members of the Palmach in Givat Brenner and No'ar Oved. On 22 July the King David Hotel in Jerusalem was bombed, which was the catalyst for Operation Shark, the searching of <b>every</b> <b>house</b> and property in Tel Aviv. For this operation the brigade had all the divisional artillery and the 3rd The King's Own Hussars under their command. The brigade's next tasks were Operations Bream and Eel between 28 August and 4 September, which entailed the search of Dorot and Ruhama in the Negev. For the first time army dogs trained in metal detecting were used during the operations, and they located a large arms cache in both settlements.|$|E
5|$|Six months later, King Stewart {{learns that}} Redbush {{is gone and}} {{he makes his way}} to Quahog to reclaim his wife and kill Griffin Peterson. King Stewart's army arrives in Quahog where they terrorize the colony (similar to a scene from Blazing Saddles). King Stewart orders Cockney First Lieutenant (Chris) to search <b>every</b> <b>house</b> for them. Upon being {{discovered}} by the First Lieutenant, Griffin Peterson and Lady Redbush are confronted by King Stewart. Griffin Peterson threatens to kill the officer, while King Stewart threatens to kill Redbush. After exchanging threats without getting anywhere, Griffin and Stewart decide to settle their dispute with a talent show, with the winner winning Lady Redbush's hand in marriage, and ownership of the town of Quahog. For his act, King Stewart steals his jester's mostly unfunny jokes about his Aunt Frieda. However, Griffin, Quagmire, Joe, Cleveland, Mort, and Seamus effectively steal the show with a techno-rock number from Revenge of the Nerds. This was enough to defeat King Stewart in the talent show. After King Stewart and his army leaves, Griffin and Redbush remain in Quahog to live happily ever after.|$|E
