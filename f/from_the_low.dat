5|$|Nicholas had {{no impact}} as a {{tropical}} cyclone, and impact <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> that absorbed {{the storm was}} limited to rainfall, gusty winds, and rough surf. Nicholas extended the above-average levels of tropical cyclone activity throughout the 2003 season, {{and was one of}} fourteen seasons to reach fourteen storms. The low that absorbed the storm nearly developed into a tropical cyclone, which would have been called Odette. However, moderate wind shear prevented further development.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{stones and}} {{materials}} were salvaged {{and used to}} rebuild the Hawkins priory in Virginia, the reconstructed house incorporated other designs and influences. Following the acquisition of the Warwickshire property, the Weddells hired chief architect Henry Grant Morse and scouted the English countryside, surveying properties and considering various designs they could incorporate into the rebuilding process. As a result, the reconstruction is not {{a replica of the}} original building. The west wing of the house is actually a replica of Sulgrave Manor, a small manor house in Northamptonshire, England, which once belonged to Lawrence Washington, an ancestor of America's first president, George Washington. However, the center of the house is a reproduction of the original Warwickshire priory and uses the curvilinear gables, strapwork design, and balustrades that the English commonly adapted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Low</b> Countries in the early seventeenth century. The east wing of the house, however, is based on Wormleighton Manor, a Spencer-Churchill family estate in England.|$|E

5|$|As it tracked northward, {{the storm}} failed to {{organize}} at first, {{due to the}} influence of an upper-level low to its south. The circulation became broad and elongated, as well as removed from the deepest convection. However, after moving away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>low,</b> the convection became better organized and more associated with the convection. After some initial slow organization continued, an area of deep convection developed over the center midday on September 20. An eye developed within the convection, and late on September 20 Jeanne re-attained hurricane status about 350mi (570km) east-northeast of the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|By August30, strong outflow {{developed}} around Luis despite convection remaining displaced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> pressure center. Once the shear {{began to}} relent, shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the center, allowing the storm to intensify. Around 1800UTC that day, Luis attained Category1 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; however, operationally Luis was not upgraded to a hurricane until 0900UTC on August31. The newly upgraded hurricane steadily intensified as banding features developed around {{the periphery of}} the cyclone. By the morning of August31, cold cloud tops surrounded a developing eye. Around this time, Luis was located due south of the area of high pressure and tracking steadily towards the west-northwest. Further development resulted in the appearance of a ragged eye appearing on visible satellite images. Winds within the eyewall were estimated at 100mph (155km/h), making Luis a low-end Category2 hurricane. Later that day, the storm became increasingly organized, with a symmetrical structure and a well-defined center. The NHC forecast the hurricane to peak as a Category3 hurricane in 36hours before interacting with Hurricane Iris and Tropical Storm Karen.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 3, {{strong wind}} shear over Chris {{detached}} the deep convection <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> level circulation, while a building ridge to its north turned the storm towards the west {{into an area}} of drier air. By mid-day on the 3rd the circulation was devoid of any convection within 85miles (135km), while the deeper convection spread across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. Late on August 3, deep convection developed over the center of circulation again, though persistent vertical shear weakened Chris to a tropical depression on August 4. Due to computer models predicting lesser amounts of shear, forecasters indicated the possibility of moderate strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico to a 60mph (95km/h) storm. However, convection remained minimal, and Chris degenerated into a remnant {{area of low pressure}} late on August 4. Late on August 5, convection increased in the remnants of the storm, and forecasters indicated the potential for slow development over the Gulf of Mexico due to marginally favorable conditions. Redevelopment never occurred, and the remnant circulation dissipated near Havana, Cuba on August 6.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Kyle {{began as}} a weak area of low {{pressure}} associated with a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on September12. The system tracked in a general westward direction with little convective development and tracked over the Leeward Islands on September18. An upper-level trough situated over the eastern Caribbean Sea interacted with the wave, resulting in an increase in shower and thunderstorm activity. The following day, a larger surface circulation developed as the low moved towards the northwest. The wave later became separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>low,</b> with the wave continuing towards the west and the low tracking to the northwest. The National Hurricane Center (NHC), at this time, were not anticipating significant development of the low as strong wind shear inhibited deep convection from forming. Around 1400UTC on September21, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued for the system as convection developed around the center of circulation.|$|E
5|$|MDOT is {{the agency}} {{responsible}} for the day-to-day maintenance and operations of the State Trunkline Highway System, which includes the U.S. Highways in Michigan. The numbering for these highways is coordinated through AASHTO, an organization composed of the various state departments of transportation in the United States. Under the scheme finalized in 1926, two-digit US Highways are numbered in a grid; east–west highways have even numbers while north–south routes have odd numbers. The lowest numbers are {{in the east and}} the north. The east–west highways in Michigan number in the single digits up to the low 20s. The north–south highways range <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> 20s into the 40s. There are also three three-digit highways numbered in the 100s and one in the 200s as branches of related two-digit highways.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the alert was issued, deep {{convection}} disappeared <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> while located 400mi (645km). Convection was anticipated to redeveloped later that night or early the next morning. The low was moving slowly towards the northwest due to a deep trough located over the Gulf of Mexico and a ridge of high pressure located over western Mexico. By the morning of July 3, convection had redeveloped near the low and its forward motion quickly increased to 11mph (18km/h). The low remained disorganized {{for the next two}} days as it steadily moved towards the northwest.|$|E

5|$|Partly {{inspired}} by {{his visit to the}} Spanish court in 1623, Charles became a passionate and knowledgeable art collector, amassing one of the finest art collections ever assembled. In Spain, he sat for a sketch by Velázquez, and acquired works by Titian and Correggio, among others. In England, his commissions included the ceiling of the Banqueting House, Whitehall, by Rubens and paintings by other artists <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Low</b> Countries such as van Honthorst, Mytens, and van Dyck. His close associates, including the Duke of Buckingham and the Earl of Arundel, shared his interest and have been dubbed the Whitehall Group. In 1627 and 1628, Charles purchased the entire collection of the Duke of Mantua, which included work by Titian, Correggio, Raphael, Caravaggio, del Sarto and Mantegna. His collection grew further to encompass Bernini, Bruegel, da Vinci, Holbein, Hollar, Tintoretto and Veronese, and self-portraits by both Dürer and Rembrandt. By Charles's death, there were an estimated 1760 paintings, most of which were sold and dispersed by Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Sauropelta {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} known nodosaurids. All specimens of S. edwardsorum were recovered from the Little Sheep Mudstone section of the Cloverly Formation in Wyoming and Montana, which has been dated to 108.5 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous. Sauropelta lived in wide floodplains around rivers that drained into the shallow inland sea to the north and east, carrying sediment eroded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> mountains to the west. Periodic flooding of these rivers covered the surrounding plains with new muddy sediments, creating the Cloverly Formation and burying the remains of many animals, some of which would be fossilized. At the end of Cloverly times, the shallow sea would expand to cover the entire region and would eventually split North America completely in half, forming the Western Interior Seaway. Abundant fossil remains of coniferous trees suggest that these plains were covered in forests. Grasses would not evolve until later in the Cretaceous, so Sauropelta and other Early Cretaceous dinosaurian herbivores browsed from a variety of conifers and cycads. Nodosaurids like Sauropelta had narrow snouts, an adaptation seen today in animals that are selective browsers as opposed to the wide muzzles of grazers.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Schellenberg {{was part}} of the Grand Alliance's {{campaign}} of 1704 to prevent the Franco-Bavarian army from threatening Vienna, the capital of Habsburg Austria. The campaign began in earnest on 19 May when the Duke of Marlborough began his 250-mile (400km) march from Bedburg near Cologne towards the Elector of Bavaria's and Marshal Marsin's Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Marlborough had initially deceived the French commanders– Marshal Villeroi in the Spanish Netherlands and Marshal Tallard along the Rhine– into thinking his target was Alsace or the Moselle farther to the north. However, when the Elector was notified on 5 June of Marlborough's march <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Low</b> Countries, he had correctly predicted that it was his principality of Bavaria that was the Allies' real target.|$|E

5|$|The non-tropical {{low that}} absorbed Nicholas dropped locally heavy {{rainfall}} across the Bahamas and southern Florida, {{as well as}} in portions of the northern Gulf Coast. Gusty winds <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> produced heavy surf and rip currents along the east and west coast of Florida, and a wind gust of 35mph (55km/h) was recorded in Cape Canaveral as a rainband from the system moved ashore. The low also resulted in two to four foot (0.6 to 1.2m) swells along the East Coast of the United States. Overall, no damage or deaths were associated with Nicholas or the low that absorbed it.|$|E
5|$|The {{role that}} gender plays {{in health care}} access can be {{determined}} by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female fetus is not aborted, the mother’s pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to being fed less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} such plats {{depicting}} naval actions and expeditions that {{are attributed to}} Anthony: the route of Anne of Cleves <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Low</b> Countries to England (1539), a French attack on a coastal fort (date unknown) and a French raid on Brighton (July 1545). The design of the ships in these paintings, especially that of the Brighton raid, closely match those in the rolls. It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished. It is only certain that it {{was presented to the}} king the year it was dated, 1546. The inclusion of the Mary Rose that sank at the Battle of the Solent 19 July 1545 does not mean it was necessarily started before this date, since it was still considered possible that she could be raised even as late as 1549. The galleasses, the Antelope, Hart, Bull and Tiger, all present in the second roll, were still being built around March 1546, and the Hart was not at sea until October that year. At the same time the Galley Blanchard, captured from the French 18 May 1546 is not included.|$|E

5|$|They first {{prepared}} a cheval de frise to prevent British ships from sailing up the Hudson and outflanking the American position. For {{more than a}} month, the troops transported boulders from the heights of Manhattan {{to the edge of}} the river, where they loaded them into a collection of hulks and cribs made of timber and stretched it across the river. When the cheval de frise was finished, they began work on the fort. Little soil covered the rocky surface, so men had to haul soil up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> ground. They were unable to dig the customary ditches or trenches around the fort. The fort was built in the shape of a pentagon with five bastions. The main walls were made of earth, constructed with ravelins with openings for guns from every angle. The fort enclosed a total of three to four acres. The troops built an abbattis around the fort. After the barracks were finished in September, all the troops in the area were placed under the command of Major General William Heath. Washington established his headquarters near the fort.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps ten {{per cent}} of the {{population}} lived in one of many burghs that {{had grown up in}} the later Medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. A characteristic of Scottish burghs was a long main street of tall buildings, with vennels, wynds and alleys leading off it, many of which survive today. In towns, traditional thatched half-timbered houses were interspersed with the larger stone and slate-roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry. Most wooden thatched houses have not survived, but stone houses of the period can be seen in Edinburgh at Lady Stair's House, Acheson House and the six-storey Gladstone's Land, an early example of the tendency to build upward in the increasingly crowded towns, producing horizontally divided tenements. Many burghs acquired tollbooths in this period, which acted as town halls, courts and prisons. They often had peels of bells or clock towers and the aspect of a fortress. The Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh was rebuilt on the orders of Mary Queen of Scots from 1561 and housed the parliament {{until the end of the}} 1630s. Other examples can be seen at Tain, Culross and Stonehaven, often showing influences <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Low</b> Countries in their crow-stepped gables and steeples.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication in Sabah and Sarawak were {{originally}} administered by Posts and Telecommunication Department until 1967, and {{maintained by the}} British Cable & Wireless Communications before all telecommunications management in the state been takeover by Peninsular-based company. The British telecommunication company have establish a submarine cable that linking Kota Kinabalu with Singapore and Hong Kong. Following {{the expansion of the}} Peninsular-based company on 1 January 1968, Sabah Posts and Telecommunication Department was merged with the Peninsular telecommunication department to formed Telecommunications Department Malaysia. All operations under Telecommunications Department Malaysia was then transferred to Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Berhad (STM) which become a public listed company in 1991 with the federal government retained a majority shareholding. There are also other telecommunication companies operating in the state although only providing cellular phone facilities. In 2006, the state has the lowest Direct Exchange Line (DEL) penetration rate, with cellular and internet dial-up penetrations rate only 6.5 per 100 inhabitants. Most residents <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> income groups would rather use mobile phones internet or use internet at their offices instead of setting up internet access at home as the Malaysian main internet provider of Telekom Malaysia were unable to build high speed low cost internet due to the high cost of equipment which are mostly sourced from abroad. Until the end of 2014, there were only 934 telecommunication hotspots in Sabah. Due to this, the government are working to increase the penetration and capability of internet connection as well {{to bridge the gap between}} Sabah and the Peninsular. The mobile telecommunications in Sabah are mostly use 4G and 3G and there is free rural Wi-Fi services provided by the federal government known as the Kampung Tanpa Wayar 1Malaysia (KTW) although Malaysia's public internet speeds are among the slower than many other countries.|$|E
