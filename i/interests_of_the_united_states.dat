5|$|During the year, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued {{advisories}} on tropical cyclones {{west of the}} International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula, {{and north}} of the equator; {{this was due to}} the agency's status as the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, as designated by the World Meteorological Organization in 1989. The JMA issued forecasts and analyses four times a day, beginning at 0000UTC and continuing every six hours. The JMA issued forecasts based on a climatological tropical cyclone forecast model. The agency estimated 10minute sustained winds and barometric pressure based on the Dvorak technique and numerical weather prediction. The JTWC also issued warnings on storms within the basin, operating from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii to represent the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Armed Forces in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.|$|E
5|$|On December 16, 1811, {{the first}} of the New Madrid {{earthquakes}} shook the South and the Midwest. Many Indians took the earthquake as a sign that Tenskwatawa's predictions of doom were coming true, and they supported Tecumseh in greater number, including many of his former detractors. They increased their attacks against European-American settlers and isolated outposts in the Indiana and Illinois Territories, resulting in the deaths of many civilians. The Shawnee partially rebuilt Prophetstown over the next year, but it was destroyed by a second US campaign in 1812. Tecumseh continued {{to play a major role}} in military operations on the frontier. By the time the U.S. declared war on Great Britain in the War of 1812, Tecumseh's confederacy was ready to launch its own war against the United States, this time with British allies. Tecumseh's warriors made up nearly half of the British forces that captured Detroit from the United States in the War of 1812. It was not until Tecumseh's death at the 1813 Battle of the Thames in Ontario that his confederacy ceased to threaten the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E
5|$|While the King was in California on January 31, the Straits Times of Singapore {{published}} {{a story that}} Kalākaua already had a representative in Germany finalizing {{the sale of the}} Kingdom of Hawaii. In April, Secretary of State James G. Blaine was made aware of various rumors that Kalākaua wanted to sell the kingdom to a nation other than the United States, and repeated them to Garfield, who in turn shared them in a letter to one of his friends. In an attempt to protect the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> Blaine made it clear to British diplomat Edward Thornton that priority on annexation belonged to the United States. Thornton filed a report with his government, sending a copy to Honolulu's British consul Wodehouse who shared it with Queen Dowager Emma, Princess Likelike, her husband Archibald Scott Cleghorn, Liliuokalani, and her husband John Owen Dominis. Although troubled by the rumors and by Blaine's stance on annexation, none of them had any knowledge of the situation and so forwarded the report to Kalākaua.|$|E

25|$|In 1898, {{when he was}} 11 years old, the United States invaded Puerto Rico.

25|$|World War II precipitated great {{changes in}} the economy of Massachusetts, which in turn led to changes in society. The {{aftermath}} of WWII created a global economy that was focused upon the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> both militarily and in relation to business. The domestic economy in the United States was altered by government procurement policies focused on defense. In the years following WWII, Massachusetts was transformed from a factory-based economy to one based on services and technology. During WWII, the U.S. government had built facilities that they leased, and in the post-war years sold, to defense contractors. Such facilities contributed to an economy focused on creating specialized defense goods. That form of economy prospered {{as a result of}} the Cold War, the Vietnam War, and the Korean War.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{had long}} been {{interested}} in acquiring Cuba from the declining Spanish Empire. As with Texas, Oregon, and California, American policy makers were concerned that Cuba would fall into British hands, which, according to the thinking of the Monroe Doctrine, would constitute {{a threat to the}} <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Prompted by John L. O'Sullivan, in 1848 President Polk offered to buy Cuba from Spain for $100million. Polk feared that filibustering would hurt his effort to buy the island, and so he informed the Spanish of an attempt by the Cuban filibuster Narciso López to seize Cuba by force and annex it to the United States, foiling the plot. Nevertheless, Spain declined to sell the island, which ended Polk's efforts to acquire Cuba. O'Sullivan, on the other hand eventually landed in legal trouble.|$|E
25|$|To manage U.S. {{maritime}} {{interests in}} South India, Joy appointed American merchant William Abbott {{as the first}} American consular agent of the Madras Presidency on 24 November 1794, who served {{for more than a}} decade. The Indo-American trade experienced a hiatus for several decades that followed, and, when it revived, a separate U.S. consular agency was established in Madras on 24 May 1867 with Joseph L. Thompson, of Massachusetts, serving as the consular agent to Madras. He served till October 1872. The consular agents in Madras were expected to report directly to the State Department of the U.S. government. The post continued as a consular agency under the Consulate General at Calcutta until 1908. The main role of the consular agents during those times was to promote trade and business <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> and most consular agents between 1867 until 1908 were selected from the ranks of expatriate businessmen.|$|E
