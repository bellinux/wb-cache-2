40|$|The zeta {{potentials}} and {{yield stresses}} of silica suspensions were measured {{over a wide}} range of monovalent electrolyte concentrations. The counterions investigated were Li⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, and Cs⁺, while the co-ion was always Cl⁻. The poorly <b>hydrated</b> <b>ions</b> (Cs⁺ and K⁺) adsorb in greater quantity to the silica surface than the well-hydrated ions (Li⁺ and Na⁺) and produce lower magnitude negative zeta potentials at high pH. At high electrolyte concentrations and at low pH the poorly hydrated counterions adsorb in great enough quantity to reverse the sign of the zeta potential from negative to positive. This specific adsorption of counterions shifts the iep to higher values. The shift in the iep {{is directly related to the}} hydration of the counterion with the least <b>hydrated</b> <b>ions</b> creating the greatest iep shift.

TSCF of each cation was negatively correlated with the transpiration rate {{as in the case}} of Na+. These results indicated that ion exclusion rates change with the transpiration rate. At the same transpiration rate, TSCF of IR 28 was lower than that of KR 1, which indicated that exclusion efficiency was essentially higher in IR 28. The differences in TSCF of K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + between both varieties were relatively small compared with those of Na+ and Li+. These results indicated that the difference in exclusion rate between varieties was affected by ion species.

Speciation study of metals in sediment provides information on the potential availability of metals (toxic) to biota under various environmental conditions. In water, the toxic metal specie is the free hydrated metal ion. The toxicity of metals depends especially on their chemical forms rather than their total metal content. The present study focuses on Qaraaoun Reservoir, Lebanon. Earlier studies focused only on total metal concentrations in sediment and water. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine metal speciation (Fe, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd) in the (operationally defined) sediment chemical fractions and metal speciation in reservoir water. This would reflect on metal bioavailability and toxicity. Water samples and bed sediments were collected from nine sites during the dry season and a sequential chemical fraction scheme was applied to the < 75 -μm sieve sediment fraction. Metal content in each fraction was determined by the FAAS technique. The data showed that the highest percentages of total metal content in sediment fractions were for: Fe in residual followed by reducible, Cr and Ni in residual and in reducible, Cu in organic followed by exchangeable, Zn in residual and in organic, Pb in organic and carbonate, Cd was mainly in carbonate. Total metal content in water was determined by ICP-MS technique and aqueous metal speciation was predicted using AQUACHEM software interfaced to PHREEQC geochemical computer model. The water speciation data predicted that a high percentage of Pb and Ni were present as carbonate complex species and low percentages as free hydrated ions, highest percentage of Zn as carbonate complex species followed by free <b>hydrated</b> <b>ion,</b> highest percentage of Cd as free <b>hydrated</b> <b>ion</b> followed by carbonate complex species.

Theoretical calculations show that increasing the solvent polarity increases the energy of the electronic transition related to the measured V oc.

Such ion-induced {{changes of}} water dynamics {{have long been}} rationalized {{in terms of the}} change of water structure around the ions.

Through the synthesis of the above three, we formulate a scheme to correlate the ion-induced water dynamics changes to the water structure. With this new formulation, it is shown that chaotropic or negatively <b>hydrated</b> <b>ions</b> preferentially bind the transition state of water motion thereby stabilizing the transition state, whereas the exclusion of kosmotropes or positively <b>hydrated</b> <b>ions</b> suppresses the formation of the transition state.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{reorientation}} dynamics of water molecules around ions using terahertz dielectric relaxation spectroscopy and polarization-resolved femtosecond infrared pump-probe spectroscopy. The results {{are discussed in}} relation to the ion-specific Hofmeister series and the concomitant "structure-making" and "structure-breaking" effects of ions on water. We show that when a dissolved salt consists of a strongly <b>hydrated</b> <b>ion</b> with a weakly hydrated counterion the reorientation of water molecules around the strongly <b>hydrated</b> <b>ion</b> is anisotropic, in the sense that differently charged ions affect reorientation along different molecular axes: cations mainly slow the reorientation dynamics of the water dipole vectors, and anions mainly slow down the reorientation dynamics of the hydroxyl group that points toward the anion. In both cases, motion along only one molecular axis is impeded, so that the hydration shell is best described as semirigid. In this semirigid hydration picture, water molecules in the first hydration shell show anisotropic reorientation, whereas water molecules outside the first hydration shell remain unaffected. The inferred anisotropy in molecular motion explains why terahertz dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, which probes dipolar relaxation, is more sensitive to cation hydration effects while femtosecond infrared pump-probe spectroscopy, which is sensitive to reorientation of hydroxyl groups, is more sensitive to anion hydration effects. We also show that dissolution of CsI—a salt for which both cation and anion are weakly hydrated—has little effect on water reorientation dynamics, with hydration water displaying dynamics that are similar to those in bulk wate...|$|E
