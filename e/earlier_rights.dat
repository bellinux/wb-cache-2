500|$|In 1915, the C.L.Best Gas Traction Co. {{exhibited}} its new [...] "Tracklayer" [...] at the California state fair. Holt {{once again}} sued, {{this time for}} patent infringement. C.L.Best thought that his best defense was to prove that Holt's patents violated Lombard's patents. One of Best's lawyers, Henry Montgomery, visited Lombard and sought his assistance as a friendly witness. Lombard was more than friendly. He allegedly responded, [...] "By God, young man, I'm glad to see you. If God Almighty could charter me to kill a man, I'd get on the train and go to California and kill old Ben Holt." [...] Best bought all rights to Lombard's 1901 and 1907 patents for $20,000, which pre-dated Holt's [...] "crawler" [...] patents also purchased from Lombard. Holt's <b>earlier</b> <b>rights</b> to the Lombard patents were annulled and Best counter-sued Holt.|$|E

It considers the inclusion of this right in an array of historical and social analyses: its object of study; the generations of the rights that come out it; its relationship to other rights (partly explained by its development in the 19 th century together with the right of expression, but later gaining autonomy from the right to expression during the 20 th century); its character as an individual right (and conversely, as a collective or social right); its character in respect to private life; and its relationship to denial, lying, and secrecy. In conclusion, the article presents a chart that summarizes the arguments of the paper and some of the authors discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|Resumé Community Trade Mark and Impediments to Registration Trademarks take {{important}} {{and still more}} preferred part of entrepreneur legal protection portfolio. The effects of European integration are partially visible in corresponding approximation of national trademark law of member states. The remaining barriers of cross- border undertakings in whole European Union were substantially mitigated by this new legal instrument, which grants its proprietor an exclusive right to prevent unauthorized use of the mark in trade without his consent. This diploma thesis deals with possible impediments to registration of Community trade mark. For an entrepreneur, {{it is crucial to}} know whether he may reasonably expect, that his trademark application will remain unchallenged. Therefore, the question must be raised on whether the mark is registrable as such. Since this is not the only nor the most frequent issue, the focus is made on the conflict with <b>earlier</b> <b>rights</b> as well. The systematization of this work is, to a certain extent, based on observation of respective parts of Council Regulation (EC) No. 207 / 2009 of 26 February 2009, dealing with absolute and relative grounds for refusal of a Community trade mark.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>early</b> <b>right</b> ear {{deafness}} on lateralisation of auditory language functions {{are not fully}} known. A 36 year old right handed man, {{with a history of}} perinatal right ear deafness and undergoing evaluation for surgical treatment of seizures that began at age 10 years was studied. Language lateralisation testing by intracarotid sodium amobarbital injection showed receptive and expressive language functions to be strongly lateralised to the left hemisphere. Results with intracarotid sodium amobarbital injection further suggested that transmission of auditory input to the patient's left hemisphere was partially dependent on ipsilateral left ear pathways. Cortical language mapping through implanted subdural electrodes localised auditory language functions to traditional left posterior perisylvian language areas. These results suggest that <b>early</b> <b>right</b> ear deafness does not impede left hemisphere lateralisation and localisation of auditory language functions. Moreover, transmission of auditory information to the patient's left hemisphere seems to be accomplished, in part, by recruitment of ipsilateral left ear pathways. ...|$|R

40|$|During {{listening}} to a musical piece, unexpected harmonies may evoke brain responses that are reflected electrically as an <b>early</b> <b>right</b> anterior negativity ~ERAN! and a late frontal negativity ~N 5 !. In the present study we demonstrate that these components of the event-related potential can be evoked preattentively, that is, even when a musical stimulus is ignored. Both ERAN and N 5 differed in amplitude {{as a function of}} music-theoretical principles. Participants had no special musical expertise; results thus provide evidence for an automatic processing of musical information in "nonmusicians. " Descriptors: Electroencephalography, Auditory processing, Music, <b>Early</b> <b>right</b> anterior negativity, N 5 In recent studies ~Koelsch et al., 2001; Koelsch, Gunter, Friederici, & Schroger, 2000; Maess, Koelsch, Gunter, & Friederici, 2001 !,it was found that within a musical context, harmonically unrelated chords elicit early and late event-related brain potentials ~ERPs!, termed by the authors the <b>early</b> <b>right</b> anterior negativity ~ERAN! and the N 5. The term "harmonically unrelated" refers to the fact that, for example, within a C-major context ~i. e., within a sequence consisting of chords in C-major! a subsequent C-major chord is harmonically related, whereas a chord from, for example, d-flatmajor is harmonically unrelated ~for more detailed descriptions see, e. g., Krumhansl, & Kessler, 1982; Patel, Gibson, Ratner, Besson, & Holcomb, 1998; Schnberg, 1969 !. The ERAN reflected the violation of a musical expectancy and was generated due to an exact representation of the major [...] minor tonal system in the brains of listeners. The N 5 was suggested to reflect processes of harmonic integration. Both ERP components varied in amplitude {{as a function of the}} degree of harmonic expectancies induc [...] ...|$|R
