5|$|On 17 May, in a {{game where}} they needed to defeat Atlético Madrid (who had {{eliminated}} them from the Champions League in the quarter-finals earlier in the year) to be crowned champions of La Liga for the 23rd time, they drew after Atlético defender Diego Godín <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> the equaliser in the 49th minute, giving Atlético the championship.|$|E
5|$|The two lead brigades split their {{advances}} {{into two}} directions, although not on brigade boundaries.

5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} quicker {{of the two}} teams. Inside a minute, a miskick by Manchester United left back John Aston troubled his defence, and {{presented}} Reg Lewis and Rooke with shooting opportunities. After three minutes, Arsenal took the lead; combination play from Jimmy Logie and Bryn Jones forced goalkeeper Jack Crompton out of his area, and ended with Jones hitting the ball high into an empty net. Lewis <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> Archie Macaulay's cross from the right to double Arsenal's lead, and the team scored their third almost immediately, when Rooke maneuvered past the United defence to shoot past Crompton.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, receiving a bye as a Premier League club. Their opening match was a 2–0 home win against Cardiff City on 7 January 2006, with both goals scored by Pirès. Arsenal faced Bolton Wanderers the following round; an understrength team lost 1–0 after Giannakopulos <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> the winning goal, six minutes {{from the end of}} the match.|$|E
5|$|In the 37th minute Arsenal overcame their {{numerical}} disadvantage {{to score}} when Sol Campbell <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> from a free-kick following Carles Puyol's foul on Emmanuel Eboué, although some observers believed that Eboué appeared to dive. Arsenal held onto their lead {{for the remainder}} of the half, as Barcelona's best chance came courtesy of Eto'o, whose shot hit the post via a save from Almunia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} against Barcelona, Lehmann was sent off in 18th minute for a {{professional}} foul on striker Samuel Eto'o. Wenger reacted by substituting Robert Pirès for goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, thus altering the formation. In spite of the disadvantage, Arsenal {{took the lead in}} the 37th minute, after Henry's free kick was <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> by Campbell. Henry missed a chance in the second half to give Arsenal a two-nil lead before Eto'o equalised with 14 minutes left. Substitute Henrik Larsson set up Juliano Belletti to score the winner for Barcelona. Wenger criticised referee Terje Hauge for sending off Lehmann, a view shared by club captain Henry and FIFA president Sepp Blatter.|$|E

5|$|Crystal Palace were Cardiff's {{opponents in}} the semi-final which was played over two-legs. The first leg was played at Palace's home ground Selhurst Park. Cardiff started the match the better of the two sides but were unable to convert their chances. Palace {{took the lead in}} the 43rd minute when Anthony Gardner <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> Darren Ambrose's cross. Neither side scored again and the match ended 1–0. The second leg at the Cardiff City Stadium started well for Cardiff when they went ahead in the seventh minute after an own-goal from Palace defender Gardner, which {{levelled}} the aggregate score at 1–1. Palace were reduced to ten men in the second half when Paddy McCarthy was sent-off. Despite their numerical advantage Cardiff were unable to a second goal during the 90 minutes and extra-time and the tie went to a penalty shoot-out.

5|$|Ferris offers {{himself in}} {{exchange}} to Aisha's kidnappers, and {{is brought to}} the middle of the desert, with Hoffman watching everything via a surveillance drone. Ferris is surrounded by a group of SUVs, which circle him to create an obscuring dust cloud before picking him up. The dust cloud blocks Hoffman's view, so that he cannot determine which of the SUVs, now <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> different directions, is carrying Ferris. Ferris is taken across the border to Syria where he is to be interrogated by Al-Saleem. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told that someone has lied to him and that he has been double-crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator (Karami) in his organization who works for Ferris, and that, by association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris. Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, beats him, turns on a video camera and orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life. Al-Saleem is shown arrested in his own SUV by Marwan Se-Kia, Hani Salaam's security officer.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool faced Stoke City in the Sixth Round at Anfield. Suárez {{scored in}} the 23rd minute to give Liverpool the lead, before former player Peter Crouch {{equalised}} three minutes later.

Nikica Jelavić scored in the 24th minute after a Liverpool defensive error, to give Everton a 1–0 lead. Liverpool equalised {{in the second half}} when Suárez scored after a back-pass from Everton defender Sylvain Distin. The match looked to be heading towards extra time, before Carroll <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> a Craig Bellamy free kick in the 87th minute to give Liverpool a 2–1 victory and secure their place in the final {{for the first time since}} 2006, when they defeated West Ham United.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool won the toss and kicked-off. Within {{the first}} four minutes Liverpool had scored. Markus Babbel <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> a Gary McAllister free-kick to put Liverpool 1–0 up.

Two minutes later, Martín Astudillo was shown a yellow card for a {{challenge}} on Heskey. Liverpool player Gary McAllister also received a yellow card after he confronted the Alavés player over his challenge. Alavés first opportunity to score was in the 12th minute. They were awarded a free-kick {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool penalty area following a challenge by Stéphane Henchoz. Oscar Téllez curled a shot towards Liverpool's goal, however, Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld pushed the ball away from goal. Three minutes later, Michael Owen collected a Dietmar Hamann pass and played a diagonal pass to Steven Gerrard, whose shot beat the Alavés keeper Herrera to put Liverpool 2–0 ahead.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City's quarter-final {{was against}} Burnley of the Second Division. City {{took the lead}} early in the match {{following}} a solo goal by Tilson. In the second-half Burnley discarded their passing game in favour of a direct approach, and pressured the Manchester City goal. The City defence stood firm, and the match finished 1–0. City's opponents for the semi-final, held at Leeds Road, Huddersfield, were Derby County. Derby had two chances to score in the first half, but both were missed. A Manchester City counter-attack produced the opening goal, when Brook crossed and Toseland <b>headed</b> <b>in.</b> By midway through the second half Manchester City led by three goals. The second was scored by Tilson, a follow-up after an initial saved shot. McMullan scored the third after dribbling through the Derby defence. Derby mounted a late comeback. A goal by Howard Fabian reduced the deficit to two, and Sammy Crooks added a late second for Derby, {{but it was too}} late to affect the result of the match, which ended 3–2.|$|E
5|$|On the 36th lap, Glock's right-rear {{suspension}} failed {{coming out}} of the final corner. He spun through 180 degrees before hitting the pit wall with a strong rearward impact, with debris flying across the track. The car, pointing the wrong way, rolled to a stop on the grass. A dazed Glock extracted himself before being treated at the medical centre. The safety car was deployed after the accident. When the pit lane opened on lap38, most drivers <b>headed</b> <b>in,</b> including all of the leaders except Hamilton. McLaren believed that Hamilton had enough fuel to stay out, the plan being for him to then rapidly pull away from his heavily-fuelled rivals, after the safety car went in. Hamilton needed to build up enough of a lead to rejoin still in first position, following his final pit stop. This would prove to be very risky, as Massa rejoined in fourth position, fuelled to the finish.|$|E

However, within five minutes, it was 2–1 to Porto when Deco's through ball found Dmitri Alenichev, who scored with a low shot. Just three minutes later, Celtic equalised once again through Henrik Larsson when he <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> Alan Thompson's corner. After this, the game stagnated {{until a couple of}} minutes {{from the end of the}} game when Jackie McNamara's errant pass found Alenichev, who shot over the crossbar.|$|E
