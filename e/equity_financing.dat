It offers an array of debt and <b>equity</b> <b>financing</b> services and helps companies face their risk exposures while refraining from participating in a management capacity.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{importance}} of new public firms and public <b>equity</b> <b>finance</b> for R 2 ̆ 6 D and creative destruction in the U. S. high-tech sector. Over 1900 new public firms enter high-tech manufacturing between 1970 and 2004; they are increasingly R 2 ̆ 6 D intensive and rely extensively on public <b>equity</b> <b>finance</b> in the 1980 s and 1990 s. We estimate dynamic R 2 ̆ 6 D models and find a strong link between public <b>equity</b> <b>finance</b> and R 2 ̆ 6 D for new entrants, but not established entrants or incumbents. Further, recent cohorts of public entrants have a substantial economic impact: by 2000, recent public entrants account for almost half of high-tech sales {{and more than half}} of R 2 ̆ 6 D. Variation in the availability of public <b>equity</b> <b>finance</b> has a marked impact on entrant R 2 ̆ 6 D and the rate at which entrants take market share from incumbents.

25|$|The D.C. City Council voted {{unanimously}} on June 29, 2009, {{in favor of}} the new financing package. The deal was revised somewhat from the June 17 agreement. The city agreed to issue $225 million in bonds (down from $267 million) in order to give Marriott $159 million in <b>equity</b> <b>financing</b> (an increase from $135 million). TIF revenues from the hotel project itself would pay for $135 million in <b>equity</b> <b>financing,</b> while the other $24 million in equity money would come from other TIF revenue sources in the city. A new wrinkle in the plan was that WCSA would contribute a $25 million loan (payable over 25 years) as well as a one-time $22 million grant to build the hotel. The city also agreed to eliminate the requirement that a parking garage be built near the hotel.|$|E

The higher equity participation meant that Marriott would {{no longer need to}} seek private lending as part of the agreement—which meant construction could go forward without the long delay that would occur while seeking bank loans.

2500|$|Management must {{identify}} the [...] "optimal mix" [...] of financing – the capital structure {{that results in}} maximum firm value, (See Balance sheet, WACC) but must also take other factors into account (see trade-off theory below). Financing a project through debt results in a liability or obligation that must be serviced, thus entailing cash flow implications independent of the project's degree of success. <b>Equity</b> <b>financing</b> is less risky with respect to cash flow commitments, but results in a dilution of share ownership, control and earnings. The cost of equity (see CAPM and APT) is also typically higher {{than the cost of}} debt - which is, additionally, a deductible expense – and so <b>equity</b> <b>financing</b> may result in an increased hurdle rate which may offset any reduction in cash flow risk.|$|E

2500|$|Entrepreneurs may {{attempt to}} [...] "bootstrap-finance" [...] their {{start-up}} rather than seeking external investors. One {{of the reasons}} that some entrepreneurs prefer to [...] "bootstrap" [...] is that obtaining <b>equity</b> <b>financing</b> requires the entrepreneur to provide ownership shares to the investors. If the start-up becomes successful later on, these early <b>equity</b> <b>financing</b> deals could provide a windfall for the investors and a huge loss for the entrepreneur. As well, if investors have a significant stake in the company, {{they may be able to}} exert influence on company strategy, CEO choice, and other important decisions. This is often problematic since the investor and the founder might have different incentives regarding the long-term goal of the company. An investor will generally aim for a profitable exit and therefore promotes a high-evaluation IPO in order to sell their shares. Whereas the entrepreneur might have philanthropic intentions as their main driving force. Soft values like this might not go well with the short-term pressure on yearly and quarterly profits that publicly traded companies often experience from their owners.|$|E

In general, the finance methods comprise of internal finance and external finance, based on whether the funds come from the inside or outside of the corporation.

2500|$|In {{corporate}} finance, a company's {{capital structure}} {{is the total}} mix of financing methods it uses to raise funds. One method is debt financing, which includes bank loans and bond sales. Another method is <b>equity</b> <b>financing</b> – the sale of stock by a company to investors, the original shareholders (they own {{a portion of the}} business) of a share. [...] Ownership of a share gives the shareholder certain contractual rights and powers, which typically include the right to receive declared dividends and to vote the proxy on important matters (e.g., board elections). [...] The owners of both bonds (either government bonds or corporate bonds) and stock (whether its preferred stock or common stock), may be institutional investors – financial institutions such as investment banks and pension funds or private individuals, called private investors or retail investors.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the theory}} here, falls under the {{umbrella}} of the Trade-Off Theory in which firms are assumed to trade-off the tax benefits of debt with the bankruptcy costs of debt when choosing how to allocate the company's resources. However economists have developed a set of alternative theories about how managers allocate a corporation's finances. One of the main alternative theories of how firms manage their capital funds is the Pecking Order Theory (Stewart Myers), which suggests that firms avoid external financing while they have internal financing available and avoid new <b>equity</b> <b>financing</b> while they can engage in new debt financing at reasonably low interest rates. [...] Also, Capital structure substitution theory hypothesizes that management manipulates the capital structure such that earnings per share (EPS) are maximized. An emerging area in finance theory is right-financing whereby investment banks and corporations can enhance investment return and company value over time by determining the right investment objectives, policy framework, institutional structure, source of financing (debt or equity) and expenditure framework within a given economy and under given market conditions. One of the more recent innovations in this area from a theoretical point of view is the Market timing hypothesis. This hypothesis, inspired in the behavioral finance literature, states that firms look for the cheaper type of financing regardless of their current levels of internal resources, debt and equity.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple model capturing differences between debt and <b>equity</b> <b>finance</b> {{to examine how}} financial structure matters for macroeconomic volatility. Debt finance is relatively cheap {{in the sense that}} debt holders need to verify relatively few profitability states, but debt finance may lead to costly bankruptcy. At the aggregate level, a more debt-based financial structure leads to a higher bankruptcy rate. Therefore, aggregate output is more variable in case of a heavy reliance on debt finance. This paper provides empirical evidence that countries with more <b>equity</b> <b>finance</b> have a lower variance of GDP and a lower probability of episodes of negative economic growth. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} UK {{public policy}} addressing the seed and early stage <b>equity</b> <b>finance</b> gap since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Drawing on {{lessons learned from}} recent studies of UK and international government equity schemes, two contemporary models of government backed <b>equity</b> <b>finance</b> are examined.

The paper highlights the shortcomings of traditional interim fund performance analysis and presents current demand and supply side evidence that establishes that these schemes are making attributable impacts on their portfolio businesses and the wider UK economy. It also demonstrates that they are playing important roles in the establishment of a new post GFC UK finance escalator. However, whilst these schemes were found to be currently complementary and effective, their future roles within the UK’s evolving post GFC seed and early stage equity markets are also considered.
