40|$|We {{extend a}} simple {{model of a}} charge trap coupled to a single-electron box to energy ranges and {{parameters}} such that it gives new insights and predictions readily observable in many experimental systems. We show that a single background charge is enough to give lines of differential conductance in the stability diagram of the quantum dot, even within undistorted Coulomb diamonds. It also suppresses the current near degeneracy of the impurity charge, and yields negative differential lines far from this degeneracy. We compare this picture to two other accepted explanations for lines in diamonds, based respectively on the excitation spectrum of a quantum dot and on fluctuations of the density-of-states in the contacts. In order to discriminate between these models we emphasize the specific features related to <b>environmental</b> <b>charge</b> traps.

40|$|In this study, pulsed {{measurement}} techniques to suppress hysteresis in carbon nanotube (CNT) field-effect transistor (CNTFET) transfer characteristics are demonstrated. As hysteresis is reduced, both {{forward and backward}} gate voltage sweeps move toward a common, unique central transfer characteristic that reveals the “true” device mobility. Time constants associated with <b>environmental</b> <b>charge</b> trapping, at various ambient temperatures from 80 to 453 K are extracted. Hysteresis dependence of pulsed measurements is compared under air, high-temperature, and vacuum conditions. Using such measurements we investigate the error on carrier mobility associated with mobility extractions from forward and backward DC gate voltage sweeps. A pulsed electrical breakdown technique to increase the ION/IOFF ratio of carbon nanotube random network transistors is also demonstrated. The ratio is increased by three orders of magnitude, with minimal reduction in ION (< 50 %). It is shown that adsorbed water rather than oxygen promotes nanotube breakdown.

40|$|Abstract: The paper proposes the {{framework}} of China environmental taxation policy, put forward schemes for environmental taxes in China and implementation strategy for environmental tax policy in China. Key Words: Environmental taxation policy, framework, scheme, implementation strategy Environmental tax policy {{is used as a}} kind of economic means to regulate pollution and to protect environment. In a broad sense, it includes to establish environmental tax, fiscal and preferential policies related with environment and natural resources, as well as to eliminate subsidy and <b>environmental</b> <b>charge</b> policies, which are harmful for environmental protection. From this point of view, many countries have their environmental tax policies. In a narrow sense, environmental tax means to collect or reduce taxes from impersonal entities or individuals which are engaged in developing, protecting or utilizing environmental resources, according to the degrees of the exploitation, pollution, destroy or protection of the environmental resources. Therefore, few countries regard environmental tax as one of categories of taxes to implement.

40|$|The {{consumption}} {{of bottled water}} in Italy began in the 1970 s. Since then, this usage has grown considerably, also {{as a result of}} changes in habits. The environmental impact {{as a result of the}} water production chain is very significant; it would be considered, for example, the use of plastic bottles, the {{consumption of}} oil in the production of the bottles, the emission of air from the vehicles that transport the bottles, non-recycled plastic packaging, etc. In this study, considering the comparison between two situations, use of bottled water and use of water kiosk (WK), an environmental and economic impact evaluation has been done. The study considered the production of a WK in a town with 9000 inhabitants, which supplies controlled, still and sparkling water, with an organoleptic quality higher than tap water coming from the aqueduct. In particular, taking into consideration the environmental aspects, specific attention was paid both to CO 2 emissions and PET bottle waste reduction. The economic impact evaluation was carried out from the consumer's point of view. In order to provide a supply service that was economically sustainable, a calculation was done with the aim of determining a specific fee for the supplied water. Moreover, a comparison has been made between quality parameters achieved with the analysis of water from aqueducts with the limits established in the Italian legislation and the parameters of several Italian water brands. The study has the aim at considering the opportunity to follow a different people's habits, closer to the concept of sustainability, reducing the <b>environmental</b> <b>charge</b> related to the realization, transport and consumption of plastic water bottles without significant reduction of the quality of the service and with convenient and interesting economic implications. In fact the results of the study show that the alternative of WKs is more efficient in economic and environmental terms respect to the use of bottled water...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe optical {{resonance}} linewidth {{of a single}} quantum emitter provides a direct measurement of decoherence in the system, which is a quantity of interest to certain quantum technological applications and ultimately sets a fundamental limitation for these materials. However, accessing the homogeneous linewidth has proven problematic in semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) due {{to the effect of}} spectral diffusion (SD), which is a random fluctuation of the transition energy. Instabilities in the spectral position are discouraging for potential applications in for example coherent control of quantum states and coupled systems, thus so far there have been few reports using NCs in such applications. At cryogenic temperatures high quality NCs exhibit slow relaxation between closely spaced band-edge states resulting in stable multiline spectra. Inter-state relaxation properties are explored using a near-resonant photoluminescence excitation of higher-lying states to selectively excite specific band-edge states, revealing significant population redistribution, indicative of slow relaxation between the band-edge states. This state-selective excitation reveals unexpected spin-dependent non-radiative relaxation channels that need {{to be taken into account}} in order to understand the final state populations. In colloidal NCs, thermal excitation of acoustic phonons can be inhibited at cryogenic temperatures, eliminating a major dephasing mechanism, therefore one might expect to observe lifetime limited transitions in high quality colloidal NCs. High-resolution excitation scans of individual spectral lines of apparently ultra-stable NCs, reveal spectral lines significantly broader than the lifetime limit. By performing a series of successive scans over the same spectral line, the underlying SD is revealed. This SD is notable in that it results in symmetric broadening of the excitation scan, indicating that the origin is not photo-induced. Thus a persistent contribution to SD is revealed. The magnitudes of the spectral shifts are consistent with <b>environmental</b> <b>charge</b> noise known to be associated with random polymer matrices and so most likely emanate from the disordered local environment of the NC, which may include the ligand shell. This persistent SD ultimately limits the linewidth of the band-edge states in colloidal NCs to the 1 GHz regime, approximately an order of magnitude greater than the lifetime limit...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{potential}} for problems regarding public acceptability of environmental taxes with: a review of waste charges literature; {{a review of the}} literature on environmental attitudes; and a case study - the municipal waste charge protests in Ireland in 2003 and 2004. These public protests against new waste charges demonstrate the necessity for good advertisement and public relations when introducing a new tax. Rather than explain the polluter pays principle and simultaneously providing a good selection of options for recycling and composting, some municipalities jumped straight into the new tax (for a service that had originally been free of charge and covered by general taxes). Outbreaks of public revolt occurred, with people blockading the streets and refusing to let the collection trucks down their road. We seek to identify the reasons why there was so much resistance to this charge and examine the lessons for the introduction of other environmental taxes and charges in the future. The literature on the various types of municipal waste charge is discussed with a view to seeing if pay-by-weight tends to be more politically acceptable as there is a real incentive and control over the amount of waste collected for landfill or incinerator. The key figures in the Irish waste charge revolts were interviewed in an attempt to gain insights into their reasoning about the acceptability failure of the charge and design measures that could have been taken to avoid this outcome. Reasons for the revolt included: that protesters missed the point of local authorities being recently made responsible for covering the costs of municipal waste (rather than central government); they did not see the polluter-pays principle as related to the public; they felt the government was attempting to double-tax them; they were worried that privatisation meant that the charges could be free to rise exponentially in the future. The findings of the study are analysed to see what, if any, international lessons can be learned from the problems with public acceptance of this <b>environmental</b> <b>charge.</b> The following should be in place to encourage the success of new public taxes and charges: Good alternatives for the taxed behaviour; justification for the tax; terminology of the tax; trust in government; administrative simplicity; gradual introduction; willingness to fine-tune and adapt; community group leader support; and professional marketing and advertising schemes...|$|E
