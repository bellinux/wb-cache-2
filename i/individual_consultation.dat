25|$|Although {{there are}} many {{contributing}} factors and risks associated with strokes, {{there are very few}} associated with Dejerine–Roussy syndrome and thalamic lesions specifically. In general, strokes damage one hemisphere of the brain, which can include the thalamus. The thalamus is generally believed to relay sensory information between a variety of subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. It is known that sensory information from environmental stimuli travels to the thalamus for processing and then to the somatosensory cortex for interpretation. The final product of this communication is the ability to see, hear or feel something as interpreted by the brain. Dejerine–Roussy syndrome most often compromises tactile sensation. Therefore, the damage in the thalamus causes miscommunication between the afferent pathway and the cortex of the brain, changing what or how one feels. The change could be an incorrect sensation experienced, or inappropriate amplification or dulling of a sensation. Because the brain is considered plastic and each individual's brain is different, {{it is almost impossible to}} know how a sensation will be changed without brain mapping and <b>individual</b> <b>consultation.</b>|$|E

40|$|First time {{mothering}} is {{a challenging}} {{time as the}} woman and her family adjusts to their new role. Providing appropriate and effective community health services for this group has a long history in Australia, however, these services are often not evaluated. Objective: To evaluate a community model of care for first time mothers in terms of the following outcomes: provision of timely information, facilitation of social support networks and addressing individual needs through appropriate use of resources. Quasi-experimental design using telephone interviews at 3, 6 and 12 months following entry into the service. First time mothers with no risk factors and a well and thriving baby were invited to participate. The setting was community child health centres in metropolitan Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. A total of 152 women were recruited, 94 into the intervention group and 58 to the control group. The new model of care incorporated timely presentation of information in a small group format, infant screening and surveillance in line with national recommendations, a drop in and self weigh service and <b>individual</b> <b>consultation</b> when required. Standard care involved a series (6) of group information sessions and <b>individual</b> <b>consultation.</b> No {{significant differences were found between}} control and intervention groups in relation to information needs or the development of social support networks. However, intervention group participants were less likely to access individual consultations than the control group (p= 0. 009).
