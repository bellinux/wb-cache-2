50|$|Modern {{artillery}} is {{most obviously}} distinguished by its long range, firing an explosive shell or rocket and a mobile carriage for firing and transport. However, {{its most important}} characteristic {{is the use of}} indirect fire, whereby the <b>firing</b> <b>equipment</b> is aimed without seeing the target through its sights. Indirect fire emerged {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century and was greatly enhanced by the development of predicted fire methods in World War I. However, indirect fire was area fire; it was and is not suitable for destroying point targets; its primary purpose is area suppression. Nevertheless, by the late 1970s precision munitions started to appear, notably the US 155 mm Copperhead and its Soviet 152 mm equivalent that had success in Indian service. These relied on laser designation to 'illuminate' the target that the shell homed onto. However, in the early 21st Century, the Global Positioning System (GPS) enabled relatively cheap and accurate guidance for shells and missiles, notably the US 155 mm Excalibur and the 227 mm GMLRS rocket. The introduction of these led to a new issue, the need for very accurate three dimensional target coordinates - the mensuration process.|$|E

The examination as-sessed the nature and prevalence of specific firing flaws associated with the productive process, and the data derived from this study are used to reconstruct some of the technical challenges faced by the Podere Funghi potters and their <b>firing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The study documents a high prevalence of flaws associated with a rapid rise in temperature within the kiln at the beginning of firing process, while cataloguing few flaws associated with excessive sustained tem-peratures. This combination of flaws suggests poor pre-production drying of the wares, or the use of a fuel source that would have produced an initial high heat spike in temperature. In addition, it tells us much about craft production at satellite communities associated with large settlements, in this case, Poggio Colla...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} all the {{foregoing}} test work indicates that solution should be offered to at least three distinct problems. The first problem can be termed a physical and chemical problem, and refers to {{the reasons for the}} firebrick reactions under impingement, carbon deposition and carbon penetration between temperatures 2000 F and 2300 F. The second problem can be termed a problem of design, and simply stated refers to a suggested design for a low cost and low maintenance refractory furnace, for an oil fired steam boiler. The third problem is a mechanical engineering problem and refers to the selection of proper <b>firing</b> <b>equipment</b> to suit the particular service, (type of steam demand) for which this equipment will be used. It is felt that a clear view on these three matters should contribute materially to reductions in the cost of operating oil fired boilers, {{while at the same time}} increasing their useful life. The test work which has been described raises the physical and chemical problem in a threefold manner as is evident both in the operating tests and in the laboratory tests. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The {{doubly fed}} {{induction}} generator (DFIG) -based wind {{energy conversion system}} (WECS) currently dominates the wind energy market due to its advantages over other WECSs. In it, the rotor is interfaced with the AC network through a rotor side voltage source converter (RSC) and a grid side voltage source converter (GSC) which are coupled with a DC-link capacitor that helps to maintain the voltage {{at the point of}} common coupling within permissible limits. A DFIG's sensitivity to external faults has motivated researchers to investigate the impacts of various grid disturbances, such as voltage sag, voltage swell and short-circuit faults, on the grid side of its low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability. However, no {{attention has been paid to}} examining the impacts of RSC and GSC internal faults on the LVRT capability of a DFIG-based WECS. This thesis investigates a new DFIG problem that may frequently occur and proposes a solution to it. In this study, the impacts of various intermittent and sustained internal GSC and RSC faults on the overall performance of a DFIG-based WECS are compared. These faults include a fire-through, misfire, flashover and short circuit across the DC-link capacitor that can be caused by various malfunctions in the control and <b>firing</b> <b>equipment</b> of the converter station. In this context, the effects of the previously mentioned faults on various variables of the DFIG-based WECS are investigated using PSCAD/EMTDC software package. Compliance of the DFIG performance under such faults with the recent LVRT grid codes of the USA, Spain, Mexico, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, Quebec and the UK are also investigated. Two proposed solutions to these problems are introduced; a conventional STATCOM; and a STATCOM with the application of a high temperature superconducting (HTS) coil. The key objectives of the proposed solutions are to improve the LVRT capability of the DFIG and maintain its unity power factor operation during various voltage source converter (VSC) faults. To introduce a general and robust controller that helps to enhance the system’s performance under various faults, the controller parameters are tuned using the Nelder and Mead optimisation technique. This study determines that the effect of internal VSC faults should be considered in the design of a DFIG control system and reactive power compensation must be available to enable the wind turbine to comply with the stringent LVRT specifications enforced by international grid codes. Moreover, a reliable technique for monitoring conditions is necessary to detect these faults in advance in order to prevent their severe consequences...|$|E

40|$|There {{is always}} some risk of {{incident}} {{associated with the}} combustion of solid fuels in automatically stoked boilers or stoves. These incidents are of essentially three types: smoke from the burner back into the boiler room (or {{back into the living}} room from pellet stoves), gas explosions in the combustion chamber and back burning in the stoker. There can be a number of reasons for these problems, and in many cases such incidents have not been investigated. The Swedish Building Regulations stipulate that <b>firing</b> <b>equipment</b> shall have adequate safety against fire. They also recommend that stokers/burners should have at least two independent safety systems against back burning. The objective of this project has been to analyse such incidents and to test safety systems for pellet and wood chip burners, in order better to understand how they work. It has also included evaluation of the“fireguard” water sprinkler system. The results from the tests with pellet burners showed that the burners that were tested provided relatively good protection against back burning. However, it was found that it was very important how and where the systems (temperature limiter, water sprinkler etc.) were fitted on the burners in order to ensure correct and effective operation of the safety system. One of the key question was also where to position electronic equipment on the burners in order to ensure that it is not exposed to temperatures higher than those for which it is designed. Over the years, there have been major problems with back burning in older designs of wood chip burners using old technology. The chip burner used in this project was of modern type. The test with simulated back burning showed that the water sprinkler stopped the fire. However, for greater safety the water sprinklers should have included two separate water container. The test with the pellets stove showed that the temperature sensor was of crucial importance for safety against back burning in the stove. Back burn occurred in one of the tests, but only after all the stove’s safety systems had been rendered inoperable. The “Fireguard” water sprinkler system performed well in our tests. However, the position of the temperature sensors, and the integrity of their thermal contact, was of crucial importance for how quickly the sprinklers responded. Another water sprinkler (Syr) showed itself to be very slow to respond when its sensor were in poor thermal contact with the surface of the fuel feed chute. Experience from the tests in this project has shown that it is relatively difficult to simulate back burning in boilers and pellet stoves, despite setting up very favourable conditions for such back burning. Although modern burners and pellet stoves are equipped with all the safety systems that can be expected, several incidents still happen every year. This means that continued analysis of incidents and development of safety systems is essential. The results from this project will be included when SP’s P-marking rules for pellet burners, pellet stoves and chip wood burners are next reviewe...|$|E
