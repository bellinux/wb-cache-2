5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> has been more of an economic than a purely architectural decision, some argue that double-sided ships receive less comprehensive surveys and suffer more from hidden corrosion. In spite of opposition, double hulls became a requirement for Panamax and Capesize vessels in 2005.|$|E
5|$|U-3s {{design was}} an {{improved}} version of Germaniawerft's {{design for the}} Imperial German Navy's first U-boat, , and featured a <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> with internal saddle tanks. The Germaniawerft engineers refined the design's hull shape through extensive model trials.|$|E
50|$|A second {{significant}} amendment the OPA {{makes to}} the CWA {{is that it}} makes it a mandatory requirement for U.S. tank vessels, onshore and offshore facilities to establish and submit oil spill response plans to the corresponding federal authority. The OPA requires new vessels operating and transporting oil in U.S. waters to have <b>double</b> <b>hulls.</b> Not all vessels are of the same size and for the same purpose hence the OPA makes provision for exempting certain vessels from having <b>double</b> <b>hulls.</b> However, by 2015 it is a requirement by law that all oil carrying vessels operating in the U.S. must have <b>double</b> <b>hulls.</b>|$|R

40|$|Marine {{pollution}} {{associated with}} shipping accidents {{has resulted in}} a Congressional mandate for <b>double</b> <b>hulls</b> on tankers in U. S. waters. In this paper, we formulate a social planner's problem using optimal control theory to examine the relative cost-effectiveness of <b>double</b> <b>hulls</b> and alternative pollution prevention technologies, and the optimal installation strategy for such technologies. The model encompasses the costs and benefits associated with shipping operations, damage to the marine environment, and investment in each technology. A computer simulation of the model is used to evaluate investment strategies for two technological options: <b>double</b> <b>hulls</b> and electronic chart systems. Results indicate that electronic charts may be a far more cost-effective approach to marine pollution control.

5|$|The same report {{lists the}} {{following}} as some drawbacks to the double-hull design, including higher build costs, greater operating expenses (e.g. higher canal and port tariffs), difficulties in ballast tank ventilation, {{the fact that}} ballast tanks need continuous monitoring and maintenance, increased transverse free surface, the greater number of surfaces to maintain, the risk of explosions in double-hull spaces if a vapor detection system not fitted, and that cleaning ballast tanks is more difficult for <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> ships.|$|E
5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as {{she was used to}} {{evaluate}} steam power for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably because she could not pump the water out of her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her <b>double</b> <b>hull.</b> These problems, coupled with {{the fact that she was}} too slow to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E
5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E
50|$|The vessels were {{designed}} with <b>double</b> <b>hulls</b> {{to prevent or}} reduce environmental pollution from oil spills if damage is sustained to the outer hull.|$|R
50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>hulls</b> or <b>double</b> bottoms {{have been}} {{required}} in all passenger ships for decades {{as part of the}} Safety Of Life At Sea or SOLAS Convention.|$|R
50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>hulls</b> are a more {{extensive}} safety measure than double bottoms, which have two hull layers only {{in the bottom of}} the ship but not the sides.|$|R
25|$|OPA {{also set}} a {{schedule}} for the gradual phase in of a <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> design, providing an additional layer between the oil tanks and the ocean. While a <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> would likely not have prevented the Valdez disaster, a Coast Guard study estimated {{that it would have}} cut the amount of oil spilled by 60 percent.|$|E
25|$|The Exxon Valdez {{oil spill}} was the {{incentive}} to introduce legislation requiring tankers to have a <b>double</b> <b>hull,</b> a measure that is not seen as the best solution by all experts. Where a <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> should minimize the consequences after a disaster, Concordia Maritime developed the Stena V-MAX, a VLCC with two propellers, two rudders and two redundant engine rooms, where a single fault does not result in loss of steering, reducing {{the chances of a}} grounding.|$|E
25|$|Double-hulling - build double hulls into vessels, {{which reduces}} the risk and {{severity}} of a spill {{in case of a}} collision or grounding. Existing single-hull vessels can also be rebuilt to have a <b>double</b> <b>hull.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{low-energy}} collisions, <b>double</b> <b>hulls</b> {{can prevent}} flooding beyond the penetrated compartment. In high-energy collisions, however, {{the distance to}} the inner hull is not sufficient and the inner compartment is penetrated as well.|$|R
40|$|OPA 90 set out {{stringent}} {{requirements and}} liabilities for tankers operating in US national waters. OPA 90 was {{in response to}} the public concern caused by the grounding of the Exxon Valdez in 1989. It made ship owners responsible for the cost of pollution incidents and required all tank ships/barges operating in US waters have <b>double</b> <b>hulls</b> by 2015. We model factors influencing oil spills and test whether OPA 90 helped reduce the number of those spills. After accounting for causal factors, both increased liability and <b>double</b> <b>hulls</b> were statistically significant factors in reducing the number of spills.

25|$|On 9 June 2007 a salvage team, led by Drew Shannon, {{boarded the}} ship to assess the {{condition}} of the hull. Salvage investigators confirmed on 11 June 2007 that the outer shell of the ship's <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> had been breached and was taking on water on the starboard side.|$|E
25|$|CHANTs were {{designed}} {{with a flat}} bottom {{to enable them to}} ground on beaches. A <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> was used to minimise any chance of leakage. Each CHANT had four sub-divided tanks and was fitted with one single mast with two derricks and winches. They were not the most stable of ships, and needed to carry plenty of ballast. CHANTs were assembled at five different shipyards, and launched between February and May 1944.|$|E
25|$|HMAS Success (OR 304) is a Durance-class {{multi-product}} replenishment oiler {{serving in}} the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, Australia, during the 1980s, {{she is the only}} ship of the class to be constructed outside France, and the only one to not originally serve in the Marine Nationale (French Navy). The ship was part of the Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War, and was deployed to East Timor in response to incidents in 1999 and 2006. The ship was fitted with a <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> {{during the first half of}} 2011, to meet International Maritime Organisation standards.|$|E

25|$|Equipped with a <b>double</b> <b>hull,</b> Andrea Doria {{was divided}} into 11 {{watertight}} compartments. Any two of these could be filled with water without endangering the ship’s safety. Andrea Doria also carried enough lifeboats to accommodate all passengers and crew. She carried a total of 16 steel lifeboats, eight positioned {{on each side of}} the ship, coming in three different designs; two 58-person launches for emergency use, two 70-person motorboats with inboard radio transmitters, and 12 146-person hand-propelled standard boats. Furthermore, the ship was equipped with the latest early warning radar. However, despite its technological advantages, the ship had serious flaws concerning its seaworthiness and safety.|$|E
25|$|Sause Bros. {{opened a}} shipyard, Southern Oregon Marine (SOMAR), in 1979, east of Coos Bay, Oregon. The SOMAR {{division}} of Sause Bros. constructs, modifies, repairs, and maintains the company's fleet of tugs and barges, including line-haul and ship-assist tugs, lumber barges, covered house barges, and <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> liquid cargo barges. During the mid-'70s, Sause Bros. had two single-screw 104ft (32m) tugs, the Joseph Sause and the Henry Sause, built in Louisiana. Over the years, SOMAR has lengthened these two tugs, increased the beam, and added new engines and twin screws {{to gain more}} working deck space fore and aft. These changes also made possible a larger pilot house, located {{near the center of}} the boat.|$|E
25|$|While {{the full}} extent of his {{scientific}} studies has only become recognized in the last 150 years, he was, during his lifetime, employed for his engineering and skill of invention. Many of his designs, such as the movable dikes to protect Venice from invasion, proved too costly or impractical. Some of his smaller inventions entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. As an engineer, Leonardo conceived ideas vastly ahead of his own time, conceptually inventing an improved version of the helicopter, an armoured fighting vehicle, the use of concentrated solar power, a calculator, a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics and the <b>double</b> <b>hull.</b> In practice, he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of anatomy, astronomy, civil engineering, optics, and the study of water (hydrodynamics).|$|E
5000|$|The {{ability of}} double-hulled tankers {{to prevent or}} reduce oil spills led to <b>double</b> <b>hulls</b> being {{standardized}} for other types of ships including oil tankers by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships or MARPOL Convention. In 1992, MARPOL was amended, making it [...] "mandatory for tankers of 5,000 dwt and more ordered after 6 July 1993 to be fitted with <b>double</b> <b>hulls,</b> or an alternative design approved by IMO". However, {{in the aftermath of}} the Erika incident of the coast off France in December 1999, members of IMO adopted a revised schedule for the phase-out of single-hull tankers, which came into effect on 1 September 2003, with further amendments validated on 5 April 2005.|$|R

25|$|Brunel's {{last major}} project, the , {{was built in}} 185457 {{with the intent of}} linking Great Britain with India, via the Cape of Good Hope, without any coaling stops. This ship was arguably more revolutionary than her predecessors. She {{was one of the first}} ships to be built with a <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> with {{watertight}} compartments and was the first liner to have four funnels. She was the biggest liner throughout the rest of the 19th century with a gross tonnage of almost 20,000 tons and had a passenger-carrying capacity of thousands. The ship was ahead of her time and went through a turbulent history, never being put to her intended use. The first transatlantic steamer built of steel was , built by Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers and entering service in 1879.|$|E
25|$|On 9 October 1912, White Star withdrew Olympic from {{service and}} {{returned}} {{her to her}} builders at Belfast to have modifications added to incorporate {{lessons learned from the}} Titanic disaster six months prior, and improve safety. The number of lifeboats carried by Olympic was increased from twenty to sixty four (per Carlisle's original number), and extra davits were installed along the boat deck to accommodate them. An inner watertight skin was also constructed in the boiler and engine rooms, to create a <b>double</b> <b>hull.</b> Five of the watertight bulkheads were extended up to B-Deck, extending to the entire height of the hull. This corrected a flaw in the original design, in which the bulkheads only rose up as far as E or D-Deck, a short distance above the waterline. This flaw had been exposed during Titanics sinking, where water spilled {{over the top of the}} bulkheads as the ship sank and flooded subsequent compartments. In addition, an extra bulkhead was added to subdivide the electrical dynamo room, bringing the total number of watertight compartments to seventeen. Improvements were also made to the ship's pumping apparatus. These modifications meant that Olympic could survive a collision similar to that of Titanic, in that her first six compartments could be breached and the ship could remain afloat.|$|E
25|$|The Terrex AV81 is an {{armoured}} fighting vehicle weighing between 25 and 30 tons an 8×8 {{wheeled chassis}} and modern armour. Multiple weapon platforms are supported, including both the remote and overhead weapons stations. The Terrex's modular design allows for different level of armour protection and weapon systems. It {{is designed to}} be air-portable by C-130s or equivalent cargo aircraft. The Terrex uses a patented independent double wishbone suspension, which greatly improves ground mobility and comfort during rides over rough terrains. The use of automatic traction control and the capacity for large footprint off-road tyres enables the Terrex to reach high speed on soft ground. The vehicle has a <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> with an external V-hull that improves mine blast survivability. Add-on armour provides further protection for troops. It is also capable of providing full chemical, biological and nuclear protection in extreme operational conditions. The baseline configuration is fully amphibious. Two water jets mounted on either side {{at the back of the}} hull propel the vehicle through water at 10km/h. Initially developed for export sales from the number of emerging wheeled armoured vehicle requirements including U.S. Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) concept, which calls for the need of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles (AFV) as opposed to tracked AFVs. In 2006, the SAF decided to purchase 135 units to replace their aging V-200 armoured vehicles. The Indonesian Army also indicated plans to purchase 420 units and to produce the Terrex under license locally.|$|E
50|$|The K III {{class was}} {{a class of}} two patrol {{submarines}}, built by Koninklijke Maatschappij De Schelde in Vlissingen for the Royal Netherlands Navy.
