500|$|The Court {{reasoned}} that Article 162 had no {{application to the}} SCJA as the latter was not an existing law at the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>commencement</b> of the Constitution (that is, 9 August 1965), having been enacted in 1969. However, the Court did not consider the effect of Article 4 of the Constitution on the offence. That Article states: [...] "This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic of Singapore and any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, {{to the extent of}} the inconsistency, be void." [...] Subsequently, in Attorney-General v. Chee Soon Juan (2006), the High Court held that the offence of scandalizing the court could not be regarded as unconstitutional since Article 14(2)(a) clearly empowered Parliament to restrict free speech in order to punish acts amounting to contempt of court. Parliament had done so by enacting section 7(1) of the SCJA.|$|E

40|$|In dryland {{areas of}} India, {{rainfall}} {{is the main}} source of water for raising crops. For these areas, the greatest problem is not water shortage per se, but rather the tremendous variability in rainfall from year to year and season to season. In planning for the coming season, we currently have little or no ability to predict the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the onset of rains or their amount, distribution, or duration. However, uncertainty about rainfall is lessened when information is available concerning the possible variability and frequencies of historical occurrences of rainfall. This information can be obtained by coupling water use to water production functions that enable estimates of associated crop yields and economic returns (Stewart and Hagan, 1973; and Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979). Therefore, in the present study, a simple water balance model developed by Frere and Popov (1979) was used to estimate crop water use; when coupled with water production functions, it explains yield behavior of the following crops (with respect to different <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>commencement</b> <b>of</b> the rainy season) : sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), pearl millet (Pinnisatum americanum L. Leek), sunflower (Helianthus annus L.), castor (Ricinus communis L.), and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L. Millisp.) These crops are grown in Hyderabad under high management and rainfed conditions...|$|R

Due to the close vicinity of Lake Morskie Oko, comparisons were performed in terms of variability of ice phenomena of both of the lakes. The study showed among others that although Lake Wielki Staw is located higher than Lake Morskie Oko by approximately 270 m, ice phenomena on the lake appear on the average 10 days later than in Lake Morskie Oko, and the mean persistence of the ice cover is the same, i. e. it amounts to 167 days...|$|R
