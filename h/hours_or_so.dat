25|$|During {{the female}} sex flush, pinkish spots develop under the breasts, then {{spread to the}} breasts, torso, face, hands, soles of the feet, and {{possibly}} over the entire body. Vasocongestion is also responsible for the darkening of the clitoris and {{the walls of the}} vagina during sexual arousal. During the male sex flush, the coloration of the skin develops less consistently than in the female, but typically starts with the epigastrium (upper abdomen), spreads across the chest, then continues to the neck, face, forehead, back, and sometimes, shoulders and forearms. The sex flush typically disappears soon after orgasm occurs, but this may take up to two <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> and, sometimes, intense sweating will occur simultaneously. The flush usually diminishes in reverse of the order in which it appeared.|$|E
25|$|Tackle design {{began to}} improve from the 1880s. The {{introduction}} of new woods to the manufacture of fly rods {{made it possible to}} cast flies into the wind on silk lines, instead of horse hair. These lines allowed for a much greater casting distance. However, these early fly lines proved troublesome as they had to be coated with various dressings to make them float and needed to be taken off the reel and dried every four <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> to prevent them from becoming waterlogged. Another negative consequence was that it became easy for the much longer line to get into a tangle - this was called a 'tangle' in Britain, and a 'backlash' in the US. This problem spurred the invention of the regulator to evenly spool the line out and prevent tangling.|$|E
500|$|Dan Adams of IGN {{rated the}} game 9.4 out of 10 and praised its {{improved}} visuals and expansive environments, but cited the short six-hour length as a drawback. He said: [...] "Any {{way you look}} at it, Episode Two stands out, even among the Half-Life series, as something special ... a burly experience packed into roughly six <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> that offers up all the diversity, level design, and thoughtful gameplay we've known while making sure to propel the story forward and leave us wanting more." [...] Bit-tech.net awarded the game a 10 out of 10 score, citing approval of how the story turns and the introduction of side stories and new characters. 1UP.com praised the game, noting that the game's [...] "entire five-hour experience" [...] was [...] "vivid, emotionally engaging, and virtually unsurpassed." [...] PC Gamer UK also applauded Episode Two, noting it [...] "is the most sumptuous chapter of the Half-Life saga, and by a country mile." [...] The New York Times enjoyed the gameplay, saying, [...] "The battles in Episode 2 of Half-Life 2 often require as much ingenuity as they do fast reflexes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Not all white, blue-eyed foals are {{affected}} with LWS. Other genes can produce healthy pink-skinned, blue-eyed horses {{with a white}} or very light cream-colored coat. [...] For a time, some of these completely white horses were called [...] "living lethals", [...] {{but this is a}} misnomer. [...] Before reliable information and the DNA test were available to breeders, perfectly healthy, white-coated, blue-eyed foals were sometimes euthanized for fear they were lethal whites, an outcome which can be avoided today with testing and a better understanding of coat color genetics or even waiting 12 <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> for the foal to develop clinical signs. The availability of testing also allows a breeder to determine if a white-coated, blue-eyed foal that becomes ill is an LWS foal that requires euthanasia or a non-LWS foal with a simple illness that may be successfully treated.|$|E

6000|$|Later that morning, when {{relieved}} by my second officer, I threw myself on my couch {{and for some}} three <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> I really found oblivion.
