Organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E

About {{half a million}} Irish, who were predominantly Catholic, fled to England to escape the famine; many embarked from Liverpool to travel to North America while others remained in the city. Because of the increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> population, the co-adjutor Bishop of Liverpool, Alexander Goss (18141872), saw {{the need for a}} cathedral. The location he chose was the grounds of St. Edward's College on St.Domingo Road, Everton.|$|E

5|$|In 1374, Tvrtko married Dorothea, {{daughter}} of Tsar Ivan Stratsimir of Bulgaria.

Tvrtko thereby solidified his relations with the Roman Catholic Church and earned recognition from Pope Gregory XI.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages the {{problems}} of schism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Historians have discerned a decline in traditional monastic life in the late Middle Ages, but the mendicant orders of friars grew, particularly in the expanding burghs, emphasised preaching and ministering to the population. New saints and cults of devotion also proliferated. Despite problems over the number and quality of clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and evidence of heresy in the fifteenth century, the Church in Scotland remained stable before the Reformation in the sixteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the {{principal}} one, celebrated liturgically in the Mass. The church teaches that through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. Virgin Mary is venerated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven, honoured in dogmas and devotions. Its teaching includes sanctification through faith and evangelisation of the Gospel and Catholic social teaching, which emphasises support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. The Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of {{education and health care}} in the world.|$|E

After brutal fighting, and the plundering of villages, cities, and abbeys throughout the Electorate, Gebhard surrendered his claim on the electorate and retired to Strasbourg.
