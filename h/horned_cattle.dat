25|$|In {{the twenty}} years {{immediately}} after settlement, Hobart Town became {{a base for}} the Southern Ocean whaling and sealing industries. Hobart Town's shipyards built many of the whalers, and were kept busy with maintenance and repairs. Whale oil soon became a major export, and was used to light the street lamps of London, and the wool industry had also established itself as a major export from Hobart Town's docks. In 1816, there were 20,000 sheep, and by 1818, 12,000 <b>horned</b> <b>cattle.</b> Merino and other flocks were established in the now expanding Midlands district, and at Clarendon, Perth, Longford, Esk Vale, Jericho, Simmonds and elsewhere. Soon merino stud rams were being sold for high prices, and Van Diemen's Land became noted throughout the empire for its fine wool. Wheat crops were produced in such abundance that it was being exported to Sydney to subsidise their less successful crops. The Van Diemen's Land Company was formed in 1825 to raise sheep in the colony to provide wool for British cloth manufacturers who were then buying wool from Spain and Germany, as sheep bred in Britain were largely meat breeds.|$|E
25|$|Like Lord {{and other}} early Sydney entrepreneurs, Kable {{always had a}} {{substantial}} landholding {{as a kind of}} 'sheet anchor'. He had been granted farms at Petersham Hill in 1794 and 1795, and in the latter year bought out four near-by grantees within a week of their grants being signed. In 1807 he owned at least four farms of about 170 acres (69 ha); in 1809 in addition he held five farms at the Hawkesbury and 300 acres (121 ha) at the Cowpastures, with a variety of real estate in Sydney itself including his comfortable house and extensive stores. He also had 40 <b>horned</b> <b>cattle,</b> 9 horses and 40 pigs. His business reputation seems to have been dubious, for he was regarded with distrust by Governor King and with active hostility by Governor Bligh who thought him and his partners fraudulent and had them imprisoned for a month and fined each £100 for sending him a letter couched in improper terms. It is certain that Kable played no part in public life comparable with Simeon Lord's multifarious activities. His commercial career in Sydney seems to have ended soon after Lord & Co. broke up, for as early as February 1810 he announced that his son Henry Junior had taken over the entire management of his Sydney affairs. In 1811 Kable moved to Windsor where he operated a store and brewery, the latter in association with a partner, Richard Woodbury and his Sydney warehouse was let to Michael Hayes.|$|E

50|$|White cattle (often {{with black}} or red ears) are {{believed}} to have been highly regarded in Britain and Ireland in very early times, and herds of white cattle were kept as ornamental and sporting animals in enclosed parks for many centuries. They gave rise to the <b>horned</b> White Park <b>cattle,</b> and contributed to the polled British White. However, British Whites are not as genetically distinct from other British breeds as White Parks are, and so there is some doubt about their exact origins; other breeds such as Shorthorn may have contributed to their development.|$|R
50|$|Polled strains {{have been}} {{developed}} of many cattle breeds which were originally horned. This has usually been done by crossing with naturally polled breeds, most commonly Angus and Galloway cattle. For example, polled Jersey cattle originated in Ohio sometime prior to 1895. Two strains were developed, the first to appear being founded by crosses of registered Jersey bulls (the standard) on common muley (hornless) cows. These were graded up by the continued use of purebred Jersey sires, selection being made of the polled offspring of each generation, the horned progeny being discarded. Thus originated what was later known as the single-standard strain. As {{in the case of}} the Polled Shorthorns and Polled Herefords, the development of the single-standard strain was soon followed by the appearance of a double-standard strain, founded by a few naturally hornless sports that were discovered in registered herds of <b>horned</b> Jersey <b>cattle.</b> These standards were bred among themselves or crossed with registered horned Jerseys, followed by selection for the polled head, and the strain was developed in this way.|$|R

40|$|The polled {{phenotype}} {{of cattle}} is increasingly becoming favourable {{mainly because of}} the enhanced emphasis on animal welfare, for which the causative mutations have been reported during the past years. The Shuxuan cattle are a new synthetic breed by crossing the indigenous cattle with both Simmental and Holstein semen in Sichuan of Southwest China, in which about 15 % of polled individuals have newly emerged. Because official record about POLLED genotypes for the historically imported sires is unavailable, we therefore genotyped the proposed POLLED variants of P 202 ID, P 80 kbID and P 219 ID among 48 polled and 16 <b>horned</b> Shuxuan <b>cattle.</b> It was first revealed that all three candidate mutations have been simultaneously introgressed into Shuxuan cattle, whereas the P 202 ID mutation is dominant. Furthermore, one polled animal still remains to carry none of the three candidate mutations, which suggests that further mutation(s) would also exist. Additionally, we sequenced mitochondrial DNA and found that Shuxuan cattle are composed of two matrilineal origins of Bos taurus (65. 6 %) and B. indicus (34. 4 %); and there is no origin-biased distribution of polled phenotype. In conclusion, our study first supports the recently reported novel candidate mutation of P 219 ID and detects simultaneous presences of all three known POLLED mutations within a cattle breed...|$|R

On the day of introduction, the cattle showed large increases of both standing and locomotion time at the expense of both eating and lying time, however little difference in maintenance behaviour occurred between Day + 6 and pre-introduction (Days - 3 and - 2). During the observation period of postintroduction, the percentage of time spent lying was negatively correlated with the frequency of agonistic interactions, especially it had the highest significant correlation with the frequency of actively aggressive behaviours (fighting, butting and threatening) of the introduced cow who was most dominant in her previous group (r = - 0. 993, P < 0. 001). In the posttintroduction herd, the introduced cow spent more time in locomotion than other herdmates, which might partly lead to her larger reduction in live weight...|$|R

40|$|Background: Intensified {{selection}} of polled individuals has recently gained importance in predominantly <b>horned</b> dairy <b>cattle</b> breeds {{as an alternative}} to routine dehorning. The status quo of the current polled breeding pool of genetically-closely related artificial insemination sires with lower breeding values for performance traits raises questions regarding the effects of intensified selection based on this founder pool. Methods: We developed a stochastic simulation framework that combines the stochastic simulation software QMSim and a self-designed R program named QUALsim that acts as an external extension. Two traits were simulated in a dairy cattle population for 25 generations: one quantitative (QMSim) and one qualitative trait with Mendelian inheritance (i. e. polledness, QUALsim). The assignment scheme for qualitative trait genotypes initiated realistic initial breeding situations regarding allele frequencies, true breeding values for the quantitative trait and genetic relatedness. Intensified selection for polled cattle was achieved using an approach that weights estimated breeding values in the animal best linear unbiased prediction model for the quantitative trait depending on genotypes or phenotypes for the polled trait with a user-defined weighting factor. Results: Selection response for the polled trait was highest in the selection scheme based on genotypes. Selection based on phenotypes led to significantly lower allele frequencies for polled. The male selection path played a significantly greater role for a fast dissemination of polled alleles compared to female selection strategies. Fixation of the polled allele implies selection based on polled genotypes among males. In comparison to a base breeding scenario that does not take polledness into account, intensive selection for polled substantially reduced genetic gain for this quantitative trait after 25 generations. Reducing selection intensity for polled males while maintaining strong selection intensity among females, simultaneously decreased losses in genetic gain and achieved a final allele frequency of 0. 93 for polled. Conclusions: A fast transition to a completely polled population through intensified selection for polled was in contradiction to the preservation of high genetic gain for the quantitative trait. Selection on male polled genotypes with moderate weighting, and selection on female polled phenotypes with high weighting, could be a suitable compromise regarding all important breeding aspects...|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} horns in Bos taurus {{is under the}} genetic control of the {{autosomal}} dominant Polled locus which has been genetically mapped to the centromeric region of cattle chromosome 1 (BTA 1). The position of the Polled locus on BTA 1 has been identified and candidate causal mutations have been identified. Recently it was demonstrated that {{there are at least}} two different alleles at the Polled locus in cattle. For example, a 202 -base pair (bp) insertion-deletion (InDel), referred to as P 202 ID, has been identified in various cattle breeds, including cattle in Scandinavia, Scotland, England, the Channel Islands and France (regions North of the Alpine region). Little is known about breed to breed variation, other than the identification of a Holstein Polled mutation occurring at 932 kb, and that this overlaps with a Simmental Polled locus at 212 kb. Using a polymerase chain reaction – single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) approach, 876 New Zealand (NZ) cattle from five British cattle breeds (South Devon, Belgian Blue, Hereford, Shorthorn and Holstein-Friesian) were sampled, of which 467 were investigated to validate a polled/horned gene test developed by the Lincoln University Gene Marker laboratory. Three PCR-SSCP banding-patterns were identified, and these were typically found in homozygous polled (BB), heterozygous polled (AB) and homozygous <b>horned</b> (AA) <b>cattle.</b> Phenotypic data for polled/horned was available for all 467 cattle, so the accuracy of the gene test was calculated for each breed studied. A high level of confidence can be held when using the gene test in breeds such as the South Devon (100 %), Shorthorn (100 %) and Belgian Blue (96. 5 %), but a lower accuracy was observed with Hereford cattle (73. 5 %). The Holstein-Friesian cattle that were typed were true to phenotype (100 %), but the result is less reliable as the sample size was small and no polled Holstein-Friesians were typed. Overall these results suggest that the gene test has the ability to identify polled and horned genotypes in South Devon, Belgian Blue and Shorthorn cattle, but it requires further refinement for Hereford and Holstein-Friesian...|$|R
40|$|The <b>horned</b> {{condition}} in <b>cattle</b> {{is believed to}} be the wild type with morphogenesis primarily occurring after birth. The polled condition has existed since domestication and has been selected for its economic importance. The polled locus has previously been mapped by genetic linkage analysis to the proximal region of bovine chromosome 1. In order to help us eventually identify the causative mutation, the objective of the study was to structurally and functionally characterize the polled interval from IFNAR 1 to SOD 1 on BTA 1. Our hypothesis was that the polled locus is a tissue specific transcription factor that is expressed in the developing horn buds and acts directly or indirectly upon SOX 9. A 2. 5 Mb BAC contig and STS content map of the polled interval was constructed. Three candidate genes encoding transcription factors were identified within this region but only C 21 orf 66 was expressed in the horn buds from 1 d old Bos indicus influenced calves. The C 21 orf 66 gene has 18 exons, spans 30, 976 bp of genomic DNA, and 144 SNP were identified. No single SNP discovered in C 21 orf 66 can be attributed as the causative mutation. None of the genes from the polled interval were differentially expressed in skin and horn from 1 d old Bos indicus influenced calves. However, there were significant differences in the levels of expression of RUNX 2, SOX 9, BMP 4, PRKCA, and FOXL 2 in these samples. Expression of RUNX 2 was localized to the osteoblasts, and both RUNX 2 and SOX 9 were expressed in sebaceous glands of the horn at 1 d of age. Histological examination of horns and scurs from newborn, 5 to 6 mo, and ~ 1. 5 yr old Bos indicus influenced cattle suggest that horns form through intramembranous ossification. Based on the data presented herein, we propose that the polled locus is upstream of RUNX 2 and SOX 9 in the osteogenic pathway, and could have its primary effect on the differentiation of mesenchymal condensations. The genes IL 10 RB, SFRS 15, C 21 orf 66, OLIG 1, OLIG 2 and HUNK remain candidates for the polled locus and warrant further investigation...|$|R
