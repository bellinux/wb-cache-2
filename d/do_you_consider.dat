The value of self-identification {{as a measure of}} a person's political independence or partisanship is that it is seen as a proxy for the behavior which should be exhibited by the independent voter. Additionally, self-identification could be easily captured either with a nominal question ("Do you self-identify with an existing political party?", a question which is answered with a [...] "yes" [...] or a [...] "no"), or by a structured ordinal question ("Generally speaking, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> yourself a Democrat, a Republican, an independent, or what?"). The first analyses of this measure of political independence found that there were significant differences between those individuals who self-identified as [...] "independent" [...] and those who listed [...] "no preference" [...] as to party identification. Individuals who expressed [...] "no preference" [...] usually exhibited low levels of interest in politics, low levels of knowledge about the candidates and issues, low frequency of voting, and less {{confidence in their ability to}} influence politics.|$|E
