40|$|Obligate {{interspecific}} avian brood parasites do {{not build}} nests {{of their own}} but lay their eggs in the nests of other species. It has been proposed that a <b>flexible</b> song <b>learning</b> mechanism (copying the heterospecific songs of the foster species) facilitates the evolution of brood-parasitic behavior. Some sort of song copying is common to all songbirds; hence, {{to better understand the}} evolution of brood parasitism it is important to study the role of song learning. The proposed hypothesis {{does not take into account}} that <b>flexible</b> song <b>learning</b> might make mate acquisition more difficult because males that are preferred by brood-parasitic females would be initially rare. We examine this by means of two population dynamic models. By using a recurrence equation model of brood parasites competing with their nestbuilding ancestors, we show that <b>flexible</b> song <b>learning</b> is indeed an obstacle to the evolution of brood parasitism. Results from a more realistic, individual-based model, in which the brood-parasitic trait can evolve more gradually, confirm this finding. However, we also show that the obstacle of <b>flexible</b> song <b>learning</b> can be overcome quite easily when males also are carriers of the brood-parasitic trait. This is probably because brood parasitism is a neutral trait in males, which increases the number of mutants carrying genes for brood parasitism, and thus makes the female task of finding suitable partners easier.

Costing £102 million, the centre contains resources for teaching Years 7 and 8 after the council reforms of 11 September 2001 which moved the education system in Northumberland to the two-tier system after decades of using the three-tier system. Also contained within are resources for music and performing arts. The building is made up of other isolated 'blocks' called Enquire, Explore, Discover, Create, Communicate and Care. Other features of the JLV include its “Village” street, open science Learning Plaza, Cyber Café, and <b>flexible</b> <b>learning</b> spaces.

40|$|Among some {{scholars}} of management, organisation and also economists {{as well as}} policy makers {{it is argued that}} certain new forms of firm organisation such as <b>flexible</b> and <b>learning</b> organisations increasingly are becoming “best practice”, in an increasingly learning and global economy. On a policy level, in eg. Denmark and OECD, questions are already asked as to how policies should be set up to stimulate such organisational forms. A crucial aspect that is recognised by {{some scholars}}, is that it is in certain competitive structures where <b>flexible</b> and <b>learning</b> organisations are well suited, though tends to be overlooked within the debate. The analysis in this paper applies performance data from Statistics Denmark merged with survey data of organisational forms, management, work practices and employee skills collected through a questionnaire in 1900 Danish firms in manufacturing as well as services. Applying regression analyses we show that the <b>flexible</b> or <b>learning</b> organisational forms {{in some parts of the}} economy, characterised by innovation turbulence and cumulativeness, are best performers though not in general.

40|$|The {{ability to}} make {{categorical}} decisions and interpret sensory experiences is critical for survival and interactions across the lifespan. However, {{little is known about}} the human brain mechanisms that mediate the learning and representation of visual categories in aging. Here we combine behavioral measurements and fMRI measurements to investigate the neural processes that mediate <b>flexible</b> category <b>learning</b> in the aging human brain. Our findings show that training changes the decision criterion (i. e., categorical boundary) that young and older observers use for making categorical judgments. Comparing the behavioral choices of human observers with those of a pattern classifier based upon multivoxel fMRI signals, we demonstrate learning-dependent changes in similar cortical areas for young and older adults. In particular, we show that neural signals in occipito-temporal and posterior parietal regions change through learning to reflect the perceived visual categories. Information in these areas about the perceived visual categories is preserved in aging, whereas information content is compromised in more anterior parietal and frontal circuits. Thus, these findings provide novel evidence for <b>flexible</b> category <b>learning</b> in aging that shapes the neural representations of visual categories to reflect the observers' behavioral judgments. status: publishe...|$|R
