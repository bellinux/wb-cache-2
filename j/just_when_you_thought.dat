I realise now this is what the family meal has been missing three nights a week: gathering the telly to watch a grubby, greasyhaired thug drooling over a 15-year-old girl who (as luck would have it) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she's not at school.

He had an old musty bit of parchment, on which were written some words, hardly legible, in an antique hand,--an old deed, it might have been,--some family document, and here and there the letters were faded away. But this man had spent his life over it, and he had made out the meaning, and he {{interpreted}} it to you, and left it with you, only there was one gap,--one torn or obliterated place. Well, sir,--and he bade you, with your poor little skill at the mortar, and for a certain sum,-- ample repayment for such a service,--to manufacture this medicine,--this cordial. It was an affair of months. And <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> it finished, the man came again, and stood over your cursed beverage, and shook a powder, or dropped a lump into it, or put in some ingredient, in which was all the hidden virtue,--or, at least, it drew out all the hidden virtue of the mean and common herbs, and married them into a wondrous efficacy. This done, the man bade you do certain other things with the potation, and went away"--the Colonel hesitated a moment--"and never came back again." ...|$|E

Rosamond thought that no one could be more in love than she was; and Lydgate thought that after all his wild {{mistakes}} and absurd credulity, he had found perfect womanhood--felt as if already breathed upon by exquisite wedded affection such as would be bestowed by an accomplished creature who venerated his high musings and momentous labors and would never interfere with them; who would create order in the home and accounts with still magic, yet keep her fingers ready to touch the lute and transform life into romance at any moment; who was instructed to the true womanly limit and not a hair's-breadth beyond--docile, therefore, and ready to carry out behests which came from that limit. It was plainer now than ever that his notion of remaining much longer a bachelor had been a mistake: marriage would not be an obstruction but a furtherance. And happening the next day to accompany a patient to Brassing, he saw a dinner-service there which struck him as so exactly the right thing that he bought it at once. It saved time to do these things <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> of them, and Lydgate hated ugly crockery. The dinner-service in question was expensive, but that might be in the nature of dinner-services. Furnishing was necessarily expensive; but then it had to be done only once.|$|E

Boasting of the Kawasaki Automatic Compression Release KACR, it gives an easy kick start—no added fuss for men who mean real business. And just like what real men do, the Compression release takes away rider pressure, ensuring a smooth ride. Equipped with a powerful 176.6 cc engine, 4-stroke SOHC Euro-II compliant, and made with heavy-duty high-tensile steel, it could take on any bump or weather. Add a long dual seat to accommodate more passengers, and you get a mean machine that shares the pleasure. A fierce look, a sense for business, and a gentleman enough to think of its riders—now aren’t those signs of a true man? [...] "Tatak ng mas pinabarako".|$|E

Like that episode, <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> House and his team were in the clear, there was another speed bump in the road.

Despite the recycling of gameplay and art, the game is very short ... and worse, has an abrupt, cliffhanger ending." [...] Feeling the bonus game was just as repetitive and uncreative as the main one, Neilie cited: [...] "Post-ending, the pain still doesnt end since theres a half-baked bonus chapter wherein you play as Faye, doing all the things Lyra envisioned her doing during the first part of the adventure. ... And <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> things just couldnt get any crummier, the bonus chapter also ends on an abrupt, insultingly unfinished cliffhanger."
