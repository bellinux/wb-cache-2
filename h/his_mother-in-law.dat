5|$|Reginald Yzendoorn, {{author of}} History of the Catholic Mission in the Hawaiian Islands, later wrote that Kaʻauwai was {{a judge and}} Calvinist deacon who related the burning of the Roman Catholic chapel of Wailuku in 1843 to <b>his</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> Marie Leahi, an early Catholic female catechumen. In the early Hawaiian Protestant mission, deacons {{did not have to}} be {{licensed}} to preach.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the English Civil War Lady Drake {{was joined}} at her Devon home, Ash House in the parish of Musbury, by her fourth {{daughter}} Elizabeth Drake and her husband Winston Churchill (1620–1688), a Royalist cavalry captain. Unlike <b>his</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> who had supported the Parliamentary cause, Winston had the misfortune of fighting on the losing side of the war – for which he, like so many other Cavaliers, was forced to compound; in his case £446 18s. Although Winston had paid off the fine by 1651, it had impoverished him. From this episode may derive the Churchill family motto: Fiel Pero Desdichado ("Faithful but Unfortunate").|$|E
5|$|Hertfordshire. She was the {{daughter}} of Richard Jennings (or Jenyns), a Member of Parliament, and Frances Thornhurst; her paternal grandfather was Sir John Jennings, father, by his wife Alice Spencer, of an extraordinarily large family. Her uncle (Martin Lister) was a prominent naturalist. Richard Jennings came into contact with James, Duke of York (the future James II, brother of King Charles II), in 1663, during negotiations for the recovery of an estate in Kent (Agney Court) that had been the property of <b>his</b> <b>mother-in-law,</b> Susan Lister (nee Temple). James's first impressions were favourable, and in 1664 Sarah’s sister, Frances, was appointed maid of honour to the Duchess of York, Anne Hyde.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the extant}} {{information}} about {{the last few days}} of Poe's life comes from his attending physician, Dr. John Joseph Moran, though his credibility is questionable. Poe was buried after a small funeral at the back of Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, but his remains were moved to a new grave with a larger monument in 1875. The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe's wife, Virginia, and <b>his</b> <b>mother-in-law,</b> Maria. Theories as to what caused Poe's death include suicide, murder, cholera, hypoglycemia, rabies, syphilis, influenza, and that Poe was a victim of cooping. Evidence of the influence of alcohol is strongly disputed.|$|E

5|$|Although court {{entertainments}} {{were few}} after the Prince Consort's death, Beatrice and the Queen enjoyed tableau vivant photography, which was often {{performed at the}} royal residences. Henry, increasingly bored {{by the lack of}} activity at court, longed for employment, and in response, the Queen made him Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1889. However, he yearned for military adventure and pleaded with <b>his</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> to let him join the Ashanti expedition fighting in the Anglo-Asante war. Despite misgivings, the Queen consented, and Henry and Beatrice parted on 6 December 1895; they would not meet again. Henry contracted malaria and was sent home. On 22 January 1896, Beatrice, who was waiting for her husband at Madeira, received a telegram informing her of Henry's death two days earlier.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 Morton {{was named}} to lead a {{committee}} to investigate charges of bribery made against La Fayette Grover, a newly elected U.S. Senator from Oregon. The committee spent eighteen days in Oregon holding hearings and investigations. On the return trip, Morton detoured to San Francisco for a rest and visit. After dinner {{on the night of}} August 6, Morton suffered a severe stroke that paralyzed {{the left side of his}} body. The next day he was taken by train to Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory, where he was met by his brother-in-law, John A. Burbank, the former governor of the Dakota Territory. Morton was accompanied by him to the home of <b>his</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> in Richmond, Indiana, where he stayed until October 15, then he was moved to his own home in Indianapolis to recover. He remained at Indianapolis, surrounded by his family, until his death on November 1, 1877.|$|E
5|$|More widely, 1936 {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the Great Terror, in which many of the composer's friends and relatives were imprisoned or killed. These included his patron Marshal Tukhachevsky (shot months after his arrest); his brother-in-law Vsevolod Frederiks (a distinguished physicist, who was eventually released but died before he got home); his close friend Nikolai Zhilyayev (a musicologist who had taught Tukhachevsky; shot shortly after his arrest); <b>his</b> <b>mother-in-law,</b> the astronomer Sofiya Mikhaylovna Varzar (sent to a camp in Karaganda); his friend the Marxist writer Galina Serebryakova (20 years in camps); his uncle Maxim Kostrykin (died); and his colleagues Boris Kornilov and Adrian Piotrovsky (executed). His only consolation in this period was the birth of his daughter Galina in 1936; his son Maxim was born two years later.|$|E

5|$|On January 14, 1815, {{three months}} after his father's death, Cofresí married Juana Creitoff in San Miguel Arcángel parish, Cabo Rojo. Contemporary {{documents}} are unclear about her birthplace; although it is also listed as Curaçao, she was probably born in Cabo Rojo to Dutch parents. After their marriage, the couple moved to a residence bought for 50 pesos by Creitoff's father, Geraldo. Months later Cofresí's father in-law lost his humble home in a fire, plunging the family into debt. Three years after his marriage Cofresí owned no property and lived with <b>his</b> <b>mother-in-law,</b> Anna Cordelia. He established ties with residents of San Germán, including his brothers-in-law: the wealthy merchant Don Jacobo Ufret and Don Manuel Ufret. The couple struggled to begin a family of their own, conceiving two sons (Juan and Francisco Matías) who died soon after birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving home {{in which}} Poe lived is in Baltimore, preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum. Poe {{is believed to}} have lived in the home at the age of 23 when he first lived with Maria Clemm and Virginia (as well as his grandmother and possibly his brother William Henry Leonard Poe). It {{is open to the public}} and is also the home of the Edgar Allan Poe Society. Of the several homes that Poe, his wife Virginia, and <b>his</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> Maria rented in Philadelphia, only the last house has survived. The Spring Garden home, where the author lived in 1843–1844, is today preserved by the National Park Service as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site. Poe's final home is preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage in the Bronx.|$|E
5|$|Aberdour Castle was {{reserved}} to <b>his</b> <b>mother-in-law,</b> Countess Katherine, until 1564, when Mary, Queen of Scots, confirmed Morton's {{right to the}} whole barony of Dalkeith and Aberdour. In 1566, Morton was involved in planning a rebellion against the Queen, {{which resulted in the}} murder of Queen Mary's secretary, David Riccio, but failed to gain further momentum, and Morton was forced to flee to England. However, {{by the end of the}} year he had returned, and by July the following year, Mary was imprisoned and had been forced to abdicate by the Scottish noblemen. Morton was appointed Regent of Scotland, for the child King James VI in 1572. He undertook extensions to the castle in the 1570s, rebuilding the south block of c. 1500, and extending it further south to form the present central range. He also drew inspiration from contemporary gardens in England, such as Hampton Court, in laying out the terraced gardens. The Privy Council met at Aberdour Castle in August 1576, but Morton's regency came to an end in 1578. He was later implicated in the 1567 murder of Queen Mary's husband, Lord Darnley, and executed in 1581 on the orders of the young King.|$|E

5|$|As a belated {{homage to}} his late father-in-law, Bizet {{took up the}} Noé {{manuscript}} and completed it. Parts of his moribund Vasco da Gama and Ivan IV were incorporated into the score, but a projected production at the Théâtre Lyrique failed to materialise when Carvalho's company finally went bankrupt, and Noé remained unperformed until 1885. Bizet's marriage was initially happy, but was affected by Geneviève's nervous instability (inherited from both her parents), her difficult relations {{with her mother and}} by Mme. Halévy's interference in the couple's affairs. Despite this, Bizet kept on good terms with <b>his</b> <b>mother-in-law</b> and maintained an extensive correspondence with her. In the year following the marriage, he considered plans for {{at least half a dozen}} new operas and began to sketch the music for two of them: Clarissa Harlowe based on Samuel Richardson's novel Clarissa, and Grisélidis with a libretto from Victorien Sardou. However, his progress on these projects was brought to a halt in July 1870, with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{concerns}} that the Queen might be barren, Henry and Eleanor had five children together. In 1239 Eleanor gave birth to their first child, Edward, named after the Confessor. Henry was overjoyed and held huge celebrations, giving lavishly to the Church and to the poor to encourage God to protect his young son. Their first daughter, Margaret, named after Eleanor's sister, followed in 1240, her birth also accompanied by celebrations and donations to the poor. Henry's third child, Beatrice, was named after <b>his</b> <b>mother-in-law,</b> and born in 1242 during a campaign in Poitou. Their fourth child, Edmund, arrived in 1245 and was named after the 9th-century saint: concerned about Eleanor's health, Henry donated {{large amounts of money}} to the Church throughout the pregnancy. A third daughter, Katherine, was born in 1253 but soon fell ill, possibly the result of a degenerative disorder such as Rett syndrome, and was unable to speak. She died in 1257 and Henry was distraught. Henry's children spent most of their childhood at Windsor Castle and he appears to have been extremely attached to them, rarely spending extended periods of time apart from his family.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Neighbours {{started out}} with three {{families}} created by Watson – the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes. Watson said {{that he wanted to}} show three families living in a small street, who are friends. Max Ramsay (Francis Bell), his wife Maria (Dasha Blahova) and their sons Shane (Peter O'Brien) and Danny (David Clencie) lived at No.24 Ramsay Street. Single father, Jim Robinson (Alan Dale) lived next door with his children, Paul (Stefan Dennis), Julie (Vikki Blanche), Scott (Darius Perkins) and Lucy (Kylie Flinker). <b>His</b> <b>mother-in-law,</b> Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) also lived with him. Bachelor Des Clarke (Paul Keane) invited Daphne Lawrence (Elaine Smith) to live at No. 28 with him and they were later married. The Robinsons and the Ramsays had a long history in the street and they were often involved in an ongoing rivalry. When Network Ten picked up the show and revamped it, they brought in new and younger actors including Kylie Minogue as Charlene Mitchell and Jason Donovan, who replaced Darius Perkins as Scott Robinson. Many families, including the Alessi, Bishop, Hancock, Hoyland, Rebecchi, Scully, Timmins and Willis families have moved {{in and out of the}} street over the years.|$|E
