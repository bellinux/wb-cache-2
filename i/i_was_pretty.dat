5|$|I {{read this}} book, and I was totally stunned. At {{the same time}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> upset with myself that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E

Of their songwriting process, Sweet has said: [...] " [...] was the real {{powerhouse}} behind it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> tentative in those days.

500|$|In early 1965, {{while they}} were his guests for dinner, Lennon and Harrison's dentist {{secretly}} added LSD to their coffee. Lennon described the experience: [...] "It was just terrifying, but it was fantastic. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> stunned {{for a month or}} two." [...] He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug, joined by Starr on at least one occasion. McCartney was initially reluctant to try it, but eventually did so in late 1966. He became the first Beatle to discuss LSD publicly, declaring in a magazine interview that [...] "it opened my eyes" [...] and [...] "made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society".|$|E
500|$|Whedon {{approached}} Nathan Fillion to {{play the}} lead role of Malcolm Reynolds; after Whedon explained the premise and showed him the treatment for the pilot, Fillion was eager for the role. Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast. He noted that [...] "it was really thrilling. It was my first lead and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> nervous, but I really wanted that part and I wanted to tell those stories." [...] Fillion later said he was [...] "heartbroken" [...] when he learned the series had been cancelled. Fillion has called his time on Firefly the best acting job he ever had, and compares every job {{he has had to}} it.|$|E
500|$|When Jennings was 11 {{he began}} {{attending}} Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, where he excelled in sports. After the CBC moved {{his father to}} its Ottawa headquarters in the early 1950s, Jennings transferred to Lisgar Collegiate Institute. He struggled academically, and Jennings later surmised that {{it was out of}} [...] "pure boredom" [...] that he failed 10th grade and dropped out. [...] "I loved girls," [...] he said. [...] "I loved comic books. And for reasons I don't understand, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> lazy."

500|$|During 1997, Ann Romney began {{experiencing}} severe numbness, fatigue, {{and other}} symptoms, {{and just before}} Thanksgiving in 1998, {{she was diagnosed with}} multiple sclerosis. [...] Mitt Romney described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as the worst day of his life. He later said: [...] "I couldn't operate without Ann. We're a partnership. We've always been a partnership so her being healthy and our being able to be together is essential." [...] She initially experienced a period of severe difficulty with the disease, and later said: [...] "I was very sick in 1998 when I was diagnosed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> desperate, pretty frightened and very, very sick. It was tough at the beginning, just to think, this is how I'm going to feel {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} and minor {{success of the}} band's debut album, Gish, The Smashing Pumpkins were being hyped as [...] "the next Nirvana". However, the band was {{experiencing}} several difficulties at the time. Drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was undergoing an increasingly severe addiction to heroin; James Iha and D'arcy Wretzky had recently broken up their romantic relationship; and Billy Corgan had become overweight, depressed {{to the point of}} contemplating suicide, and plagued by writer's block. Corgan recalled that [...] "after the first album, I became completely suicidal. It was an eight-month depression, give or take a month, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> suicidal for about two or three months." [...] Under the pressure and other complications, the Pumpkins entered the Triclops Sound Studios in Atlanta to record the follow-up to Gish.|$|E

"Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> happy." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1956, Gittings {{traveled}} to California {{on the advice}} of Donald Webster Cory, to visit the office of the new ONE, Inc., an early homophile organization that dedicated itself to providing support to homosexuals in the US. While in California, she met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who had co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in San Francisco. [...] "She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift and sandals. I remember she had this satchel, a backpack— I'd never seen anything like it. Or her", Lyon remembered. At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional bisexual character, not even homosexual. [...] "Even then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> assertive...What were they doing with a name like that? It wasn't very nice of me, but they seemed to take it with reasonably good spirits." ...|$|E
500|$|Hughes won the grudge {{match against}} Serra at UFC 98: Evans vs. Machida via {{unanimous}} decision. In the first round, both fighters collided heads, and Hughes got {{the worst of}} it. Despite this, Serra could not finish the fight and Hughes recovered rapidly. In the second stanza, Hughes controlled his opponent {{on the ground with}} his wrestling skills. The final round saw the former champions taking each other down and exchanging punches. The back and forth action rewarded both competitors with Fight of the Night honors. After the fight Hughes and Serra embraced each other and ended their feud. Hughes posted on his blog: [...] "When the fight was over, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> confident I was going to get my hand raised. Some people have asked why I raised his hand at the end. Actually I didn't, he raised mine. He also told me that, no matter what the decision was, he was done with the rivalry". After the fight Hughes said, [...] "I think I have a few more fights left in me." ...|$|E

[...] She faced {{criticism}} {{from her parents}} over her decision to marry and start a large family so young. [...] She also felt snubbed by her peers, {{at a time when}} the feminist movement was blooming and educated women were establishing careers. [...] She later said, [...] "My parents were questioning my choices, my peers were. But [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> resolute, pretty confident in what I was doing." [...] She taught early morning seminary to them and other children while her husband worked, first in business, then in politics. [...] She wanted to go on for a master's degree, perhaps in art history, but first taking care of her children, and later her health issues, forestalled that. [...] She was active in the local PTA and with the League of Women Voters. [...] With a friend, she held local cooking classes for a brief period. [...] Naturally athletic, she began playing tennis and became one of the best players around the local country clubs.|$|E

500|$|Although Drymon had a {{significant}} influence on SpongeBob SquarePants, he was not initially offered a role on the series. As a late recruit to Rocko's Modern Life, he had not established much of a relationship with Hillenburg before SpongeBobs conception. Hillenburg first sought out Drymon's storyboard partner, Mark O'Hare - but O'Hare had just created the soon-to-be syndicated comic strip, Citizen Dog, and while he would later join SpongeBob as a writer, lacked {{the time to get}} involved with both projects at the outset. Drymon has said, [...] "I remember Hillenburg's bringing it up to Mark in our office and asking him if he'd be interested in working on it...I was all ready to say yes to the offer, but Steve didn't ask; he just left the room. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> desperate...so I ran into the hall after him and basically begged him for the job. He didn't jump at the chance." [...] Once Hillenburg had given it some thought and decided to bring Drymon on as creative director, the two began meeting at Hillenburg's house multiple times a week to develop the series. Drymon has identified this period as having begun in 1996, shortly after the end of Rocko's Modern Life.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} put two {{characters}} of flesh and bone {{in the middle of}} all these artificial creatures," [...] Henson explained, [...] "and David Bowie embodies a certain maturity, with his sexuality, his disturbing aspect, all sorts of things that characterize the adult world". Henson met David Bowie in the summer of 1983 to seek his involvement, as Bowie was in the U.S. for his Serious Moonlight Tour at the time. Henson continued to pursue Bowie for the role of Jareth, and sent him each revised draft of the film's script for his comments. During a meeting that took place on June 18, 1984, Henson showed Bowie The Dark Crystal and a selection of Brian Froud's concept drawings to pique his interest in the project. Bowie formally agreed to take part on February 15, 1985, several months before filming began. Discussing why he chose to be involved in the film, Bowie explained, [...] "I'd always wanted to be involved in the music-writing aspect of a movie that would appeal to children of all ages, as well as everyone else, and I must say that Jim gave me a completely free hand with it. The script itself was terribly amusing without being vicious or spiteful or bloody, and it had a lot more heart in it than many other special effects movies. So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> hooked from the beginning." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{producers}} {{launched a}} nationwide talent hunt to discover new faces for the film, initially refusing to employ established actors. However, the actors {{who came to}} audition were not promising enough for the roles, and the idea was scrapped. Mahesh Bhatt said, [...] "It was a disastrous talent hunt. We discovered that people lacked the courage to audition. Those who are amateurs went for audition ...and people with certain talent were like why should we risk public rejection." [...] When Suri saw some pictures of Aditya Roy Kapur and met him, he found Kapur perfect for the role and cast him to play the male lead. In June 2012, Shraddha Kapoor was signed to play the female lead. Bhatt said, [...] "Yes, Shraddha Kapoor is playing the lead with the two boys Aditya Roy Kapur and Shaad Randhawa. We found her to be very talented. All three actors have extremely challenging dramatic roles." [...] When asked about replacing new actors with known ones, Suri said [...] "People said I couldn't make a film with new actors and expect an audience to come in. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> sure I wanted Aditya and Shraddha to play my protagonists. My writer Shagufta Rafique and I saw them as the protagonists. See, Aditya and Shraddha may have had unsuccessful films before. But that never took away from their talent." ...|$|E

500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] he said. As for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there was nothing to do except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E
