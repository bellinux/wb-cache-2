25|$|As for... {{the great}} {{question}} {{of the power of}} sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that {{it would be good for}} princes to be persuaded that their people have the right to resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of Grotius, that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> {{her figure}} {{as she stood}} leaning against the rock, with her hands crossed in front of her, lost in thought. <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> {{her face as she}} looked up quickly, startled by the sound of my {{footsteps}} in the deep stillness of the night.|$|R
60|$|And yet, suddenly, <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> Hamilton. <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> {{him without}} effort, without a shock, without a start. There he was, strolling toward the Harbour Office with his stiff, arrogant dignity. His red face made him {{noticeable}} at a distance. It flamed, over there, on the shady {{side of the}} street.|$|R

25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

500|$|During {{production}} of the fourth season, Beaver joined the limited series Harper's Island. Although he initially feared that it would prevent future appearances of Bobby, {{he was able to}} maintain his Supernatural [...] "quota" [...] with seven episodes. The character's role increased for the fifth season, which made sense for the actor due to the apocalyptic storyline. The season also introduced a new story arc for Bobby: his use of a wheelchair. Series creator Eric Kripke explained that it [...] " [...] the Apocalypse matter"; the writers wanted [...] "real stakes and real loss and real obstacles thrown in our heroes' way" [...] to differentiate it from prior seasons. Though he found it to be a challenge, Beaver enjoyed the experience because he could perform tricks on set that his wheelchair-using college roommate had taught him. However, the actor did [...] " [...] very seriously", and commented, [...] "I can get out of the chair {{at the end of the}} day and go home and <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> that, so many people can't and I have to be considerate to them and respect that." ...|$|E

500|$|On August 9, 1983, ABC {{announced}} that Jennings {{had signed a}} four-year contract with the network and would become the sole anchor and senior editor for World News Tonight on September 5. Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, {{and the beginning of}} what the media would deem the [...] "Big Three" [...] era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. [...] "With me, Brokaw and Rather, <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> that there will be the factor of three pretty faces," [...] he said. [...] "That's an inevitable byproduct of television. But if that is {{what it comes down to}} in terms of the approach we take, if our approach is that singular, then we will all have made a mistake." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the Palm Beach media {{attention}} and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy {{a very low}} 22percent national approval rating. A Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for re-election, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy had misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25points. Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991, dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer at Keck, Mahin & Cate, a divorced mother of two, and {{the daughter of an}} old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie. They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship. In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: [...] "I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> my own shortcomings– the faults in the conduct of my private life. I realize that I alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them." [...] In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case three years later. Kennedy's testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped convince the public that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended. Smith was acquitted.|$|E

2500|$|Large authors lists have {{attracted}} some criticism. One commentator wrote, [...] "In more than 25 years {{working as a}} scientific editor ...

[...] The rise of shared authorship has been attributed to Big Science—scientific experiments that require collaboration and specialization of many individuals.|$|E

2500|$|Bryan Cranston as Walter White– a {{chemistry}} teacher diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer who turns to making meth to secure his family's finances. As his shady business progresses, Walter gains a notorious reputation {{under the name}} of 'Heisenberg.' Cranston stated that, though he enjoyed doing comedy, he decided he ... should really focus on doing something else. But I think any good drama worth its weight always has a sprinkling of comedy in it, because you can ease the tension to an audience when it's necessary, and then build it back up again. Walt White has no clue he's occasionally funny, but as an actor, <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> when there are comedic moments and opportunities.|$|E

2500|$|As in his pre-trial appearance, at {{the opening}} of the 19 October Trial Saddam {{appeared}} defiant. He rejected the tribunal's legitimacy and independence from the control of the foreign occupation. [...] "I do not respond to this so-called court, with all due respect to its people, and I retain my constitutional right as the president of Iraq", Saddam declared. He added, [...] "Neither do <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> the body that has designated and authorized you, nor the aggression because all that has been built on false basis is false." [...] When the judge asked for his name, Saddam refused, stating [...] "I am the president of the Iraq". He returned the question, asking Kurdish judge Rizgar Mohammed Amin, [...] "Who are you? I want to know who you are." [...] When Amin addressed Saddam as [...] "the former president", Saddam objected emphatically, saying he was still the President of the Republic of Iraq and had not been deposed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accusation}} tarnished Bryant's reputation, as the public's {{perception of}} Bryant plummeted, and his endorsement contracts with McDonald's and Nutella were terminated. Sales for Bryant's replica jersey fell significantly from their previous highs. However, in September 2004, the assault case was dropped by prosecutors after the accuser refused {{to testify in}} the trial. Afterward, Bryant agreed to apologize to her for the incident, including his public mea culpa: [...] "Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> now {{that she did not}} and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter." [...] The accuser filed a separate civil lawsuit against Bryant, which the two sides ultimately settled with the specific terms of the settlement being undisclosed to the public.|$|E
