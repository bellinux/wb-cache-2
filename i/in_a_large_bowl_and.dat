5000|$|The meat-based raw {{materials}} used in the pudding are sourced from the producers who farm within a six-mile (10 km) radius of the factory at Timoleague whereas {{most of the other}} ingredients used (cereals, onions, casings) are sourced outside the immediate area. One of the cardinal features of this pudding is the cereal is soaked in fresh pig's blood the night before preparation of the pudding. The following morning, the remaining ingredients are minced together <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> blended into the blood mixture before being placed in the casings. Once filled, the puddings are boiled in water for 15 minutes. After boiling, the puddings are taken out and left to cool. [...] The pudding is brown in colour, is a long cylindrical sausage shape which forms naturally into rings and is made from fresh pigs' blood, pork trimming, cereal, fresh onions, seasonings, spices and natural casings. It comes in weights of between 750 and 1000 grams (1.7-2.2 lb). Due to the inclusion of fresh blood, the taste of the pudding can be described as very clean and rustic. The process of pre-soaking pig's blood in oatmeal is a continuation of the traditional west Cork method of combining blood and cereal in a pudding to give it its distinctive regional texture and taste.|$|E

50|$|Until the 1840s, punsch {{was served}} as a warm punch, created just before consumption: a sugarloaf was placed upright <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl,</b> hot water was poured over it to make the sugar dissolve, and arrack, unflavoured spirits and German Rhine wine was added. Still warm, the drink was then served in cups. However, in 1845 wine {{importing}} company J. Cederlunds Söner started selling premixed punsch in bottles, quickly followed by several other manufacturers, and the habit of drinking punsch cold as a liqueur began to take hold. However, on Thursdays, punsch is still traditionally served warm with Swedish pea & pork soup and pancakes.|$|R
50|$|Cotton candy, {{also known}} as Candy Floss, {{is a form of}} spun sugar. Typical {{machines}} used to make cotton candy include a spinning head enclosing a small bowl into which granulated sugar is poured. Colored sugar or separate sugar and food coloring are used to provide color. Heaters near the rim of the head melt the sugar, which is squeezed out through tiny holes by centrifugal force, and the molten sugar solidifies in the air and is caught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> which totally surrounds the spinning head. After the product builds up on the inside walls of the <b>larger</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>a</b> stick, cone, or hands are inserted, upon which the sugar strands are gathered.|$|R

25|$|Ice cream {{was made}} by hand <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> placed inside <b>a</b> tub filled with ice and salt. This was called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sorbetière (a covered pail with a handle {{attached}} to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, {{the temperature of the}} ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.|$|R
50|$|Buildings were {{constructed}} on allegedly waterproof waxed card bases. The bricks etc. were stuck {{together with a}} mortar made from a mixture of flour and chalk powder. It required {{a great amount of}} skill to erect buildings accurately, very time-consuming and beyond the patience of most of the children it was aimed at (8 to 14 years). Especially so in cold houses (as most British homes then were) it would take several days for the building to 'set'. Reusing the components involved a process of dunking the entire model <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> of warm water. After the model fell apart the bricks and plaster pieces required lengthy rinsing to remove all organic traces to prevent mould growing on them.|$|R

40|$|Golden Ten is an {{observation}} game which is {{played with a}} small ball rolling down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl.</b> This paper describes {{the motion of the}} ball in the bowl by means of deterministic mechanical model, which leads to a set of ordinary second-order differential equations. A first impression of the solution is obtained through a numerical approximation, based on some preliminary estimates. Part of the solution is computed exactly, yielding a simple estimation procedure for the coefficient of air friction, {{which is one of the}} two main parameters controlling the system (the other parameter is the angle of inclination). An asymptotic solution method eventually leads to an approximate explicit solution, describing the motion of the ball as an elliptical spiral. One of the conclusions is a simple prediction strategy...|$|R

Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil <b>in</b> <b>a</b> deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|R

50|$|A typical frybread recipe {{consists}} of flour, water, salt, {{a small amount}} of oil, and baking powder. The ingredients are mixed and worked into a simple dough, and covered with a cloth for 30 minutes to an hour, until the dough rises. It is then formed into small balls, and are either rolled or pulled into flat discs prior to frying in hot oil. Many variations of this basic recipe exist, including substituting mayonnaise for oil in the dough (which produces a crisp, crunchy texture that resists getting soggy - ideal for Navajo tacos), and leavening the dough with a small container of yogurt or soured milk instead of using baking powder or yeast (produces a rich, sourdough flavor but requires several hours to fully leaven after the dough is prepared). Most frybread recipes do not use yeast at all because it was not typically available to Native peoples when this foodstuff was developed. In many Native American households, frybread dough is mixed {{early in the morning and}} left <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> covered with <b>a</b> cloth to leaven and is used throughout the day to prepare fresh bread when needed.|$|R

Spicy mustard sauce (or mustard oil) and vinegar are often added before consumption. Traditionally, the long noodles would be eaten without cutting, as they symbolized longevity {{of life and}} good health, but servers at restaurants usually ask if the noodles should be cut prior to eating, and use scissors to cut the noodles.|$|R
