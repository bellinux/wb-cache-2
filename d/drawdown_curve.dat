40|$|AbstractSingle-well and group-well pumping {{tests were}} {{undertaken}} {{in a deep}} gravel formation of the Taipei basin to determine the hydraulic parameters and better understand the drawdown characteristics across the basin. The periodic drawdown fluctuation due to tidal loading from the overlying river resulted in a difficulty in determining the hydraulic parameters by those conventionally used graphic techniques.

Declines in water levels have resulted and investigations have been made by the Geological Survey in cooperation with the Texas Board of Water Engineers to determine the capacities of the formations to yield water to wells. The most reliable index of the quantity of water that a formation will yield has heretofore been considered to be the em-. pirical correlation of pumpage and water levels in wells. Studies of re-charge, 'laboratory studies of permeability and specific yield of water-bearing materials, and measurements of specific capacities of wells have also proven valuable.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{hydraulic}} response to pumping of leaky perched aquifers that receive continuous recharge. We explore whether distinct <b>drawdown</b> <b>curves</b> result that might reveal boundary effects or {{the position of}} the production well within the aquifer. Three-dimensional saturated-unsaturated simulations were developed to generate both circular (point-source recharge) and rectangular (line-source recharge) perched aquifer systems. Once the simulations stabilized at quasi steady-state in response to recharge, pumping at a constant-rate was imposed on the perched aquifer system. Diagnostic plots of the simulated log drawdown log time, as well as time-derivative curves, were analyzed. Results showed a repeatable, distinctive pattern of late-time negative slope-derivative curves that result from the size of the perched aquifer decreasing due to pumping and from continuing leakage through the aquitard as the system returns to steady-state. Because leakage decreases as the size and saturated thickness of the perched aquifer diminishes, additional water is available to meet pump demands and the rate of drawdown in the well decreases. This behavior is due to the small and constrained geometry of the aquifer. A lower pump rate required less reductio...|$|R

This study involves a pump test investigation using Modflow (ModelMuse interface) to simulate a hydraulic fracture in coal. The investigation aimed to determine how Modflow responded to the presence of a fracture. This was achieved by comparing changes in pump test drawdown in response to changes in the dimensions and hydraulic properties of the coal and fracture using the oil industry "Fracture Conductivity" formula. The flow profile of the simulation was also compared with theoretical pump test drawdown equations to determine if, within the model, the flow around the well changed from radial to linear. The investigation found that the flow profile created in Modflow was neither linear nor radial, and instead created an ellipsoidal radial flow profile. Simulations with equal Fracture Conductivity values but different fracture dimensions produced different <b>drawdown</b> <b>curves.</b> This {{may be due to the}} model using Darcy flow within the fracture, while Fracture Conductivity assumes flow between two plates, resulting in a different head gradient-discharge relationship within a fracture.

The lithophysal rock is described as a tri-continuum medium, consisting of fractures, rock matrices, and cavities.

Global flow occurs through the fracture network only, while rock matrices and cavities contain the majority of fluid storage and provide fluid drainage to the fractures. Interporosity flows between the triple media are described using a pseudosteady-state concept and the system is characterized by interporosity transmissivity ratios and storativity ratio of each continuum. Pressure behavior is analyzed by examining the pressure <b>drawdown</b> <b>curves,</b> the derivative plots, and the effects of the characteristic parameters.

40|$|A novel {{modeling}} {{approach is}} applied to karst hydrology. Long-standing problems in karst hydrology and solute transport are addressed using Lattice Boltzmann methods (LBMs). These methods contrast with other modeling approaches that have been applied to karst hydrology. The motivation of this dissertation is to develop new computational models for solving ground water hydraulics and transport problems in karst aquifers, which are widespread around the globe. This research tests {{the viability of the}} LBM as a robust alternative numerical technique for solving large-scale hydrological problems. The LB models applied in this research are briefly reviewed and there is a discussion of implementation issues. The dissertation focuses on testing the LB models. ^ The LBM is tested for two different types of inlet boundary conditions for solute transport in finite and effectively semi-infinite domains. The LBM solutions are verified against analytical solutions. Zero-diffusion transport and Taylor dispersion in slits are also simulated and compared against analytical solutions. These results demonstrate the LBM’s flexibility as a solute transport solver. ^ The LBM {{is applied to}} simulate solute transport and fluid flow in porous media traversed by larger conduits. A LBM-based macroscopic flow solver (Darcy’s law-based) is linked with an anisotropic dispersion solver. Spatial breakthrough curves in one and two dimensions are fitted against the available analytical solutions. This provides a steady flow model with capabilities routinely found in ground water flow and transport models (e. g., the combination of MODFLOW and MT 3 D). However the new LBM-based model retains the ability to solve inertial flows that are characteristic of karst aquifer conduits. ^ Transient flows in a confined aquifer are solved using two different LBM approaches. The analogy between Fick’s second law (diffusion equation) and the transient ground water flow equation is used to solve the transient head distribution. An altered-velocity flow solver with source/sink term is applied to simulate a <b>drawdown</b> <b>curve.</b> Hydraulic parameters like transmissivity and storage coefficient are linked with LB parameters.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Coal Seam Gas (CSG) (sometimes called Coal Seam Methane or Coal Bed Methane) {{is a form}} {{of natural}} gas found in some coal deposits. This gas is mainly methane with small amount of carbon dioxide. The methane gas is {{generated}} from the organic matter under biologic and/or thermal processes over geologic time. In many geologies hydraulic fracturing is used to increase the permeability and extract the gas more efficiently from the coal seam. This study aimed to understand the effects of hydraulic fracturing on a coal seam aquifer, performed in the HB 02 gas well located in the north of the Sydney Basin at Broke, in the Hunter Valley, NSW, Australia. To do this, an observed pumping test response was used to compare the performance of three different groundwater models that simulate either single phase (water only) and multiphase (water and methane) conditions. This research posed four questions: (1) Are we able to realistically simulate the groundwater flow in a multiphase flow that includes a mixture of water and gas? (2) Can the extraction of both phases from an artificially fractured coal seam be simulated with enough accuracy that we can provide an adequate estimation of the coal and fracture properties? (3) What do the well functions for a fractured well look like? (4) How do these insights improve our understanding of a CSG well; particularly, how much water is produced? The methodology employed multiple stages of analysis. The key stages in this analysis provide insight into the development of the single phase groundwater simulation and they include a sensitivity analysis of the model to coal and fracture parameters using the GMS (Groundwater Modeling System) software. It was determined that a varying hydraulic conductivity with distance from the well (modeled by geology zonation with distance from the well) improved the realism of groundwater flow patterns and the match to the well <b>drawdown</b> <b>curve.</b> Following the confirmation of qualitatively correct flow patterns and drawdowns, subsequent calibration established that the conductivity and the specific storage of the unfractured coal seam were important parameters for which the model was highly sensitive. Despite obtaining reasonable agreement between the predicted and observed drawdown curves, some subtle but significant mismatches remained. To confirm the validity of the GMS simulations, an alternative single phase model was developed, using TOUGH 2 (Transport Of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat) with the single phase EOS 1 module, with functionally equivalent to the GMS model. Both GMS and TOUGH 2 /EOS 1 produced similar results, with the same subtle mismatches, though there were slight improvements using TOUGH 2. This established that the two models, with slightly different numerical formulations, could produce similar results, but were similarly unable to capture some important behaviours observed in the multiphase flow data from the HB 02 well. More refined simulations using the TOUGH 2 /EOS 7 C multiphase module, with the addition of gas modeling, revealed significant changes in model performance. For the same model parameters which gave the best simulations for the single phase flow simulations, the accuracy of the multiphase model was greatly reduced, requiring the model to be recalibrated. After recalibration, TOUGH 2 /EOS 7 gave slightly better results than both TOUGH 2 /EOS 1 and GMS, although the strong curvature evident in the observed <b>drawdown</b> <b>curve</b> could still not be adequately predicted. This implies that the application of single phase models to a multiphase problem may be associated with greater uncertainty than explicitly modeling gas flow. As such, in selecting a modeling approach for fracked gas wells, consideration should be given to the balance between computational efficiency and simplicity of the model, and ease of calibration, and ultimately the certainty (or uncertainty) constraints associated with the inferred coal seam properties. In answer to the second research question, the uncertainty and identifiability of the TOUGH 2 /EOS 7 C parameters was assessed by the use of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) method. This provided insight into the values of the parameters likely to best represent the coal seam where the HB 02 well is located, and which parameters could not be reliably calibrated from the well test data. Most parameters were non-identifiable; however the model was sensitive to the half-length of the fracture and the permeability of the surrounding coal seam. Furthermore, it was discovered that there were high levels of interaction between these two parameters, suggesting a balance between the volume/conductivity associated with the fracture and surrounding coal seam was the key to providing a realistic simulation. This interaction was quantified and found to be robust against changes in the objective function used for model calibration. Furthermore it was found that information sometimes collected during fracking (total volume of sand injected and thus frack volume, permeability of the sand, length of the frack using microseismic) provided little incremental benefit in reducing overall parameter uncertainty other than for that characteristic directly measured. In answer to the third research question, the well test was best fit by a bilinear flow field, rather than a radial flow field, so that, at least for the first 11 days of the flow test, the well function of a bilinear flow is more appropriate than that of a radial flow field. In addition, there was strong evidence for a reduction with distance from the well of the unfracked coal permeability, which may reflect a non-trivial density of small subsidiary fracks around the well that are not modeled by using a single large frack. In answer to the fourth research question the aquifer water yield (i. e. as parameterised by the aquifer storativity or the coal matrix compressibility) was found to be unidentifiable from the well test meaning that the 11 day duration of the well test was insufficient to reliably assess the long term water yield of the well. Thus the well test was unable to improve on a priori estimates of the total long-term water yield for a production well field...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBecause of {{the various}} types and scales of {{heterogeneities}} encountered in calcareous rocks, flow and transport modelling in limestone aquifers {{remains one of the}} most challenging problems in subsurface hydrology. Important questions remain unanswered at the field scale as to what extent the concepts used in models are based on realistic descriptions of a rock volume and whether adequate data can be collected from site characterization. In order to improve the predictive capabilities of numerical models, there is a real need for modelling to study real data sets collected from a variety of hydro-geologic environments. However, there is a dearth of in-situ research facilities in bedded rocks as compared to those developed in crystalline rocks (mainly related to radioactive waste management studies). As a contribution to fill this gap, a new experimental site has been developed in Poitiers, France. The Hydrogeological Experimental Site (HES) of Poitiers covers an area of 12 hectares and includes 32 wells drilled to a depth of 120 m. The focus is on a 100 m-thick confined limestone aquifer. Extensive hydrogeophysical investigations have been made at the HES since 2002 (see the recent synthesis by Audouin et al. 2008) which indicate that flowpaths in the HES aquifer are strongly constrained within (1) subhorizontal karstic structures and (2) subvertical fractures. Typically-shaped <b>drawdown</b> <b>curves</b> have been consistently monitored during pumping tests. These curves show an upward curvature when plotted versus the logarithm of time, which makes them uninterpretable with conventional models such as the Cooper and Jacob straight-line method. A second particular feature is that most <b>drawdown</b> <b>curves</b> are merged both in time and amplitude, which may infer that each location of the HES is evenly stressed irrespective of its distance from the pumped well. Such behaviour stems from the very rapid propagation of pressure-head perturbations through preferential flowpath networks made by fractures and karstic channels, which has been proven by cross-borehole slug test analysis (Audouin and Bodin 2008). From a scientific point of view, the overall HES heterogeneity (dual nature of hydraulic flowpaths, clustering of karstic structures, limestone texture variability) and the large amount of data collected since 2002 offer a great opportunity to get new insights in the hydrogeologic modelling of limestone aquifers. Since October 2006, six modelling teams have been involved in a national research project attempting to confront different modelling approaches to the HES data (MACH- 1 project: "Modelling of Heterogeneous Carbonate Aquifers – 1. Flow Dynamics"). The tested models are based on various conceptual/numerical approaches: 2 D heterogeneous continuum, 2 D double/triple continuum, discrete-continuum hybrid model, fractured porous media, 3 D discrete fracture networks, and 3 D pipe-networks. The main goal of the MACH- 1 project is to analyse to which extent the variability and density of the HES data are both relevant and sufficient to confer some predictive capabilities to these models.

The effects of sedimentary facies and fracture distribution on groundwater flow and resource exploitation are studied in the ancient fan delta of Sant Llorenç de Munt (central Catalonia, Spain) by integrating geological field observations (using sequence stratigraphy methods) and hydrogeological data (pumping tests, hydrochemistry and environmental isotopes). A comprehensive analysis of data portrays the massif as a single unit, constituted by different compartments determined by specific layers and sets of fractures. Two distinct flow systems—local and regional—are identified based on pumping test analysis as well as hydrochemical and isotopic data. <b>Drawdown</b> <b>curves</b> derived from pumping tests indicate that {{the behavior of the}} saturated layers, whose main porosity is given by the fracture network, corresponds to a confined aquifer. Pumping tests also reflect a double porosity within the system and the occurrence of impervious boundaries that support a compartmentalized model for the whole aquifer system. Hydrochemical data and associated spatial evolution show the result of water–rock interaction along the flow lines. Concentration of magnesium, derived from dolomite dissolution, is a tracer of the flow-path along distinct stratigraphic units. Water stable isotopes indicate that evaporation (near a 5 % loss) occurs in a thick unsaturated zone within the massif before infiltration reaches the water table.

40|$|A {{pumping test}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate aquifer characteristics, the percentage of tube well discharge derived from the stream, and the effective distance to the stream simulated as a fully penetrating plane source of constant head. The formulae are applicable although a natural stream is seldom fully penetrating, because {{the distance from the}} stream to an equivalent fully penetrating but imaginary plane source can be calculated. When pumping begins, the tube well obtains most of its water from the immediate vicinity, but as the cone of influence expands, it receives a part of its water from the stream until a time is reached when it draws the entire amount of water from the stream. This will of course depend upon the aquifer characteristics, the tube well discharge, distance of the tube well from stream and the infiltration regimen of the stream. Different methods were used to find the distance of stream equivalent to a fully penetrating plane source, the determination of coefficient of transmissibility and coefficient of storage, and, lastly, the amount of water that the tube well intercepts from the stream. The distance of the stream as a fully penetrating plane source by Rorabaugh’s modification of the Theis formula ranges from l' 70 feet to ioo feet and the value of coefficient of transmissibility is 0. 77 cubic ft. /sec. / ft. The equivalent distance by Stallman’s modification of the Theis formula is l 90 feet and coefficient of transmissibility 0. 6 g. The equivalent distance by the inflection point method of Hantush ranges from 1500 feet to 2100 feet, the coefficient of transmissibility from 0. 73 to 0. 79 cubic ft. /sec. and coefficient of storage is 0. 05. The coefficient of transmissibility by considering it as a leaky aquifer is 0. 715 cubic ft. /sec. The coefficient of storage by the volume method is 0. 065 and the contribution of the stream to the tube well discharge is 86 %. The contribution of the stream to the tube well is 93 % by the image theory. The results derived, based on mathematical theory, were also checked by preparing contour maps of drawdown for different times and calculating the volume dewatered by the pumping well at different times and plotting it against total pumpage and thus estimating the coefficient of storage. }or the determination of effective distance, only distant pipes from the tube well were used to avoid effects due to partial penetration and non-radial flow. The data for later time were used assuming that canal leakage fully affected the pipe under analysis and it was not a time variable. As determination of T and S was based upon the inflection point on a time <b>drawdown</b> <b>curve</b> for the analysis, only pipes near the canals were chosen, where the recharge was predominant, and so the determination of inflection point and maximum drawdown were easier.

The pumping test behaviour is complicated by: the fractured condition of the Chalk, simultaneous pumping from adjacent boreholes, and variable pumping rates during the test. In addition, the groundwater flow system is complicated by quarrying of the Chalk. Analytical solutions for pumping test analysis fail to represent these complex flow processes and cannot reproduce the observed time <b>drawdown</b> <b>curves.</b> A layered cylindrical grid numerical model has been applied to the results of the Swanscombe pumping test.

40|$|International audienceFractional flow models {{introduced}} by Barker (1988) have been increasingly popular as means of interpreting nonclassical <b>drawdown</b> <b>curves</b> obtained from well tests. Fractional flow models are intrinsically isotropic scaling models depending to first order on two exponents n and dw expressing {{the dimension of}} the structure available to flow and the flow slowdown, respectively. We study the fractional flow induced either by geometrically scaling structures such as Sierpinski- and percolation-like fractal media or by hydraulically scaling media such as long-range continuous correlated media. First, percolation and Sierpinski structures have two well-separated dw values in the range [2. 6, 3] and [1. 9, 2. 5], respectively. The bottlenecks, characteristic of percolation, induce a more anomalous transport (larger dw values) than the impervious zones present at all scales of Sierpinskis. Second, the realization-based values of n and dw depend both on global and on local characteristics like the fractal dimension and the permeability around the well, respectively. Finally, solving the inverse problem on anomalous transient well test responses consists in comparing the (n, dw) realization-based values with field data. Indeed, well tests performed from a unique pumping well must be taken as realization-based results. For the site of Ploemeur (Brittany, France), from which n and dw have been previously determined (Le Borgne et al., 2004), the only consistent model is given by the continuous multifractals. However, the values obtained from continuous multifractals cover most of the (n, dw) plane, and realization-based results are not selective in terms of model. So this should {{be replaced by the}} comparison of (n, dw) values averaged over different pumping well locations, which however requires a significantly larger quantity of field tests...|$|R

The area around the Broke township (located in the north-west of the Sydney Basin) has had coal seam gas exploration activities over the last decade. One methodology of well stimulation, hydraulic fracturing, {{has the potential to}} cause some environmental problems. The Broke region includes 4 aquifers (3 confined and semi-confined), more than 3 major coal seams (3 gas bearing) and has been covered by variety of different sedimentary rocks of Permian age. The groundwater system, with the gas bearing deposits is the function of conductivity and storativity (K and S) of the coal seam and geometry of properties of the fractures. The required data to investigate the hydraulic properties in the fractured zone includes; corehole data to assessment the geology and underground system, micro-seismic data to infer the fracture properties, pumping tests results, and monitoring wells data to evaluate the hydraulic properties of the coal seams. This paper investigates the shape of <b>drawdown</b> <b>curves,</b> resulting from the hydraulic pumping tests at Broke performed to determine the hydraulic and fracture properties, such as length, width, conductivity of fractures, and the proportion of the water and gas contained in the targeted coal seam. In order to reduce data uncertainty and increase the reliability of the hydraulic property estimation the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) will be applied.

40|$|The {{study of}} fluid flow in {{fractured}} rocks {{plays a key}} role in reservoir management, including CO 2 sequestration and waste isolation. We present a mathematical model of fluid flow in a fault zone, based on field data acquired in Majella Mountain, in the Central Apennines (Italy). The Majella is a thrust related, asymmetric, box shaped anticline. The mountain carbonate outcrops are part of a lower Cretaceous-Miocene succession, covered by a siliciclastic sequence of lower Pliocene age. We study a fault zone located in the Bolognano Formation (Oligo-Miocene age) and exposed in the Roman Valley Quarry near the town of Lettomanoppello, in the northern sector of the Majella Mountain. This is one of the best places in the Apennines to investigate a fault zone and has been the subject of numerous field studies. Faults are mechanical and permeability heterogeneities in the upper crust, so they strongly influence fluid flow. The distribution of the main components (core, damage zone) can lead a fault zone to act as a conduit, a barrier or a combined conduit-barrier system. We integrated existing and our own structural surveys of the area to better identify the major fault features (e. g., kind of fractures, statistical properties, geometry and pertrophysical characteristics). Our analytical model describe the Bolognano Formation using a dual porosity/dual permeability model: global flow occurs through the fracture network only, while rock matrix contain the majority of fluid storage and provide fluid drainage to the fractures. Pressure behavior is analyzed by examining the pressure <b>drawdown</b> <b>curves,</b> the derivative plots and the effects of the characteristic parameters. The analytical model has been calibrated against published data on fluid flow and pressure distribution in the Bolognano Formation...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} considering reciprocal <b>drawdown</b> <b>curves</b> for the characterization of hydraulic properties of aquifer systems through inverse modeling based on interference well testing. Reciprocity implies that drawdown observed in a well B when pumping takes place from well A should strictly coincide with the drawdown observed in A when pumping in B with the same flow rate as in A. In this context, a critical point related to applications of hydraulic tomography is {{the assessment of the}} number of available independent drawdown data and their impact on the solution of the inverse problem. The issue arises when inverse modeling relies upon mathematical formulations of the classical single-continuum approach to flow in porous media grounded on Darcy's law. In these cases, introducing reciprocal draw down curves in the database of an inverse problem is equivalent to duplicate some information, to a certain extent. We present a theoretical analysis of the way a Least-Square objective function and a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm are affected by the introduction of reciprocal information in the inverse problem. We also {{investigate the}} way these reciprocal data, eventually corrupted by measurement errors, influence model parameter identification in terms of: (a) the convergence of the inverse model, (b) the optimal values of parameter estimates, and (c) the associated estimation uncertainty. Our theoretical findings are exemplified through a suite of computational examples focused on block heterogeneous systems with increased complexity level. We find that the introduction of noisy reciprocal information in the objective function of the inverse problem has a very limited influence on the optimal parameter estimates. Convergence of the inverse problem improves when adding diverse (nonreciprocal) drawdown series, but does not improve when reciprocal information is added to condition the flow model. The uncertainty on optimal parameter estimates is influenced by the strength of measurement errors and it is not significantly diminished or increased by adding noisy reciprocal information...|$|R

Transmissivity was estimated from specific capacity values obtained from 378 well drillers 2 ̆ 7 records and keyed into a spatial database. Five pumping tests were also performed. Four of the tests were single-well tests using private domestic wells, and one was a multiple-well test using high-yield municipal wells owned and operated by Logan City. The sites selected for conducting the aquifer tests were the Stevenson well in Weston, Idaho in an unconfined alluvial aquifer; the Tomkinson well south of Newton, Utah in the confined gravels of western Cache Valley; the Henningsen well east of Paradise, Utah in the Salt Lake Formation; the Luthy well east of Cove, Utah in the Salt Lake Formation; and three Logan City, Utah wells in the principal aquifer. Drawdown data collected for each test provide clues regarding the surrounding geology, including the existence of a low permeability barrier and the possible presence of fractured material. The transmissivity and storativity of the principal aquifer, into which the Logan City wells are screened, have been estimated to be 300, 000 square feet per day (ft 2 /day) and 0. 000275, respectively. <b>Drawdown</b> <b>curves</b> from wells penetrating close to the East Cache fault display boundary effects. The GIS database shows that the principal aquifer underlies {{the east side of the}} valley between Smithfield and Hyrum, and has the highest density of wells, most of which are screened into confined unconsolidated gravels.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} first {{demonstrates the}} effectiveness of hydraulic tomography (HT) in characterizing the heterogeneity of both the saturated and unsaturated zone parameters through a laboratory unconfined aquifer. Specifically, a geostatistical inversion algorithm that considers variably saturated flow processes (successive linear estimator (SLE) developed by Mao 2013 c)) in unconfined aquifers is utilized to obtain tomograms of hydraulic conductivity (K), specific storage (Ss), and the unsaturated zone parameters (pore size parameter (α) and saturated water content (θs)) for the Gardner-Russo's model. The estimated tomograms accurately capture the locations of heterogeneity including high and low K layers within the saturated and unsaturated zones compared to the true stratigraphy visible in the sandbox, as well as reasonable distribution patterns of α and θs for the Gardner-Russo's model. The estimated tomograms are then used to predict drawdown responses of pumping tests not used in the inverse modeling effort. The simulated and observed <b>drawdown</b> <b>curves</b> show an excellent agreement for observations in both the saturated and unsaturated zones. Drawdown predictions of the geostatistical inversion approach are significantly better than those based on the homogeneous assumption. Results of this study demonstrates the robust performance of HT that considers variably saturated flow processes in unconfined aquifers and the unsaturated zone above it, and substantiate the unbiased and minimal variance of HT analysis with the SLE algorithm. Then, this dissertation investigates the importance of geological data in HT through sandbox experiments. Four geological models with homogeneous units are constructed with borehole data of varying accuracy. These geological models are calibrated to multiple pumping test data of two different pumping and observation densities. Results show that both accurate and inaccurate geological models can be well calibrated and inaccurate geological models yield poor drawdown predictions for model validation. Moreover, model calibration and validation comparisons among layer-based geological models and a highly parameterized geostatistical model show that the performance gap between the approaches decreases {{as the number of}} pumping tests and monitoring locations are reduced. Next, four geological models are populated with permeameter test K values for each layer and used as prior mean information in geostatistical inverse models. Results show that the estimated K tomograms preserve geological features especially in areas where drawdown data are not available. Overall, this sandbox study emphasizes that accurate geological data is important for incorporating into HT surveys when data from pumping tests are sparse. Finally, this dissertation looks into the importance of geological data in HT through field experiments conducted at a highly heterogeneous glaciofluvial deposit at the North Campus Research Site (NCRS) of the University of Waterloo. Unlike the sandbox study in which the stratigraphy is perfectly known, geological data are obtained from 18 boreholes at NCRS. Two geological models of different resolutions are constructed. One model contains 19 layers while the other model merges some of the units resulting in five layers. Steady state pressure head data of 14 pumping tests are selected from the site for model calibration and validation purposes. The results are first compared with permeameter-estimated K profiles along boreholes. Results reveal that the simultaneous calibration of geological models to seven pumping test data yields K values that correctly reflect the general patterns of vertical distributions of permeameter-estimated K. In addition, this study finds that using a geological model as prior information in the geostatistical inversion approach leads to improved correspondence of K estimates to permeameter test results along wells, as well as in preserving geological features where drawdown measurements are lacking. Therefore, the field study suggests incorporating geological data for HT analysis based on geostatistical inverse modeling approaches when reliable geological data are available...|$|R
40|$|History {{matching}} and {{prediction of}} future performance of hydrocarbon reservoirs and groundwater aquifers are considered {{some of the}} biggest challenges facing hydrologists and petroleum engineers. The complexity of the simulation method, in addition to the huge amount of input data, makes evaluating the reservoir performance expensive. The conventional reservoir history matching procedure usually requires a trial and error process of altering various reservoir parameters and simulating the pressure distribution and field production, or what is known as 'Forward Modeling'. In this study, I propose the use of regular electrical arrays to simulate aquifer drawdowns. By representing reservoir hydraulic conductivities as electric resistors and storativities as capacitors, simulating the potential response gives results similar to that of solving the hydraulic flow equations. Scaling the electrical parameters results in an equivalent approximation of voltage and hydraulic head. A set of synthetic aquifer models with increasing structure complexity were simulated under the Dupuit-Fochheimer assumption of negligible vertical flow. Under the finite difference scheme, aquifers subjected to a constant pumping rate were modeled under different boundary conditions. The transient <b>drawdown</b> data <b>curves</b> from either a single well or multiple wells were obtained, and the reservoir data were inverted for the hydraulic parameters. Because both electrical and hydraulic approaches result in similar response, parameters inversion can be performed on either system. Consequently, the hydraulic equations were used in the inversion. Inversion was performed according to the method of damped least-square where the Jacobian matrix is decomposed by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Furthermore, hydraulic aquifers are attempted to be modeled with a binary conductivity structure, which is an effective medium of two hydraulic conductivities. by Saleh Mohammed Al Nasser. Thesis: S.

40|$|Pumping {{tests are}} used to {{determine}} important aquifer parameters such as hydraulic conductivity (K), specific storage (Ss) and specific yield (Sy). Knowledge of these parameters is important for quantitative analysis of groundwater systems {{in order to address}} hydrogeologic issues such as groundwater supply for municipalities and irrigation projects, contaminant transport and remediation, and geotechnical projects. In this study, aquifer parameters were estimated in an unconfmed fluvial aquifer at a research wellfield, the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS), by using WTAQ (Moench, 1995, 1997), an analytical model, to analyze a series of fully-penetrating pumping tests that were conducted in 1999. The pumping tests generally consisted of one pumping well and five observation wells with pressure transducers used to measure the drawdown in the pumping and observation wells. From these tests, data from 73 pumping well-observation well pairs were analyzed using an analytical model to determine aquifer parameters (K, Ss, and Sy). <b>Drawdown</b> <b>curves</b> were generated with an analytical model using a forward modeling process to match the observed drawdown data for a given pumping and observation well pair. In addition, wellbore skin at both the pumping and observation wells was included in the analytical model to account for observed head losses associated with the wells. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate if the parameter values determined by the forward modeling were tightly constrained. This quality control check was accomplished by fixing a given parameter (skin hydraulic conductivity of the observation well, Ks_OBS; aquifer thickness, b; Ss; or Sy) at the high or low end of the range of values determined by the forward modeling. The other parameters were then adjusted to achieve a curve match between the drawdown data and the analytical model predicted drawdown with time. The goodness of fit on the initial forward modeling curve matches and the sensitivity analysis curve matches were compared by performing a sum of squared error (SSE) analysis. The goodness of fit between the initial forward modeling curve matches and the sensitivity analysis curve matches were found to be similar for all parameters tested in the sensitivity analysis except Ks_Q. The SSE values for the sensitivity analysis when K, Q was fixed {{at the low end of}} the range were two to three orders of magnitude higher than the SSE values for initial forward modeling curve matches. The sensitivity analysis for Ks_Q resulted in curve matches with SSE values that were one order of magnitude greater than the initial forward modeling curve matches when Ks_Q was fixed at higher values. That is, Ks_Q is the most sensitive, or most tightly constrained, parameter. Based on results from the analytical modeling of the fully penetrating pumping tests, the mean radial hydraulic conductivity (Kr) of the unconfined aquifer at the BHRS was determined to be 0. 076 cm/sec and Kr ranged from 0. 051 cm/sec to 0. 13 cm/sec with greater values generally occurring in the western half of the BHRS where the sand channel is located. Areal plots of the ratio of vertical hydraulic conductivity (Kz) to Kr were constructed to assess the distribution of anisotropy which was determined to exist in 25 well pairs (34 %). No clear areal distribution pattern of K anisotropy was evident at the BHRS. The arithmetic mean determined for Ss from the forward modeling was 4. 1 x 10 - 5 m- 1, with values ranging from 3. 3 x 10 - 5 to 1. 3 x 10 - 4 m- 1. The arithmetic mean for Sy values determined from the forward modeling was 0. 036, with values ranging from 0. 013 to 0. 070. A systematic difference between Ks_Q and Ks_OBS was evident from the modeling. The Ks_OBS was, with few exceptions, 1. 5 to 5 times larger than the Ks_Q...|$|R
40|$|The S shaped log log <b>drawdown</b> time <b>curve</b> {{typical of}} pumping tests in {{unconfined}} aquifers is reinvestigated via numerical experiments. We examine the {{temporal and spatial}} evolution of {{the rate of change}} in storage in an unconfined aquifer during pumping. This evolution is related to the transition of water release mechanisms from the expansion of water and compaction of the porous medium to the drainage of water from the unsaturated zone above the initial water table and initially saturated pores as the water table falls during the pumping of the aquifer. We conclude that the transition of the water release mechanisms and vertical flow are the cause of the S shaped drawdown time. Cross-correlation analysis is then employed {{to examine the relationship between}} hydraulic properties of an unconfined aquifer and pressure observations. The analysis reveals that head observed in the saturated zone at late times along a streamline is positively correlated with the conductivity (K(s)) of the region upstream of the observation location, and negatively correlated with the K(s) of the region downstream of the observation location along the same streamline. Besides, head observations in the saturated zone at the early time are positively correlated with specific storage (S(s)) in a narrow region between the observation and pumping locations. At intermediate and late times, the head positively correlates with the heterogeneity of α (pore-size distribution parameter) in a thin disk-shaped unsaturated region above the pumping and observation locations. Saturated water content θ(s) in the vadose zone directly above the pumping and monitoring locations is found positively correlated with the head observations during the intermediate times and late times. In the end, a stochastic inverse estimation is conducted to jointly interpret a sequential pumping test in a three dimensional unconfined aquifer. K(s), S(s), θ(s) and α are estimated at the same time. The estimated results capture the pattern of the heterogeneous parameters as well as the details with a smooth distribution.

40|$|International audienceDue to the {{complexity}} and duality of flows, well-test interpretation into karst systems constitutes a challenging task for hydrogeologists. This is especially true when the pumping well intersects karst heterogeneities such as the conduit network. The method of diagnostic plots, widely used in oil industry, {{can be applied to}} karst hydrogeology. In this paper, the classical response of a well-test into a karst conduit is described on a log-log <b>drawdown</b> derivative <b>curve.</b> It allows identifying successive flow regimes corresponding to the contribution of various karst aquifer subsystems (fractured matrix, karst conduit, main karst drainage network) to the pumped well. In heterogeneous karst systems, the log-log diagnostic plot of drawdown and its derivative in the pumping well can help identifying departures in flow-geometry from the classical homogeneous radial case. Classically, the diagnostic plot can be divided into several portions with: (a) early data used for identifying the karst conduit storage; (b) intermediate data for identifying the type of aquifer model that should be used (e. g. double porosity, anisotropy [...] .); and (c) late data for identifying the possible boundaries. This is illustrated on three examples from Mediterranean karsts in southern France. A one-month duratio pumping test on a well intersecting the main karst drainage network of the Cent-Fonts karst system shows (i) a preliminary contribution of the karst conduit storage capacity followed by (ii) linear flows into the fractured matrix. A pumping test on a well intersecting a small karst conduit of the Corbières karst system shows the existence of (i) bi-linear flow within both the karst conduit and the fractured matrix at early times, followed by (ii) radial flows within the fractured matrix and (iii) finally the contribution of a major karst cavity. A two-months duration pumping test on a deep confined karst aquifer under low permeability rocks into the Gardanne basin shows the existence of no-flow boundary conditions due to the basin extension. The use of diagnostic plots allows identifying the various flow regimes during pumping tests, corresponding to the response of the individual karst aquifer subsystems. This is helpful for improving the understanding {{of the structure of the}} karst aquifer and flow exchanges between subsystems...|$|R
40|$|Most {{analytical}} and numerical models developed to analyze pumping test data focus on saturated flow below the water table. Traditionally the soil above the initial water table prior to pumping has been {{thought to have}} little influence on the test results and has usually been ignored. It is hypothesized that, if the unsaturated zone is capped by low-permeability soil, airflow in the unsaturated zone may be developed during pumping and may have impact on the drawdown in the aquifer. A transient, three-dimensional and variably saturated flow model is employed to simulate the pumping-induced air and groundwater flows in both the saturated zone and unsaturated zone with a low-permeability layer. The results demonstrate that negative pressure in the unsaturated zone can be generated by pumping. The negative pressure begins to appear as the drawdown rate increases to a maximum, approaches a peak before the drawdown rate becomes zero, and then gradually disappears. Drawdown obtained from the capped aquifer is much greater because {{the water in the}} pores in the unsaturated zone is sucked by the negative pressure and the gravity drainage from the pores is hampered. Consequently, the <b>drawdown</b> versus time <b>curve</b> does not conform to the traditional S-shaped curve for an unconfined aquifer but {{is similar to that of}} a confined aquifer. If the airflow caused by the low-permeability cap is ignored, the error in estimated drawdown could be over 80 % for the specific parameters and aquifer configuration used in the study. The possible errors in parameter estimation when airflow is ignored are explored. Overall, the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer can be overestimated and the specific yield of the aquifer underestimated if airflow is ignored. The estimation error for specific yield tends to be greater than that in hydraulic conductivity. Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
