5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (<b>just</b> <b>an</b> hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E

5|$|Mírzá Yahyá's {{leadership}} was controversial. He generally absented {{himself from the}} Bábí community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he {{went so far as}} to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb. Mírzá Yahyá gradually alienated himself from a large number of the Bábís, who started giving their allegiance to other claimants. During the time that Mírzá Yahyá remained in hiding, Bahá'u'lláh performed much of the daily administration of Bábí affairs. In contrast to Mírzá Yahyá, Bahá'u'lláh was outgoing and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of Bábís as a religious leader, rather than <b>just</b> <b>an</b> organizer, and became their center of devotion.|$|E
5|$|Officers in {{the field}} {{were well aware of}} the killing {{operations}} being conducted by the Einsatzgruppen.

5|$|The kulintang gong {{itself is}} {{believed}} to have been one of those foreign musical elements incorporated into kulintang music, derived from the Sundanese kolenang due to its striking similarities. Along with the fact that they play important roles in their respectively ensembles, both the kulintang and kolenang show striking homogeneity in tapered rims (as opposed to pronouncedly tapered Javanese bonang and non-tapered Laotian khong vong gongs). Even the word kulintang {{is believed to}} be <b>just</b> <b>an</b> altered form of the Sundanese word kolenang.|$|E
5|$|A late 15th century legenda nova {{claimed that}} Henry {{had come to}} Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and {{appointed}} as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though legenda nova states 1150 as {{the year of the}} crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was <b>just</b> <b>an</b> inference by the writer, {{based on the fact that}} also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala. Another claim by legenda nova was that Henry was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed that Henry had been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 as the year of the crusade and 1156 as the year of Henry's death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a working-class}} family, Nurmi left school at 12 {{to provide for}} his family. In 1912, he was {{inspired}} by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting national records en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After a silver medal in the 5000 m, he took gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first, and so far only, runner to hold the world record in the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races at the same time. He went on to set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with <b>just</b> <b>an</b> hour between the races, and take gold medals in the distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Olympics. Seemingly untouched by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals, but embittered, as Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.|$|E

5|$|Following this event, Zwingli {{and other}} humanist friends petitioned the bishop on 2 July {{to abolish the}} {{requirement}} of celibacy on the clergy. Two weeks later the petition was reprinted for the public in German as Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung an die Eidgenossen (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates). The issue was not <b>just</b> <b>an</b> abstract problem for Zwingli, as he had secretly married a widow, Anna Reinhard, earlier in the year. Their cohabitation was well-known and their public wedding took place on 2 April 1524, {{three months before the}} birth of their first child. They would eventually have four children: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna. As the petition was addressed to the secular authorities, the bishop responded at the same level by notifying the Zurich government to maintain the ecclesiastical order. Other Swiss clergymen joined in Zwingli's cause which encouraged him to make his first major statement of faith, Apologeticus Archeteles (The First and Last Word). He defended himself against charges of inciting unrest and heresy. He denied the ecclesiastical hierarchy any right to judge on matters of church order because of its corrupted state.|$|E
5|$|Frank Grimes' {{favorite}} television series, Dishonorable Discharge, ends {{after six}} seasons {{and it is}} revealed that the entire series was <b>just</b> <b>an</b> angel's dream. Grimes is outraged and determined to change the ending. Later, Mark Lilly tells his girlfriend, the half-demon Callie Maggotbone, {{that he has not}} seen his father since his sixth birthday. Mark's roommate, the zombie Randall, is touched by this and decides to document Mark's journey to find his father, so that he can become a Hollywood director. Mark is assigned by Twayne Boneraper to investigate Grimes, who has been busting people who enjoyed the ending of Dishonorable Discharge. He and Randall (who documents everything with his video camera) ride along with Grimes. In a memory sequence of Grimes', it is revealed that he was a real cop in the 1970s and worked with an undercover expert named Jimmy. He was dishonorably discharged from the force and repressed all of his memories of being a cop. Mark figures that this is why he is so angry with the ending of the series, and takes him through his past by using the same car Grimes and his partner Jimmy had. In the car, Grimes has a memory sequence again and drives to Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|In the {{off-season}} the Blue Jackets' approach to building their team changed, {{moving from a}} team of young developing players into one with established players. The first deal General Manager Scott Howson made was the acquisition of All-Star forward Jeff Carter on June 23, 2011. The deal sent Jakub Voracek, Columbus' first-round draft choice, the eighth overall, and their third-round pick in the 2011 Draft to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Carter. The trade received a positive response in Columbus from fans and management who felt they finally had a number one center to play alongside of their best player, Rick Nash. Next, they traded for the negotiating rights of soon to be free agent James Wisniewski. Wisniewski scored a career high 51 points during the 2010–11 season, splitting time between the New York Islanders and Montreal Canadiens. The point total was fifth-highest in the league for defenseman scoring, tying Tobias Enstrom. The Blue Jackets came to terms with Wisniewski, <b>just</b> <b>an</b> hour {{prior to the start}} of free agency, signing him to a six-year, $33 million deal.|$|E

5|$|Longchamp's legatine {{commission}} {{from the}} papacy expired in spring 1191, {{on the death}} of Clement III, thus removing one of Longchamp's power bases. The legation was, however, renewed a few months later by Clement's successor, Celestine III. A further complication for Longchamp arose in September 1191, when Henry II's illegitimate son Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, was arrested by Longchamp's subordinates, led by the castellan of Dover Castle, Longchamp's brother-in-law. Their orders had been to arrest the Archbishop of York as he landed at Dover on the archbishop's return to England, but Geoffrey had been warned of their plans, and fled to sanctuary in St. Martin's Priory. Longchamp's men laid siege to the priory, and after four days forcibly removed Geoffrey. The violence of the attack reminded the public of Thomas Becket's martyrdom, and public opinion turned against Longchamp. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was likely <b>just</b> <b>an</b> excuse to eliminate a rival.|$|E
5|$|Modern authors like Ernesto Palacio, Norberto Galasso, and Jorge Abelardo Ramos {{attempt to}} rescue the image of Moreno by {{avoiding}} both extremes: the sweet liberal Moreno and the horrible one written by revisionists. Those historians do not consider Bernardino Rivadavia a successor of Moreno, and the proposals to seek an alliance with Britain are not seen {{as the product of}} anglophilia, but <b>just</b> <b>an</b> example of the limited options available to the Primera Junta. Similarly, they do not attribute much influence to the Representation..., considering it a mere work for a client that didn't really influence Cisneros, who would have allowed free trade for international contexts. The harsh policies are acknowledged, but not attributed specifically to Moreno, but rather to the whole Junta, and compared with similar royalist measures used to punish the Chuquisaca, the La Paz revolution, and the indigenous rebellion of Túpac Amaru II.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is <b>just</b> <b>an</b> alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E
