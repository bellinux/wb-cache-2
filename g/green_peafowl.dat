There can be problems if birds of unknown pedigree are released into the wild, as the viability of such hybrids and their offspring is often reduced (see Haldane's Rule and outbreeding depression).|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} birds are found, {{especially}} the rare <b>green</b> <b>peafowls,</b> threatened by habitat destruction, which {{come to the}} park area for breeding from January to March. Among the other animals, the fishing cat, Asiatic black bear, muntjac, masked palm civet, bamboo rat, tree shrews, the Asiatic softshell turtle and the Bengal monitor deserve mention.|$|R
50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>peafowls</b> {{are found}} {{in a wide range}} of {{habitats}} including primary and secondary forest, both tropical and subtropical, as well as evergreen and deciduous. They may also be found amongst bamboo, on grasslands, savannas, scrub and farmland edge. In Vietnam, the preferred habitat was found to be dry deciduous forest close to water and away from human disturbance. Proximity to water appears to be an important factor.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Most of the {{neoplastic}} diseases affecting poultry have a viral etiology, such as Marek’s disease, avian leukosis/sarcoma and reticuloendotheliosis. In {{the present}} paper, histopathology and molecular methods were performed, in addition of necropsy and gross morphology evaluation, for {{the differential diagnosis}} of these diseases in two <b>green</b> <b>peafowls</b> (Pavo muticus). The affected birds showed non-specific signs, such as depression, anorexia, and diarrhea. At necropsy, diffuse enlargement by several times the normal size of the liver and the spleen was observed. In one of the birds, the liver presented white to grayish discoloration was present, and focal and nodular growths in the other bird. Grossly, the other visceral organs and the peripheral nerves were normal. Microscopically, most of the tumor cells were large and uniform with pleomorphic nuclei. The PCR analysis for Marek’s disease virus (MDV), avian leukosis virus (ALV), lymphoproliferative disease virus (LPDV), and reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) based on their specific sequences showed the presence of ALV subgroups A-E and REV. According to these results, definitive diagnosis was co-infection of ALV and REV in naturally-infected <b>green</b> <b>peafowls...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Although {{there is}} no natural range overlap with the Indian peafowl, {{hybridisation}} is still a threat where the Indian Peafowl is introduced as they produce fertile hybrids. In captivity hybrids are called [...] "Spalding" [...] peafowl and are used by breeders to create different breeds. Through backcrossing some hybrids become almost indistinguishable from pure <b>green</b> <b>peafowl.</b> As the species {{as a whole is}} sometimes called [...] "Java peafowl" [...] in aviculture, the subspecies of <b>green</b> <b>peafowl</b> are also mixed in captivity and there are many captive birds of unknown provenance. In some areas of their native range, captive <b>green</b> <b>peafowl</b> have sometimes been released in the vicinity of a breeding station even though their true origins remain unknown.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Toxoplasma gondii is an {{intracellular}} protozoan parasite infecting {{almost all}} warm-blooded animals, including birds, with a worldwide distribution. Surveys of T. gondii infection in wild birds {{have been reported}} extensively in the world, but little is known of T. gondii infection in peafowls worldwide. This study was performed to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in peafowls in Yunnan Province, southwestern China. Methods Sera from 277 peafowls, including 272 blue peafowls (Pavo cristatus) and 5 <b>green</b> <b>peafowls</b> (Pavo muticus) originated from two geographic areas in Yunnan Province were assayed for T. gondii antibodies using the modified agglutination test (MAT). Results Specific T. gondii antibodies were detected in 35 of 277 (12. 64 %) peafowls (MAT titer[*]≥[*] 1 : 5). Seropositive birds were found in both species, 33 in 272 blue peafowls and 2 in 5 <b>green</b> <b>peafowls.</b> There {{was no significant difference}} in T. gondii seroprevalence between the adolescent birds (6. 74 %) and the adult birds (6. 67 %) (P[*]> [*] 0. 05). The geographical origins of peafowls was found to be highly associated with T. gondii infection in the present study, a statistically significant difference in T. gondii seropositivity was observed between peafowls from Kunming (31. 08 %) and those from Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture (5. 91 %) (OR[*]=[*] 10. 956, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 632 - 73. 545, P [*]=[*] 0. 014). Statistical analyses showed that there were no significant interactions between ages and geographical origins of peafowls (P [*]>[*] 0. 05). Conclusions The results of the present survey indicated that infection of peafowls with T. gondii is widespread in Yunnan Province, which has significant public health concerns and implications for prevention and control of toxoplamosis in this province. To our knowledge, this is the first seroprevalence report of T. gondii infection in China’s southwestern Yunnan Province. </p...|$|R

50|$|The main {{highlight}} of the park is the giant aviary that is the largest aviary in Asia. In addition, there are 63 cages of birds contain rare species such as Sarus Cranes, <b>Green</b> <b>Peafowls,</b> Eagles, Falcons, Hawks, and Ravens. Beside the birds, the park also has the Bird Egg Museum that contains many eggs from various species of birds found around the world.Aside from the aviary part, there are additional interesting sites to visit such as man-made waterfalls, wonderful gardens, a rabbit park, and a zoo. There are several wild animals present in the zoo such as Hog Deer, Elk Deer, and Mountain Goats. The other important {{highlight of}} the park is an aquarium which features several types of freshwater fish species found in Chao Phraya River. Lastly, the Space WaterPark is a zone that has a giant waterslide.|$|R

Conservation management has increased its population.|$|E
5000|$|Animal species {{include the}} {{endangered}} yellow-cheeked gibbon. Wild elephants once roamed the area, but now only domesticated ones are found. Bird life includes the grey-faced tit-babbler, {{found only in}} Indochina, and rare hornbills. The wetlands are home to the Siamese crocodile, hog deer and <b>green</b> <b>peafowl,</b> all endangered.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Green</b> <b>peafowl</b> {{are large}} birds, amongst the largest living galliforms {{in terms of}} overall size, though rather lighter-bodied than the wild turkey, and perhaps the longest extant, wild bird in total length. The male is 1.8 - 3 m in total length but this {{includes}} its tail covert (or [...] "train") which itself measures 1.4 - 1.6 m. The tail coverts are even longer {{than those of the}} male Indian peafowl but are shorter than those of the arguses. The adult female is around half the total length of the breeding male at 1 - 1.1 m in length. It has a relatively large wingspan that averages around 1.2 m and can reach 1.6 m in big males. The <b>green</b> <b>peafowl</b> is capable of sustained flight and is often observed on wing.|$|E
50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>peafowl</b> {{differs from}} the Indian peafowl in that the male has green and gold plumage and black wings with a sheen of blue. Unlike the Indian peafowl, the green peahen {{is similar to the}} male, only having shorter upper tail coverts, a more coppery neck, and overall less iridescence.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species was}} first {{classified}} as Pavo muticus by Carl Linnaeus, {{although it was}} previously described in Europe by Ulisse Aldrovandi as [...] "Pavo Iaponensis" [...] based on a Japanese painting given to the pope by the Emperor of Japan. Interestingly, these birds were depicted as having no spurs; Linnaeus followed Aldrovandi's description. The Japanese had imported <b>green</b> <b>peafowl</b> from Southeast Asia for hundreds of years, and the birds were frequently depicted in Japanese paintings. As a result, the type locality described by Linnaeus was [...] "Habitat in Japonia", even though the species is not native to Japan (they were kept by the emperor and no longer occur). François Levaillant {{was one of the}} first Western ornithologists to see a live bird, imported from Macau to an animal collection in Cape of Good Hope. From an Indian painting, George Shaw described a peafowl native to India with a [...] "blue head" [...] and an [...] "upright lanceolate crest", which he named Pavo spicifer, the spike-crested peacock. A third form of <b>green</b> <b>peafowl</b> was described in 1949 by Jean Delacour, as imperator, found in Indo-China. From the advice of a bird dealer in Hong Kong, Delacour concluded there were three races of <b>green</b> <b>peafowl,</b> lumping spicifer into the species as well. Today most authorities recognize these three: ...|$|E
50|$|There is a {{relatively}} small diversity of fauna in the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. There are about 137 species of birds, 22 species of mammals and 4 species of reptiles protected in the national park. Examples are besra, <b>green</b> <b>peafowl,</b> Javan rusa, Sumatran dhole, crab-eating macaque, marbled cat and Javan leopard.|$|E
50|$|The Snowdon Aviary was {{designed}} by Cedric Price, Frank Newby and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, and was built in 1964. A variety of birds have been kept in the aviary since it was opened, and it currently houses <b>green</b> <b>peafowl,</b> sacred ibis, little egrets, cattle egrets, northern bald ibis and grey-headed gulls.|$|E
5000|$|The Congo peafowl (Afropavo congensis), {{known as}} the mbulu by the Congolese, is a species of peafowl native to the Congo Basin. [...] It {{is one of three}} extant species of peafowl, the other two being the Indian peafowl (originally of India and Sri Lanka) and the <b>green</b> <b>peafowl</b> (native to Myanmar and Indochina).|$|E
50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>peafowl</b> are {{generally}} more silent than Indian peafowl. The male of some subspecies, especially imperator, have a loud call of ki-wao, which is often repeated. The female has a loud aow-aa call {{with an emphasis on}} the first syllable. The male may also make a similar call. The males call from their roost sites at dawn and dusk.|$|E
50|$|The Phou Xiang Thong Important Bird Area (IBA) {{is located}} within the park. The IBA covers an area of 367 km2 {{including}} part of the Mekong's eastern bank. Endangered bird species in the IBA include <b>green</b> <b>peafowl,</b> grey-headed parakeet and red-collared woodpecker. Bird species rare within the park include red-vented barbet, eared pitta and grey-faced tit-babbler.|$|E
50|$|The galliform {{bird species}} {{with the largest}} {{wingspan}} and largest overall length (including a train of over 6 feet) is most likely the <b>green</b> <b>peafowl</b> (Pavo muticus). Most galliform genera are plump-bodied with thick necks and moderately long legs, with rounded and rather short wings. Grouse, pheasants, francolins, and partridges are typical in their outwardly corpulent silhouettes.|$|E
