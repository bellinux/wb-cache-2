40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study heat and mass {{transfer}} in two vegetal fibre materials: flax and hemp concrete which are known to have a low environmental impact. After presenting each of these materials and their physical properties, we present equations of the coupled heat and moisture transfer within <b>simple</b> <b>layer</b> <b>walls.</b> In this model, moisture transport phenomenon is made through liquid and vapour phases. The liquid phase is supposed to move by capillarity whereas the vapour phase diffuses under vapour partial pressure gradient. Simulations are done with the simulation environment SPARK suited to complex problems. In this case, we investigate the impact of moisture transfer on heat diffusion within these two materials through the study of the damping effect, time lag and heat conduction loads and moisture transfer through a <b>simple</b> <b>layer</b> <b>wall</b> subjected to periodical variation of outdoor conditions. 1...|$|R
40|$|Precise needle {{placement}} {{is required}} for the success {{of a wide variety of}} percutaneous interventions in medicine. Insertions into soft tissues can be difficult to learn and to perform, due to tissue deformation, needle deflection and limited visual feedback. Little quantitative information is known about the interaction between needles and soft tissues during puncture, and no effective physicallybased training, planning and guidance systems exist for such procedures. This work aims to characterise needle-tissue interaction by measuring contact forces and deformations that are applied during insertions into soft tissue phantoms. A new methodology for estimating the forces that occur along the needle shaft during insertion is described. The approach is based on physical experiments, as well as on linear elastic phantom models that are discretised by traditional Finite Element Methods. Shaft force distributions are derived from insertions into <b>homogeneous</b> and <b>simple</b> <b>layered</b> inhomogeneous tissue phantoms at several driving velocities, and are applied as boundary conditions to tissue models for physically-based simulations of needle insertion trajectories. A large-strain elastic needle model is coupled to the tissue models to account for needle deflection and bending during simulated insertion. Sinc...|$|R
40|$|When {{released}} to the subsurface, LNAPLs (light nonaqueous phase liquids) will distribute as residual saturation {{in the form of}} disconnected blobs and ganglia or as larger accumulations in the form of mobile lenses near the water table. The conceptual model assumed for the distribution of these immiscible contaminants greatly affects important characteristics such as the rate of mass transfer, the mobility of the contaminant, and estimates for the areal extent and volume of contamination. Although the transport and distribution of LNAPLs is strongly affected by subsurface heterogeneities and knowledge of stratigraphic detail is typically limited, a better understanding of NAPL distribution in <b>homogeneous</b> and <b>simple</b> <b>layered</b> soils should result in more accurate conceptualizations of site contamination, better interpretations of observed field data, and more realistic mobility estimates. This paper highlights a new conceptual model for the geometry of LNAPL pools and lenses and illustrates how the phenomenon of saturation hysteresis and the concept of imbibition entry pressures plays a critical role in the description of LNAPL lenses at equilibrium. It is proposed that the geometry of LNAPL lenses cannot be fully understood without considering hysteresis in capillary pressure-saturation relations. In fact, it is proposed that NAPL lenses of any measurable thickness cannot be stable without this hysteresis. Considering this, attempts t...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{researches}} {{about the}} capability of ultrasonic guided waves for detection of damages in cellular lightweight structures have been done. Besides the experimental studies, numerical approaches utilizing the finite element method are used to investigate the propagation and the interaction of guided waves in such complex material systems. To reduce the computational efforts, simplified models based on a homogenization technique are often used. The complicated heterogeneous cellular mid-core is simplified to a <b>simple</b> orthotropic <b>layer</b> modeled with eight-node 3 D brick elements. However, {{it has been reported}} that this approach has specific limitations. The compact design of the <b>simple</b> <b>homogeneous</b> <b>layer</b> does not interact with the ultrasonic guided waves in a similar way as the real extended cellular structures do. These limitations are more obvious for the specific range of frequencies where the wavelength are smaller than the characteristic length scale of the cellular structure and the ultrasonic guided waves are more influenced by the microstructure. Therefore, a new kind of simplification approach based on geometrical parametric study is suggested in this paper. In this new kind, instead of material homogenization the main aim is to simplify the structural geometry. The proposed method has been used to simplify different cellular structures. The results of ultrasonic guided wave propagation are compared with the complex geometrical models. In order to prove the proposed approach, the wave propagation in a simplified hollow sphere sandwich plate is compared with experimental results. In addition, an application example of the proposed simplification approach for structural health monitoring in a hollow sphere structure is provided. Moreover, the experimental results for structural health monitoring gained by laser scanning vibrometry are presented and it is shown that the wave field interacts with damages. Finally, a computer tomography of the plate is also made in order to visualize debondings between the core material and the cover plates...|$|R

40|$|Suppose that M is countable, binary, primitive, <b>homogeneous,</b> and <b>simple,</b> {{and hence}} 1 -based. We {{prove that the}} SU-rank of the {{complete}} theory of M is~ 1. It follows that M is a random structure. The conclusion that M is a random structure does not hold if the binarity condition is removed, as witnessed by the generic tetrahedron-free 3 -hypergraph. However, {{to show that the}} generic tetrahedron-free 3 -hypergraph is 1 -based requires some work (it is known that it has the other properties) since this notion is defined in terms of imaginary elements. This is partly why we also characterize equivalence relations which are definable without parameters in the context of omega-categorical structures with degenerate algebraic closure. Another reason is that such characterizations may be useful in future research about <b>simple</b> (nonbinary) <b>homogeneous</b> structures.

They appear naturally in the study of electrostatics {{in the context of the}} electrostatic potential associated to a charge distribution on a closed surface.

Furthermore, the normal derivative is of w a well-defined continuous function on S.

40|$|Alterations in wall {{ultrastructure}} accompanying resistant sporangium maturation and meiospore liberation in Allomyces arbuscula {{were examined}} by scanning electron microscopy. Three discrete <b>wall</b> <b>layers</b> were identified, {{each of which}} underwent marked changes during processes leading to zoospore release. The outermost <b>wall</b> <b>layer,</b> the hyphal sheath continuous with the hypha, was physically altered during the maturation process preparatory to induction and release of meiospores. The integrity of this <b>wall</b> <b>layer</b> was broken, {{and it was no}} longer closely juxtaposed to the heavy pitted <b>wall</b> <b>layer</b> that lay beneath it. A fibrillar matrix seemed to cement the two layers to one another before this desiccation.

By its thickness the pitted <b>wall</b> <b>layer</b> was likely to provide mechanical rigidity to the meiosporangium. Beneath the pitted <b>wall</b> <b>layer,</b> another thin, flexible <b>wall</b> <b>layer</b> surrounded the protoplast.
