500|$|John Metcalf for The Spectator {{thought the}} book [...] "utterly disgraceful—and highly enjoyable... without [...] no {{forthcoming}} railway journey should be undertaken", although he also considered {{that it was}} [...] "not one of Mr. Fleming's best". Anthony Boucher, writing in The New York Times, was equivocal, saying [...] "I don't know anyone who writes about gambling more vividly than Fleming and I only wish {{the other parts of}} his books lived up to their gambling sequences". Richard Lister in the New Statesman thought that [...] "Mr. Fleming is splendid; <b>he</b> <b>stops</b> <b>at</b> nothing." [...] Writing for The Washington Post, Al Manola believed that the [...] "British tradition of rich mystery writing, copious description and sturdy heroism all blend nicely" [...] in Moonraker, providing what he considered was [...] "probably the best action novel of the month".|$|E

500|$|Six months later, she {{is working}} as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Simultaneously, {{teenager}} Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is kidnapped from a mall parking garage after parting with her friend, Autumn, and forced {{into the trunk of}} a car. Casey had taken Autumn's disposable phone, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator (Jenna Lamia) receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over, though Casey's use of a disposable phone means that her exact GPS location cannot be found. While the kidnapper drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a tail light and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey waving her arm out of the trunk of the car calls 9-1-1, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole, attracting the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado (Michael Imperioli) but the kidnapper knocks him out with a shovel, assuming him to be dead and stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey. He reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, which causes the kidnapper to stab him. <b>He</b> <b>stops</b> <b>at</b> a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and scream at an active worker for help. The worker attempts to bust the door open, but the kidnapper sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him.|$|E
500|$|Mulder sees Diabra, {{a diplomat}} from Burkina Faso. Diabra tells him an old folk {{tale of the}} Bambara people about the Teliko, which were nocturnal [...] "spirits of the air". Meanwhile, Scully {{examines}} a PET scan of Aboah, which shows {{that he has no}} pituitary gland. Aboah escapes the hospital and meets Duff in a car; he paralyses Duff {{in the same manner as}} his other victims and inserts a long metal object up his nose. A policeman finds Duff and requests an ambulance, and the police tell Mulder and Scully that they are sweeping the area for Aboah. Driving around, Mulder tells Scully that he thinks Aboah is the mythical Teliko. <b>He</b> <b>stops</b> <b>at</b> a demolition site, remembering that Pendrell found asbestos fibers on Sanders' body. Mulder and Scully split up at the site; Mulder is pierced as Kittel was and is taken into a duct by Aboah. Meanwhile, Scully, having heard Mulder's shouts for help, tracks him in the duct and is able to get him out of it, finding then the missing men dead, all of them with their skins depigmented. While calling for medical assistance by phone, Aboah is about to jump on her but Mulder's look alerts her and she quickly turns around and shoots at him. In her field journal, Scully writes that Aboah will stand trial if he lives long enough. She muses that Aboah's condition and survival may be discovered by science, but humans have a fear of an alien among them which causes them to [...] "deceive, inveigle, and obfuscate".|$|E

LUH has a male roommate, THX 1138, {{who works in a}} factory producing android police officers. At the beginning of the story, THX leaves the job while the loudspeakers urge the workers to [...] "increase safety", and congratulate them for only losing 195 workers in the last period, to the competing factory's 242. On the way home, <b>he</b> <b>stops</b> <b>at</b> a confession booth in a row of many, and mumbles prayers about [...] "party" [...] and [...] "masses", under the portrait of [...] "OMM 0000".

2500|$|Suddenly, {{everyone}} is knocked {{over by a}} loud crash, and enormous footprints from a Giant have destroyed the Witch's garden, sparing only a few beans. The Baker and his Wife decide that they must tell the Royal Family, and the Baker travels to the palace. His news is ignored by the Prince's Steward, and also by Jack's Mother when <b>he</b> <b>stops</b> <b>at</b> her house to ask for Jack's aid. When he returns home, Little Red Ridinghood arrives {{on her way to}} Granny's: her house has been destroyed and her mother is missing. The Baker and his Wife decide to escort her. Meanwhile, Jack decides that he must slay the Giant and Cinderella learns from her bird friends that her mother's grave was disturbed and decides to investigate, dressed in her old clothes.

2500|$|Charlie Brown smiles, quietly {{picks up}} the little tree, and {{walks out of the}} auditorium. After {{reflecting}} on what Linus had said, he decides to take the tree home to decorate, to show the others it will work in the play. When he arrives, <b>he</b> <b>stops</b> <b>at</b> Snoopy's decorated doghouse, which now sports a first prize blue ribbon for winning the display contest. He puts an ornamental ball from the doghouse {{on the top of his}} tree. The branch, with the ball still on it, promptly flops over to one side instead of remaining upright, prompting Charlie Brown to declare [...] "I've killed it" [...] and run off in disgust at his perpetual failure. Linus and the rest of the Peanuts gang (who have all become guilty for laughing at Charlie Brown) arrive outside Snoopy's doghouse. Linus gently props the drooping branch back in its upright position by wrapping his blanket around the tree. The group add the remaining decorations from Snoopy's doghouse to the tree, and Lucy admits that the tree does look nice. They start humming [...] "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". Charlie Brown returns, surprised at the humming and the redecorated tree, as his peers greet him with a joyous [...] "Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!" [...] The entire group begins to sing the first verse of [...] "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," [...] and Charlie Brown joins them as the special ends.|$|E
2500|$|As {{they wait}} for the fly {{to land on the}} flypaper, the two talk about their families. Walt expresses that he should have died already and tries to think of the perfect moment to have done so: after he had enough money, after Holly was born, before his surgery and before Skyler knew what he'd been doing. He finally decides the perfect moment to die would have been the night Jane died. Walt then tells Jesse of his bar {{conversation}} with Donald Margolis, Jane's father, on the day that she died. He tries to calculate the chances of meeting both father and daughter in different scenarios on the same night despite having never met either beforehand, but finds the odds too astronomical to calculate. Jesse, who is unaware of Walt's direct involvement in Jane's death, is surprised to hear this, but before he can ask more, he sees the fly up near the ceiling. He constructs a make-shift support for a step-ladder, asking Walt to hold it steady while he reaches for it. Walt, nearly asleep, begs Jesse to not hurt himself getting the fly. For a moment, it appears that Walt in his sleepy state is about to confess to Jesse how he stood by while Jane choked to death, but <b>he</b> <b>stops</b> <b>at</b> apologizing for Jane's death. Jesse tells him Jane's death was nobody's fault, but he still misses her. As Jesse begins wildly swatting at the fly, a sobbing Walt falls asleep. Jesse fails to get the fly and with Walt asleep, starts to climbs back down, but sees the fly land on the ladder. He swats and kills it.|$|E

60|$|L. Well, then, look, lastly, at {{this piece}} of {{courtesy}} in quartz; it is on a small scale, but wonderfully pretty. Here is nobly born quartz living with a green mineral, called epidote; and they are immense friends. Now, you see, a comparatively large and strong quartz-crystal, and a very weak and slender little one of epidote, have begun to grow, close by each other, and sloping unluckily towards each other, so that they at last meet. They cannot go on growing together; the quartz crystal is five times as thick, and more than twenty times as strong,[151] as the epidote; but <b>he</b> <b>stops</b> <b>at</b> once, just in the very crowning moment of his life, when he is building his own summit! He lets the pale little film of epidote grow right past him; stopping his own summit for it; and he never himself grows any more.|$|E
