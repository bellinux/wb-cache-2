40|$|Risk {{is central}} {{in the study}} of rural development. To cope with risk, {{smallholder}} farmers rely <b>on</b> <b>a</b> range of formal and informal insurance mechanisms: an extensive literature has explored their interactions. Yet, our understanding of the implications of these interactions for smallholder farmers’ decision-making is incomplete. This thesis addresses this scholarly gap by shedding new light on the risk-related decisions of smallholder farmers and the mechanisms through which networks affect these decisions. To do so, it relies <b>on</b> <b>a</b> combination of experimental and non-experimental economic analyses. The first chapter <b>draws</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>framed</b> field experiment in Gujarat, India to explore the effect of selling weather index insurance to groups (as opposed to individuals) on the investment decisions of the insured. The analysis reveals that group pressure reduces risk taking among individuals with group insurance in contexts with perfect information about peer investment decisions. Group insurance thus suffers from the same potential pitfall as group microcredit. The second chapter examines the extent to which informal transfers can explain take-up of individual weather index insurance. It aims to disentangle two channels through which informal transfers influence decisions to purchase insurance: (i) informal risk sharing and (ii) moral hazard. As in the first chapter, the study <b>draws</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>framed</b> field experiment in Gujarat. The main finding of this experiment is that redistribution norms reduce take-up: moral hazard leads to lower levels of insurance coverage. The final chapter builds on these results with a nonexperimental analysis of panel data from a rural household survey in India. It examines how cultural obligations to redistribute within networks affect investments in selfprotection. The empirical evidence suggests that increases in individual income lead to higher investments, but increases in network income lead to lower investments due to moral hazard. Collectively, the three papers nuance our understanding of how redistribution norms affect the risk-related decisions of the rural poor. While not negating their consumption smoothing benefits, this thesis indicates that networks also affect decision-making via group pressure and moral hazard. Such externalities could be forestalled by targeting insurance in rural areas with weaker redistributive norms or modifying insurance policy designs. Further research on the welfare implications of such approaches is thus recommended...|$|R

These countries generally have {{high levels of}} fossil fuel technology lock-in and low capacities to change, making the shift to sustainable energy difficult. Tanzania, a telling example, is projected to triple fossil-fuel power production in the next decade. This article assesses the potential to use internationally supported Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) to develop solar energy in Tanzania and contribute to transformational change of the electricity supply system. By assessing the cultural legitimacy of NAMAs among key stakeholders in the solar energy sector, we analyse the conditions for successful uptake of the concept in (1) national political thought and institutional frameworks and (2) the solar energy niche. Interview data are analysed from <b>a</b> multi-level perspective <b>on</b> transition, focusing on its cultural dimension. Several framings undermining legitimacy are articulated, such as attaching low-actor credibility to responsible agencies and the concept’s poor fit with political priorities. Actors that discern opportunities for NAMAs could, however, <b>draw</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>framing</b> of high commensurability between experienced social needs and opportunities to use NAMAs to address them through climate compatible development. This legitimises NAMAs and could challenge opposing framings...|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} 2000 s, {{the issue of}} access to HIV/AIDS {{medicines}} and intellectual property rights became for many an emblematic case of how the contemporary design of the global economic order contributes to the violation {{of the right to}} health of the global poor. A transnational network of AIDS activists exposed the role that ‘Big Pharma’ pricing policies and patents had played in the denial of life-saving treatment to millions across the Global South. Gathering widespread media coverage around the world, during this brief period, the pharmaceutical industry was effectively drawn from the confines of elite communicative spaces and sites of power into the public sphere, where it was duly named and shamed. This paper investigates how the pharmaceutical industry responded to the ensuing public relations fiasco, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>frame</b> analysis of news coverage of the crisis in the Financial Times, The Economist and the European Voice, and interviews with industry insiders, NGO lobbyists, AIDS activists, policy-makers and journalists. More specifically, it explores the communication strategies of the pharmaceutical industry, focusing in particular on the elite communicative sphere located in Brussels, a key site of power in global trade and health governance. The findings indicate that the industry’s media strategy was essentially reactive and that it has focused much of its PR efforts on engaging key elite audiences rather than mass publics via communicative channels that bypass mass-mediated public spheres, such as direct lobbying and corporate social responsibility schemes. Furthermore, whereas ‘Big Pharma’ effectively lost the ‘media battle’, its capacity to shape the EU’s trade agenda has not significantly diminished. These findings challenge the widely-held notion that politics is essentially played out in the media and indicate a need to go beyond the media- centrism characteristic of much contemporary theorisation about the interplay between communication and power...|$|R

40|$|This paper reports <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{study of}} how economists engaged in energy policymaking and {{household}} consumers frame the electricity market, {{based on interviews with}} prominent energy economists and focus group interviews with household consumers. <b>Drawing</b> <b>on</b> economic sociology, and above all the contribution of Michel Callon, we analyse framing processes involved in the sense-making with regard to the electricity market, including electricity consumption and the understanding of how households act with respect to the market. It was found that the economists <b>drew</b> predominantly <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>framing</b> of the electricity market according to their theoretical understanding of markets, considering consumers as calculative agents in a strict sense. In contrast, the consumers argued a more inclusive and complex framing of the electricity market by also emphasising moral, social and political issues. Thus, the consumers appeared to be qualculative rather than just calculative agents. This different framing did not emerge from consumers’ misunderstandings or their being misinformed about market mechanisms. Rather, we observed a mismatch between the energy economists and the household consumers regarding the underlying rationality of their framings, how they perceived consumption of electricity, and what they included and excluded in the framing of the market...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between masculinity, {{the body and the}} military through a close reading of the film Jarhead. <b>Drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Foucauldian <b>frame</b> of analysis, we consider three performances of the masculine military body that form key aspects of the film’s representational economy: the disciplined body, an outcome of the processes of basic training; the gendered body, realized through deployment of metaphors of the feminine to strengthen the masculine conception of the military body; and the cyborgian body, the result of the man-machine interface which is rapidly developing in many militaries around the world, and which poses significant questions for performances of military masculinity. We conclude by suggesting that the film’s rendering of the material and discursive body reveals an unexpected tension between the expectations of military bodies and the lived experience of their labour. As well as augmenting empirical explorations of male-worker-bodies and analysing the occupation of soldier as requiring a unique kind of body work, our contribution to the body-organization literature turns upon the claim that docile military bodies are made fit for purpose, but may actually no longer have a purpose for which to be fit.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} a range of child welfare {{interventions}} that sought to relocate children away from their birth families and home communities between the middle decades of the {{nineteenth and twentieth centuries}} <b>drew</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> common moral <b>frame.</b> These interventions – child migration schemes, assimilationist policies towards indigenous children, institutions of corrective confinement and the child protection movement – have typically been previously studied as isolated national or organisational phenomena. However, this article outlines <b>a</b> common moral <b>frame</b> to which they made reference structured around the figure of the redeemable child, vulnerable to the effects of polluted social environments, seen as needing to be re-located to new environments that would enable their civic, moral and spiritual redemption. This argument is situated within a discussion of the articulation of moral meanings as a social practice, which addresses both the central elements of this moral frame and the contexts in which it was articulated. This moral frame did not determine child-care practices within these schemes, but was one source of influence on them. In particular, the article examines the role of economic rationality in the management of these schemes, arguing that the sacralised status of the child within the family discussed in the work of Vivianna Zelizer was not extended to the children to whom these schemes were addressed. The article concludes by identifying key areas for future comparative study of these diverse schemes in relation to these shared moral meanings...|$|R

There is growing support for {{integration}} of palliative care’s holistic approach to suffering, but insufficient understanding of how this would happen in the complex team context of HF care. This study examined how HF care teams, as defined by patients, work together to provide care to patients with advanced disease. Methods: Team members were identified by each participating patient, generating team sampling units (TSUs) for each patient. Drawn from five study sites in three Canadian provinces, our dataset consists of 209 interviews from 50 TSUs. <b>Drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> theoretical <b>framing</b> of HF teams as complex adaptive systems (CAS), interviews were analyzed using the constant comparative method associated with constructivist grounded theory. Results: This paper centers on the dominant theme of system practices, how HF care delivery is reported to work organizationally, socially, and practically, and describes two subthemes: “the way things work around here”, which were commonplace, routine ways of doing things, and “the way we make things work around here”, which were more conscious, effortful adaptations to usual practice in response to emergent needs. An adaptive practice, often a small alteration to routine, could have amplified effects beyond those intended by the innovating team member and could extend to other settings. Conclusion: Adaptive practices emerged unpredictably and were variably experienced by team members. Our study offers an empirically grounded explanation of how HF care teams self-organize and how adaptive practices emerge from nonlinear interdependencies among diverse agents. We use these insights to reframe the question of palliative care integration, to ask how best to foster palliative care-aligned adaptive practices in HF care. This work has implications for health care’s growing challenge of providing care to those with chronic medical illness in complex, team-based settings.

40|$|Local {{governments are}} {{increasingly}} responding {{to climate change}} by developing formal institutions for adaptation. However, given the relative novelty of the adaptation planning field, there is insufficient practice-related research to inform these processes. The aim of this dissertation is therefore to assess the factors and actors that affect climate adaptation planning at the municipal level. Whilst numerous studies have identified the barriers to and opportunities for adaptation, less is known about what the underlying institutional, political and social conditions are that cause these factors to arise. This dissertation adopts a placebased perspective to comparatively analyse the adaptation planning processes that were undertaken in the Bergrivier, Drakenstein and Eden Municipalities between 2012 - 2013, under sponsorship from the Western Cape Government's Climate Change Municipal Support Programme (CCMSP). The CCMSP upholds an ethos of participation and multistakeholder engagement, and the theoretical concepts of knowledge co-production and collaborative governance are therefore <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> as <b>a</b> <b>framing</b> device to guide the analysis. The results highlight the various factors that can inhibit the success of collaborative adaptation planning in municipalities, {{as well as the}} multiple opportunities that exist to overcome or avoid these barriers. The barriers that emerged most strongly included: the prioritisation of local socio-economic development needs, restricted financial and human capacity resources, information and time constraints, an absence of mandatory legislation, a lack of political will to prioritise adaptation, limited cross-sectoral integration, poor representation and continuity at multi-stakeholder workshops, unclear employee roles within an organisation, strong power dynamics and misrepresented perceptions around compound environmental, climate change and development issues. The most prominent opportunities that were found for overcoming these barriers included: sound leadership from driven local champions, locating champions in departments other than, or in addition to, environmental departments, the presence of political will and support for the adaptation agenda, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> and/or building relationships and networks to co-explore and co-produce knowledge and policy, embracing experimentation and innovation, using informal communication channels, finding alternative devices through which to frame climate change and mainstreaming adaptation into overall municipal planning. Whilst some of the barriers and opportunities that were identified were common across the three case studies, others were specifically related to causes internal to the municipal environment and were thus highly context-specific. In light of these findings, the dissertation concludes that future municipal adaptation planning processes should focus on addressing the need for strong political will and effective local leadership, remain cognizant of the municipal context, call attention to the invisible factors that influence municipal climate governance, capitalize on opportunities for partnership-building, view adaptation as an iterative process rather than an end-point and embrace a flexible, 'learning by doing' approach...|$|R

Complexity ideas are then <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> to <b>frame</b> <b>an</b> empirical {{examination of the}} connections running between different levels of organisation in health and social care, and to underpin investigation into the intended and unintended local system consequences of service development. Data are used from a study conducted in the UK’s mental health field. Here, macro-level policy {{has led to the}} supplementing of longstanding community mental health teams by newer, more specialised, services. An example includes teams providing crisis resolution and home treatment (CRHT) care as an alternative to hospital admission. Using an embedded case study design, where ‘the case’ examined was a new CRHT team set in its surrounding organisational environment, ethnographic data (with interviews predominating) were generated in a single site in Wales over 18 months from the middle of 2007. In a large-scale context favourable to local decision-making, and against a background of a partial and disputed evidence base, the move to establish the new standalone service was contested. Whilst users valued the work of the team, and local practitioners recognised the quality of its contribution, powerful effects were also triggered across the locality’s horizontal interfaces. Participants described parts of the interconnected system being closed to release resources, staff gravitating to new crisis services leaving holes elsewhere, and the most needy service users being cared for by the least experienced workers. Some community mental health team staff described unexpected increases in workload, and disputes over eligibility for crisis care with implications for system-wide working relations. Detailed data extracts are used to illustrate these connections and consequences. Concluding lessons are <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> the use of evidence to inform policy, on the significance of local contexts and system interfaces, and on anticipating the unexpected at times of change...|$|R
40|$|If {{public policy}} sectors like fire {{management}} are {{to support the}} adaptive capacity and adaptation of our social-economic-ecological systems, they themselves require a considerable adaptive capacity. Yet when arguing for adaptive approaches to policies and governance, literature concerned with climate change adaptation (CCA) often treat public administration {{as something of a}} mysterious ‘black box’ where ideal policies and implementation are a ‘natural’ results of research and community inputs. Mainstreaming adaptation into a policy sector cannot ignore the structuring influence of a sector’s current policy frames and informal institutions. Even less acknowledged is the role of a sector’s bureaucrats in the adaptive capacity of public policy sectors. To consider these issues, this thesis sought to address the central research question: what capacity for reflexive learning exists within the administration of the fire management sector of Victoria, Australia? The literature review directed attention to several key factors in reflexive learning in public sectors and provided the thesis its theoretical basis, which stems from the following: Policy frames, informal institutions and networks are key influences in a sector’s capacity for reflexive learning. Adaptation in public policy requires a capacity for deliberate reflection upon the policy frames and informal institutions that underlie and structure a sector’s practices, policy options and governance arrangements. It also requires exploration of multiple, alternate frames of the sector’s fundamental issues to increase the adaptability of a sector’s policy repertoire. To enable its adaptive capacity, a public policy sector needs to adopt an explicitly reflexive learning approach. The study combined frame, institutional and network analyses to explore these factors, and provide a more nuanced appreciation of the capacity for reflexive learning than may have been gleaned from a singular perspective. A key methodological contribution of this study was the application of this triangulated analytical framework to a public policy sector and using the perspectives of the sector’s bureaucrats. The policy sector of landscape fire management in the state of Victoria, Australia was chosen for the case study because of its complex formal institutional structure and because its two objectives – disaster risk reduction and ecological management – are often argued to be key CCA strategies. The research identified two dominant master-frames: emergency management and sustainability. While the majority of participants <b>drew</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sustainability <b>frame,</b> the institutional analysis indicated that <b>an</b> emergency management <b>frame</b> is highly institutionalised within the sector. The findings suggest that it may be challenging to introduce perspectives that counter or do not ‘fit’ with the sector’s current policy frames and institutional landscape. The network analysis indicated a complex role for social networks in reflexive learning within the sector, a role that can both close down and open up the sector to new frames or ideas. Overall, this research aims to support fire management in its approach to disaster risk reduction (DRR) and CCA, and to inform the often called for interchange between DRR and CCA...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{assumes that}} the real essence of an {{organisation}} is its connectedness to the primary task. Hence the metaphor of 'soul' {{and the notion that}} passion for the task must be present to create 'soul'. It therefore follows that the nature of the primary task is central to the type of organisations that is created. The past decade of downsizing {{and the rise of the}} 'high performance culture' have developed their own narrative about delivering shareholder value. Alongside this, too often, exists the feeling that "this place has lost it soul". From that perspective, this thesis addresses the question: how does <b>an</b> increased focus <b>on</b> shareholder value impact on the organisation's passion for its primary task? In a qualitative study based on semi-structured interview data, the characteristics of the task of shareholder value delivery and its impact on customer service delivery are described in this thesis as have been reported by the informants of three large business units from The Australian Banking Corporation, Plc. (ABC), the fictionalised organization which forms the case study for this research. <b>Drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> psycho-analytic theoretical <b>frame</b> of organisational theory, the dynamic that this shift in task has created is identified and interpreted. From this phenomenological position, the findings clearly reveal that shareholder value is identified as the current primary task of the organisation, and has become deeply embedded through a business model promoting separated specialist businesses within the umbrella of ABC. The findings show that the tension between delivering service to the customer as stakeholder, the initial primary task, and the current task of delivering shareholder value is unconsciously contained through a process of splitting and projection to establish an idealised customer. The concept of social defense is applied to interpret this dynamic as it enables ABC to engage in the fantasy that it remains customer focussed. In order to replace the primary task of customer service with the task of delivering shareholder value, a process of substitution and mutation developed unconsciously from fear for the survival of ABC which, equally unconsciously connected the notion of service with the desire to serve the shareholder. The pain and anxiety produced by downsizing and continual attention to cost reduction, highly characteristic of the shareholder value model, substantially reduced organisational morale and, in this context, ABC embraced a genuine desire to create a new set of values and a healthy culture. However, what emerged was a religious fundamentalist culture that protects and reinforces the task of delivering shareholder value. Weber's protestant fundamentalism model promoted the creation of financial wealth through hard work while generating feelings of inclusion to render the task of shareholder value more palatable in the organisation. These two systems became symbiotic though the task values intrinsic in delivering shareholder value were recognised as being devoid of altruism. The dogma driven by the system is fundamentalist, the culture is divisively individualistic and passion for the newly accepted primary task is apparently impossible. Hence, it is concluded, the organisational 'soul' of ABC has been corroded. The implications of these findings for practice are concerned with the impact of the task of pursuing shareholder value, and the system it creates as they impact on ABC's ability to change and adapt so that: (1) Short-termism and risk aversion appear to be affecting the capacity of the CEO to lead the organisation into a growth phase. (2) Adoption of the specialisation model at ABC, supported by the CEO with a competitive individual reward program, appears to have reduced the potential for ABC to institute change in response to market evolution. (3) The preparedness of the CEO to risk investment in the medium to long term for growth while managing the short-term expectations of the market has been diminished. (4) The heroic CEO that the shareholder value model attracts is now concerned about his own legacy, which is impacting on his preparedness to promote a vision for the medium to longer term. (5) The culture supports the status quo and is now promoted by ABC as part of what differentiates it from its competitors. To change this, it will need to look outside ABC. This, however, appears to have become a blind spot...|$|R
