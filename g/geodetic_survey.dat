5|$|Although most printed sources, Harvey (1903), Olszewski (1971), Torres (1984), and the Historic Structure Report (2004), {{refer to}} the {{original}} 1884 inscriptions, the National <b>Geodetic</b> <b>Survey</b> (2015) refers to both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions. All sources print them {{according to their own}} editorial rules, resulting in excessive capitalization (Harvey, Olszewski, and NGS) and inappropriate line breaks. No printed source uses cursive writing, although pictures of the apex clearly show that it was used for both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|Discovered {{during the}} mapping of California's coast in 1933, Davidson Seamount {{is named after}} {{geographer}} George Davidson of the U.S. National <b>Geodetic</b> <b>Survey.</b> Studied only sparsely for decades, NOAA expeditions to the seamount in 2002 and 2006 cast light upon its unique deep-sea coral ecosystem.

The data gathered during the studies fueled the making of Davidson Seamount into a part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi Seamount's first {{depiction}} {{on a map}} was on Survey Chart 4115, a bathymetric {{rendering of}} part of Hawaiʻi compiled by the US Coast and <b>Geodetic</b> <b>Survey</b> in 1940. At the time, the seamount was non-notable, being one of many in the region. A large earthquake swarm first brought attention to it in 1952. That same year, geologist Gordon A. MacDonald hypothesized that the seamount was actually an active submarine shield volcano, similar to the two active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Macdonald's hypothesis placed the seamount as the newest volcano in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, created by the Hawaiʻi hotspot. However, because the earthquakes were oriented east–west (the direction of the volcanic fault) {{and there was no}} volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from the seamount, Macdonald attributed the earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption.|$|E
5|$|The AJ-2P {{was flown}} by Photographic Squadron SIXTY ONE (VJ-61) and Photographic Squadron SIXTY TWO (VJ-62), {{both of which}} were redesignated as Heavy Photographic Squadrons, VAP-61 and VAP-62, respectively, on 2 July 1956. VJ-61 was {{assigned}} to the Pacific Fleet and VJ-62 to the Atlantic Fleet. The squadrons never deployed as complete units, but rather deployed as one to three aircraft detachments. Detachment Queen was formed by VJ-61 during the Korean War at Naval Station Sangley Point, in the Philippines, to fly reconnaissance missions over the People's Republic of China and North Korea. The detachment continued its missions after the war until at least June 1954. Both squadrons frequently provided photographic mapping for agencies outside the Navy like the Army Map Service, Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast and <b>Geodetic</b> <b>Survey,</b> and U.S. Departments of the Interior and Agriculture. The AJ-2s in these squadrons were replaced by Douglas A3D-2P Skywarriors beginning in 1959, although the last month that they were reported in squadron service was January 1960. Surviving AJ-1 and AJ-2 aircraft became A-2As and A-2Bs, respectively, when the Department of Defense redesignated all U.S. military aircraft in a common series in 1962.|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{terrestrial}} <b>geodetic</b> <b>surveying</b> methods, such as precision triangulation, traversing and geometric levelling, {{have been}} present at the displacement monitoring systems {{of the majority of}} the Portuguese concrete and masonry large dams, since the 1940 ’s. In spite of the widespread use of displacement measurement instruments, such as pendulum and rockmeters, <b>geodetic</b> <b>surveying</b> methods continue to be used in the displacement monitoring systems because they provide: i) An independent control of the other methods; ii) A global relation between the dam, its foundation and the surrounding terrain. The Geodetic Measurement Division (GMD) of the National Laboratory for Civil Engineering, which is involved in dam surveillance activity since the 1950 ’s, is responsible for planning and observation of <b>geodetic</b> <b>surveying</b> systems for more than fifty large dams. The paper presents the experience of the GMD in planning the <b>geodetic</b> <b>surveying</b> systems and in the quality control of the observations, and carries on a prospective view of modern trends, such as motorized tachymeters and GPS relative measurements and permanent stations.

40|$|<b>Geodetic</b> <b>surveying</b> systems used to {{monitoring}} displacements at large concrete dams {{must be carefully}} designed and materialized, {{not only as a}} response to required submilimeter accuracies but also in regard as to their lifetime, witch is expected to last as long as the dam. This special care should be extended to the choice of the measurement equipment and procedures and to the use of adequate adjustment and quality control procedures. The most common sources of errors are: instrument calibration, atmospheric conditions, operative methods, human errors and mistakes and, last but not the least, the unexpected behaviour of the reference frame. This paper deals with a real situation, which took place in the <b>geodetic</b> <b>surveying</b> system of a Portuguese dam, where unexpected variations of its horizontal control network’s observables, suggesting an apparently abnormal behaviour of the dam, were detected by means of statistical quality control tests.
