60|$|But {{in those}} cases in which plants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same species were {{observed}} during several generations, a general average <b>of</b> their <b>heights</b> in all the generations together may be made; and such averages are given in Table 7/A; for instance, under Ipomoea the general average for <b>the</b> plants <b>of</b> all ten generations is as 100 for the crossed, to 77 for the self-fertilised plants. This having been done in each case {{in which more than}} one generation was raised, it is easy to calculate <b>the</b> average <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crossed and self-fertilised plants <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> species included in Table 7/A. It should however be observed that as only a few plants of some species, whilst a considerable number of others, were measured, <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean or average <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> several species is very different. Subject to this source of error, it may be worth while to give <b>the</b> mean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifty-four species in Table 7/A; and the result is, calling <b>the</b> mean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crossed plants 100, that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-fertilised plants is 87. But it is a better plan to divide the fifty-four species into three groups, as was done with the previously given eighty-three cases. The first group consists of species <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> mean <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-fertilised plants are within five per cent of 100; so that the crossed and self-fertilised plants are approximately equal; and of such species there are twelve about which nothing need be said, <b>the</b> mean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-fertilised being <b>of</b> course very nearly 100, or exactly 99.58. The second group consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species, thirty-seven in number, <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> mean <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crossed plants exceed that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-fertilised plants by more than five per cent; and <b>the</b> mean <b>of</b> their mean <b>heights</b> is to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-fertilised plants as 100 to 78. The third group consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species, only five in number, <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> mean <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-fertilised plants exceed that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crossed by more than five per cent; and here <b>the</b> mean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crossed plants is to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-fertilised as 100 to 109. Therefore if we exclude the species which are approximately equal, there are thirty-seven species in which <b>the</b> mean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crossed plants exceeds that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-fertilised by twenty-two per cent; whereas there are only five species in which <b>the</b> mean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-fertilised plants exceeds that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crossed, and this only by nine per cent.|$|R

5|$|The pillars {{that support}} {{the roof of the}} mantapa are {{monolithic}} shafts from the base up to the neck of the capital.

The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple was also constrained by the weight of the superstructure on the walls and, since Chalukyan architects did not use mortar, by the use of dry masonry and bonding stones without clamps or cementing material.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>the</b> {{physical conditions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sources <b>of</b> two metric Type-II bursts associated with CME expansions with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> verifying <b>the</b> {{relationship between the}} shocks and the CMEs, comparing <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio sources and <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUV waves associated with <b>the</b> CMEs. <b>The</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUV waves associated with the events were determined {{in relation to the}} wave fronts. <b>The</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shocks were estimated by applying two different density models to <b>the</b> frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Type-II emissions and compared with <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUV waves. For the 13 June 2010 event, with band-splitting, the shock speed was estimated from <b>the</b> frequency drifts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper and lower branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harmonic lane, taking into account the H/F frequency ratio fH/fF = 2. Exponential fits on <b>the</b> intensity maxima <b>of</b> <b>the</b> branches revealed to be more consistent with <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectrum <b>of</b> this event. For the 6 June 2012 event, with no band-splitting and with a clear fundamental lane on the spectrum, the shock speed was estimated directly from <b>the</b> frequency drift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fundamental emission, determined by linear fit on <b>the</b> intensity maxima <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lane. For each event, the most appropriate density model was adopted to estimate <b>the</b> physical parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio source. The 13 June 2010 event presented a shock speed of 664 - 719 km/s, consistent with <b>the</b> average speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUV wave fronts <b>of</b> 609 km/s. <b>The</b> 6 June 2012 event was related to a shock of speed of 211 - 461 km/s, also consistent with <b>the</b> average speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUV wave fronts of 418 km/s. For both events, <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUV wave revealed to be compatible with <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio source, assuming a radial propagation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shock.

40|$|During 450 {{years from}} <b>the</b> middle years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Asikaga era up to present, Town Simoda in {{southern}} Idu Peninsula was frequently submerged under the waters and lost many lives by 7 tunamis caused by marine earthquakes and 2 kazetunamis caused by typhoon. This is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most powerful reasons for her gradual decline, {{in spite of}} her prosperity in <b>the</b> later years <b>of</b> Tokugawa era. <b>The</b> writer picked up some suggestive facts about <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunamis from <b>the</b> old records <b>of</b> these calamities and required <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunamis from the present mean sea-level by levelling method. And get 2. 5 m, 3. 6 m and 4. 5 m for the tunamis in 1703, 1707 and 1854. <b>The</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunamis which were caused by the great Kwanto earthquake of 1923 could be told by the indisputable traces left on <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> houses at Simoda even nearly 12 years after that. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> 26 points from the mean sea-level were determined with a "Y" level as shown in Fig. 4.
