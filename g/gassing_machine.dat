40|$|Many {{anesthetic}} gases {{are used}} at Duke University for performing animal surgeries. These gases can present a risk for potential {{exposure to the}} lab personnel performing the surgeries. Anesthetics of concern include ether, nitrous oxide, and halogenated agents (i. e. halothane, isoflurane, methoxyflurane). Some of these halogenated anesthetics {{have been linked to}} adverse health effects in exposed workers, such as reproductive and neurological effects. Emphasis must be placed on protecting personnel from exposure by adequately “capturing ” the waste gas being generated. This may be accomplished by several methods depending on the method of delivery of the gas. The following good-practice should be considered: For enclosed chambers (i. e. Bell jar) : · perform work in a fume hood so when lid is removed, gases are captured by hood · evacuate chamber via building vacuum system prior to removing lid · make sure the chamber lid is tight-fitting · remove chamber lid only when animal is being placed into or removed For anesthetic <b>gas</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R

Here, the work piece material, Super duplex stainless steel SAF 2507 was turned with uncoated carbide tool. Liquid CO 2 which acts as a coolant, forms a gas cooled environment. The <b>gas</b> cooled <b>machining</b> in turn was compared with the dry and wet machining. Totally 18 experiments were conducted in order to measure the flank wear (Vb) with a tool makers microscope. The experiments were performed with the same cutting conditions and tool characteristics on the three methods of cooling. During the experimental procedure the removed chips were collected and evaluated together with the various cutting conditions. Using MINITAB 15 software, the optimized values of machining parameters were predicted using response surface methodology. Confirmation tests were carried out to compare the results of predicted values with the experimental value. The flank wear and the chips produced at the optimized values are analysed by scanning electron microscope (JOEL Model 6390).
