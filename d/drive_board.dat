5000|$|Indian Creek Designs {{also made}} a variant of this marker known as the Lasoya Promaster. The Lasoya version has {{slightly}} different milling which is more simplistic and comes in a dust finish two tone fade colour. The aggressive [...] "tail" [...] has been removed, perhaps to decrease {{the weight of the}} marker. The high pressure regulator is different from the standard ProMaster. It is a clone of the well-known Air America Vigilante regulator. Instead of the standard ProMaster blade trigger, a new trigger with two finger groves has been added. The bolt is also different as it is made of teflon, instead of delrin and has a small [...] "ramp" [...] on the top to reduce ball breakage. It also comes with a low pressure regulator gauge so the user can see exactly what the LPR is set at. Another change from the regular ProMaster is the feed neck. While it is still not a clamping feed neck, it has a lower profile, resulting in less hopper hits. The board in the Lasoya Promaster was made by Kila products for ICD and is a less adjustable version of their ProMaster <b>Drive</b> <b>board.</b> Hence it has been nicknamed the [...] "Kila Lite" [...] board. It features more firing modes than the original ProMaster board and an adjustable [...] "debounce" [...] setting.|$|E

The purpose {{of this research is}} to provide a numerical control method to overcome the multi-axis numerical control problem. The control system includes an IBM-PC computer as a host processor, a plug in multimotor controller board based on commercial numerical motor controller ICs. These implement a software specified digital control algorithm and output a PWM control number. Six motors, their driven actuators, and digital incremental feedback encoders complete the system. The experimental aspects of the work included the design of the IBM-PC plug in motor controller board and the motor <b>drive</b> <b>board,</b> computer software for real-time control and the system testing. For the theoretical aspects of the work, control theory was used to develop the mathematical model of the system. This aimed at providing a tool to predict and optimize the system performance, therefore, to fulfil the high positioning and high precision control task...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{on-board}} {{methodology for}} monitoring {{the health of}} power converter modules in drive systems, using vector control heating and structure function to check for degradation.

The structure function is good tool for tracking the magnitude and location of degradation in power modules. The ability to keep regular track of the actual degradation level of the modules enables the adoption of preventive maintenance, reducing or even eliminating altogether the appearance of failures during operation, significantly improving the availability of the power devices. The novelty in this work is the complete system that is used to achieve degradation monitoring; combining the heating technique and the measurement without additional power components except the measurement circuit which can be integrated into the gate <b>drive</b> <b>board</b> and the challenges encountered.

40|$|More {{and more}} {{attention}} has been paid to the energy crisis due to the increasing energy demand from industrial and commercial applications. The utilization of renewable energy considered as one of the most promising electrical energy sources, which has grown rapidly in the last three decades. In this day and age, many power converter techniques have been developed to integrate renewable energy with the electrical grid. In this work, there is a new technical control is known as synchronverter control which is using the synchronous generator mathematical equations as a reference. This synchronverter control is connected with DC-AC three phase inverter to work as controller of output power to feed the load. In this control strategy, the output current of the controllable inverter is controlled by a feedback load current according to the current reference. The synchronverter technology has been applied to control the inverter for the induction motor connection. An experimental setup based on DSP (Digital Signal Processing) and dc <b>drive</b> <b>board</b> have been designed to implement the open and closed loop experiments. All experiments have been implemented on a test rig based on Matlab 20013 a/simulink software and Code Composer Studio V 6. 0 to demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed control strategies with stability of the system, sinusoidal currents and good dynamics. Finally, an improve control strategy based on the synchronverter control technology has been tested for three phase inverter for renewable energy applications to make the whole system behave as a synchronous generator...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an on-board methodology for monitoring {{the health of}} power (converter) modules in drive systems. The ability to keep regular track of the actual degradation level of the modules enables the adoption of preventive maintenance, reducing or even eliminating altogether the appearance of failures during operation, significantly improving {{the availability of the}} power devices. The novelty of this work is twofold: the complete system that is used to achieve degradation monitoring; combining the heating technique (to obtain thermal transient) and the measurement without additional power components such as IGBT, MOSFETS, which affects the reliability, power density and complexity. The only additional component is an analog measurement circuit, which can be integrated into the gate <b>drive</b> <b>board.</b> The test routine is carried out during non-operational periods and idle times. Trains are used as a case study, where checks for degradation are made when the train is not in use, such as {{at the end of the}} day, after daily operation or at the start before daily operation and other non-operational periods. It is important to keep the train at standstill while tests are carried out. Hence a methodology to heat the devices with current from the input supply while keeping the motor load at a stand-still is presented. Experimental results obtained from this show that it is possible to implement an on-board health monitoring system in converters which measures the degradation on power modules. The work uses the concepts of vector control heating and structure function to check for degradation. It puts forward a system that is used on-board to measure the cooling curve and derive the structure function during idle times for maintenance purposes. The structure function is good tool for tracking the magnitude and location of degradation in power modules. Vector control gives the advantage of controlling the motor with field current and torque current (similar concept to DC motors) ...|$|E

40|$|Local {{public school}} boards {{historically}} {{provide for the}} education of youth in the United States. Most of what is written on school board governance tends toward trade association 2 ̆ 2 how-to 2 ̆ 2 guides, conventional wisdom articles and handbooks on being an effective board member. Indeed, the majority of school governance literature is highly prescriptive. Given the powerful influence and putative importance of local school boards on the course of public education, {{the purpose of this study}} is to redirect the current conversation about board governance—to take a step back from its dual preoccupation with 2 ̆ 2 effectiveness 2 ̆ 2 and what board members 2 ̆ 2 should do 2 ̆ 2 to exploring what they actually 2 ̆ 2 do, 2 ̆ 2 and to do so in a way that accounts for the first-hand experiences and perceptions of the practitioners themselves. Surprisingly, we know very little from the perspectives of board members about the organizations that govern the nation 2 ̆ 7 s 14, 890 school systems. ^ This study is designed as a qualitative, collaborative case study of board members 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their roles and responsibilities to gain an understanding for how practitioners imagine their governance work and learn about that work in their own reflections on practice. The study explores the following guiding questions through the interpretive lens of organizational metaphors of culture and politics: (1.) What is the range and variation of how school board members conceptualize their work practices—both individually and collectively?; (2.) How do individual board members perceive their own roles and responsibilities in relation to their conceptions of the board 2 ̆ 7 s work?; and, (3.) In what ways do their beliefs about their practices inform the culture and processes of the group? The study is based in large part on qualitative data culled from a five-month observational period. The study concludes that school board members 2 ̆ 7 emic perspectives on their governance work are informed by board members 2 ̆ 7 own understandings of a board 2 ̆ 7 s roles and responsibilities; in addition, these perspectives are indelibly shaped by immediate issues of local culture and politics. Thus, although local matters typically <b>drive</b> <b>board</b> governance practices, school board members benefit from understanding how their own perspectives on their work practices shape their actions. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{corporate}} governance crisis {{at the start}} of this third Millennium and the financial crisis only a few years later, have cast doubts on the way boards of directors of companies function. Lawyers and (financial) economists have developed narrow perceptions of boards and their roles that are unable to explain board performance in reality and the factors that determine it. A comprehensive and integrated approach of boards is required to truly understand what <b>drives</b> <b>board</b> performance. Such an integrated approach necessarily includes behavioural aspects. In this paper we focus on a crucial element in the analysis of board performance: what it means for a board to be On Task. On the basis of an Organisational Role Analysis we describe the interaction between executives and non-executives that constitutes board activity. The concept of the Board On Task helps to understand and assess board performance in practice. It also offers a comprehensive conceptual framework for conducting novel research in understanding board performance...|$|R

In this paper, the system composition and principles of the abdominal operating ROV are presented.
