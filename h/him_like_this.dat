60|$|She {{came over}} to Douglas with outstretched hands, and he was bewildered, for she had not smiled upon <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> once during that long journey to London.|$|E
6000|$|... "What am I to do?" [...] she asked. [...] "I cannot leave <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> and if I am not at {{the theatre}} in twenty minutes, I shall be fined." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Goble {{regarded}} the silver-tongued orator wrathfully. He was {{not accustomed to}} chatterboxes arguing with <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> He would probably have said something momentous and crushing, {{but at this point}} Jill intervened.|$|E
60|$|MRS DUBEDAT. Thank {{you again}} and again. You {{have made me}} so happy: I know you will admire <b>him</b> and <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> is my address. [She gives him her card].|$|R
6000|$|... "'And {{the fastest}} that ever I 'ad, an' that means more,' {{said the old}} huntsman. 'But what licks me is that we've never 'ad {{a look at the}} beast. 'E must leave an amazin' scent be'ind 'im when these 'ounds can follow <b>'im</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> and yet none of us have seen 'im when we've 'ad a clear 'alf mile view in front of us.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had never}} heard <b>him</b> talk <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before. In his {{excitement}} he rose from the table, and commenced pacing the room.|$|R
60|$|McTurk's lean {{face had}} turned pearly white; his mouth, {{generally}} half open, was tight shut, {{and his eyes}} blazed. They had never seen <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> save once in a sad time of civil war.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm Mrs. Pomfret--a {{very old}} friend of Mr. Crewe's. Whenever he has his friends with <b>him,</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> I come over and help him. It is so {{difficult}} for a bachelor to entertain, Mr. Braden." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why are you such a fool? What can a dog be to you, {{that you}} should give your life for <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> Just promise me the reward I want, and I will guide {{you out of the}} forest.' ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Powell smoked austerely, very detached. But I {{could not}} let <b>him</b> off <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> The sly beggar. So this was the secret of his passion for sailing about the river, the reason of his fondness for that creek.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have behaved disgracefully," [...] she concluded. [...] "I am {{disgusted with}} you. You have {{encouraged}} Gus Sinclair markedly right along, {{and now you}} throw <b>him</b> over <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> I never dreamed that you were capable of such unwomanly behaviour." ...|$|R
60|$|Cecilia {{had never}} seen <b>him</b> moved <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Was it {{possible}} {{that he was not}} incorrigibly gentle, but had in him some of that animality which she, in a sense, admired? This uncertainty terribly increased the difficulties of the situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "You say I mustn't, I mustn't. All {{the world}} will be {{speaking}} of <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> to-morrow. They will say it, and they'll print it. You shall hear it and you shall read it--and then you shall know whose daughter you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why did Sotillo {{give the}} estrapade to this pitiful wretch? Do you know? No torture {{could have been}} worse than his fear. Killing I can understand. His anguish was {{intolerable}} to behold. But why should he torment <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> He could tell no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, {{wiping his}} wet {{eyes with his}} fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last {{and he was in}} his usual health that I'd be driving after <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> He's gone from us.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. It's beastly and morbid. I wish {{he would}} drop it. It's the second fright he has given me. It was the same last winter. I found <b>him</b> just <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> with that horrid thing in front of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bad hemorrhage," [...] he said. [...] "I {{am going}} to fetch some things that will be wanted if he pulls through the next hour. I found <b>him</b> lying <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> the {{bleeding}} partly stopped by this scarf, else he had been dead by now." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS TARLETON. I do {{wonder at}} you, John, letting <b>him</b> talk <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before everybody. [Turning rather tartly to Lina] Would you mind going {{away to the}} drawing-room {{just for a few}} minutes, Miss Chipenoska. This is a private family matter, if you dont mind.|$|R
60|$|Hallward was thunderstruck. He {{looked at}} Dorian Gray in {{absolute}} amazement. He {{had never seen}} <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before. The lad was actually pallid with rage. His hands were clenched, and the pupils of his eyes were like disks of blue fire. He was trembling all over.|$|E
60|$|He {{felt his}} heart {{suddenly}} swell. No one had ever spoken to <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> The newspapers had been complimentary {{for a day and}} had accepted the verdict of circumstances the next. His wife had simply been the reflex of other people's opinion and the trend of events.|$|E
6000|$|It amused {{me to talk}} to <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> He {{reflected}} audibly that {{he guessed}} story-writers were out after money {{like the rest of the}} world which had to live by its wits: and that it was extraordinary how far people who were out after money would go. [...] . Some of them.|$|E
60|$|When Andrew made up {{his mind}} to have a man he got to <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> <b>This</b> was his danger.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{what comes}} of you blamed amateurs butting in!" [...] he remarked. [...] "Jernyngham was bad enough, but he can't come near you at mussing up our plans. Guess you don't know that we've been {{watching}} Wandle for some weeks, ready to corral him, {{and you start}} <b>him</b> off <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> without warning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he {{was worried}} over some {{business}} matters," [...] answered Dick. [...] "But that wasn't bad enough to make <b>him</b> go off <b>like</b> <b>this</b> and leave no word. When was he last seen?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stared in}} wonder {{at his own}} wife as she told him his own heart so callously. And he was indignant. What right had she to sit there telling him these things? She was his wife, what right had she to speak to <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> {{as if she were}} a stranger.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's Jerry Curtis, Harry. I come {{up along}} with Leaping Horse, though I {{did not expect}} to find you in such a bad fix. This young Indian is Hunting Dog, and this young chap next to me is your nephew, Tom Wade. You {{did not expect to}} meet <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> I reckon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the lodge}} was reached, and Mervyn, {{somewhat}} revived, had ridden through the gates, {{she turned back}} to give her warm thanks. A kind, fatherly, friendly face looked at her with a sort of compassion, as putting aside her thanks, the gentleman said, quickly, yet half-reluctantly, 'Have you ever seen <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [With feeling.] Bein' with Mr. Anthony, as you know, M'm, {{ever since}} I was fifteen, it worries {{me to see}} <b>him</b> crossed <b>like</b> <b>this</b> at his age. I've taken the liberty to speak to Mr. Wanklin [dropping his voice]-- {{seems to be the}} most {{sensible}} of the gentlemen--but 'e said to me: [...] "That's all very well, Frost, but this strike's a very serious thing," [...] 'e said. [...] "Serious for all parties, no doubt," [...] I said, [...] "but yumour 'im, sir," [...] I said, [...] "yumour <b>'im.</b> It's <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> if a man comes to a stone wall, 'e does n't drive 'is 'ead against it, 'e gets over it." [...] "Yes," [...] 'e said, [...] "you'd better tell your master that." [...] [FROST looks at his nails.] That's where it is, M'm. I said to Mr. Anthony this morning: [...] "Is it worth it, sir?" [...] "Damn it," [...] he said to me, [...] "Frost! Mind your own business, or take a month's notice!" [...] Beg pardon, M'm, for using such a word.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, doctor; I wish it 'ad. I shouldn't 'ave thought {{anything}} of that; there's something natural {{in a man}} talking about stocks and shares and trousers, but I've never 'eard <b>'im</b> say anything <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before. He was always a wonderfully steady man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor devil!" [...] cried Brown. [...] "Here, Cochrane, {{tell them}} to let him go. We can't let <b>him</b> be butchered <b>like</b> <b>this</b> in front of us. Say that we will find the money amongst us. I will be {{answerable}} for any reasonable sum." ...|$|R
6000|$|Phil! The word jarred him, for suddenly--with {{his power}} to see all round a thing, he {{perceived}} why she was putting up with <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> She {{wanted to talk about}} her lover! Well! If it was any pleasure to her! And he said: [...] "Ah! There was a bit of the sculptor in him, I fancy." ...|$|E
60|$|Mingled {{with these}} {{feelings}} was an excited gratitude {{to her for}} coming to <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> with that electric smile on her face; a stunned realization {{that she was a}} thousand times prettier than he had ever imagined; and a humility that threatened to make him loose his clutch on the steamer trunk and roll about at her feet, yapping like a dog.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Yes. Far enough,' I said. I {{was sorry}} for him; {{it was the other}} I hated. He hauled in his oar with a loud sigh, and as he was raising his hand to wipe his {{forehead}} with the air {{of a man who has}} done his work, I pulled the trigger of my revolver and shot <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> off the knee, right through the heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you know}} how he is. He notices everything. He is a fellow to take offence for the least little thing--regular Dutchman--and I want to keep {{friendly}} with <b>him.</b> It's <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> my girl: if that rajah of ours were to do something silly--and you know he is a sulky, rebellious beggar--and the authorities took into their heads that my influence over him wasn't good, you would find yourself without a roof over your head--" ...|$|R
60|$|With a quick, almost {{involuntary}} effort {{he would}} have taken her then in his arms, for her eyes were swimming in tears, which he longed to kiss away; but she had lured <b>him</b> once, just <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> then cast <b>him</b> aside <b>like</b> an ill-fitting glove. He thought this was but a mood, a caprice, and he was too proud to lend himself to it once again.|$|R
60|$|PURDIE (to whom it {{is truly}} a nauseous draught). I didn't know. Just a philanderer! (The soul of <b>him</b> would <b>like</b> at <b>this</b> instant to creep into another body.) And if people don't change, I suppose we shall begin all over again now.|$|R
