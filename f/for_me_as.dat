25|$|These {{principles}} of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, {{enable us to}} pass {{beyond the limits of}} the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.|$|E

Furthermore, the episode leaves us bereft of a villain that can be nailed to the wall for forcible rape." [...] The writer went on to state that instead of placing the blame on a single person, [...] "A Trip to the Dentist" [...] blamed several people for Veronica's rape. Whitney also wrote that despite that the [...] "official resolution of the rape narrative denies a traditional 'whodunit' ending," [...] it makes a statement that she was raped by an [...] "unfeeling class of people." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{she rose}} to {{prominence}} {{with the success}} of her major-label debut Pies Descalzos (1995), Shakira was introduced to Emilio Estefan, the most important producer in the Hispanic market at the time, by her promoter and longtime friend, Jairo Martínez. Estefan was renowned for launching the careers of various Hispanic singers, such as Enrique Iglesias, Thalía, and his wife Gloria Estefan. He decided to work with Shakira as he identified her potential to strongly break into the US Latin market and expand her commercial presence there. One of Shakira's concerns was having creative autonomy over her music. Before signing their contract, the roles and duties were defined. Estefan would be her manager and her executive producer, but she would be in charge of all the material and arrangements and have approval over the final look of the records. She later stated about her producer, [...] "He had a great respect <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> an artist and trusted me totally on this project". Since then, they started working on Estefan's Crescent Moon Studios in Miami.|$|E

The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song. [...] "Not just make it something that sounds from Hollywood and really produced, but we could add a little country twang to it," [...] she said. Cyrus said the writing process was easy. Before the song's completion, Travolta agreed to sing it, believing [...] "Well, it will be a cute song, whatever it is." [...] After listening to the song, he was surprised at Cyrus' songwriting abilities.

In November 2014, Toy Story 4 was confirmed to be in development with Lasseter serving as director. In an interview, Lasseter stated that [...] " [...] {{lot of people in the}} industry view us doing sequels as being for the business of it, but for us, it's pure passion...One of the things that was very important <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> an artist is to continue directing. When I direct, I get to work with the individual artists, with the animators." [...] In August 2015, at the D23 Expo, Lasseter said that the film would focus on the romance between Woody and Bo Peep. Its story will be built on the fact that Bo Peep was absent in Toy Story 3, with Woody and Buzz Lightyear trying to find her and bring her back.|$|E
500|$|Produced {{independently}} by Ecosse, Becoming Jane {{was given}} a limited budget of €12.7 million (£9 million or $16.5 million). Production designer Eve Stewart researched Regency literature and Austen's life, and along with Jarrold, scouted locations in Dublin and nearby counties for five weeks in January and February 2006. They ultimately opted to shoot in Dublin and the Irish counties of Meath and Wicklow instead of Hampshire, the birthplace of Austen, because it held [...] "a sense of countryside that felt more unchanged," [...] while Hampshire had unfortunately become too [...] "groomed and manicured". Jarrold also found [...] "a great variety of Georgian houses and older houses" [...] in Ireland. His production received funds from the Irish Film Board, the UK Film Council Premiere Fund, 2 Entertain, Scion Films, and Miramax Films. Film critic Andrew Sarris noted that in Ireland [...] "happily, there are still architectural traces of life more than 200 years ago to correspond with the year 1795." [...] However, Ireland did include a few disadvantages: Stewart found that [...] "the rural aspects were the most difficult as the Irish country landscape is nothing like Hampshire. There are no rolling hills so the vegetation and the landscaping was the trickiest thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a production designer." ...|$|E

500|$|The film draws {{inspiration}} from the high demand for Christmas toys such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which often led to intense searching and occasional violence amongst shoppers. Randy Kornfield wrote the film's original screenplay after witnessing his in-laws go to a Santa Monica toy store at dawn {{in order to get}} his son a Power Ranger. While admitting to missing the clamor for the Cabbage Patch Kids and Power Rangers, producer Chris Columbus experienced a similar situation in 1995 when he attempted to obtain a Buzz Lightyear action figure from the film Toy Story, released that year. As a result, he rewrote Kornfield's script, which was accepted by 20th Century Fox. Columbus was always [...] "attracted to {{the dark side of the}} happiest holiday of the year", so wrote elements of the film as a satire of the commercialization of Christmas. Brian Levant was hired to direct the film. Columbus said Levant [...] "underst the humor in the material" [...] and [...] "was very animated and excited, and he had a vision of what he wanted to do". Levant said [...] "The story that was important to me was between the father and son...it's a story about love, and a father's journey to deliver it in the form of a Turbo Man doll. The fact that I got to design a toy line and do the commercials and make pajamas and comic books was fun <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a filmmaker. But at its root, the movie's about something really sweet. It's about love and building a better family. I think that's consistent with everything I've done." ...|$|E

Anthony realises how much he loves Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) but is unsure how to deal with her brother and father Joey (David Witts) and Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) respectively. Speaking to Soaplife, Lapinskas said [...] "Joey manipulates Anthony into challenging Derek, which is a big mistake. I can't give too much away, but I can tell you that after going up against Derek, Anthony {{has no choice but to}} leave the Square." [...] Magazine reports claim that Anthony packs his bags after losing everything to Joey and Derek, revising his gambling problem. Lapinskas hopes that Anthony will return someday. In an interview with Inside Soap, Lapinskas said that EastEnders was his first job outside of drama school and added that he has learnt a lot from the people he worked with.
