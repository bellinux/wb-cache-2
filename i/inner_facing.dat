40|$|We {{present an}} {{adaptive}} grid based algorithm to compute {{a family of}} relevant molecular surfaces. Molecular interfaces are important in simulations and visualization involving biomolecules. The Richards surface has traditionally {{been used as a}} good approximation to the surface, and defined as the surface formed by the <b>inner</b> <b>facing</b> part of a solvent probe atom rolling along the van der Waals surface of the molecule. Computing and representing this surface has traditionally involved complex geometrical data structures like alpha shapes. Adaptive and uniform trilinear grids are commonly used in various simulations involving interactions of molecules or computation of electrostatics and other energy terms. We make use of this grid directly to compute the Molecular Surface and properties like area, volume, curvatures, surface atoms and other surfaces. We compare geometrical and biochemical properties with other methods as a validation. 1 Molecular Surface Definitions Explicit surface definitions as the interface between the solvent and proteins have been given since 1970 s. Since it is easier to handle implicitly defined models mathematically, different implicit approximations to these surfaces have been developed. 1. 1 van der Waals and Lee Richards Surface Definitions The most common model for molecules is as a collection of atoms represented by spheres, with radii equal to their van der Waals radii. The surface of the set of spheres is known as the van der Waals surface. Lee and Richards introduced the concep...|$|E
40|$|Site-directed {{mutagenesis}} of MCT 1 {{was performed}} on exofacial lysines Lys 38, Lys 45, Lys 282, and Lys 413. K 38 Q-MCT 1 and K 38 R-MCT 1 were inactive when expressed at the plasma membrane of Xenopus laevis oocytes, whereas K 45 R/K 282 R/K 413 R-MCT 1 and K 45 Q/K 282 Q/K 413 Q-MCT 1 were active. The former exhibited normal reversible and irreversible inhibition by DIDS, whereas the latter showed less reversible and no irreversible inhibition. K 45 Q/K 413 Q-MCT 1 retained some irreversible inhibition, whereas K 45 Q/K 282 Q-MCT 1 and K 282 Q/K 413 Q-MCT 1 did not. These {{data suggest that the}} two DIDS SO 3 − groups interact with positively charged Lys 282 together with Lys 45 and/or Lys 413. This positions one DIDS isothiocyanate group close to Lys 38, leading to its covalent modification and irreversible inhibition. Additional mutagenesis revealed that DIDS cross-links MCT 1 to its ancillary protein embigin using either Lys 38 or Lys 290 of MCT 1 and Lys 160 or Lys 164 of embigin. We have modeled a possible structure for the outward facing (open) conformation of MCT 1 by employing modest rotations of the C-terminal domain of the <b>inner</b> <b>facing</b> conformation modeled previously. The resulting model structure has a DIDS-binding site consistent with experimental data and locates Lys 38 in a hydrophobic environment {{at the bottom of a}} substrate-binding channel. Our model suggests a translocation cycle in which Lys 38 accepts a proton before binding lactate. Both the lactate and proton are then passed through the channel via Asp 302 − and Asp 306 +, an ion pair already identified as important for transport and located adjacent to Phe 360, which controls channel selectivity. The cross-linking data have also been used to model a structure of MCT 1 bound to embigin that is consistent with published data...|$|E
