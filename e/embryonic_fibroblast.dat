We propose that the DNA mismatch repair Msh 2 /Msh 6 heterodimer, responsible {{for the detection of}} DNA damage, promotes apoptosis in normal cells, thus protecting mammals from ultraviolet-induced malignant transformation. Using primary mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> derived from Msh 6 +/+ and Msh 6 –/– mice, we compare the response of DNA-mismatch repair-proficient and -deficient cells to ultraviolet B radiation.

50|$|Brpf1 gene is very conserved {{and has a}} {{critical}} role in different developmental processes. Zebrafish BRPF1, which is coordinated by its particular set of PWWP domains, mediates Moz -dependent histone acetylation and maintains Hox genes expression throughout vertebrate development, hence determines the proper pharyngeal segmental identities. Furthermore, Brpf1 may not only has significant role for maintaining the anterior-posterior axis of the craniofacial skeleton, but also the dorsal-ventral axis of the caudal skeleton. Recent studies have shown that ablation of the mouse Brpf1 gene causes embryonic lethality at embryonic day 9.5.

40|$|AbstractGDF 5 and BMP 2, {{members of}} the TGF-β {{superfamily}} of growth factors, are known to regulate apoptosis in different cell types either positively or negatively. We wanted to investigate the effects of GDF 5 and BMP 2 on vascular smooth muscle cells and mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> and disclose the mechanism by which GDF 5 and BMP 2 might exert anti-apoptotic effects. The effect of GDF 5 and BMP 2 on proliferation and/or programmed cells death was assessed in isolated human vascular smooth muscle cells and mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>fibroblasts.</b> We demonstrate that GDF 5 and BMP 2 prevent apoptosis induced by serum starvation in mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> but not in smooth muscle cells via the BMP receptor 2 (BMPR 2), which is often mutated in hereditary cases of primary pulmonary hypertension. GDF 5 and BMP 2 stimulate the interaction of BMPR- 2 with XIAP thereby reducing the ubiquitination of XIAP, which results in enhanced protein stability. The increased concentration of XIAP counteracts apoptosis by binding and inactivating activated caspases. We conclude that the inhibition of apoptosis in mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> by BMP 2 and GDF 5 {{does not depend on}} more complex signal transduction pathways such as smad and MAPK signaling but on direct stabilization of XIAP by BMPR 2...|$|R

40|$|We {{report that}} {{exposure}} of mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> to transforming growth factor beta- 1 (TGFbeta- 1) (5 ng/ml) {{results in a}} strong activation of p 8 mRNA expression that precedes the induction of cell growth. Involvement of the p 8 promoter in the regulation was demonstrated by using a p 8 -chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct. We therefore speculated that p 8 might be a mediator of TGFbeta- 1 in these cells. The incorporation of [(3) H]thymidine on treatment with TGFbeta- 1 was indeed significantly higher in p 8 (+/+) fibroblasts than in p 8 (-/-) fibroblasts. Smad transcriptional activity was used as marker of the TGFbeta- 1 signalling pathway, to probe the lower p 8 (-/-) response to TGFbeta- 1. Two Smad-binding elements (SBEs) -luciferase constructs were transfected into p 8 (-/-) and p 8 (+/+) <b>embryonic</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> before treatment with TGFbeta- 1. A lower level of Smad transactivation was observed in p 8 (-/-) <b>embryonic</b> <b>fibroblasts,</b> under basal conditions and after stimulation with TGFbeta- 1.

The expression of p 8 restored Smad transactivation in unstimulated and TGFbeta- 1 -treated cells to the level found in p 8 (+/+) cells. We concluded that TGFbeta- 1 activates p 8 expression, which in turn enhances the Smad-transactivating function responsible for TGFbeta- 1 activity...|$|R

Here, we have compared the role and specificity of TBK 1 in the type I IFN response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), polyI:C, and viral challenge by examining IRF 3 nuclear translocation, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 phosphorylation, and induction of IFN-regulated genes. The LPS and polyI:C-induced IFN responses were abolished and delayed, respectively, in macrophages from mice with a targeted disruption of the TBK 1 gene. When challenged with Sendai virus, the IFN response was normal in TBK 1 ��� macrophages, but defective in TBK 1 �� � <b>embryonic</b> <b>fibroblasts.</b> Although both TBK 1 and IKK-i are expressed in macrophages, only TBK 1 but not IKK-i was detected in <b>embryonic</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> by Northern blotting analysis.
