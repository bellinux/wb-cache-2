The quantum yield of the ground state I(52 P 32) amounts to (±) % • In terms of a three—level kinetic model, we have furthermore determined the fine—structure branching ratio of the resultant nascent K 52 P doublets {{in the presence of}} Ar, He, H 2, CH 4 and CO 2 to be 0. 800, 0. 798, 0. 791, 0. 797 and 0. 785, respectively, with 1 % accuracy. This model takes into account the rapid energy transfer between the 52 P doublets and the relevant collisional quenching, thereby leading to a more accurate value than the measurement of fluorescence intensity at low pressure. Since a variety of <b>foreign</b> <b>gases</b> that cause different energy transfers and quenching capabilities have been considered in the system, the resulting branching ratios derived at the zero—pressure are identical, thus confirming reliability of our kinetic model. The relevant fine—structure mixing rate coefficients and the collisional quenching rate coefficients are also evaluated. In addition, the kinetic model has been extended to the case of photodissociation at 248 nm; given the appropriate mixing rate coefficients reported elsewhere, the average branching ratio of K(42 P 3, 2) photofragment are then determined to be 0. 610 in the presence of Ar, 112 and N 2.

40|$|The {{pyrolysis}} of formaldehyde {{has been}} studied at 420 °C and 452 °C in the pressure range 20 - 130 mm. The products are mostly carbon monoxide, methanol and hydrogen as previously reported. The ratio (CH₃OH) /(H₂) is approximately four at 420 °C and one at 452 °C. When formaldehyde was completely pyrolyzed a good carbon balance was obtained, indicating that no condensation reaction occurred, {{at least at the}} end of the reaction. Reports of a condensation reaction have appeared in the literature. [...] Conditioning of the reactor by pumping over night with the oil diffusion pump had no effect upon the rate of methanol formation. The rate of hydrogen formation was sometimes erratic. As the reactor aged the rate of hydrogen formation decreased slightly but no effect on methanol formation could be detected. [...] The addition of <b>foreign</b> <b>gas</b> (CO₂) increased the rate of hydrogen formation, but had no effect upon the rate of methanol formation. [...] The reaction is approximately second order for methanol with a suggestion of temperature dependence of order. Hydrogen formation is also approximately second order but the results are erratic. For H₂ the observations are consistent with the results of previous work at ≈ 500 °C and at ≈ 1500 °C and for CH₃OH they are consistent with some preliminary results which have been reported. Activation energies estimated for methanol formation and hydrogen formation were 31 and 39 kcal mol⁻¹ respectively. [...] A radical chain mechanism for methanol formation is proposed which, when combined with a mechanism for hydrogen formation, can account for all of the observations in the present work: the reaction orders, the dependence of the rate of formation of H₂ on <b>foreign</b> <b>gas</b> pressure and the independence of the rate of formation of CH₃OH on <b>foreign</b> <b>gas</b> pressure, the sometimes erratic rate of H₂ formation and the reproducible rate of CH₃OH formation.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that most liquids exhibit a tensile {{strength}} which is much smaller in magnitude than the tensile strength predicted by homogeneous nucleation theory. This lack of agreement is usually attributed to the difficulty of preparing liquid samples free from <b>foreign</b> <b>gases</b> which act as heterogeneous nucleation sites. Liquid helium occupies a unique place among liquids for tensile strength measurements because all <b>foreign</b> <b>gases</b> are frozen out at liquid helium temperatures. Furthermore, superfluid 4 He should fill all crevices on solid surfaces, eliminating the chance of heterogeneous nucleation on helium vapor pockets. Despite the quantum mechanical nature of liquid helium, Becker-Doring theory of nucleation of the vapor phase from the liquid phase should be valid down to 0. 3 K in 4 He, yet previous results have been in stark disagreement with the theory. In this study, a piezoelectric transducer {{in the form of a}} hemispherical shell was used to focus high-intensity ultrasound into a small volume of 4 He. The transducer was gated at its resonant frequency of 566 kHz with gate widths of less than 1 msec in order to minimize the effects of transducer heating and acoustic streaming. The onset of nucleation was detected from the absorption of acoustic energy and the scattering of laser light from microscopic bubbles. A new theory for the diffraction of light from the focal zone of a spherical converging sound wave was developed to confirm calculations of the acoustic pressure amplitude at the focus of the piezoelectric transducer, calculations which were based on the acoustic power radiated into the liquid and the nonlinear absorption of sound. The experimental results were in agreement with homogeneous nucleation theory for a nucleation rate of approximately 1015 critical size bubbles/sec-cm 3. This is only the third liquid for which the theoretical tensile strength has been reached and it confirms homogeneous nucleation theory over a range three times greater than any other experiment. A noticeable decrease in the magnitude of the tensile strength was noted at temperatures near the lambda transition and a hypothesis that bubbles are being nucleated heterogeneously quantized vortices is presented...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Computer {{programs}} were developed with polynomial fits to help analyze data {{for a series}} of experiments on the fundamental property of water (H 2 O) by monitoring the index of refraction. The computer {{played a major role in}} helping to compare data curves to accepted models for trends. The computer expedited the analysis of data, the preparation of graphs and the final form for the narrative and peripheral requirements in the manuscripts being prepared for publication. The water molecule is a fundamental building block of living organisms. The search for water on other planets than Earth is a prime goal of space exploration. Indeed, life as we know it cannot exist without water, an almost universal solvent. A modified Michelson interferometer and a He-Ne laser were used to study the nature of liquid water structuring over temperature for 0 T 100 C. The index of refraction change at specific set temperatures was explored as a “foreign ” gas was impressed into the water structure. The change in the index of refraction was obtained from counting the fringe shifts as the <b>foreign</b> <b>gas</b> pressure is systematically changed From the data, conclusions were drawn from models covering the role that molecular aggregation plays in the changing index of refraction in water systems as the <b>foreign</b> <b>gas</b> pressure and temperature are changed.

Collisions of second kind between excited Mg atoms reduce intensity of 4571 in the arc. At a vapor pressure of 10 ^(- 4) mm, the time between collisions of the Mg atoms is 10 ^(- 3) sec. The 4571 line should appear strong at this or lower vapor pressures. Vapor from solid Mg metal at 500 °C was excited in an evacuated tube by an electrodeless short-wave discharge. The 4571 line appeared in the discharge as a fairly prominent line. Effect of <b>foreign</b> <b>gases</b> on 4571. The noble gases enhanced this line, the intensity relative to the triplet 3838 increasing up to about 20 mm in argon and 10 mm in neon and helium and then remaining practically constant. At these pressures, argon increased the line 100 times, Ne about 70 times, and He about 40 times. N 2 and CO increased 4571 up to the limit of pressure, about 2 mm, at which the discharge could be operated. H 2 caused a slight increase at a pressure of about 2 mm. Intensity-pressure curves for noble gases have been reproduced theoretically, proving the assumption that excited Mg atoms suffer collisions of the second kind with the walls, and that action of a noble gas in enhancing the 4571 line is due entirely to the slowing up of diffusion of Mg atoms in 23 P 1 state to the walls, and to its inefficiency in causing collisions of the second kind with excited Mg atoms.
