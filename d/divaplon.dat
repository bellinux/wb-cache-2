40|$|The {{differences}} in intrinsic activity and receptor subtype specific-ity {{of the newly}} developed benzodiazepine receptor ligands bretazenil, <b>divaplon</b> and abecarnil were assessed in recombinant-y-aminobutyric acid,, (GABAA) receptors expressed in mamma-han cells from the subunit-cDNA combinations a 392 y 2 and a 5 fl 2 ’y 2. Chloride currents induced by rapid application of GABA in {{the presence or absence}} of drugs were measured using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Bretazenil displayed an intrinsic activity which amounted only to 58 ± 7 % and 35 ± 1 1 % of that of flunitrazepam at the a 3. 32 y 2 and a 5 $ 2 -y 2 combination, respectively. The maximum potentiation by <b>divaplon</b> was only 28 ± 5 % and 21 ± 9 % of that of flunitra-zepam at the respective subunit combinations. Thus, the partial agonism postulated for bretazenil and <b>divaplon</b> on pharmacolog-ical grounds is shown to be operative on the level of single GABAA receptors. Most strikingly, abecamil potentiated the GABA response to the same degree as flunitrazepam at the a 3 fl 2 y 2 combination but to only 52 ± 14 % compared to flunitra-zepam at the a 5 fl 2 ’y 2 combination. This finding demonstrates that the intrinsic activity of benzodiazepine receptor ligands can vary among the receptor subtypes with the degree of receptor modulation being influenced by the type of a subunit. GABAA receptors display a pronounced structural heteroge-neity due to the expression of a family of at least 16 subunit genes in the brain (al- 6, / 31 - 4, yl- 3, #{ 244 },p 1 - 2) (for review Mohle...|$|E
