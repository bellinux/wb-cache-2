In addition, most <b>electronic</b> <b>speed</b> <b>controllers</b> can use the electric motor as a magnetic brake, offering better control of the model than is possible with a mechanical <b>speed</b> control.Mechanical <b>speed</b> <b>controllers</b> use a network of resistors and switch between them by rotating a head with an electrode around a plate that has electrical contacts. Mechanical <b>speed</b> <b>controllers</b> are prone to being slow to react because they are actuated by servos, waste energy in the form of heat from the resistors, commonly become dirty and perform intermittently, and lack a dedicated braking ability. They appear only in vintage RC models, and are now essentially obsolete.Most electric cars up to recently used brushed motors but now many people are turning to brushless motors for their higher power output and because they require much less maintenance. They are rated either in relative turns or Kv. The Kv number tells how many RPM the motor will turn per volt, assuming no load and maximum efficiency. However, the ability of the system to put out power is dependent {{on the quality of the}} batteries used, wires and connectors supplying power. Due to their power, brushless motors are also used in bigger monster trucks and 1/8 nitro-powered buggies that have been converted to electric. High quality brushless systems can be much more powerful than nitro and can accomplish feats such as standing backflips when installed in a monster truck, most notably the HPI Savage Flux. Some 1/5 scale gas to electric conversions are in production but are uncommon due to high price.A new (2012) form of electric r/c racing is MAGracing. Small 1/32 scale cars and powered by rechargeable batteries and steering and speed are controlled by r/c. Extra steering guidance is provided by steel wires hidden in the track surface enabling more accurate steering than is attainable with free running r/c cars. Tracks can therefore be much narrower and smaller making the system suitable for 'in home' racing. Cars can be driven back onto the track afteran 'off', using reverse if necessary, so that track marshals are not required.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a tool for performing path planning at the servo level of a mobile robot. The ability to perform, in a provably correct manner, such a complex task at the servo level can lead to a large increase in the speed of operation, low energy consumption and high quality of response. Planning has been traditionally limited to the high level controller of a robot. The guidance velocity signal from this stage is usually converted to a control signal using what is known as an <b>electronic</b> <b>speed</b> <b>controller</b> (ESC). This paper demonstrates the ability of the harmonic potential field (HPF) approach to generate a provably correct, constrained, well behaved trajectory and control signal for a rigid, nonholonomic robot in a stationary, cluttered environment. It is shown that the HPF based, servo level planner can address a large number of challenges facing planning in a realistic situation. The suggested approach migrates the rich and provably correct properties of the solution trajectories from an HPF planner to those of the robot. This is achieved using a synchronizing control signal whose aim is to align the velocity of the robot in its local coordinates, with that of the gradient of the HPF. The link between the two is made possible by representing the robot using what the paper terms separable form. The context-sensitive and goal-oriented control signal used to steer the robot is demonstrated to be well behaved and robust in the presence of actuator noise, saturation and uncertainty in the parameters.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on the fabrication freedom of 3 D printing to create not only conceptual models but also final end-use products. In the last decade, several research groups have reported embedding electronic components and electrical interconnects into 3 D printed structures during process interruptions; however, to date there is an absence of fabricated devices with electromechanical functionality for parts fabricated in a single Additive Manufacturing (AM) build sequence. ^ The focus of this research is the use of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) to manufacture a self-supported electromechanical motor. FDM is an AM process capable of building parts in a layer-by-layer fashion. A uPrint SE Plus (Stratasys, Edina, Minnesota) (a relatively low-cost FDM system), was used to manufacture an electromechanical device. Economical, out-of-the-shelf electrical and mechanical components were used to fabricate the device. A three-phase brushless direct current (DC) motor was chosen because of its easy assembly and minimal requirement of electrical and mechanical components. The motor requires electromagnets, permanent magnets (PM), an <b>electronic</b> <b>speed</b> <b>controller,</b> and ball bearings to function. The three-phase brushless DC motor was manufactured in a process interrupt method where pauses during fabrication were strategically place during the build for the embedding of the electrical and mechanical components. Furthermore, surfaces angled at 45 -degrees from horizontal were used in the design to prevent the deposition of internal support material and prevent thermal shock of the electronic components. ^ The three-phase brushless DC motor was designed using an iteration process. The first iteration worked as a proof-of-concept while the second design contains improvements including reduction of mass, fabrication time, and size. The iteration process on the design was done to determine the performance improvements that can be achieved.

40|$|International audienceQuad-Rotor Control {{develops}} original control {{methods for}} the navigation and hovering flight of an autonomous mini-quad-rotor robotic helicopter. These methods use an imaging {{system and a}} combination of inertial and altitude sensors to localize and guide {{the movement of the}} unmanned aerial vehicle relative to its immediate environment. The history, classification and applications of UAVs are introduced, followed by a description of modelling techniques for quad-rotors and the experimental platform itself. A control strategy for the improvement of attitude stabilization in quad-rotors is then proposed and tested in real-time experiments. The strategy, based on the use of low-cost components and with experimentally-established robustness, avoids drift in the UAV's angular position by the addition of an internal control loop to each <b>electronic</b> <b>speed</b> <b>controller</b> ensuring that, during hovering flight, all four motors turn at almost the same speed. The quad-rotor's Euler angles being very close to the origin, other sensors like GPS or image-sensing equipment can be incorporated to perform autonomous positioning or trajectory-tracking tasks. Two vision-based strategies, each designed to deal with a specific kind of mission, are introduced and separately tested. The first stabilizes the quad-rotor over a landing pad on the ground; it extracts the 3 -dimensional position using homography estimation and derives translational velocity by optical flow calculation. The second combines colour-extraction and line-detection algorithms to control the quad-rotor's 3 -dimensional position and achieves forward velocity regulation during a road-following task. In order to estimate the translational-dynamical characteristics of the quad-rotor (relative position and translational velocity) as they evolve within a building or other unstructured, GPS-deprived environment, imaging, inertial and altitude sensors are combined in a state observer. The text gives the reader a current view of the problems encountered in UAV control, specifically those relating to quad-rotor flying machines and it will interest researchers and graduate students working in that field. The vision-based control strategies presented help the reader {{to a better understanding of}} how an imaging system can be used to obtain the information required for performance of the hovering and navigation tasks ubiquitous in rotored UAV operation...|$|E
40|$|Multirotors such as {{the more}} famous quadcopter have been a favoured {{research}} object the last years. It is widely used as a ﬂying platform for the hobby enthusiasts, but recently also used more and more by the industry. The multirotor has complex dynamics and requires sensors and a control system in order to ﬂy. To get the desired ﬂight characteristics batteries, motor and the propeller have to be chosen wisely as different combinations create different properties. The usual design approach is to test different combinations of motors and propellers, and based on experience select components that will be closest to the desired ﬂight properties. This thesis presents an optimization method that calculates what hardware to use {{in order to get}} closest to the demanded properties. The method will only select from a given database, hence not returning a diameter and pitch of a propeller that are not available. A wide range of criteria can be optimized, examples are dynamics of the motor/propeller, ﬂight dynamics, ﬂight time, payload etc. The optimization routine will also calculate if the better choice is a quadcopter with four propellers, a hexacopter with six or an octocopter with eight propellers. The optimization is not trivial due to the non-linear characteristics of the propeller. A lot of experimental work was done to test the response of the propeller, both for acceleration and deceleration. Theory and experimental work show that the thrust response of the propeller can be more or less equal if the <b>electronic</b> <b>speed</b> <b>controller</b> controls the motor in a special mode. This mode also makes the response of the motor faster than normal. The new design is tested with a new approach for attitude estimation, and a controller operating directly with the result of the estimator.

Common aircraft utilize internal combustion engines (ICE) as main power source for the propulsion system. However, ICE imposes negative impact towards the environment due to the pollution produced through carbon emission, initiating green house effect, global warming, and health problems. Researchers have started to develop interest on the possibilities of using alternative energies to replace ICE aircraft propulsion system.

The objectives of this project are to design and to develop a fuel cell propulsion system that operates using a 500 W hydrogen PEM fuel cell as the main power generator for a UAV. The research is important to determine the capability of the propulsion system to power a custom designed and built 5 -meter wingspan UAV that acts as a technology demonstrator. The propulsion system was designed in two configurations, fuel cell and hybrid. The system consists of a fuel cell (main power supply), 2 -cell lithium poljmier battery (hybrid), <b>electronic</b> <b>speed</b> <b>controller,</b> a brushless direct current motor and a propeller. Mathematical model simulation is designed to predict the performance outcome from the system while experimental approach to validate the simulation is done through two different methods; ground-based static test in the lab and actual test flight at an outdoor location. The performance from the flight tests shows that both configurations were capable to produce sufficient power, thrust, and speed for the aircraft to fly successfully. The maximum power of 514. 49 W was achieved for the fuel cell system and 862. 45 W was achieved for the hybrid system. The maximum speed of the aircraft was 19. 4 meters per second with a maximum altitude achieved at 90 meters. The simulation and experimental comparison shows that the simulation result follows the same trend as the experimental; however some errors were identified showing slight inaccuracies between both results.

Software part comprised of real-time object detection and tracking algorithm for detecting and tracking of human beings that were done with the help of Matlab software. After achieving the stable flight, the camera installed on the quadcopter would transmit a video signal to the receiver placed on the ground station. Video signal from the receiver would then be transferred to Matlab software for further processing or for tracking human beings using real-time object detection and tracking algorith...|$|R
40|$|A {{design for}} a {{solid-state}} parasitic <b>speed</b> <b>controller</b> using digital logic was analyzed. Parasitic <b>speed</b> <b>controllers</b> are used in space power electrical generating systems to control the speed of turbine-driven alternators within specified limits. The analysis included the performance characteristics of the <b>speed</b> <b>controller</b> and the generation of timing functions. The <b>speed</b> <b>controller</b> using digital logic applies step loads to the alternator. The step loads conduct for a full half wave starting at either zero or 180 electrical degrees.

50|$|Fuel {{is pumped}} from an inline {{injection}} pump to the injection nozzles. The injection pump is a pump with a rotational <b>speed</b> <b>controller,</b> fuel filter and a pump clutch. Some engines have an injection timing device {{instead of the}} pump clutch. The rotational <b>speed</b> <b>controller</b> is either an all-speed controller or an idle <b>speed</b> <b>controller.</b> The <b>speed</b> <b>controllers</b> are driven by the camshaft of the injection pump. The idle <b>speed</b> <b>controller</b> does affect the idle and redline speed only, while the all-speed controller affects every rotation speed. For fuel filtering a paper filter is used.|$|R
