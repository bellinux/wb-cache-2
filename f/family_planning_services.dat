40|$|Introduction: In Pakistan, Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) among married female {{youth is}} 17. 4 % and even lower in rural and slum areas leading to rapid {{population}} growth {{on one hand and}} poor health consequences on the other. The study was conducted to explore <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> providers’ perceptions regarding use of different contraceptive methods and to identify factors that are influencing their use amongst currently married youth aged 18 - 24 years in slum areas of Karachi. Method: Qualitative exploratory study design was adopted and a total of ten in-depth interviews were conducted with <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> providers of the area. For content analysis coding of transcribed interviews was done and then categories were made and furthermore themes were derived. Results: Our findings revealed that <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> providers perceived that there is low use of contraceptive methods amongst youth of study area and low usage could be due to side effects; myths and misconceptions; lack of proper knowledge about different contraceptives; unmet needs of contraceptives; socio-cultural and religious factors about different contraceptive methods and <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> providers own biases against or for use of contraceptive methods amongst youth in the study area. However better education of youth and <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> providers’ improved knowledge about counseling and use of contraceptive methods was perceived to be associated with improved use of <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> methods amongst youth of the study area. Conclusion: Exaggerated side effects and socio-cultural factors could be important influences leading to low use of <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> methods amongst youth of Karachi. Some policy initiatives are the training of lady health Workers, lady health visitors, physicians and staff of the pharmacies for counseling youth in the correct use of <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> methods. </span...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: These days <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> is {{considered}} a fundamental principle in human life. This study aimed to investigate <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> providers knowledge about and attitude toward pregnancy prevention methods in shahrood in 2008. Methods: This research was a cross-sectional and applied one. In this study a questionnaire including 8 general items and 52 specialized ones was administered to service providers. The studied population (162 people) were all service providers working in health houses and urban and rural health centers in shahrood. The correlation between variables was calculated through Pearson correlation coefficient and the means of groups were compared through analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results have been show {{in the form of}} tables and diagrams. Results: 152 people the majority of whom (73. 7 %) were women participated in the study. 74. 3 % of participants had high school diploma and below degrees. 7. 9 % had associative and 2. 6 % had BS degrees in family health. 15. 1 % had BS degrees in midwifery. The Knowledge mean score was 17. 9 ± 2. 7 out of 25 which indicates average knowledge of service providers. The attitude mean score was 71 ± 10. 3 out of 108 that indicates the positive attitude of <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> providers. The results showed a significant relationship between knowledge and sex job level of education unit of service providing work experience and type of prevention used by the service providers (P= 0. 001). However there was no significant relationship between attitude and sex service unit and work experience. Conclusion: Noting the average knowledge and the positive attitudes of the <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> providers and noting the unreliable prevention methods about one-third of them use providing all ranks of service providers with educational classes about <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> seems to be a considerable help for planning and promotion of mothers health plans...|$|R

40|$|In 1965, a <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> {{was created}} in Geneva which aimed at {{spreading}} information on contraception. This article focuses on {{the attitude of the}} centre vis-à-vis the new contraceptive methods, especially the pill, and puts it in perspective with other voices, such as those of feminists.

The centre's pedagogical discourse about contraception focuses on stable couples and a rational attitude towards reproduction and <b>family</b> <b>planning.</b> It reflects the dominance of medical theories in the field of sexuality in Geneva during this period. The author suggests that the centre's approach to contraception contributed to the diffusion of a new contraceptive norm by combining contraceptive information with messages concerning the proper type of relationship, the state of mind and even the feelings with which contraception should be associated.

In addition, the years of the late 1960s and early 1970s saw a dramatic change in society's view of illegitimacy and in the legal rights of those born outside of wedlock. In response, family preservation efforts grew so that few children born out of wedlock today are adopted.

500|$|To {{optimise}} women's {{control over}} pregnancy, {{it is essential}} that culturally appropriate contraceptive advice and means are widely, easily, and affordably available to anyone that is sexually active, including adolescents. In {{many parts of the world}} access to contraception and <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> is very difficult or non existent and even in developed counties cultural and religious traditions can create barriers to access. Reported usage of adequate contraception by women has risen only slightly between 1990 and 2014, with considerable regional variability. Although global usage is around 55%, it may be as low as 25% in Africa. Worldwide 222 million women have no or limited access to contraception. Some caution is needed in interpreting available data, since contraceptive prevalence is often defined as [...] "the percentage of women currently using any method of contraception among all women of reproductive age (i.e., those aged 15 to 49 years, unless otherwise stated) who are married or in a union. The “in-union” group includes women living with their partner in the same household and who are not married according to the marriage laws or customs of a country."

40|$|Background Unsafe {{abortion}} imposes heavy {{burdens on}} both individuals and society, particularly in low-income countries, {{many of which}} have restrictive abortion laws. Providing <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> counseling and <b>services</b> to women following an abortion has emerged as a key strategy to address this issue. Study Design This systematic review gathered, appraised and synthesized recent research evidence on the effects of postabortion <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> counseling and <b>services</b> on women in low-income countries. Results Of the 2965 potentially relevant records that were identified and screened, 15 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. None provided evidence on the effectiveness of postabortion <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> counseling and <b>services</b> on maternal morbidity and mortality. One controlled study found that, compared to the group of nonbeneficiaries, women who received postabortion <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> counseling and <b>services</b> had significantly fewer unplanned pregnancies and fewer repeat abortions during the 12 -month follow-up period. All 15 studies examined contraception-related outcomes. In the seven studies which used a comparative design, there was greater acceptance and/or use of modern contraceptives in women who had received postabortion <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> counseling and <b>services</b> relative to the no-program group. Conclusions The current evidence on the use of postabortion <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> counseling and <b>services</b> in low-income countries {{to address the problem of}} unsafe abortion is inconclusive. Nevertheless, the increase in acceptance and/or use of contraceptives is encouraging and has the potential to be further explored.
