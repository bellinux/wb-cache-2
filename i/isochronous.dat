25|$|If these {{variations}} in the escapement's force cause changes in the pendulum's width of swing (amplitude), this will cause corresponding slight changes in the period, since (as discussed at top) a pendulum with a finite swing is not quite <b>isochronous.</b> Therefore, the goal of traditional escapement design is to apply the force with the proper profile, and at the correct point in the pendulum's cycle, so force variations {{have no effect on}} the pendulum's amplitude. This is called an <b>isochronous</b> escapement.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the Imbrium-related {{stratigraphy}} of Shoemaker and Hackman, that devised for Mercury is a rock {{rather than}} a time stratigraphy.

25|$|Another {{question}} is whether, {{if there was}} a perceptible beat, it was heard at regular intervals as in modern western music, or irregularly. Gratwick argues that the ictus was not <b>isochronous,</b> but that the timing depended on whether the anceps syllables were long or short. His view is that so far from attempting to make the word accent match the ictus, Roman writers often deliberately tried to avoid such coincidence, especially {{at the beginning and end}} of the line, to avoid monotony.|$|E
25|$|Audio packets– {{also known}} as <b>isochronous</b> data packets, these packets are sent out by all CobraNet devices after they receive a beat packet. At {{standard}} latency settings, one audio packet is sent for each beat packet received, and each audio packet includes 64 samples of audio data per channel. At lower latency settings, audio packets may be sent twice or four times for each beat packet received. Bundles do not share packets; separate packets are sent in sequence for each bundle transmitted from the same device.|$|E
25|$|The {{transverse}} de-focusing {{effect of}} this radial field gradient is compensated by ridges on the magnet faces which vary the field azimuthally as well. This allows particles to be accelerated continuously, on every period of the radio frequency (RF), rather than in bursts as in most other accelerator types. This principle that alternating field gradients have a net focusing effect is called strong focusing. It was obscurely known theoretically long before it was put into practice. Examples of <b>isochronous</b> cyclotrons abound; in fact almost all modern cyclotrons use azimuthally-varying fields. The TRIUMF cyclotron mentioned below is the largest with an outer orbit radius of 7.9metres, extracting protons at up to 510MeV, which is 3/4 {{of the speed of}} light. The PSI cyclotron reaches higher energy but is smaller because of using a higher magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|Huygens {{analyzed}} {{this problem}} by finding the curve down which a mass will slide {{under the influence of}} gravity in the same amount of time, regardless of its starting point; the so-called tautochrone problem. By geometrical methods which were an early use of calculus, he showed it to be a cycloid, rather than the circular arc of a pendulum's bob, and therefore that pendulums are not <b>isochronous.</b> He also solved a problem posed by Mersenne: how to calculate the period of a pendulum made of an arbitrarily shaped swinging rigid body. This involved discovering the center of oscillation and its reciprocal relationship with the pivot point. In the same work, he analysed the conical pendulum, consisting of a weight on a cord moving in a circle, using the concept of centrifugal force.|$|E

500|$|Galileo's {{theoretical}} and experimental {{work on the}} motions of bodies, along with the largely independent work of Kepler and René Descartes, was a precursor of the classical mechanics developed by Sir Isaac Newton. Galileo conducted several experiments with pendulums. It is popularly believed (thanks to the biography by Vincenzo Viviani) that these began by watching the swings of the bronze chandelier in the cathedral of Pisa, using his pulse as a timer. Later experiments are described in his Two New Sciences. Galileo claimed that a simple pendulum is <b>isochronous,</b> i.e. that its swings always take {{the same amount of}} time, independently of the amplitude. In fact, this is only approximately true, as was discovered by Christiaan Huygens. Galileo also found that the square of the period varies directly with the length of the pendulum. Galileo's son, Vincenzo, sketched a clock based on his father's theories in 1642. The clock was never built and, because of the large swings required by its verge escapement, would have been a poor timekeeper. (See Engineering above.) ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} to the synchrocyclotron is the <b>isochronous</b> cyclotron, which has a magnetic field that increases with radius, rather than with time. <b>Isochronous</b> cyclotrons are capable of producing much greater beam current than synchrocyclotrons, but require azimuthal variations in the field strength to provide a strong focusing effect and keep the particles captured in their spiral trajectory. For this reason, an <b>isochronous</b> cyclotron is also called an [...] "AVF (azimuthal varying field) cyclotron". This solution for focusing the particle beam was proposed by L. H. Thomas in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existing}} clock movement, {{the verge}} escapement, made pendulums swing in very wide arcs of about 100°. Huygens showed {{this was a}} source of inaccuracy, causing the period to vary with amplitude changes caused by small unavoidable variations in the clock's drive force. [...] To make its period <b>isochronous,</b> Huygens mounted cycloidal-shaped metal 'chops' next to the pivots in his clocks, that constrained the suspension cord and forced the pendulum to follow a cycloid arc. [...] This solution didn't prove as practical as simply limiting the pendulum's swing to small angles of a few degrees. The realization that only small swings were <b>isochronous</b> [...] motivated the development of the anchor escapement around 1670, which reduced the pendulum swing in clocks to 4°–6°.|$|E

They can be distinguished by whether the footfall rhythm is [...] "even" [...] or <b>isochronous,</b> four equal beats in a 1-2-3-4 rhythm; or non-isochronous, a slightly uneven 1-2, 3-4 rhythm created because the horse picks up and sets down its feet on each individual side slightly faster, creating a slight pause when switching to the opposite lateral pair of footfalls.|$|E
2500|$|In the nonrelativistic approximation, the {{frequency}} {{does not depend}} upon the radius of the particle's orbit, since the particle's mass is constant.

They are {{smoother}} for a rider than either a trot or a pace and most can be sustained for relatively {{long periods of time}}, making them particularly desirable for trail riding and other tasks where a rider must spend long periods of time in the saddle. There are two basic types: lateral, wherein the front and hind feet on the same side move in sequence, and diagonal, where the front and hind feet on opposite sides move in sequence. Ambling gaits are further distinguished by whether the [...] footfall rhythm is , four equal beats in a 1–2–3–4 rhythm; or a non <b>isochronous</b> 1–2, 3–4 rhythm created by a slight pause between the groundstrike of the forefoot of one side {{to the rear of the}} other.|$|E
2500|$|In 1673, 17 {{years after}} he invented the {{pendulum}} clock, Christiaan Huygens published his theory of the pendulum, Horologium Oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum. [...] Marin Mersenne and René Descartes had discovered around 1636 that the pendulum was not quite isochronous; its period increased somewhat with its amplitude. [...] Huygens analyzed this problem by determining what curve an object must follow to descend by gravity to the same point {{in the same time}} interval, regardless of starting point; the so-called tautochrone curve. By a complicated method that was an early use of calculus, he showed this curve was a cycloid, rather than the circular arc of a pendulum, confirming that the pendulum was not <b>isochronous</b> and Galileo's observation of isochronism was accurate only for small swings. [...] Huygens also solved {{the problem of how to}} calculate the period of an arbitrarily shaped pendulum (called a compound pendulum), discovering the center of oscillation, and its interchangeability with the pivot point.|$|E
2500|$|There is some {{controversy}} among scholars over whether Greek and Latin verse had a regular [...] "beat" [...] (ictus) like modern western music. On one side, supporting {{the idea of}} ictus, are scholars such as W. Sidney Allen, Lionel Pearson, and from an earlier generation Wallace Lindsay. [...] However, many scholars, such as Paul Maas, Italian Plautus expert Cesare Questa, and the Loeb edition editor Wolfgang de Melo argue {{that there was no}} beat or [...] "ictus"; in their view, rhythm is [...] "simply the regulated sequence of short and long syllables". Similarly, Benjamin Fortson writes: [...] "The theory that there was a verse-ictus, never universally accepted, has by now been thoroughly discredited." [...] Gratwick, in his edition of the Menaechmi, takes an intermediate position, rejecting [...] "both the Anglo-German view that the lines are <b>isochronous</b> with a regular metrical beat attached to every longum, and the Franco-Italian view that there is no ictus at all in such verses".|$|E
2500|$|The slow gait is {{a general}} term for several slower forms of the classic amble that follow the same general {{footfall}} pattern as the walk, in that lateral pairs of legs move forward in sequence, but the rhythm and collection of the movements are different. The common thread is that all are smooth gaits, comfortable to the rider. Terms for various slow gaits include the stepping pace and singlefoot. Some slow gaits are natural to some horses, while others are developed from the pace. [...] The stepping pace, sometimes itself called an [...] "amble," [...] is a slightly uneven lateral gait, with a non-isochronous 1-2, 3-4 sequence, while the singlefoot has an <b>isochronous,</b> even 1-2-3-4 rhythm. [...] The stepping pace is faster than a running walk and extremely smooth, but not as energy-efficient. It is a smooth gait at slower speeds, but when sped up can turn into a 2-beat pace. [...] The United States Equestrian Federation defines the slow gait as a restrained four-beat gait, [...] "derived from the pace" [...] and [...] "not a medium rack".|$|E
2500|$|The spiral {{path of the}} {{cyclotron}} beam {{can only}} [...] "sync up" [...] with klystron-type (constant frequency) voltage sources if the accelerated particles are approximately obeying Newton's laws of motion. If the particles become fast enough that relativistic effects become important, the beam becomes out of phase with the oscillating electric field, and cannot receive any additional acceleration. The classical cyclotron is therefore only capable of accelerating particles up to a few percent {{of the speed of}} light. To accommodate increased mass the magnetic field may be modified by appropriately shaping the pole pieces as in the <b>isochronous</b> cyclotrons, operating in a pulsed mode and changing the frequency applied to the dees as in the synchrocyclotrons, either of which is limited by the diminishing cost effectiveness of making larger machines. Cost limitations have been overcome by employing the more complex synchrotron or modern, klystron-driven linear accelerators, both of which have the advantage of scalability, offering more power within an improved cost structure as the machines are made larger.|$|E

On using a smaller positive wire for the same experiment, the glow first appeared on it, and then the brush, the negative brush being affected at the same time; and the two at one distance became exceedingly alike in appearance, and the sounds, I thought, were in unison; at all events they were in harmony, so that the intermissions of discharge were either <b>isochronous,</b> or a simple ratio existed between the intervals. With a higher action of the machine, the wires being retained unaltered, the negative surface became dark and silent, and a glow appeared on the positive one. A still higher action changed the latter into a spark. Finer positive wires gave other variations of these effects, the description of which I must not allow myself to go into here.|$|E
