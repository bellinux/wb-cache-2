500|$|In {{the first}} round of its series four heat, Razer progressed {{alongside}} Robochicken from a three-way battle in which Velocirippa was eliminated. In its next battle against Milly-Ann Bug, Razer methodically removed all of its opponent's wheels, rendering Milly-Ann Bug unable to move. In a post-battle interview with host Craig Charles, Blood likened this attack to [...] "pulling the legs off a spider". Early on in its heat final against Pussycat, Razer malfunctioned. Stuck in <b>forward</b> <b>drive,</b> it careered into the arena side wall with the rear wheels spinning but unable to steer. Pussycat severely damaged the back end and wheels of Razer, until Dead Metal of the house robots pitted the machine. Although Scott and Blood were gracious in defeat, Lewis turned his back on the fight, left the control booth immediately afterwards, and refused to be interviewed by Craig Charles. Lewis accused the Pussycat team of breaking a gentlemen's agreement that both teams would not seriously damage the other's machine. However, Team Pussycat were unaware that Razer was immobilised. Razer also took part in the Pinball Warrior and Sumo Basho side tournaments of series four; its performances were underwhelming in both events, scoring 95 points in the former having abandoned the run partway through to attack Sir Killalot, and lasting less than five seconds in the latter.|$|E
2500|$|While {{with the}} T.I. Group Dolphin invented and {{patented}} a 'Jumping apparatus' {{consisting of a}} tubular post with footrests supported by a spring on a post, mounted on a three-wheeled carriage. [...] The user would have to {{jump up and down}} to 'establish a <b>forward</b> <b>drive</b> to wheels through a free-wheel device'. More successful was his invention of an exercising machine [...] consisting of 'a flywheel rotatably mounted in fixed bearings, a winding spool fixed to rotate with the flywheel and a cable one end of which is connected to the core of the spool {{in such a way that}} on rotation of the flywheel with the cable fully unwound, the cable winds onto the spool in one or other direction depending on the direction of rotation of the flywheel.' From the patent it can be seen that this was the principle used for rowing machines and exercise equipment.|$|E

He would read the printed poem that very night, and before {{retiring}} to rest {{he would have}} Lorimer's verses complete and ready to be sent in for judgement to the examiner. But for the present he would dismiss the matter from his mind, and devote himself to polishing off the Charchester champions in the fifth and final test match. And in this he was successful, for just as the bell rang, summoning the players in to a well-earned tea, a sweet <b>forward</b> <b>drive</b> from his walking-stick crashed against the end wall, and Beckford had won the rubber.|$|E

60|$|If {{you are one}} of the team, {{and watch}} the match from the Pavilion, you escape these trials, but there are others. In the first few overs of a School match, every ball looks to the spectators like taking a wicket. The fiendish {{ingenuity}} of the slow bowler, and the lightning speed of the fast man at the other end, make one feel positively ill. When the first ten has gone up on the scoring-board matters begin to right themselves. Today ten went up quickly. The fast man's first ball was outside the off-stump and a half-volley, and Norris, whatever the state of his nerves at the time, never forgot his <b>forward</b> <b>drive.</b> Before the bowler had recovered his balance the ball was half-way to the ropes. The umpire waved a large hand towards the Pavilion. The bowler looked annoyed. And the School inside the form-rooms asked itself feverishly what had happened, and which side it was that was applauding.|$|E

50|$|The Tata Pixel {{is able to}} {{maneuver}} and park in tight spaces due to the zero turn toroidal traction-drive, Infinitely Variable Transmission (IVT), and due to its steering system design. This results in a turning circle radius of 2.6 meters. The steering and the transmission work together so that each wheel is driven independently with inputs from the steering system. By applying reverse drive on a single rear wheel and <b>forward</b> <b>drive</b> on a single front wheel, the car is able to turn almost in its own length.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the resistance against the machine and the cutters when operated at different <b>drive</b> <b>forward</b> and engine revolution speeds during planing, combinations of three different engine revolution speeds and three different <b>drive</b> <b>forward</b> speeds were tested on five specimens from each of the six different types of wood-based panels, for a total of 270 samples.

The strain values were determined by the power the engine used according to engine revolution speed and <b>drive</b> <b>forward</b> speed.

5000|$|Volvo Penta has {{introduced}} several industry-first innovations to the marine engine market, including the sterndrive unit, contra-rotating propellers Duoprop, and <b>Forward</b> <b>Drive.</b> In 2005, Volvo Penta launched the first IPS engine, a new [...] "pod type" [...] boat drive system with counter rotating forward-facing propellers {{operated by a}} joystick. Its engines are used by more than 140 boat manufacturers including Fairline Boats, Sunseeker, Riviera, Four Winns, and Cranchi. In conjunction with Volvo owned CPAC Systems, Volvo Penta and Yamaha Motor signed an agreement involving technological partnership in December 2010.|$|E
50|$|The {{drive unit}} transmits {{power from the}} inboard engine, {{generally}} mounted above the waterline, outboard through the transom and downward to the propellers below the waterline. The propellers lie about 27 inches further forward than the props of a Duoprop and move from an exposed position beyond the transom to underneath the hull, away from a surfer’s exposed appendages. This causes the thrust to be multi-directional rather than bi-directional. The exhaust exits under the water, keeping {{it away from the}} rider’s face. The engine can be trimmed up and down which equates to less wetted area. Learn more about the Volvo Penta <b>Forward</b> <b>Drive</b> in Power Boating magazine.|$|E
50|$|The proairetic code {{encompasses}} the actions or small sequences {{of the narrative}} (Annex 2) which creates narrative tension. By telling us that someone 'had been sleeping', we now anticipate them waking up, thus creating a small structure of narrative tension and expectation. Out of these units, the whole narrative has a <b>forward</b> <b>drive.</b> This notion is connected with Barthes' notion of the “readerly” text. The reader assimilates distinct pieces of information in a prescribed order. Even acts of psychological introspection in the novel are classified by the reader {{in terms of the}} occurrence of movements or activities. Thus, the proairetic code constitutes the text as a location with spatial and temporal dimensions through which the reader moves.|$|E
