5|$|In September, Kaitlyn was {{attacked}} by an unknown assailant prior to her championship match at Night of Champions. Upon her return, she announced her assailant had blonde hair, and Assistant SmackDown General Manager Eve Torres accused Phoenix before attacking her. On the September 28 episode of SmackDown, Phoenix was suspended by Torres, but the suspension was later reversed by SmackDown General manager Booker T. On the October 1 episode of Raw, Phoenix lost to Torres. Phoenix reverted to her villainous persona on the October 18 episode of Superstars, when she berated Kaitlyn <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> that Phoenix attacked her and demanded respect from Kaitlyn, before losing {{to her in a}} singles match. On the October 29 episode of Raw, Phoenix was defeated by AJ Lee in a singles match, but the match was restarted by Raw Managing Supervisor Vickie Guerrero, allowing Phoenix to win. After the match, in storyline, Guerrero fired Phoenix for her poor performance. In reality, Phoenix had given her notice to WWE in September and left the company for family reasons.|$|E
5|$|Schlosberg's contribution, is, in many ways, a {{response}} to challenges made to his Defining Environmental Justice (2007). Schlosberg aims to step beyond previous accounts of animal rights or environmentalism as requirements of justice by deploying a mixed capabilities/deliberation approach applicable to both ecosystems and nonhuman animals. Schlosberg challenges criticisms of his capabilities approach (specifically, a capabilities approach which moves beyond humans) grounded {{in the existence of}} conflicts of capabilities, claiming that a form of deliberative democracy can overcome the problem posed by these conflicts. His mixed account, he claims, provides a form of justice appropriate <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> about human and nonhuman individuals and collectives in the Anthropocene.|$|E
5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with {{a consideration of the}} purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E

25|$|This {{corollary}} {{is sometimes}} expressed {{by saying that}} second-order logic does not admit a complete proof theory. In this respect second-order logic with standard semantics differs from first-order logic; Quine (1970, pp.9091) pointed {{to the lack of}} a complete proof system as a reason <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> of second-order logic as not logic, properly speaking.|$|E

25|$|The black soldier became another stock type {{during the}} Civil War and merged {{qualities of the}} slave and the dandy. He was {{acknowledged}} for playing some role in the war, but he was more frequently lampooned for bumbling through his drills or <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> his uniform made him the equal of his white counterparts. He was usually better at retreating than fighting, and, like the dandy, he preferred partying to serious pursuits. Still, his introduction allowed for some return to themes of {{the breakup of the}} plantation family.|$|E
25|$|Into {{the later}} twentieth century, scholars' usual {{explanation}} {{for the lack of}} Celtic influence on English, supported by uncritical readings of the accounts of Gildas and Bede, was that Old English became dominant primarily because Germanic-speaking invaders killed, chased away, and/or enslaved the previous inhabitants of the areas that they settled. In recent decades, a few specialists have continued to support this interpretation, and Peter Schrijver has said that 'to a large extent, it is linguistics that is responsible <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> in terms of drastic scenarios' about demographic change in late Roman Britain.|$|E
25|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem in}} foreign aid is what some have called a 'neo-Newtonian' paradigm <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> and action. Development and humanitarian problems are frequently dealt with {{as if they}} are simple, linear, and best addressed through the application of 'best practices' developed in Western countries and then applied ad infinitum by aid agencies. This approach has come under sustained criticism in Ben Ramalingam's Aid on the Edge of Chaos. This work advocates that aid agencies should embrace the ideas and principles of complex adaptive systems research in order to improve how they think about and act on development problems.|$|E

40|$|Starting {{with the}} fact that school {{education}} has failed to become education <b>for</b> critical <b>thinking</b> and {{that one of the reasons}} for that could be in how education <b>for</b> critical <b>thinking</b> is conceptualised, this paper presents: (1) an analysis of the predominant approach to education <b>for</b> critical <b>thinking</b> through the implementation of special programs and methods, and (2) an attempt to establish different approaches to education <b>for</b> critical <b>thinking.</b> The overview and analysis of understanding education <b>for</b> developing critical <b>thinking</b> as the implementation of special programs reveal that it is perceived as a decontextualised activity, reduced to practicing individual intellectual skills. Foundations for a different approach, which could be characterised as the ‘education for critical competencies’, are found in ideas of critical pedagogy and open curriculum theory. This approach differs from the predominant approach in terms of how the nature and purpose of critical <b>thinking</b> and education <b>for</b> critical <b>thinking</b> are understood. In the approach of education for critical competencies, it is not sufficient to introduce special programs and methods for the development of critical thinking to the existing educational system. This approach emphasises the need to question and reconstruct the status, role, and power of pupils and teachers in the teaching process, but also in the process of curriculum development.

25|$|Wilson (September 1912) thought Haldane a fool <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> that Britain {{would have}} a time window of {{up to six months}} in which to deploy the BEF. In September 1912 he {{inspected}} Warsaw with Alfred Knox, British military attaché in Russia, then met Zhilinsky in St Petersburg, before visiting the battlefield of Borodino, and Kiev, then – in Austria-Hungary – Lemburg, Krakow and Vienna. Plans to visit Constantinople had to be shelved because of the First Balkan War, although Wilson recorded his concerns that the Bulgars had beaten the Turks a month after the declaration of war – evidence that the BEF must be committed to war at once, not within six months as Haldane hoped.|$|E
25|$|Lee did get one wicket, though, and Australia {{could have}} been forgiven <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> {{it was the most}} important. Pietersen pulled to Simon Katich for 71, off just 76 balls, and with the score on 342 for 7, England would have to get {{something}} extraordinary out of the tail to get past 400. But they did – Steve Harmison smacked two fours and a six in an entertaining, if brief, 17, and Simon Jones stuck around with Matthew Hoggard for a vital last-wicket partnership of 32, Jones making 19 not out. Shane Warne finally got the better of Hoggard, but England had made 407, in just under 80 overs. The Australian openers took to the field for the last half-hour of the day. However, heavy rain prevented another ball being bowled on the first day.|$|E

25|$|While Jolson was touring with a stage show during June 1927, {{production}} on The Jazz Singer {{began with the}} shooting of exterior scenes by the second unit. In late June, Alan Crosland headed to New York City to shoot the Lower East Side and Winter Garden exteriors on location. Jolson joined the production in mid-July (his contract specified July 11). Filming with Jolson began with his silent scenes; the more complex Vitaphone sequences were primarily done in late August. Both Jolson and Zanuck would later take credit <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> up the ad-libbed dialogue sequence between Jack and his mother; another story had it that Sam Warner was impressed by Jolson's brief ad-libbing in the cabaret scene and had Cohn {{come up with some}} lines on the spot.

25|$|In Soho, McLaughlin and the Vicar of St Anne's Father Gilbert Shaw founded, and McLaughlin directed, the Society of St Anne's, {{which was}} active between 1942 and 1958 and which {{promoted}} {{links between the}} Church {{and the world of}} literature. The society was begun late in 1942 when McLaughlin and Shaw asked the Bishop of London (Geoffrey Fisher, later Archbishop of Canterbury) for permission to use the St Anne's clergy house as a kind of mission centre <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> pagans. Fisher agreed, and Dorothy L. Sayers was asked to give the new society's first course of lectures, then T. S. Eliot the second. The location of St Anne's, near to the theatres, colleges and restaurants around Bloomsbury and also to the Inns of Court, was ideal for such an intellectual outreach programme, and the Society soon included C. S. Lewis, Agatha Christie, Father Max Petitpierre, Charles Williams, Arnold Bennett and Rose Macaulay, as well as T. S. Eliot and Dorothy L. Sayers, among its members. Others who contributed to it from time to time included John Betjeman, Iris Murdoch, Lord David Cecil, Rebecca West and Christopher Dawson.|$|E
