40|$|Abstract−The {{effects of}} flow rates {{of hot air}} and cooling water on drying {{percentage}} and energy efficiency of cotton lint in a cylindrical type drum tumbler dryer (0. 54 m-ID× 0. 34 m-high) have been determined. Drying of the lint is mainly affected by flow rate of hot air, which {{is a function of}} the diameter ratio (D M /D F) of motor and <b>fan</b> <b>pulley</b> and motor capacity. During the drying process in the tumbler dryer, temperatures and humidity before and after were measured to determine the drying characteristics. The volumetric flow rate of hot air increases with increasing the diameter ratio of the motor and <b>fan</b> <b>pulley,</b> whereas the volumetric flow rate of hot air decreases with an increase in the mass flow rate of the cooling water through the condenser. The energy consumed by the motor relied more on the diameter ratio of the motor and <b>fan</b> <b>pulley</b> as opposed to the mass flow rate of cooling water. Despite the increase in the drying per-centage with increasing the diameter ratio of the motor and <b>fan</b> <b>pulley</b> and the mass flow rate of the cooling water, the energy efficiency decreased...|$|E

40|$|Continuous Commissioning (CC) is a proven, highly {{cost-effective}} {{process that}} can improve building comfort and reduce energy consumption. This paper discusses the CC of three public schools in Austin, Texas. These schools include one high school and two elementary schools, one of which also includes a community center. Major CC measures implemented include resetting supply air temperature, duct static pressure, chilled and hot water loop ?P setpoints, condenser water temperature, and reheat water temperature; optimizing economizer operation and heat recovery unit operation; improving equipment scheduling and staging sequence; and adjusting terminal box air flow settings. Also included are some minor retrofits that convert a few constant volume units to variable air volume units and adjusting the <b>fan</b> <b>pulleys</b> for units that are oversized. Even though all three schools are well maintained, the CC project was able to achieve 10 - 14 % energy reduction, which amounts to an annual cost saving of $ 80, 000. With a total implementation cost of approximately $ 201, 800, the simple payback is about 2. 5 years...|$|R
5000|$|Earlier, {{on the way}} to lunch, Kane and Mason {{had seen}} Fry's name on an {{envelope}} he dropped. Kane remembers the address and travels to a ranch in the High Desert. The ranch owner, Charles Tobin (Otto Kruger), appears to be a well-respected citizen, but reveals that he is working with the saboteurs. Kane learns from a piece of mail he sees that Fry has gone to Soda City. Tobin has called the sheriff, but Kane escapes the police, taking refuge with a kind blind man (Vaughan Glaser) whose visiting niece, Patricia [...] "Pat" [...] Martin (Priscilla Lane), is a model famous for appearing on billboards. Although her uncle asks her to take Kane to the local blacksmith shop to have his handcuffs removed, she attempts {{to take him to the}} police. Kane insists he is innocent and kidnaps Martin. When he takes control of the car and stops, she jumps out and tries to signal a passing car to stop. He uses the <b>fan</b> belt <b>pulley</b> of her car's generator to break his handcuffs apart, causing the car to overheat and break down.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper mainly {{concerned}} with actual problems faced in mixed model assembly lines. For this the cycle time, takt time and production line balancing are mainly considered. Cycle time means the period {{required to complete}} one cycle of an operation; or to complete a function, job, or task from start to finish. And takt time is a adjustable time units in lean production to synchronize the rate of production with the rate of demand. Line balancing {{is the problem of}} assigning operations to workstations along the assembly line. These problems are take an account while considering the scheduling of any process. In mixed model assembly lines layout designing is a critical one, and also scheduling problem will occur. The scheduling problem occurs due to same layout is followed for all the products. In mixed model the products produced are having some similarities but {{the size and shape of}} the products are varied in many cases. Due to these variations the overall machining time for each product is differed from other products. To decrease the machining time and for the scheduling problems software’s are used. The products taken in account here is the <b>fan</b> <b>pulley</b> for air compressors and HP motors. 15 different types of products are taken here, but the process sequence is same for all the products. In this paper POM (Principles Of Operation Management) software is used for scheduling. Mainly thi...|$|E

Aluminium alloy pistons with steel connecting rods run in a cast chrome-iron block with sand-cast high-tensile light alloy heads and crankcase housing a short stiff dynamically balanced crankshaft carried on five bearings. The nose of the crankshaft carries a torsional vibration damper, a four-bladed <b>fan,</b> and the <b>pulley</b> for the triangulated thin belt drive for the dynamo and water pump. The dynamo is located between the cylinder blocks. At the rear the drive is taken {{from the back of the}} camshaft for the distributor positioned high above the unit behind the two semi-downdraught SU carburettors. There is a separate exhaust system for each bank of cylinders. Light alloy is used for the valve covers, tappet blocks, sump and inlet manifolds. Cooling is by pump and fan with a thermostatic by-pass control.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{when his}} brother Elmer {{had a stroke}} in 1917, he took more {{control of the company}} and became the general manager. He {{accepted}} an award for his brother from the Press Club of Indiana after they were honored for [...] "their achievement in building the first practically commercially successful American automobile". In 1918, Edgar Apperson started making a new model for the company's 25th anniversary, an automobile that would now have V-type <b>fan</b> belt and <b>pulley</b> and a gearshift above the steeering wheel instead of the floorboard. With Elmer's death in 1920 at an auto race in Los Angeles, Edgar was named president of the company and the company would ultimately become troubled in 1922 such as a new president, Don C. McCord, who would remove the name [...] "Apperson" [...] from the company and would lead Edgar Apperson to retire from the company a year later. His company would go bankrupt a year later in July 1926 while the new owners wanted to increase production. Apperson retired to Wisconsin until returning to Phoenix, Arizona where he would invest in farm lands of Salt River Valley until his death in 1959.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{increasing}} demand for light weight, high quality and more cost effective product has led adhesive bonding {{to emerge as}} one of the primary 60 ways of fastening structural members. East Adhesive joints have previously been designed empirically but now a day's data is available to design adhesive joints in West an optimum way. The fixing of cylindrical 40 components subjected to torque is a common requirement in industrial manufacture and {{there is a need to}} design and North optimize the adhesively bonded cylindrical 20 joint for maximum torque transmission capability facilitating keyless fastening. Some typical examples of adhesively bonded cylindrical joints are shaft to shaft, gear to shaft, rotor to shaft, <b>fan</b> to shaft, <b>pulley</b> to shaft etc. The present paper aims 0 at the development of analytical model for adhesively bonded cylindrical joint subjected to torsion loading for determination 1 st of Qtr the 2 nd joint Qtr profile 3 rd Qtr geometry 4 th Qtr for maximum torque transmission capability.

40|$|The book is {{organised}} in {{two main}} parts: Part I and Part II and into several chapters. The Part I includes two chapters. The first one, by the Editor, deals with basic theory, which is described following the historical steps by eminent scientists, from Herschel, to Nobili, Melloni, Stefan, Boltzmann, Planck and others. The radiation mechanisms {{with the most}} important parameters, which {{play a key role}} in acquisition and interpretation of thermal images are recalled and discussed. A section is devoted to detectors used for infrared technology. The main steps in detectors development following the technological progress are also drawn. The second chapter is by Roberto Rinaldi of the Infrared Training Center (ITC) by Flir Systems in Milan (Italy). This chapter is concerned with an overview of infrared imaging devices from the first prototype developed in 1958 to the multitude of models, which are today available. The historical evolution of the infrared technology is traced within the key features of each model. In particular, some basic characteristics and performance are described which may help the reader in the choice of the most appropriate device for the specific application. Part II is subdivided into four sections and many chapters. The first section regards applications to medicine (Chap. 1) and veterinary (Chap. 2). The study of the temperature of the human body has been associated with health as far back as the 1 st century BC, when Hypocrites, (the father of medicine), used the sense of touch to skin surface temperature anomalies and to determine the health of his patients. Still today, monitoring the body temperature variation, aides in both diagnosis and treatment planning. Chapter one was prepared by Boris G. Vainer of the Institute of Semiconductor Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This chapter reports on the IRT’s state of art in medicine with methodological approaches and a variety of applications such as in the diagnosis of breast cancer, in ophthalmologic surgery, in cardiovascular surgery, in the visualization of ischemic tissues and in many others. Chapter two presents application and use of infrared thermography in farm animals and veterinary medicine. This chapter was supplied by Petr Kunc and Ivana Knizkova of the Institute of Animal Science - University of Prague (The Czech Republic). The addressed areas include reproduction, thermoregulation, animal welfare and the milking process. The application of IRT to veterinary medicine is particularly useful to predict inflammation since, contrary to human beings, animals cannot reveal any symptom before the illness has become important. Section two includes a chapter on the use of Infrared thermography in foodstuff conservation by Klaus Gottschalk of the Leibniz-Institut für Agrartechnik Potsdam (Germany). It is shown the usefulness of IRT to control the conservation conditions of fruits and vegetables. The main advantage of using an infrared device lies in the possibility to control and improve the climate, which is essential in prolonging the shelf life of crops. Section three regards applications of IRT to industrial engineering. The first chapter, prepared by Giovanni M. Carlomagno of the Department of Aerospace Engineering - University of Naples Federico II (Italy), is an overview on IRT to thermo-fluid-dynamics. After recalling the first historical attempts in measuring heat transfer coefficients, this chapter describes the most useful heat flux sensors, supplies information about thermal restoration of data and shows several examples of convective heat transfer measurements in complex fluid flows, ranging from natural convection to hypersonic regime. The attention of chapter two is focused on the application of IRT to combustion. This contribution is by Christophe Allouis and Rocco Pagliara of the Combustion Institute CNR in Naples (Italy). It is demonstrated the usefulness of an infrared imaging system for understanding fluid-dynamics phenomena associated with combustion processes in turbine burners. The third chapter by Ralph A. Rotolante of Vicon Infrared in Boxborough, MA (USA) regards the use of IRT for nondestructive inspection purposes. The main pulse and lockin techniques are described with some application examples including also the inspection of real aircraft parts. Indeed, a remote imaging system offers many advantages over other methodologies since it is fast and two-dimensional with safeguard of the part integrity. Section four is concerned with the application of IRT in architecture and civil engineering. This is a relevant topic for infrared thermography applications after Building Regulation (2007) for Conservation of Fuel and Energy. A chapter by Ermanno Grinzato of CNR-ITC in Padua (Italy) reports some examples of structural analysis aided by IR thermography. In particular, it is stressed the impressive help, which is given to the comfort monitoring by the distributed temperature map measured by an infrared device. The attention goes also to the possibility, using a novel method, to “see” the environmental main quantities as air temperature, relative humidity and velocity, obtained from thermographic readings. Besides those herein described, an infrared imaging system can be advantageously used for many other applications. Infrared thermography is an excellent condition monitoring tool to assist in the reduction of maintenance costs on mechanical equipment. One of the biggest problems in mechanical systems is heat generated by friction, cooling degradation, material loss or blockages. The infrared technique allows for the monitoring of temperatures and thermal patterns, on a wide variety of equipments including pumps, motors, bearings, <b>pulleys,</b> <b>fans,</b> drives, conveyors etc, and while the equipment is online and running under full load. Information acquired from thermographic images enable a company to predict equipment failure and to plan corrective actions before a costly shutdown, equipment damage, or personal injury occurs. What it is more, the inspection can be performed far away from any dangerous condition without additional costs in terms of workers health care. However, it has to be pointed out that infrared thermography is still not completely exploited. It could be employed in a lot of other novel applications; it is only a matter of fantasy and skill...|$|R
