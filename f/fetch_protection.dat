40|$|Fine-grained {{hardware}} protection, {{if it can}} be {{done without}} slowing down the processor, could deliver significant benefits to software, enabling the implementation of strongly encapsulated light-weight objects. In this paper we introduce Legba, a new caching architecture that aims at supporting fine-grained memory protection and protected procedure calls without slowing down the processor's clock speed. This is achieved by separating translation from protection, which allows the use of virtually-addressed caches and moving the TLB off-core. Protection is implemented in two stages. We add protection information {{in the form of an}} object ID to each cache line. This object ID is combined with a per-protection context identifier, and the result is used to index into a protection cache, which delivers the access rights. As no range check is required on the protection cache, it can be set-associative, allowing it to be made large, fast and low-power, compared to a fully associative TLB. On a cache miss, the object ID is retrieved in parallel to the cache line <b>fetch,</b> performing the <b>protection</b> range check off-core. A new switch permission enables Legba to implement protected procedure calls, where the new context identifier is taken from the instruction cache liner's object ID. This mechanism is similar to call gates but more flexible. The paper compares Legba with approaches based on the idea of a protection look-aside buffer, in particular with respect to coverage...|$|R
40|$|Colonization by {{macrophyte}} and phytoplankton communities {{was recorded}} in the newly created freshwater wetland complex at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), The Wetlands Centre, London. To attract particular bird species and to increase overall invertebrate and vertebrate biodiversity it was originally planned to establish {{a number of different}} submerged aquatic macrophyte communities in the water bodies. Early planting schemes were abandoned due to extensive growths of filamentous macroalgae. 2. During 1997 and 1998 hypereutrophic conditions prevailed in the lagoons with peak concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) in excess of 1000 mg m− 3. Turbidity was high and dense algal crops and cyanobacterial blooms common, with chlorophyll a concentrations in excess of 40 mg m− 3. 3. In 1999, a ‘switch’ in state occurred in the Sheltered Lagoon from a turbid lake dominated by cyanobacteria and filamentous macroalgae in 1998, to a clear lake, dominated by the macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum L. with a mean biomass of 245 g dry weight m− 2; concentrations of TP remained high (> 200 mg m− 3). 4. Possible causes for the switch in the Sheltered Lagoon are considered. Reduction in TP was not considered to be sufficient to trigger a switch. The smaller size (1. 8 ha), with smaller <b>fetch</b> and greater <b>protection</b> from wind mixing may have reduced sediment suspension in the Sheltered Lagoon and, coupled with water level changes, may have created favourable light conditions for the establishment of M. spicatum. Implications for future design and management of the water bodies are considered...|$|R
