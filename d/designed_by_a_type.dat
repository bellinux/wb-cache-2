40|$|The Windows Vista {{operating}} system implements an interesting model of multi-level integrity. We observe {{that in this}} model, trusted code can be blamed for any information-flow attack; thus, {{it is possible to}} eliminate such attacks by static analysis of trusted code. We formalize this model <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> system that can efficiently enforce data-flow integrity on Windows Vista. Typechecking guarantees that objects whose contents are statically trusted never contain untrusted values, regardless of what untrusted code runs in the environment. Some of Windows Vista’s runtime access checks are necessary for soundness; others are redundant and can be optimized away...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a systematic {{description of a}} reusable software architecture for multi-agent systems {{in the domain of}} manufac-turing control. The architectural description consolidates the groups’ expertise in this area. Until now, the research took a manufacturing control perspective at multi-agent systems. The research focussed on providing benefits to the manufacturing control domain <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> novel <b>type</b> of control system. This paper takes a software architectural perspective at multi-agent manufacturing control. The systematic description specifies a software product line architecture for manufacturing control. The paper describes the assets of the software product line architecture and how the assets can be combined...|$|R

However, the proposed security requirements seem to be overly restrictive in some cases.

This does not seem justified in case the two pieces of information are totally unrelated. The aim of the present paper is to overcome this restriction, <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> discipline for <b>a</b> simple multiparty session calculus, which classifies messages according to their topics and allows unrestricted sequencing of messages on independent topics...|$|R

40|$|Continuations are {{programming}} abstractions {{that allow}} for manipulating the “future ” of a computation. Amongst their many applications, they enable implementing unstructured program flow through higher-order control operators such as callcc. In this paper we develop a Hoare-style logic for the verification of programs with higher-order control, {{in the presence of}} dynamic state. This is done <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> dependent <b>type</b> theory with first class callcc and abort operators, where pre- and postconditions of programs are tracked through types. Our operators are algebraic in the sense of Plotkin and Power, and Jaskelioff, to reduce the annotation burden and enable verification by symbolic evaluation. We illustrate working with the logic <b>by</b> verifying <b>a</b> number of characteristic examples. 1...|$|R
50|$|<b>Type</b> <b>design</b> is {{performed}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> designer. It is a craft, blending elements {{of art and}} science. In the pre-digital era it was primarily learned through apprenticeship and professional training within the industry. Since the mid-1990s {{it has become the}} subject of dedicated degree programs at a handful of universities, including the MA Typeface Design at the University of Reading (UK) and the Type Media program at the KABK (Royal Academy of Art in the Hague). At the same time, the transition to digital type and font editors which can be inexpensive (or even open source and free) has led to a great democratization of type design; the craft is accessible to anyone with the interest to pursue it, nevertheless, it may take a very long time for the serious artist to master.|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} a study {{developed}} {{in order to help}} a group of six limited- proficient students of English (newcomers) to improve their reading comprehension of English novels <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> storyboards, <b>a</b> <b>type</b> of graphic organizer that condenses both images and scripts. The investigation was carried out in a public school in the state of North Carolina, United States, and lasted eight weeks. The following instruments were implemented in order to measure the impact of this investigation: two pre-tests and two posttests, a teacher’s journal, students’ portfolios, and the results of a reading benchmark. Data were analyzed using cross tabulation and coding of the data collected. The results revealed that storyboards can {{have a positive impact on}} English language learners with limited language proficiency...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{problem of}} state-observation is {{addressed}} for nonlinear systems {{that can be}} modeled <b>by</b> <b>an</b> ODE-PDE series association. The ODE subsystem assumes a triangular structure while the PDE element is of heat diffusion type. The aim is to accurately estimate online the state vector of the ODE subsystem and the distributed state of the PDE element. One major difficulty {{is that the state}} observation must only rely on the global system output i. e. the PDE state at the terminal boundary. In particular, the connection point between the ODE and the PDE blocks is not accessible to measurements. The observation problem is dealt with <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> high-gain <b>type</b> observer. Sufficient conditions involving the PDE domain length are formally established that ensure the observer exponential convergence. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNovel H-bond donor {{copolymers}} were <b>designed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> versatile click <b>type</b> grafting {{reaction of}} unprotected mercaptoalcohols onto poly(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorostyrene) (PPFS). <b>As</b> demonstrated <b>by</b> 19 F NMR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses, the reaction {{appears to be}} chemoselective as the SH groups solely react onto the para-fluoro position of the PFS units. The nucleophilic substitution was successfully performed with two mercaptoalcohols bearing either one or two hydroxyl groups. By carefully selecting the experimental conditions, a library of copolymers with various degree of substitution up to 95 % was obtained in a reasonable timescale through kinetic control. By turbidity analysis, the ability of these functional polymers to form in solution interpolymer complexes with poly(4 -vinyl pyridine) was shown to be tunable by adjusting the molecular characteristics. FTIR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Differential scanning calorimetry evidence that different types of blends (immiscible, partially or totally miscible, and complex) can be achieved, and that {{the driving force of}} the interaction originates from H-bond...|$|R
40|$|The {{large volume}} of hyperspectral images (HSI) {{generated}} creates huge challenges for transmission and storage, making data compression more and more important. Compressive Sensing (CS) is an effective data compression technology that shows that when a signal is sparse in some basis, {{only a small number}} of measurements are needed for exact signal recovery. Distributed CS (DCS) takes advantage of both intra- and inter- signal correlations to reduce the number of measurements needed for multichannel-signal recovery. HSI can be observed by the DCS framework to reduce the volume of data significantly. The traditional method for estimating endmembers (spectral information) first recovers the images from the compressive HSI and then estimates endmembers via the recovered images. The recovery step takes considerable time and introduces errors into the estimation step. In this paper, we propose <b>a</b> novel method, <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> <b>type</b> of coherent measurement matrix, to estimate endmembers directly from the compressively observed HSI data via convex geometry (CG) approaches without recovering the images. Numerical simulations show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional method with better estimation speed and better (or comparable) accuracy in both noisy and noiseless cases...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{report the}} history, signalment, {{indication}} for pacing and epicardial lead placement complications and final outcome of 28 dogs and 5 cats in which permanent epicardial pacing leads were surgically placed {{at a single}} institution. Methods: Medical records of 28 dogs and 5 cats were retrospectively reviewed. Signalment, age, species, gender, clinical signs, presence of structural heart disease and/or congestive heart failure, ECG diagnosis, reason to select epicardial surgery, patient size (more or less than 14 kg), year of study period, and overall survival rate were recorded. Statistical correlations were made between those variables and rates of major and minor complications. Results: No statistical {{differences were found in}} the prevalence of major (life threatening or requiring replacement of the pacemaker system) and minor (self-limiting) complications with respect to the different variables listed above except for patient size. A significant difference in survival was found between animals that sustained major complications versus those that did not. Cox regression analysis showed that size of patient, occurrence of major complications and presence of structural heart disease negatively impacted survival rate. Clinical Relevance: The transdiaphragmatic approach may result in specific intraoperativeand short-term complications (lead dislodgment). The presence of structural heart disease at diagnosis and the occurrence of major complications are associated with a decreased survival rate. Patients weighing more than 14 kg experienced more major complications. Improvement of patient outcomes following epicardial lead placement could possibly be made <b>by</b> selecting <b>a</b> different surgical approach or <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> different <b>type</b> of epicardial lead for animals...|$|R
