50|$|In {{the middle}} Eocene {{formations}} of North America occurred the more specialized Uintatherium (or Dinoceras), typifying the family Uintatheriidae. Uintatheres were huge creatures with long narrow skulls, {{of which the}} elongated facial portion carried three pairs of bony horn-cores, probably covered with short horns in life, the hind-pair having been much the largest. The dental formula was i. 0/3, c. 1/1, p. 3/3·4, m. 3/3, the upper canines having been long sabre-like weapons, protected by a descending flange {{on each side of}} the lower <b>front</b> <b>jaw.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Nicholas R. Longrich and colleagues, the describers of Chenanisaurus, {{were able}} to {{establish}} some distinctive features. The lower jaw is high, while the dentary is bent in side view. The lateral groove and associated foramina are located high on the outer surface of the dentary. The anterodorsal margin of the dentary is curved downward. The symphysis of the lower jaws is heavily built while the leading edge is vertical in side view. The <b>front</b> <b>jaw</b> points are wide in plan view, encountering each other at an obtuse angle.|$|E
50|$|Crenidens crenidens has an oblong to ovoid shaped body {{which is}} {{slightly}} compressed. Smaller adults, less than 19.7 cm in length, show a nose like bump {{in front of}} the eye. The mouth extends back to the anterior nostril and there are three rows of teeth in each jaw, the upper <b>front</b> <b>jaw</b> has 8-9 brown-tipped incisor like teeth, each bearing five denticulations which give the edge of the teeth a wavy appearance. The inner rows have a few teeth of similar form but the other teeth are granular. The scales finely ctenoid, the scaly cheeks contrasting with the scaleless interorbital region. The dorsal fin has eleven each of spiny and soft rays, while the anal fin has three spiny and ten soft rays. The caudal fin is forked. There are 52-60 scales making up the lateral line.|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Structural and {{functional}} {{patterns in the}} evolution of the actinopterygian feeding mechanism are discussed in the context of the major monophyletic lineages of ray-finned fishes. A tripartite adductor mandibulae contained in a maxillary-palatoquad-rate chamber and a single mechanism of mandibular depression mediated by the obliquus inferioris, sternohyoideus, and hyoid apparatus are primitive features of the Actinopte-rygii. Halecostome fishes are characterized by having an additional mechanism of man-dibular depression, the levator operculi—opercular series coupling, and a maxilla which swings anteriorly during prey capture. These innovations provide the basis for feeding by inertial suction which is the dominant mode of prey capture throughout the haleco-stome radiation. A remarkably consistent kinematic profile occurs in all suction-feeding halecostomes. Teleost fishes possess a number of specializations in the <b>front</b> <b>jaws</b> including a geniohyoideus muscle, loss of the primitive suborbital adductor component, and a mobile premaxilla. Structural innovations in teleost pharyngeal jaws include fusion of the dermal tooth plates with endoskeletal gill arch elements, the occurrence of a pharyngeal retractor muscle, and a shift in the origin of the pharyngohyoideus. These specializations relate to increased functional versatility of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus as demonstrated by an electromyographic study of pharyngeal muscle activity in Esox and Ambloplites. The major feature of the evolution of the actinopterygian feeding mechanism is the increase in structural complexity in both the pharyngeal and <b>front</b> <b>jaws.</b> Structural diversification is a function of the number of independent biomechanical pathways governing movement...|$|R

25|$|Sauropod skulls {{are rarely}} preserved, and {{scientists}} {{have yet to}} discover a Barosaurus skull. Related diplodocids like Apatosaurus and Diplodocus had long, low skulls with peg-like teeth confined to the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaws.</b>|$|R
50|$|The holotype, ROM 1790, {{was found}} in a layer of the lower Dinosaur Park Formation, dating to the late Campanian. It {{consists}} of a partial skeleton, including the snout, the <b>front</b> lower <b>jaws,</b> the last back vertebra, six sacral vertebrae, sixteen front tail vertebrae {{that may or may not}} have formed a natural series, the complete pelvis, and the hindlimbs (minus the right toes). Many of the bones are damaged and compressed. It is part of the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum.|$|R
25|$|Scansoriopteryx is also {{notable for}} its wide, rounded jaws. The lower jaw {{contained}} at least twelve teeth, larger in the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaws</b> {{than in the}} back. The lower jaw bones may have been fused together, a feature otherwise known only in the oviraptorosaurs.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} nocturnal. They prey upon {{a wide variety}} of rodents, lizards, amphibians, and {{sometimes}} birds and insects- an unusual variety for a small elapid. These snakes are venomous, and, like all elapids, inject their venom swiftly through fangs placed in the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaw.</b>|$|R
50|$|The jaw of Magnuviator is {{long and}} slender, and the Meckelian canal is open. On the jaw, there are 22 to 24 closely spaced {{columnar}} teeth. They are pleurodont, meaning that they extend out from the interior side of the jawbone, they are roughly equal in height, {{and they do not}} have V-shaped wear facets. At the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaw,</b> the teeth have a single cusp (monocuspid); further back, the teeth gain an additional cusp at the back (bicuspid), then an additional one at the front (tricuspid). The splenial bone uniquely reaches forward to about 2/3 the length of the tooth row. On the splenial, the anterior inferior alveolar foramen is also located partially on the dentary, and is uniquely located behind and above the anterior mylohyoid foramen. Meanwhile, the angular bone bears a process in <b>front</b> of the <b>jaw</b> joint.|$|R
50|$|According to Dong e.a. the Chungkingosaurus jiangbeiensis holotype {{was one of}} the {{smallest}} stegosaurs with a length of less than four metres (about thirteen feet), even though it was apparently an adult, judging by the ossification of the sacrum. Chungkingosaurus sp. 1 was estimated at five metres; Chungkingosaurus sp. 2 was seen as longer than five metres. Dong e.a. indicated that Chungkingosaurus strongly resembled Tuojiangosaurus, found in the same formation, in many anatomical details. Chungkingosaurus was different in its smaller size, deeper snout and <b>front</b> lower <b>jaws</b> (resulting in a relatively high and narrow skull), and non-overlapping teeth with less pronounced denticles.|$|R
50|$|The maxillary central incisor {{is a human}} tooth in the <b>front</b> upper <b>jaw,</b> or maxilla, and {{is usually}} the most visible of all teeth in the mouth. It is located mesial (closer to the midline of the face) to the maxillary lateral incisor. As with all incisors, their {{function}} is for shearing or cutting food during mastication (chewing). There is typically a single cusp on each tooth, called an incisal ridge or incisal edge. Formation of these teeth begins at 14 weeks in utero for the deciduous (baby) set and 3-4 months of age for the permanent set.|$|R

50|$|The dentitions of lizards {{reflect their}} {{wide range of}} diets, {{including}} carnivorous, insectivorous, omnivorous, herbivorous, nectivorous, and molluscivorous. Species typically have uniform teeth suited to their diet, but several species have variable teeth, such as cutting teeth in the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaws</b> and crushing teeth in the rear. Most species are pleurodont, though agamids and chameleons are acrodont.|$|R
50|$|The {{design that}} is {{considered}} one of the most important characteristics of mammals is a three-cusped shape called a tribosphenic molar. This molar design has two important features: the trigonid, or shearing end, and the talonid, or crushing heel. In modern tribosphenic molars, the trigonid is towards the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaw</b> and the talonid towards the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Lycodon aulicus {{feeds on}} lizards and frogs. According to Günther (1864) {{it is one}} of the most {{formidable}} enemies of the skinks, which form almost its sole food, the [...] "fangs" [...] in the <b>front</b> of its <b>jaws</b> being admirably adapted for piercing and making good its hold on the hard smooth scales with which those lizards are coated.|$|R
50|$|In taxonomy, {{shark teeth}} are counted as follows: rows of teeth are counted {{along the line}} of the jaw, while series of teeth are counted from the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaw</b> inward. A single tooth row {{includes}} one or more functional teeth at the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaw,</b> and multiple replacement teeth behind this. For example, the jaws of a bull shark can have 50 rows of teeth in 7 series, with the outermost series functional, but most sharks have 5 series with the average shark having about 15 rows of teeth in each jaw. The small teeth at the symphysis, where the two halves of the jaw meet, are usually counted separately from the main teeth on either side. Sharks are also known to lose at least one tooth per week. Due to their specific arrangement of rows and series however, lost teeth can be replaced within a day.|$|R
50|$|Brasileodactylus was {{a medium}} sized {{pterosaur}} with a wingspan of approximately 4 m. It {{had a long}} pointed snout and conical teeth that in the extreme <b>front</b> of the <b>jaws</b> were long, thin and forward pointing. Unlike some other Brazilian pterosaurs it had no crest on the snout or lower jaw but might have had one {{on the back of}} the skull.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, other extinct fish, such as Onychodontiformes, have {{analogous}} tooth-whorls at the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaw,</b> {{suggesting that}} such whorls {{are not as}} big of an impediment to swimming as suggested in Purdy's hypothesis. While no complete skulls of Helicoprion have been officially described, the fact that related species of chondrichthyids had long, pointed snouts suggests that Helicoprion did, as well.|$|R
50|$|Like other theropods in the Dromaeosauridae, Saurornitholestes had a long, curving, blade-like claw on {{the second}} toe. Saurornitholestes was more long-legged and lightly built than other dromaeosaurids such as Velociraptor and Dromaeosaurus. It resembles Velociraptor in having large, fanglike teeth in the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaws.</b> Saurornitholestes most closely resembles Velociraptor, {{although}} the precise relationships of the Dromaeosauridae are still relatively poorly understood.|$|R
50|$|The dentary is very elongate, {{and has a}} long toothless portion (the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaw,</b> {{including}} the end where the predentary would have been attached) that is bent steeply downward and inward, which {{would have given the}} jaw a spoon-like shape when complete. It is comparable in size, although on the small side and with unusual proportions (see above), compared to dentaries from other hadrosaurids.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of teeth at the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaw</b> {{suggests that this}} may have been a relatively primitive nodosaur, since most later forms had a toothless beak instead. In addition to the usual rounded and polygonal osteoderms, Silvisaurus may have also sported bony spines on its shoulders and tail. The head contained large air passages, which may have been used for loud vocalisations, presumably for communication.|$|R
50|$|The jaws of Paraplacodus {{were adapted}} to eat shellfish, with {{three pairs of}} {{protruding}} teeth in the top row and two rows of protruding teeth in the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaw,</b> with rounded crushing teeth in {{the upper and lower}} jaws. Thick ribs formed a box-like ribcage with an almost-square cross-section, which enabled Paraplacodus to remain close to the seabed while hunting for food.|$|R
50|$|The {{teeth of}} Bathygnathus are long, recurved, and distinctively {{teardrop}}-shaped, being widest {{at the middle}} rather than the base. The teardrop shape of the teeth {{is an indication that}} Bathygnathus belongs to the family Sphenacodontidae. The shape of the maxilla indicates that Bathygnathus had a deep skull like those of other advanced sphenacodontids like Dimetrodon. Like Dimetrodon, Bathygnathus has an enlarged caniniform tooth near the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaw.</b>|$|R
50|$|The dentary of Jianianhualong bore 21 {{teeth on}} each side, while the dentary bore 25 on each side. Like other troodontids, the teeth are {{strongly}} recurved and unevenly distributed. The teeth at the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaws</b> are closely packed, {{while they are}} smaller and more spaced out {{at the back of}} the jaws. Characteristic of troodontids, the teeth are short-crowned, with height-to-width ratios decreasing from 1.5 (first tooth) to 1.2 (sixth tooth) along the jaw; the same ratio is 2.6 in Microraptor. The teeth near the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaw</b> (e.g. the first maxillary tooth) lack serrations, while teeth further back have serrations on their back edges. These serrations are fine, as in Sinovenator, instead of robust as in derived troodontids. Similar to contemporary troodontids, the last maxillary tooth is located near the back end of the jugal branch of the maxilla, which is much further back than most coelurosaurs. Unusually, unlike the maxillary teeth, the first several teeth in the dentary appear to be angled forwards. This condition is present in several contemporary dromaeosaurids.|$|R
30|$|Mouth terminal, {{small and}} oblique, forming an angle of about 40 ° to 60 ° to {{horizontal}} {{axis of the}} head and body; maxilla not reaching vertical at the anterior margin of orbit, upper jaw length 3.4 (3.2 to 3.6) in HL; teeth biserial, at least at the <b>front</b> of <b>jaws,</b> consisting of the outer row of larger incisiform to conical teeth and slender buttress teeth behind and in the spaces between the outer row teeth, 38 (35 to 40) in the outer row of upper jaw and 36 (34 to 39) in the outer row of lower jaw. Tongue triangular with rounded tip, papillose on dorsal surface. Gill rakers long and slender, the longest on the lower limb near angle about equal to or slightly shorter than the length of the longest gill filaments.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{distinct}} ridge on the front margin of the parietal bone, wedged between the frontal bones; the shaft of the lacrimal bone, which is located {{in front of the}} eye socket, is wide, flattened, and plate-like seen from the side; the foramen magnum (a hole {{in the back of the}} skull) is smaller than the occipital condyle (the boss forming the skull-neck joint); there is no ridge on the bottom of the <b>front</b> lower <b>jaws,</b> which is also not strongly downturned; and the xiphoid process does not flare out from the sternum behind the ribs. Other characteristics of the skull separate Tongtianlong from its contemporaries; for instance, the nostril is situated much higher than the antorbital fenestra, a trait seen otherwise only in Nemegtomaia and Rinchenia.|$|R
25|$|The procument {{front teeth}} of Masiakasaurus were likely an {{adaptation}} for grasping small prey. They {{would have been}} unsuitable for tearing larger food apart. In the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaws,</b> carinae are restricted {{to the base of}} the teeth and would not have been used to tear prey. The back teeth, however, share the same general characteristics as those of most other theropods, suggesting that they served a similar function in Masiakasaurus such as cutting and slicing.|$|R
50|$|Patagosuchus is an extinct genus of peirosaurid crocodyliform {{known from}} the early Late Cretaceous Portezuelo Formation of Neuquén Province, western central Argentina. It {{contains}} a single species, Patagosuchus anielensis. It is distinguished from other peirosaurids by its extremely heterodont dentition, which includes small serrated teeth at the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaws</b> with much larger, laterally compressed caniniform teeth behind them. Patagosuchus also has large spaces between its teeth called interalveolar spaces that are not found in any other peirosaurid.|$|R

50|$|Stoplight loosejaws {{are small}} fish found {{worldwide}} {{in the deep}} sea. Relative to their size they {{have one of the}} widest gapes of any fish. The lower jaw has no ethmoid membrane (floor) and is attached only by the hinge and a modified tongue bone. There are several large, fang-like teeth in the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaws,</b> followed by many small barbed teeth. There are several groups of pharyngeal teeth that serve to direct food down the esophagus.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{browsing}} and grazing animals, {{they do not}} use the incisors at the <b>front</b> of the <b>jaw</b> for slicing off leaves and grass; rather, they use the molar teeth {{at the side of}} the jaw.

A diastema occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth. The dental formula for hyraxes is [...]|$|R
5|$|Grasshoppers {{have the}} typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. The head is held {{vertically}} {{at an angle}} to the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, and a pair of thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in <b>front</b> of the <b>jaws.</b>|$|R
