The magnificence of the One is the center and source of the Universe and all that is. God is life, joy, love, and peace and, in all that we are, we demonstrate these qualities as the ideas of God. Today we think, believe in, and know the wisdom and intelligence of what we do and how we do it. We demonstrate this Highest Power in all that we think, in all the ways that we express, and how we experience who we are. As we share our ideas, knowing that we do this {{in the best interest of}} the people we serve, the people who call Nevada home, we do it as ideas of God. We are the demonstration of this Highest Power and Presence that express, in, of, and as each of us in all that we do and all that we are. For this I am so <b>grateful,</b> <b>knowing</b> that each step we take this day, and the days ahead, we are doing so with wisdom, intelligence, and love. And so it is, AMEN.

The companions find a man's corpse, {{as well as one}} of a stickie (a vicious breed of mutant), and further {{evidence}} of stickie activity. Sometime later they encounter three people searching for their friend, who they identify as the corpse. Saddened, but <b>grateful</b> for <b>knowing</b> their friend's fate, the young people invite the companions back to their ville, Quindley.|$|R

And when baby Angela had clasped her fat hands, and, as 'youngest at the board,' 'inclined the head and pronounced the solemn word,' her father added, 'Gratias Deo, and Grazie a lei. We must renew our childhood's training, dear Mary--make our bow and curtesy, and say [...] "Thank you for our good dinner."' ...|$|R

Most of all I would I like to think my wife for her support, love, and patience while pursuing a master degree. I am truly grateful to have such great officemates Andrew, Will, and Baiyuan, for their help and guidance while pursing my degree at the University of Texas. I {{would like to}} especially like to thank Andrew for all his help with Landmark, GMT, Matlab, and any other software that we had the opportunity to learn. I am <b>grateful</b> for <b>knowing</b> and learning from two posts docs Maria and Gang in our UT Geofluids Consortium.

I {{would also like to thank}} Tessa Green for all your help and getting me onto Peter’s extremely busy schedule and organizing our annual meetings and travel arrangements. Thanks to my advisor, Dr. Peter Flemings, for supervising my thesis project. I am truly blessed and fortunate to have been advised by such an intelligent and passionate scientist. Peter has truly pushed me as a scientist further than I can imagine. I stil...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} {{of my book}} can be introduced by quoting some examples {{of the way it}} presents itself in everyday situations: we sometimes feel <b>grateful</b> without <b>knowing</b> whom we could be grateful to. In such situations in which we cannot thank someone for what (s) he gave us, this feeling of gratefulness makes us (or at least those who can’t or don’t want to address this feeling to a God) feel embarrassed: we feel a gratefulness which we cannot assent to; we relativize a feeling that nevertheless imposes itself upon us. I want to suggest a diagnosis for that embarrassment (2), find out what concept of gratefulness has contributed to it (3), and ask the question whether we can think of gratefulness in a way that allows us to feel grateful in such cases as indicated, even after what Nietzsche called ‘the death of God’ (3 - 6). For a diagnosis of the problem I rely on what Nietzsche writes on the history (and the future) of nihilism. The God that died is the one who is so strongly interwoven with all domains of our culture and our way of thinking, and doing that his death will torn us apart between the ideas and the ideals without which we cannot live anymore, and the criticism of these very same ideals to which our truthfulness compels us. The embarrassment I pointed at in the first section could very well be one appearance of this ‘nihilistic condition’, which Nietzsche calls our ‘terrifying Either/Or’ (GS 346). An overview of the history of philosophical thinking about gratitude from Aristotle to Nietzsche may show how gratitude came to be conceived of as a special form of reciprocity that recompenses for a gift received. Our feelings and experiences (e. g. our feeling of gratefulness) are codetermined by the way we conceptualize them. It is the task of philosophy to ‘save the phenomena’, which implies breaking through prevalent interpretations and conceptualizations. In a second itinerary through the history of philosophical thinking about gratitude, we may discover thus far undisclosed and unsuspected possibilities for an alternative conceptualization of gratitude. Some results of this second itinerary can be summarized by referring to the iconography of the three Graces. There being three (and not just two) graces reminds us of the importance of ‘receiving’ as the condition of possibility for both ‘giving’ and ‘thanking’. The unity and the movement of the three graces (their round dance) suggest that the different roles are not separated or distributed in a fixed way. Gratefulness is the expression of being part of a community and a tradition. The ‘identity’ of the three ladies (Aglaia, Euphrosyne and Thalia) suggests the concurrence of giving, receiving and thanking. By conclusion I indicate how this conception of gratefulness could be interpreted as an Aristotelian virtue (the best realization of our capacity to receive, a mean between an attitude of appropriation and one of neglect) and I refer once again to Nietzsche who does also make a distinction between two concepts of gratitude, one being a kind of revenge, the other being a creative affirmation of reality as it is. Nothing prevents the religious believer to address this alternative gratitude to God, {{but it will be a}} God who does not compel one to be grateful, but who can be discovered by gratitude...|$|R
