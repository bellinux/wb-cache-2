500|$|In July 2011, Horsfield {{stepped down}} as {{assistant}} manager to concentrate on his coaching qualifications, remaining at Port Vale as a coach. Later in the month he scored in a friendly against Stone Dominoes, but dismissed speculation {{that he would make}} a return to the playing side of the game. In December 2011, loan striker Guy Madjo celebrated his first goal for the club by running over to Horsfield on the touchline, [...] "to say thank you for all the finishing (practice) that we have been doing. He has shown me {{a lot of things that}} I haven't done in the past. In seven years, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> many places, to so many clubs and I haven't done that with anyone else, so I just feel it was a good dedication for him." [...] Horsfield retired completely from football in May 2012 to pursue business interests.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain's {{fall from}} power left him deeply depressed; he wrote, [...] "Few men can have known such a {{reversal}} of fortune in so short a time." [...] He especially regretted the loss of Chequers as [...] "a place where <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> happy", though after a farewell visit there by the Chamberlains on 19 June, he wrote [...] "I am content now that I have done that, and shall put Chequers out of my mind." [...] As Lord President he assumed vast responsibilities over domestic issues and chaired the War Cabinet during Churchill's many absences. Attlee later remembered him as [...] "free {{from any of the}} rancour he might have felt against us. He worked very hard and well: a good chairman, a good committeeman, always very businesslike". As chairman of the Lord President's Committee, he exerted great influence over the wartime economy. When Axis feelers for peace reached the War Cabinet on 26 May 1940, with the Low Countries conquered and France tottering, Halifax urged following up and seeing if the actual offer was worthwhile. The battle over the course of action within the War Cabinet lasted three days, and Chamberlain's statement on the final day that there was unlikely to be an acceptable offer and that the feelers should not be pursued at that time helped persuade the War Cabinet to reject negotiations.|$|E
500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E
6000|$|... "No, mother; because I didn't {{like to tell}} 'ee <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> far. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> picking black-hearts, {{and went}} further than I meant." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much {{astonished}} already, that I only felt {{a kind of}} resigned {{wonder when}} Mr. Littimer walked forth, reading a good book! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> busy feeling {{saved from}} the {{scaffold}} that I didn't {{get on to}} {{it for a moment}} that an early reply was desired.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>HAVE</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> innerly proud, and so long alone, Do {{not leave}} me, or I shall break. Do not leave me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Eugene, Eugene, Eugene,' replied Mortimer, still {{pacing the}} room, 'I am sorry for this. And {{to think that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> blind!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{from that}} miserable Alexis! Oh, I know I brought it on myself, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> wretched and so ashamed all day.' ...|$|E
60|$|My {{state of}} mind {{regarding}} the pilfering from which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but <b>I</b> hope it <b>had</b> some dregs of good {{at the bottom of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not then}} know it <b>was</b> Miss Mordaunt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> {{fortunate}} as to serve; {{but here is}} Mr. Newcome at your elbow, Follock, and dying to be introduced, as he sees <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I disliked you--but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{come to the}} {{conclusion}} it was just the contrary. In reality I was in love with you. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> from the first time I saw you--when I made that sketch of you at Siena." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had Shadrach, our boy, with me. He carried it. It is {{not from}} me, exactly; though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> glad to come with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I humbly {{beg your}} pardon," [...] he said quietly, [...] "And must crave your kind indulgence for my mood: but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> anxious ..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> silly!" [...] she confessed. [...] "There {{were times}} when I couldn't believe that you were my Everard--mine! And now I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{cried the}} king, his love shining in his eyes, [...] "how could I {{for an instant}} doubt her! And yet <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> shaken by the others! Francoise is as true as steel. Was it not a {{beautiful}} letter, Louvois?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My Jock, I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> sorry! I wish it {{were not}} too late. <b>I</b> could not <b>have</b> let you give up so much," [...] and she fondled his head. [...] "I did not think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> weak as to let you see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay--I must be {{a bloody}} spectacle," [...] said Mr. Touchwood, letting himself fall heavily upon his assistant's shoulder, and wiping his face, which trickled with wet--"I did not think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> seriously hurt; but I find my {{weakness}} now--I must have lost much blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|At last Tom said, [...] "Oh, {{where have}} you been all this while? I have been looking for you so long, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> lonely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] {{returned}} the Queen, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> busy since your arrival that I {{have not had}} a chance to awaken them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must take}} the place of my own dear little granddaughter," [...] said Aunt Esther. [...] "She died six years ago, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> lonely since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dresses ARE nice. I love pretty things. I {{remember}} the first pretty dress I ever had--the brown gloria Matthew gave me for our school concert. Before that everything <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> ugly. It {{seemed to me that}} I stepped into a new world that night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Delighted! Enchanted! And our dear Miss Summerson. She is {{not quite}} prostrated by fatigue?" [...] Here he would crease up his eyelids and kiss his fingers to me, though I am happy to say he <b>had</b> ceased to <b>be</b> {{particular}} in his attentions since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> altered.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much excited {{during the}} scenes through which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just passed, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much stimulated by grog, that, as yet, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not felt {{much of the}} {{depression}} natural to such events. I even slept soundly that night, nor did I turn out until six the next morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "And what if I do? What if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> silly as {{to allow}} your perfections {{to be too}} many for my weak heart? What then, Captain Broughton?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wicked or not, it is true. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> wretched that I {{have not}} {{known how to}} hold myself. I could not bring myself to write to Florence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{come from}} Brittany," [...] Rupert said; [...] "but I learnt {{to speak the}} Paris dialect there, and have almost {{forgotten}} my own, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> long away." ...|$|E
5000|$|Leon Wessels: [...] "I am {{now more}} {{convinced}} {{than ever that}} apartheid was a terrible mistake that blighted our land. South Africans did not listen to the laughing and the crying of each other. I <b>am</b> sorry that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> hard of hearing for so long".|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Harry, {{you don't}} {{mean to say}} so," [...] I cried, for I was West Indian enough in my {{feelings}} {{to have a certain}} innate horror of coloured blood, and I was really shocked to think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> imprudent as to dance four times with a brown man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Talking of girls," [...] said Mrs. Reeves impatiently, [...] "I am almost discouraged. It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> {{hard to get}} a good all-round one. The {{last one}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> saucy <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to {{discharge}} her, and the one <b>I</b> <b>have</b> now cannot make decent bread. <b>I</b> never <b>had</b> good luck with bread myself either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Traddles,' said I, 'I am {{delighted to}} see you at last, and very sorry I have not been at home before. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much engaged--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know I am mad, my dear Mrs. Vavasour; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> a long time: but Snowdon ponies are {{in their}} sober senses,--and I shall take one of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I shall walk, Craig. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much upset to-day that the {{exercise}} will do me good. I {{will have the}} light coat from my bedroom." ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Corny was disconsolate, {{and cried}} bitterly. I think I heard her mother call back to her, but I {{am not sure}} about it. There <b>was</b> <b>so</b> much to see and hear. And yet <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> busy with what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{had to do that}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen {{comparatively}} little {{of what was going on}} around me.|$|R
60|$|I took {{occasion}} to plead, in like manner, the associations of early life, for my disappointment {{in respect to}} the surrounding scenery. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> accustomed to hills crowned with forests, and streams breaking {{their way through a}} wilderness of trees, that all my ideas of romantic landscape were apt to be well wooded.|$|R
60|$|I was surprised, not at {{the sight}} of so many thieves only, but at the {{circumstances}} I was in; being now to thrust myself in among so many people, who for some weeks <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> shy of myself, that, if I met anybody in the street, I would cross the way from them.|$|R
