40|$|The process {{streams in}} the forest {{industry}} contain {{a large amount of}} hemicelluloses that today ends up in the wastewater. This is an unfortunate loss of a renewable raw material. The hemicelluloses can be isolated from the process stream by using membrane filtration in a process that produces purified water as a by-product, thereby facilitating increased recirculation. However, process streams from the forest industry contain both aromatic compounds and inorganic ions that are known to cause <b>fouling</b> <b>of</b> the membranes. Thus, the most suitable membrane and pretreatment from a cost-efficient point of view must be applied to avoid fouling and life-time shortening of the membranes during operation. In the present investigation, <b>fouling</b> during ultrafiltration <b>of</b> a process stream from the production of Masonite was studied. The <b>fouling</b> <b>of</b> a hydrophilic membrane made of regenerated cellulose was less severe than the <b>fouling</b> <b>of</b> hydrophobic membranes made of polyether sulphone and a composite fluoropolymer.

In this study multi-photon microscopy, a fluorescence-based technique is used to 3 -D image in situ the <b>fouling</b> <b>of</b> microfiltration membranes by suspensions containing combinations of washed yeast, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and ovalbumin. Appropriate fluorescent labelling allows the three foulant species to be clearly identified. Images correlate well with filtration data and clearly show the cake of yeast cells capturing protein aggregates. The proteins exhibited very different filtration behaviour. When filtering washed yeast together with ovalbumin and/or a 50 : 50 mixture by mass of BSA and ovalbumin, the ovalbumin fouling dominates the system. Capture of aggregates by the cake did not reduce <b>fouling</b> <b>of</b> the membrane by the protein and increased {{the resistance of the}} cake.

40|$|Water level {{regulation}} {{related to}} hydroelectric power production and flood prevention {{is an important}} hydro-morphological pressure on many watercourses around the world. <b>Fouling</b> <b>of</b> fishing nets in autumn during the open water period and in winter under the ice is a common phenomenon in large Finnish lakes where the water level is regulated. This <b>fouling</b> <b>of</b> fishing nets can sometimes be so extensive that fishing has to be stopped. Based on the practical experiences of fishermen, the main cause for the under-ice fouling has been proposed to be the winter draw-down of water causing low water level and stronger currents in lakes, but no conclusive relationship between fouling and water level regulation has yet been demonstrated. Here we show, using long-term winter data from a boreal lake and short-term netting experiments, that <b>fouling</b> <b>of</b> fishing nets results from increased water draw-down during winter (January–March). Our results also show that <b>fouling</b> <b>of</b> fishing nets takes place only if the high water flow rates are accompanied by an intensive lowering of the water level. We also discuss the relevance of our results to other regulated lakes with ice cover...|$|R
