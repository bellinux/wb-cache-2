40|$|SYNOPSIS. Physiological phenotypes are {{the result}} of the coordinated {{function}} of many genes, some of which may be differentiated between conspecific populations. Within any one population, natural selection will favor evolution of a coadapted set of alleles which optimizes physiological performance and reproductive success. The existence of such coadapted gene complexes may be assessed by assaying phe-notypes of interpopulation hybrids: inferior performance of hybrids suggests that the allelic combinations present in the parental populations are coadapted. This approach has been used to examine the genetic architecture of physiological traits in the copepod Tigriopus californicus, a species characterized by sharp genetic differentiation of populations. Developmental time and response to osmotic stress both show pronounced F 2 hybrid breakdown, a result consistent with <b>genetic</b> <b>co-adaptation</b> within populations. To better understand the biochemical and molec-ular mechanisms underlying hybrid breakdown, we are investigating a specific biochemical phenotype, the activity of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (COX). COX (encoded by multiple nuclear and mitochondrial genes) catalyzes the oxida...|$|E
40|$|Publicaci√≥n ISITo {{explore the}} {{evolution}} of higher order behavioral traits we investigated the organization of foraging patterns in first instar larvae of natural populations of Drosophila. We examined Drosophila simulans (cosmopolitan); D. mauritania (widespread); D. pavani, and D. gaucha (endemic). Larvae of these four species share the same behavior components that comprise foraging (locomotion, feeding, bending, and turning). D. simulans and D. mauritania larvae show uncoupled foraging patterns organized into partially independent behavioral elements. Larvae of D. pavani and D. gaucha exhibit coupled foraging behaviors based on a dependency between behavioral components. Hybrid larvae obtained from crosses of natural populations of D. simulans and D. mauritania show an organization of foraging patterns {{similar to that of}} the parental lines. In contrast, hybridization disrupts the organization of foraging patterns in D. pavani and D. gaucha intra- and inter-specific hybrid larvae. This suggests <b>genetic</b> <b>co-adaptation</b> for linkage between the behavioral components that comprise foraging. The organization of larval foraging patterns of the endemic species D. pavani seems readily affected by hybridization. The absence of linkage between behavioral components, as in the case of larval foraging patterns of D. simulans and D. mauritania could lead to an increase in the variability of organization of this higher order behavior. The possibility that larvae may use a variable and flexible behavioral integration of foraging patterns could contribute to their development and feeding in a diversity of substrates and climates...|$|E
