40|$|In this study, {{surviving}} {{percent and}} growing of seedlings planted with their tubes of Black pine [Pinus nigra Arnold. ssp. pallasiana (Lamb. Holmboe.) ], Taurus cedar (Cedrus libani A. Rich), Crimean juniper (Juniperus excelsa Bieb.) were evaluated {{in the areas}} prepared with different soil cultivation methods for afforestation studies in arid areas. For this aim, afforestation area in Karaman disrict was selected. In the experiment, 12 treatments for land preparation by using different equipments were applied. In parcels applied these treatments, seedlings of the species were planted as tubed only cutting their 1 cm partial of bottom. The experiment was established in completely randomized plot design with three replications, 20 seedlings for each one. At {{the end of the}} second vegetation period survival rate, seedling height, growth of the terminal shoot in the last year and bottom diameter of the seedlings were measured. According to results of data analysing, minimum survival rate was 38. 89 % (Balck pine), maximum was 88. 89 % (Crimean juniper). The treatments made top soil tillage combined disc harrows and <b>gradoni</b> terrace applications more successful than the other treatments for all seedling characteristics and surviving percentages. In addition the treatments, double riper + <b>gradoni</b> terrace and triple ripper + <b>gradoni</b> terrace, which had better performance can suggest for soil preparetaion in arid area. Because these treatments are more practicable and cheap than the others...|$|E
40|$|Leishmaniasis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} infectious diseases worldwide. Currently, 12 million people in 88 (mostly develo- ping) countries are infected with 2 million new infections per year. 60. 000 annual deaths result from leishmaniasis. A vacci- ne does not exist at present and some treatment options are expensive and can cause major side effects (Scott et al., Immunol. Rev. 2004, 201 : 318 - 338). The disease is caused by an obligate intracellular parasite inoculated into the skin by the bite of a sand fly. Humans as well as small animals and dogs are natural reservoirs for the parasite. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a li- fe threatening disease characterized by uncontrolled parasitisation of spleen, liver, and bone marrow. The mechanisms under- lying the failure to control the growth and systemic spread of leishmania parasites in VL are not well understood. While the absence of antigen-specific Th 1 responses in PBMC from VL patients is thought to be casually related to disease progression, the finding that these patients also express elevated IFNgamma mRNA in lesional tissue, as well as elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggests that their immunologic defect cannot be simply explained by immune tolerance or Th 2 polarization. As a possible homeostatic mechanism to control persistent infection-induced inflammation, elevated levels of regulatory cytokines IL- 10 have repeatedly been reported in clinical studies of VL (Nylén and Sacks, Trends in Immunol. 2007, 28 : 378 - 384). VL, caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum, is a sand fly-borne disease found in the Me- diterranean area, Asia, and Latin America. In most of this range, the domestic dog is the main reservoir host (Gramiccia and <b>Gradoni,</b> Int. J. Parasitol. 2005, 35 : 1169 - 1180; Dantas-Torres F., Vet. Parasitol. 2007, 149 : 139 - 146). Dogs may suffer from a severe disease characterized by chronic evolution of viscero-cutaneous signs, which occurs in fewer than 50...|$|E
