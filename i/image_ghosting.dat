40|$|A common {{artefact}} of time-sequential stereoscopic {{video displays}} {{is the presence}} of some <b>image</b> <b>ghosting</b> or crosstalk between the two eye views. In general this happens because of imperfect shuttering of the Liquid Crystal Shutter (LCS) glasses used, and the afterglow of one image into another due to phosphor persistence. This paper describes a project that has measured and quantified these sources of <b>image</b> <b>ghosting</b> and developed a mathematical model of stereoscopic <b>image</b> <b>ghosting.</b> The primary parameters which have been measured for use in the model are: the spectral response of the red, green and blue phosphors {{for a wide range of}} monitors, the phosphor decay rate of same, and the transmission response of a wide range of LCS glasses. The model compares reasonably well with perceived <b>image</b> <b>ghosting.</b> This paper aims to provide the reader with an improved understanding of the mechanisms of stereoscopic <b>image</b> <b>ghosting</b> and to provide guidance in reducing <b>image</b> <b>ghosting</b> in time-sequential stereoscopic displays...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE Accurate {{knowledge}} about the positions of electrodes in electroencephalography (EEG) {{is very important for}} precise source localizations. Direct detection of electrodes from magnetic resonance (MR) images is particularly interesting, as it is possible to avoid errors of co-registration between electrode and head coordinate systems. In this study, we propose an automated MR-based method for electrode detection and labeling, particularly tailored to high-density montages. APPROACH Anatomical MR images were processed to create an electrode-enhanced image in individual space. Image processing included intensity non-uniformity correction, background noise and goggles artifact removal. Next, we defined a search volume around the head where electrode positions were detected. Electrodes were identified as local maxima in the search volume and registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard space using an affine transformation. This allowed the matching of the detected points with the specific EEG montage template, as well as their labeling. Matching and labeling were performed by the coherent point drift method. Our method was assessed on 8 MR images collected in subjects wearing a 256 -channel EEG net, using the displacement with respect to manually selected electrodes as performance metric. MAIN RESULTS Average displacement achieved by our method was significantly lower compared to alternative techniques, such as the photogrammetry technique. The maximum displacement was for more than 99 % of the electrodes lower than 1 cm, which is typically considered an acceptable upper limit for errors in electrode positioning. Our method showed robustness and reliability, even in suboptimal conditions, such {{as in the case of}} net rotation, imprecisely gathered wires, electrode detachment from the head, and MR <b>image</b> <b>ghosting.</b> SIGNIFICANCE We showed that our method provides objective, repeatable and precise estimates of EEG electrode coordinates. We hope our work will contribute to a more widespread use of high-density EEG as a brain-imaging tool...|$|E

In a previous paper (Applied Optics, Vol. 50, Issue 15, pp. 2305 - 2315 (2011)), modeling <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> was performed using a sequential ray tracing technique. Synthesizing ray paths into ghost and nominal paths and performing sequential ray tracing provides a powerful tool for describing <b>ghost</b> <b>image</b> formation in optical systems.

40|$|Flow {{artifacts}} in MR images can appear as <b>image</b> <b>ghosts</b> {{within and outside}} the body cavity. Technical improvements aimed at suppressing these <b>image</b> <b>ghosts</b> often rely on expert scoring (1, 2) or on semi-automated methods demanding tissue segmentation and estimation of statistical properties of intensity distribution (3) to evaluate the efficacy of the methods. These approaches can be labor intensive, introduce observer bias, computationally demanding, and error-prone if tissue segmentation is used. Herein we propose two fully automated image-processing methods that rely on the statistical properties of background (noise) pixels to assess the presence of flow artifacts (appearing as <b>image</b> <b>ghosts)</b> without requiring tissue segmentation. The first method rapidly evaluates the presence of flow {{artifacts in}} a global fashion, while the second one provides a more detailed characterization of the artifacts. We evaluate the proposed methods in the setting of cardiac phase-resolved myocardial blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI where different cine SSFP imaging strategies are proposed for overcoming flow artifacts. Finally we assess the utility of our automated approaches against expert scoring results...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this study, a new {{approach}} is proposed for accurate target identification, required by the phased array radar systems that are employed in through-the-wall imaging applications. In radar imaging, {{the effects of the}} multipath propagation are materialised in fake impressions of the true target, known as <b>ghost</b> <b>images.</b> The developed algorithm removes these ambiguities related to the existence of a target by cancelling, in the final radar <b>image,</b> the <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> by means of improving the global signal-to-spurious-ratio (SSR) and the target-to-ghost-ratio (TGR) that characterise the real target signature. The development of the approach is based on beamforming and on coherent signal processing upon the returned signal and clutters, for a phased array monostatic radar system. The performances of the algorithm are measured in terms of both the global SSR gain and the TGR and they are verified through simulations and measurements in scenarios that quantify the robustness of the approach. The obtained numerical results concerning the global SSR gain and the TGR certify that the proposed method improves the target localisation and removes the <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> for radars that operate in rich scattering environments. In the end, the limitations of the approach are also presented...|$|R
