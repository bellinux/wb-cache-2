5|$|Handley {{served as}} coach for two mediocre seasons (1991–92), {{in which the}} Giants went from Super Bowl champions to a 6–10 record. He was fired {{following}} the 1992 season and replaced by former Denver Broncos coach <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves.</b> In the early 1990s, Simms and Taylor played out {{the last years of}} their career with steadily declining production. In 1993, however, the Giants experienced a resurgent season with Reeves at the helm, and Simms and Taylor ended their careers as members of a winning team.|$|E
5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves,</b> the successful former {{head coach of the}} Denver Broncos who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in four years, one against the Giants. After his dismissal from the Broncos, Reeves took the unusual step of lobbying heavily for the job. Especially after being publicly rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was pleased that someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job, and Reeves was hired as Giants head coach. He had been a finalist along with Perkins for the team's head coaching position in 1979, but Young went with Perkins at the time because he felt he knew him better from their days together with the Baltimore Colts.|$|E
5|$|Youngblood {{played in}} 201 {{consecutive}} games, a Rams team record; he only missed one game in his 14-year NFL career. He was the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the recipient <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> award three times, which is {{awarded to the}} team's most valuable player. He had 151.5 career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmer's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities {{to make sure the}} opponent's running game was handled. His highest single-season sack total was 18 in 1979.|$|E
5|$|McBride {{developed}} {{a passion for}} football attending games at Notre Dame, where his son went to college. In the early 1940s he tried to buy the NFL's Cleveland Rams, owned by millionaire supermarket heir <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves,</b> but was rebuffed. Having been awarded the Cleveland franchise in the AAFC, McBride asked Cleveland Plain Dealer sportswriter John Dietrich for head coaching suggestions. Dietrich recommended Paul Brown, the 36-year-old Ohio State Buckeyes coach. After consulting with Ward, McBride followed Dietrich's advice in early 1945, naming Brown head coach and giving him an ownership stake in the team and full control over player personnel. Brown, who had built an impressive record as coach of a Massillon, Ohio high school team and brought the Buckeyes their first national championship, {{at the time was}} serving in the U.S. Navy and coached the football team at Great Lakes Naval Station near Chicago.|$|E
5|$|McBride {{was a fan}} {{of boxing}} and baseball, but knew little about football. He only grew {{interested}} in the sport in 1940, when his son Arthur Jr. was a student the University of Notre Dame and he attended Notre Dame Fighting Irish football games in South Bend, Indiana. He was drawn by the excitement that surrounded football and thought a professional team could be profitable. In 1942, McBride made overtures to supermarket heir <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> about buying his Cleveland Rams, a National Football League team, but Reeves rebuffed him. In 1944, however, Chicago Tribune sports editor Arch Ward proposed a new professional league called the All-America Football Conference. McBride, who knew Ward from his days in the newspaper business, eagerly signed on {{as the owner of}} the eight-team circuit's Cleveland franchise.|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles Rams, a {{professional}} American football team based in Los Angeles, joined the National Football League (NFL) as Cleveland Rams in 1937. The Rams began playing in 1936 as a charter {{member of the}} second American Football League. Although the NFL granted membership to the same owner, the NFL considers it a separate entity. In 1946, Rams' owner <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves,</b> fed up with poor attendance at Cleveland Stadium, moved the Rams to Los Angeles, and the team played there from 1946 to 1979. Before his death in 1979, later Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom planned a move within the Los Angeles metropolitan area to Anaheim, using the venue now known as Angel Stadium, and his widow and successor Georgia Frontiere went through with the move in 1980, with the team still officially representing Los Angeles. The Rams moved to St. Louis in 1995 and renamed the team St. Louis Rams. In January 2016, the Rams and the NFL announced that the team would return to Los Angeles. The team now plays in its original L.A. venue, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, while awaiting the 2020 opening of its new stadium in suburban Inglewood.|$|E
5|$|For the 1979 season, Youngblood had {{a career-high}} 18 sacks {{and was a}} {{consensus}} first-team All-Pro for the fifth time. He was voted to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl. In 1980, he was second-team All-Pro and first-team All-NFC while leading the Rams with 11½ sacks. In 1981, Youngblood led the Rams with 12½ sacks and was the Rams outstanding defensive lineman. In the off-season, prior to the 1981 season, Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot-dog sized blood clot from under his left arm. It {{was a result of}} repeated trauma to a nerve in his arm that blocked the flow of blood. Despite the broken leg and numerous other injuries, Youngblood played in 201 consecutive games, a Rams team record; and only missed one game in his 14-year NFL career. He played in seven straight Pro Bowls, five NFC Championships, and one Super Bowl. He was also the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> award 3 times, which is awarded to the team's MVP. He had 151½ career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant Coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in Defensive Coordinator Fritz Shurmur's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities to make sure the opponent's running game was handled.|$|E
5|$|Tolliver was {{slated to}} compete with Tommy Maddox for the backup quarterback spot at Atlanta as {{training}} camp rolled around. Halfway through August, Maddox was released, and Tolliver was made the primary backup behind Chris Chandler. Tolliver played his first NFL game since 1994 on September 7, 1997 against the Carolina Panthers. He completed 7 of 17 passes for 79 yards. After relieving Chandler again the following week, Tolliver was slated to start the next game against the 49ers, in what became his only starting appearance of the season. He was slated to start again against the Denver Broncos, but instead came in late in the game. He was almost able to lead the Falcons to a comeback victory over the Broncos, completing six of nine passes for 85 yards and a touchdown, but he instead lost to the then-undefeated Broncos as the team remained winless. When Chandler went down with an injury in late October, coach <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> chose to start Tony Graziani. Shortly afterwards, Tolliver was released by the Falcons. In early November, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac was lost for the season due to a broken collarbone. As a result, the Chiefs signed Tolliver to a two-year contract as the third-string quarterback to replace him. Tolliver finished the season having completed 64 passes in 116 attempts for 677 yards, five touchdowns, and one interception. Only one of the 116 attempts came as a Kansas City quarterback. The 1998 preseason began with Tolliver competing with Pat Barnes for the third-string quarterback job, but this ended when Tolliver was released by the Chiefs in August.|$|E

25|$|The {{defending}} Super Bowl champion Broncos {{entered the}} game with an AFC-best 14–2 regular season record. The Falcons, under former Denver head coach <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves,</b> were making their first Super Bowl appearance after also posting a 14–2 regular season record.|$|E
25|$|However, {{under new}} coach <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> the Bronco defense rebounded in 1981, ranking 6th in total defense and 9th in fewest points allowed as Broncos {{finished}} {{the season with}} a record of 10-6. Randy had one of his best seasons as he was consensus All-Pro and All-AFC as well as being voted to the Pro Bowl.|$|E
25|$|Stydahar {{began the}} 1952 {{season as the}} Rams' head coach. After losing to the Cleveland Browns in the season opener, dissension between Stydahar and his backfield coach Hampton Pool became public. On September 30, Stydahar reached an {{agreement}} with Rams owner <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> under which Stydahar resigned and was paid him $11,900 to buy out his contract, and Pool was promoted as the new head coach.|$|E
25|$|In June 1941, the Rams {{were bought}} by <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> and Fred Levy Jr. Reeves, an heir to his family's grocery-chain {{business}} {{that had been}} purchased by Safeway, used some of his inheritance to buy {{his share of the}} team. Levy's family owned the Levy Brothers department store chain in Kentucky and he also came to own the Riverside International Raceway. Levy owned part of the Rams, with Bob Hope another of the owners, until Reeves bought out his partners in 1962.|$|E
25|$|With Ron Rivera {{having been}} a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX, and Kubiak {{replacing}} Elway {{at the end of}} the Broncos' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV, this was the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves; coincidentally, the coaches they had played under, Mike Ditka (Rivera) and <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> (Kubiak), not only had Super Bowl playing experience themselves, but had done so as teammates with the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowls V and VI (and worked together as Cowboys assistant coaches for Super Bowls X, XII and XIII).|$|E
25|$|However, the Falcons' {{fortunes}} {{began to}} improve after <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> became their {{head coach in}} 1997. During Reeves' first season with Atlanta, they finished the season 6–2, after starting out 1–7, to compile a 7–9 record overall. Reeves was Denver's head coach from 1981 to 1992, leading the Elway-led Broncos to Super Bowls XXI, XXII, and XXIV. But they lost each one, including a 55–10 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV. After that, Reeves was in constant conflict with his coaching staff {{and some of his}} players for the next three years. He left Denver in 1993 and spent four seasons as the head coach of the New York Giants before joining the Falcons.|$|E
25|$|In March 1960, Hirsch {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} {{to serve as the}} general manager of the Los Angeles Rams; he replaced Pete Rozelle as the Rams' general manager after Rozelle was hired as NFL commissioner. The Rams began the 1960s in the lower tier of the NFL, compiling a losing record each year from 1959 to 1965. As general manager, {{he was in charge of}} scouting, the college draft, and negotiating player and coach contracts. During his tenure as general manager, the team drafted numerous talented players, including quarterback Roman Gabriel (first round pick in 1961), Deacon Jones (14th round pick in 1961), and Merlin Olsen (first round pick in 1962), player who helped the Rams improve to 11–1–2 in 1967 and 10–3–1 in 1968. In 1963, after <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> acquired outright ownership of the Rams, Hirsch's title was changed to assistant to the president. He continued to serve as Reeves' assistant through the 1968 season.|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks later}} in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been hell. I know I {{would not have been}} back here if <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> had been here. It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and I got tired of working with him." [...] Reeves responded by saying, [...] "Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me either. One of these days I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." [...] During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an {{assistant}} coach on the team, and these points of contention became a media storyline entering the game. Nonetheless, all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed.|$|E
500|$|In 1948, Shaughnessy {{joined the}} Los Angeles Rams as a [...] "technical advisor" [...] to head coach Bob Snyder. In the preseason, owner <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> was so {{impressed}} with Shaughnessy that Reeves promoted him to head coach and fired Snyder. At Los Angeles, Shaughnessy developed the pro set that used a three wide receiver set. He made this change to capitalize on running back Elroy [...] "Crazy Legs" [...] Hirsch, who he thought would make a better flanker. Los Angeles captured the Western Conference Championship in 1949.|$|E
500|$|After a {{successful}} 1993 season, the Giants struggled under head coach <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves,</b> {{and failed to}} reach the playoffs for three consecutive seasons. With the hiring of Jim Fassel as the team's new head coach in 1997, the Giants fortunes improved and they made the playoffs several times. Led by free agent acquisition quarterback Kerry Collins, the Fassel era included an appearance in Super Bowl XXXV, where they lost to the Baltimore Ravens. Although there was success, the Fassel era was also marked by inconsistency, and he was fired after the 2003 season.|$|E
500|$|The 2000 {{season was}} {{considered}} a make-or-break season for Fassel. Like his predecessor, <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves,</b> Fassel had enjoyed great success in his first year, but disappointment in the following two seasons. The conventional wisdom was that the Giants needed {{to have a strong}} year for Fassel to retain his job. The Giants' big draft acquisition was running back Ron Dayne, Heisman Trophy winner from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Before the draft the team was debating whether to select Dayne or Shaun Alexander. The plan for Dayne was that the power running style he had at Wisconsin would complement Barber's speed and pass-catching ability. The two were dubbed [...] "Thunder and Lightning".|$|E
500|$|In 1995 and 1996, under <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> the Giants had losing {{seasons and}} {{relied heavily on}} Rodney Hampton who {{received}} {{the bulk of the}} carries on rushing plays. In 1995, running back Herschel Walker received more passing downs and in 1996 fullback Charles Way was a main weapon. Wheatley returned kickoffs for the 1995 and 1996, with 10returns for 18.6yards per return in 1995 and 23returns for 21.9yards per return in 1996. [...] While Hampton led the team in rushing with 827yards to Wheatley's 400yards in 1996, Wheatley's 503return yards and 51yards receiving gave him the team all-purpose yards leadership. [...] However, Wheatley had 6fumbles on only 147touches (112rushes, 12receptions, and 23kickoff returns).|$|E
500|$|Elmer Layden was {{appointed}} the first NFL commissioner in 1941, but Ward appeared as dictating his hiring. Layden tendered his resignation {{for personal reasons}} January 1946. Bell, who was not well respected in Pittsburgh, was elected to replace him. He received a three-year contract at $20,000 ($) per year, and transacted a sale of his stake in the Steelers to Rooney, albeit for a price Bell did not construe was full-value. He was then immediately placed {{at the center of}} a controversy wherein the owners denied <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> permission to relocate the Cleveland Rams to Los Angeles. Bell moderated a settlement, and, as a result, the Los Angeles Rams were formed. As a precondition to the Rams leasing the Los Angeles Coliseum, they signed Kenny Washington, which marked the beginning of the end of racial segregation on the field, but also caused [...] "'all hell to break loose'" [...] amidst the owners.|$|E
500|$|Falcons coach <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> {{was praised}} {{for his ability}} to lead the team after having heart surgery only weeks prior, as Reeves' {{comeback}} proved to be an emotional rallying point for the team. Austin Murphy of Sports Illustrated noted that Reeves' return [...] " [...] the already close-knit Falcons," [...] and Falcons linebacker Jessie Tuggle agreed: [...] "Dan has really inspired us all. [...] He walked in the meeting room four days after having had surgery, and you could have heard a pin drop. We wanted to hear every last word he had to say." [...] Reeves described his time during the season as [...] "more rewarding than any other teams I've been involved in," [...] and to Falcons special teams coach Joe DeCamillis, Reeves' leadership that season was [...] "his best coaching job ever." [...] CBS called Reeves' return [...] "an amazing comeback that people will be talking about for years." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1998 {{season was}} not {{expected}} to be any different, as the Falcons had failed to reach the playoffs the previous two seasons and only made the playoffs twice in the previous fifteen seasons. However, head coach <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves,</b> who was hired before the previous season, had overhauled the roster in an attempt to reverse the team's fortunes. Thirty-eight of the fifty-three players on the 1998 Falcons team had been brought in by Reeves over the previous year, including journeyman quarterback Chris Chandler, who had a career-best season in 1998. Running back Jamal Anderson also posted a career-high 1846 rushing yards, which led the NFC that year, and the defense finished fourth overall in points allowed. As a result, the Falcons won the NFC West with a record of 14–2 and clinched 2nd overall seed in the NFC playoffs, behind only the Vikings. The team was nicknamed the [...] "Dirty Birds" [...] after a touchdown dance created by tight end O.J. Santiago [...] but popularized by Anderson.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{returned}} for the 1993 season enticed by {{the chance to}} play with a new coach (<b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves),</b> and determined not to end his career due to an injury. The Giants had a resurgent season in 1993. They finished 11–5, and competed for the top NFC playoff seed. Taylor finished with 6 sacks, and the Giants defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed. They defeated the Vikings 17–10 in the opening round of the playoffs. The next week on January 15, 1994 in what would be Taylor's final game, the Giants were beaten 44–3 by the 49ers. As the game came to a conclusion, television cameras drew in close on Taylor who was crying. He announced his retirement at the post-game press conference saying, [...] "I think it's time for me to retire. I've done everything I can do. I've been to Super Bowls. I've been to playoffs. I've done things that other people haven't been able to do in this game before. After 13 years, it's time for me to go." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Culverhouse had a {{handshake}} deal {{to buy the}} Los Angeles Rams from owner <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> for $17 million, only to learn that Reeves later sold the team to Robert Irsay for $19 million. When Irsay then traded teams with Baltimore Colts owner Carroll Rosenbloom, Culverhouse sued, claiming that the others had conspired to prevent his purchase of the team. An out-of-court settlement guaranteed Rosenbloom's aid in getting an expansion franchise for Culverhouse. The opportunity came two years later, when the league expanded to Seattle and Tampa. Culverhouse was offered the Seattle expansion franchise, but declined it due to his residence in Jacksonville. Philadelphia construction company owner Thomas McCloskey was originally awarded the Tampa franchise, but soon found the business arrangement to be different than what he had expected, and {{backed out of the}} deal. Culverhouse was then awarded the franchise by the Art Rooney-chaired NFL Expansion Committee, ahead of Fort Lauderdale furniture chain (and future Boston Celtics) owner Harry T. Mangurian, Jr. The name [...] "Tampa Bay Buccaneers" [...] was chosen as a nod to the team representing not only the city of Tampa, but the entire Florida Suncoast area; and to the pirates who once inhabited the area.|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} 11–5 {{and reaching}} {{the second round}} of the playoffs in 1993, the Giants took a step backwards in 1994. Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor, the two biggest figures of the 1980s and early 1990s, both retired. Several other key starting players were dropped from the roster due to free agency. [...] In the wake of Simms' retirement, head coach <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves</b> named Dave Brown, who had been a No. 1 supplemental draft choice in 1992, as the Giants' new starting quarterback. Though Brown led the Giants to wins in their first three games of the season, the Giants lost their next 7 in a row to drop to 3–7. The poor play of Brown received much of the blame from fans and the media. However, the Giants recovered and won their last six games of the season, finishing with a 15–10 victory over the Dallas Cowboys at Giants Stadium. During this stretch they never allowed more than 20 points in a game, and the Giants ended the season with a record of 9–7. The team's stars included Rodney Hampton, who had his 4th straight 1,000yard rushing season; second-year defensive lineman Michael Strahan, and linebackers Jessie Armstead and Michael Brooks.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} 15 head coaches for the Broncos franchise. The franchise's first head coach was Frank Filchock, who coached until [...] Mike Shanahan is the franchise's all-time {{leader for the}} most regular season games coached (208), the most regular season game wins (130), and the most playoff game wins (8). Shanahan and <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves,</b> are tied for the most playoffs games coached (13). Shanahan was the first Broncos head coach to win a Super Bowl {{following}} the 1997 season, and repeated the feat following the 1998 season. The current head coach, Vance Joseph, looks for revenge in the AFC West after a tough last season The Broncos next Super Bowl victory was for Super Bowl 50 following the 2015 season {{under the leadership of}} coach Gary Kubiak who had previously played for Denver and served as an assistant coach. [...] Jack Faulkner, John Ralston, Red Miller, and Reeves have been named the United Press International (UPI) NFL Coach of the Year, at least once with the Broncos. Filchock, Faulkner, Mac Speedie, Jerry Smith, Ralston, and Miller spent their entire coaching careers with the Broncos. Speedie, Ray Malavasi, Miller, Shanahan, and Kubiak have been assistant coaches with the Broncos before they became head coaches with the Broncos.|$|E
500|$|After the Giants' Super Bowl victory, Parcells {{resigned}} {{and was replaced}} by the team's running backs coach Ray Handley. One of Handley's first decisions was to select Jeff Hostetler as the team's starting quarterback following his performance in Super Bowl XXV. Simms saw only spot action in two games prior to Week 13, when Hostetler broke his back in a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Simms finished the game and reclaimed the starting job, but won only once in his remaining four starts as the Giants failed to return to the playoffs at 8-8. Simms was named starter for the 1992 season after beating out Hostetler, whom Handley still thought high of as a quarterback in the preseason. However, Simms suffered a severe arm injury in a Week 4 loss to the Los Angeles Raiders and missed the remainder of the season. In those two seasons Simms amassed only a combined 1,905 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions while completing 59.3% of his passes. The Giants finished the 1992 season at 6-10, which led to the termination of the unpopular Handley and the hiring of former Denver Broncos coach <b>Dan</b> <b>Reeves.</b> As part of an overall house cleaning, Reeves released Hostetler and named Simms his starting quarterback. He started all 16 games in 1993, being one of only seven quarterbacks to do so, and led the Giants to a resurgent 11–5 season including a victory over the Minnesota Vikings in the playoffs. However, Simms underwent shoulder surgery after the 1993 NFL Season to repair a torn labrum. The surgery was successful, and team doctor Russell F. Warren's prognosis for recovery was excellent, and Simms was expected to be ready in time for training camp. However, later during that offseason, Simms was released by the Giants, and subsequently decided to retire. Upon his release, co-owner Wellington Mara called it [...] "a day of overwhelming sadness.". Phil Simms considered playing for the Browns in 1995, but eventually decided to stay retired.|$|E
