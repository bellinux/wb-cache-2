40|$|International audienceMost recent {{methods in}} ionospheric {{tomography}} {{are based on}} the inversion of the total electron content measured by ground-based GPS receivers. As a consequence of the high frequency of the GPS signal and the absence of horizontal raypaths, the electron density structure is mainly reconstructed in the F 2 region (300 km), where the ionosphere reaches the maximum of ionization, and is not sensitive to the lower ionospheric structure. We propose here a new tomographic method of the lower ionosphere, based on the full inversion of over-the-horizon (OTH) radar data. Previous studies using OTH radar for ionospheric tomography inverted only the leading edge <b>echo</b> <b>curve</b> of backscatter ionograms. The major advantage of our methodology is taking into account, numerically and jointly, the effect that the electron density perturbations induce not only in the speed of electromagnetic waves but also on the raypath geometry. This last point is extremely critical for OTH radar inversions as the emitted signal propagates through the ionosphere between a fixed starting point (the radar) and an unknown end point on the Earth surface where the signal is backscattered. We detail our ionospheric tomography method with the aid of benchmark tests. Having proved the necessity to take into account both effects simultaneously, we apply our method to real data. This {{is the first time that}} the effect of the raypath deflection has been quantified and that the ionospheric plasma density has been estimated over the entirety of Europe with an OTH radar...|$|E
40|$|A rapid {{method for}} {{predicting}} myocardial viability prior to revascularisation remains elusive. Intra-coronary contrast echocardiography (ICE) evaluates myocardial perfusion {{and may have}} a role in predicting myocardial viability by demonstrating flow at a microvascular level. ICE was performed before PTCA in 14 patients who had a wall motion abnormality associated with the index artery (LAD= 11 RCA= 3). There were 10 men and 4 women {{with a mean age of}} 63 years (range 54 – 74 years). Echo derived wall motion score and global ejection fraction were calculated before PTCA and again at 1 month. Linear ultrasound contrast echo data was digitally stored on optical disc and quantified using a specially developed software package. Measured parameters were peak contrast effect (P), area under the contrast <b>echo</b> <b>curve</b> (A). time to peak contrast effect, contrast half-time and mean transit time. Contrast effect in the myocardial bed of the index artery (i) was also compared with that in a reference bed supplied by a normal artery (r). Nine patients (“viable group”) had an improvement in echo score at 1 month while 5 patients (“non-viable” group) had no improvement. The “viable” patients had an improvement in ejection fraction (52. 1 % to 55. 5 %, P< 0. 02) as well as wall motion index score (1. 4 to 1. 1, p< 0. 04) while the “non-viable” patients had no significant improvement in either parameter (49. 0 % to 42. 8 % and 1. 5 to 1. 61. Significant contrast data was:P(i) P(i) /P(r) A(i) A(i) /A(r) “Viable” 1. 840. 5466. 10. 51 “Non-viable” 0. 640. 2220. 00. 22 p valuep< 0. 04 P< 0. 01 P< 0. 02 P< 0. 05 P and A were significantly greater in the index myocardial bed in the “viable” group compared to the “non-viable” group. Despite a patent epicardial index coronary artery, 4 / 5 patients in the “non-viable” group demonstrated minimal contrast effect in the index myocardial segment. These initial results suggest that ICE prior to PTCA may be rapidly used to predict improvement in both regional and global left ventricular function. The contrast data is additive to that obtained by angiography and identification of a contrast “watershed” value should enable a valuable echo predictor of myocardial viability...|$|E

Recently, Prokhorenko and Holzwarth (J. Phys. Chem.

We investigate the diffusion of water across a similar to 50 mum thick film formed between planes of glass. The diffusion time t is changed almost three orders of magnitude. For short t, the root-mean-square displacement increases with a rate which is slightly less than for freely diffusing water. At t longer than 0. 3 s, the displacement,is constant at 24 mum which implies that t he water is confined in the measuring direction defined by the applied gradient pulses. Perfectly smooth and aligned planes give rise to sharp diffraction-like features on the <b>echo</b> attenuation <b>curve,</b> i. e., NMR signal vs. the reciprocal space vector q.

The computations rely on our recent methodology for modeling water equilibria and dynamics in the Fe-homologue MIL- 100 crystal; in that sense, the particular NMR technique serves also as a validation tool of the previous simulation work which is adapted to the current system. In addition, a computational scheme for assigning partial charges on the host framework atoms was devised; it involves density functional theory (DFT) combined with electronegativity equalization method (EEM) calculations.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{possibility}} of quantifying coronary blood flow by myocardial contrast echocardiography with air-filled serum albumin microspheres (Albunex). Background. Air-filled albumin microspheres have been proposed as an intravascular tracer for the study of myocardial perfusion by contrast echocardiography. Methods. In six anesthetized open chest dogs, the left circumflex coronary artery was cannulated and perfused by a roller pump with blood from the femoral artery. Both air-filled albumin microspheres (0. 4 ml, 2 × 108 spheres/ml) and technetium- 99 m-labeled albumin were injected as a bolus into the coronary cannula at baseline and after treatment with dipyridamole (0. 56 mg/kg body weight intravenously for 4 min). Two-dimensional echographic images of the left ventricular short axis were digitized to generate myocardial time-intensity curves; myocardial radioactivity was measured by an external detector to generate radionuclide time-activity curves. Results. After dipyridamole, left circumflex coronary artery blood flow (as measured by both the pump and an electromagnetic flow meter) significantly increased (from 1. 06 ± 0. 28 to 3. 61 ± 1. 43 ml/min per g of myocardium). Peak intensity and rise time of contrast <b>echo</b> <b>curves</b> were able to differentiate baseline myocardial perfusion from coronary hyperemia but did not show any significant correlation with coronary blood flow. A weak inverse correlation with coronary blood flow was provided by myocardial mean transit time of air-filled albumin microspheres (r = 0. 33). Conversely, a close inverse correlation with coronary blood flow was obtained by myocardial mean transit time of technetium- 99 m-labeled albumin (r = 0. 95). Myocardial transit time of air-filled albumin microspheres (1. 95 ± 0. 60 s) was also markedly shorter than that of labeled albumin (5. 35 ± 3. 43 s, p < 0. 001) and the measurements were less reproducible.

The Fourier transform of the relaxation-corrected two-pulse <b>echo</b> decay <b>curve</b> reveals peaks, at one and two times the deuterium NMR frequency, that arise from the dipolar hyperfine interaction of the deuterium nucleus with the unpaired electron spin of the nitroxide-labeled lipid.

At chain positions C- 5 and C- 7 closer to the phospholipid headgroups, the amplitude of the deuterium signal is greater in the presence of cholesterol than in its absence.

Difficulties in testing anisotropic materials are due to the direction dependence of the ultrasonic velocities and to the inherent effects of beam divergence and beam distortion.

However, this direct evidence for a GRB/SN connection has recently been challenged. It has been suggested that the late afterglows of these bursts can be explained by dust echoes, of which we consider two cases: (1) the scattering of light from the afterglow (the forward shock), the optical flash (the reverse shock), and/or optical light from the burst itself by a shell of dust at a radius R from the progenitor, and (2) the absorption and thermal re-emission of this light by this shell of dust. In this paper, we model and compute dust <b>echo</b> light <b>curves</b> and spectra for both cases. Although the late-time afterglow of GRB 980326 was not sufficiently well sampled to rule out a dust echo description, we find that the late-time afterglow of GRB 970228 cannot be explained by a dust echo.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{inspection}} {{plays an}} important role in numerous industrial fields. One of the prominent tasks is the determination of location, shape, size and orientation of defects. In isotropic materials, the location of reflectors can be inferred from time-of-flight measurements, angle of insonification and transducer position. In anisotropic media, however, such a procedure is aggrevated by several phenomena, which are the direction dependence of the ultrasonic velocities, the beam skewing effect and the modified radiation characteristics of flaws with respect to wave scattering. In this contribution, analytical relationships are presented for the scattering of ultrasound at defects in such media. Based on the mathematical formulation of Huygens' principle, these relationships are obtained for traction-free scatterers using Krichhoff's approximation. Asymptotic evaluation yields explicit expressions, which are further incorporated in the Generalized Point Source Synthesis method. Numeri cal results are obtained for rectangular and circualr reflectors, selected to compare with notches and flat-bottomed holes, respectively. Evaluation is performed in view of the radiation characteristics of these defects, conside ring (quasi-) longitudinal wave scattering in transversely isotropic weld material. Also, the elaborated relationships have been applied to calculate <b>echo</b> dynamic <b>curves</b> in dependence of transducer position for pulse-echo technique. Good comparison with experimental results has been obtained...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA general theory, {{based on}} density matrix calculations, has been {{developed}} for the special case of a two-pulse sequence applied to spin 1 (14 N) Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) of a powder sample. It is shown that the homologous of the NMR inversion-recovery experiment leads easily to the longitudinal relaxation time (associated with the diagonal elements of the density matrix) provided that an appropriate phase cycling is used. Conversely, in spite of two-step phase cycling schemes adapted to transverse relaxation measurements, the homologous of the NMR Hahn spin-echo sequence may pose some problems if the results are displayed in the magnitude mode. First, at short decay times, the echo may be corrupted by unwanted signals. Secondly, in that case, the amplitude of the resulting signal can evolve unexpectedly and differently {{as a function of}} the phase of the second pulse. Thirdly, at long decay times, the echo maximum occurs earlier than expected. All these problems in principle disappear with a complete four-step phase cycling scheme and the <b>echo</b> decay <b>curve</b> yields reliably the transverse relaxation time (associated with off-diagonal elements). This theory allowed us to exploit many test experiments performed at different frequencies on hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) and sodium nitrite...|$|R
