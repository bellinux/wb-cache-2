Australian opener Matthew Hayden scored the then highest Test score of 380 in the First Test at the Western Australia Cricket Association Ground (WACA).

They then <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> four-Test series {{at home against}} India in December and January. The Fourth Test was captain Steve Waugh's last, and it was played at his home ground the SCG.

50|$|Since {{the prizes}} {{are exactly the}} same, it follows that you will prefer Gamble A to Gamble B {{if and only if}} you believe that <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red ball is more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black ball (according to {{expected}} utility theory). Also, there would be no clear preference between the choices if you thought that a red ball was as likely as a black ball. Similarly it follows that you will prefer Gamble C to Gamble D if, and only if, you believe that <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red or yellow ball is more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black or yellow ball. It might seem intuitive that, if <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red ball is more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black ball, then <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red or yellow ball is also more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black or yellow ball. So, supposing you prefer Gamble A to Gamble B, it follows that you will also prefer Gamble C to Gamble D. And, supposing instead that you prefer Gamble B to Gamble A, it follows that you will also prefer Gamble D to Gamble C.|$|R
5|$|Clark's ruling <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly.

Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted to abolish the Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} more sympathetic court.|$|E

5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E

5|$|From 2000 to 2011, {{the stadium}} was the almost-permanent home of Welsh football. The {{national}} team played {{the vast majority}} of home matches at the Millennium Stadium, with a handful of friendly matches {{once or twice a year}} at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham or Liberty Stadium, Swansea. The first Welsh football game at the stadium was played against Finland in 2000, and <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> then-record home crowd for Welsh football of over 66,000.

5|$|Hershey was {{eliminated}} from the playoffs by the Providence Bruins despite winning {{the first two games}} in a best-of-five series, marking only the tenth time this had occurred in league history.

5|$|In 1494, the {{principal}} maritime powers, Portugal and Spain, signed a treaty which <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> line {{down the middle}} of the Atlantic Ocean and allocated all trade routes to the east of the line to Portugal. That gave Portugal dominance of the only known route to the east—via the Cape of Good Hope and Indian Ocean, which left Spain, and later other countries, to seek a western route to the Pacific. The exploration of the south began as part of the search for such a route.|$|E
50|$|If two {{cards are}} drawn with {{replacement}} from {{a deck of}} cards, the event of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the first trial and that of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the second trial are independent. By contrast, if two cards are drawn without replacement from a deck of cards, the event of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the first trial and that of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the second trial are not independent, because a deck that has had a red card removed has proportionately fewer red cards.|$|R
50|$|For example, it is {{impossible}} to <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> card that is both red and a club because clubs are always black. If just one card is drawn from the deck, either a red card (heart or diamond) or a black card (club or spade) will be <b>drawn.</b> When <b>A</b> and B are mutually exclusive, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B). To find the probability of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card or a club, for example, add together the probability of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card and the probability of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> club. In a standard 52-card deck, there are twenty-six red cards and thirteen clubs: 26/52 + 13/52 = 39/52 or 3/4.|$|R

However the tournament's principal organizer, Howard Staunton, offered to pay Anderssen's travel expenses out of his own pocket if necessary, should Anderssen fail to win a tournament prize. Anderssen accepted this generous offer.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the United States Football League {{formed as}} a spring league, and enjoyed {{moderate}} success during its first two seasons behind such stars as Jim Kelly and Herschel Walker.
