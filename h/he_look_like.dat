2500|$|Nicholas's casting in {{the role}} was praised by All About Soap, who said, [...] "We reckon this is ace casting—doesn't <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> he belongs in Walford? We can just picture him in The Vic!" [...] Discussing Gavin's first scene in the show, Daily Mail TV critic Jim Shelley said the character's arrival [...] "wasn't quite as revelatory or as menacing as the writers must have assumed." [...] Frances Taylor, writing on BT Group website, said that Gavin's {{introduction}} [...] "got the nation talking about EastEnders for all the right reasons".|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, you {{interest}} me indescribably. Do you suppose {{he was in}} our rank of life? I mean, of course, did <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a gentleman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know that}} Johnny Chuck had a cousin until you {{mentioned}} it," [...] said Peter. [...] "Does <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Johnny? Won't {{you tell me}} about him, Mr. Coyote?" ...|$|E
5000|$|White's {{inconsistent}} play inspired this memorable quote by ABC announcer Mark Jones: [...] "Against USC, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> Dan Marino. Against Washington State, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> Dan Quayle." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, I can't stand {{much more}} of this," [...] {{exploded}} Flambeau. [...] "Who is this fellow? What does <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like?</b> What is the usual get-up of a mentally invisible man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But where shall I find God?" [...] insisted Tarzan. [...] "You {{are very}} old; {{if there is}} a God you must have seen Him. What does <b>He</b> <b>look</b> <b>like?</b> Where does He live?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no good talking," [...] said Rachel; [...] "but {{when they}} say that he's afraid to show himself in Baslehurst, I don't believe them. Does <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a man afraid to show himself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is hard to}} tell," [...] {{said the}} man thoughtfully. [...] "You see, Oz is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a bird; and some say <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> an elephant; and some say <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a cat. To others he appears as a {{beautiful}} fairy, or a brownie, {{or in any other}} form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Does <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an {{insurance}} agent? If so, say that I have already policies in three Hartford companies. Meanwhile prepare the stake, {{and see that}} the squaws are ready with their implements of torture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That nasty old North River?" [...] objected Hetty. [...] "It smells {{to me like}} soap {{factories}} and wet setter-dogs--oh, you mean the stew. Well, I wish we had an onion for it. Did <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> he had money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Women who had waited, and got {{patient at}} last {{after years of}} waiting, could not endure these {{additional}} few hours. Despair was endurable, but suspense! [...] "Ah, God! Was their man alive? What did <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like?</b> Had he aged much?" ...|$|E
40|$|Jimmy Finger {{lived in}} the {{apartment}} directly above. It was 1973, and I was seven. Jimmy was two years older and attended what his mother called the “special school,” suggesting that Jimmy went there {{because he was a}} genius. And <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a genius to me: plastic-framed glasses, uncombed hair, filthy clothes. In the only photo that I have of him, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>he’s</b> trapped inside of an invisible jail cell. He’s screaming, his arms are raised over his head as though he’s pounding at bars no one can see, and his glasses are crooked. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> an insane genius. Or maybe <b>he</b> just <b>looks</b> insane...|$|R

6000|$|... "Is {{this the}} hypocrite, who is deceiving me {{for his own}} wicked ends?" [...] I asked. [...] "Does <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the jealous monster who is {{plotting}} my destruction, and who will succeed if I am fool enough to accept his invitation?" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was just}} time to {{complete}} this discreet arrangement, before the stranger reached the lodge. He {{took off his hat}} to Miss Garth politely, as she turned round. What did <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> on the face of him? He looked like a clergyman in difficulties.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does he {{remind you}} of {{the figure of the}} man you saw come out of the mews?" [...] Lord Fawn paused. [...] "We can't make him move about here as we did in Mr. Wickerby's room; but remembering that as you must do, does <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the man?" ...|$|E
50|$|Coyote <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> {{a coyote}} in animal form and <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> {{a man with}} a {{mustache}} in human form.|$|R

6000|$|... "Doesn't <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a god?" [...] says Maria, {{clutching}} my wife's hand: {{and indeed}} Mr. Hagan did {{look like a}} handsome young gentleman. His colour had risen; he had put {{his hand to his}} breast with a noble air: Chamont or Castalio could not present himself better.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really!" [...] she said. [...] "You've {{done all}} those things!" [...] And she {{scrutinized}} Alvina's face. [...] "You've had some effect on him, that's evident," [...] she said. Then she shuddered, and dabbed her nose with her handkerchief. [...] "Oh, the flesh is a beastly thing!" [...] she cried. [...] "To {{make a man}} howl outside there like that, because you're here. And to make me howl because I've got a child inside me. It's unbearable! What does <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> really?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{told him}} the whole truth; the case against us--the facts as we knew them. Then I added, slowly, 'This is Mr. Harold Tillington, whom they accuse of forgery. Does <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a forger? I want to marry him before he is tried. It {{is the only way}} by which I can prove my {{implicit}} trust in him. As soon as we are married, he will give himself up at once to the police--if you wish it, before your eyes. But married we must be. Can't you manage it somehow?' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "You {{listen to}} these people talk, or you see them, they look so regular. What does a serial killer <b>look</b> <b>like?</b> <b>He</b> don’t <b>look</b> <b>like</b> anything. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> you. You could be living next door to one. If I lived next door to you, you could be." ...|$|R

6000|$|Stamping in, chilly {{from the}} ride, Mr. Wrenn laughed aloud. With a {{comfortable}} feeling {{on the side}} toward the fire he stuck his slight legs straight out before the old-time settle, looked devil-may-care, made delightful ridges on the sanded floor with his toe, and clapped a pewter pot on his knee with a small emphatic [...] "Wop!" [...] After {{about two and a}} quarter tankards he broke out, [...] "Say, that peddler guy there, don't <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> he was a gipsy--you know--sneaking through the hedges around the manner-house to steal the earl's daughter, huh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ma nun me lasciar'--!" [...] she murmured, {{repeating the}} music. [...] "That means--Don't leave me! Don't leave me! But why? Why shouldn't one human being go away from another? What does it mean? That awful noise! Isn't love {{the most horrible}} thing! I think it's horrible. It just does one in, and turns one {{into a sort of}} howling animal. I'm howling with one sort of pain, he's howling with another. Two hellish animals howling through the night! I'm not myself, he's not himself. Oh, I think it's horrible. What does <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> Nurse? Is he beautiful? Is he a great hefty brute?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I bowed low to his Majesty, {{and stepped}} out into the hall. Apparently my obeisance did not come up to Egyptian {{standards}} of courtesy, for a suppressed titter broke audibly from the ranks of bronze-skinned waiting-women. But the king graciously smiled at my attempt, and turning to the nearest nobleman, observed in a voice of great sweetness and self-contained majesty: [...] "This stranger, Ombos, is certainly a very curious person. His appearance does not at all resemble that of an Ethiopian or other savage, nor does <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the pale-faced sailors who come to us from the Achaian land beyond the sea. His features, to be sure, are not very different from theirs; but his extraordinary and singularly inartistic dress shows him to belong to some other barbaric race." ...|$|E
