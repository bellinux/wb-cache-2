In this research, insulation panels with multilayer, low-emissivity aluminum-polyethylene sheets were prepared and investigated. The results of the study showed that surface emissivity and convection currents have important influence on heat flow. The aluminum-polyethylene sheets were effective in reflecting heat and reducing heat transfer by radiation. They also divided the air space in the insulation system, resulting in the reduction of convection currents and convection heat transfer. The heat insulation system was built without micro <b>heat</b> <b>bridges.</b> Consequently, <b>heat</b> conduction was not increased by micro <b>heat</b> <b>bridges</b> resulting in lower effective thermal conductivity than the commonly used insulation materials. The connection between heat resistance and the number of sheets was not linear.

40|$|Today, {{with the}} rapid {{depletion}} of fossil energy sources and the increasing environmental problems caused by fossil fuels, supervision and management of energy consumption becomes more important. Looking at the breakdown of energy consumption by sectors, the buildings sector is seen {{as one of the}} priority areas for energy efficiency after industry and transportation. 80 % of the total energy used from the production of a building till its demolition is consumed during utilization of the building. Therefore, priority is given to applications that reduce the amount of energy consumed during the utilization phase throughout the lifetimes of buildings. There are several ecological retrofitting done so as {{to reduce the amount of}} energy consumed during utilization in buildings that have not yet completed their lifetimes. In Turkey, energy consumption is increasing every year, mostly in the industry and building sector; a large portion of the energy used in residential buildings is consumed for heating and cooling purposes. Most effective energy saving in residential buildings can be achieved by using heat insulation, an easy-to-use energy efficiency technology. In the recent years, insulation jacketing on the external walls of existing buildings has become very common in Turkey, and the energy saving gained from this practice is the subject of this paper. In line with the purpose of the study, the energy gain from various insulation alternatives on the external walls and roof of a residential building selected for this study will be evaluated. In the external insulation system, the insulation wraps the building like a jacket, without creating a <b>heat</b> <b>bridge.</b> Although the cost of external insulation system is higher compared to other systems, it is the most suitable system for buildings built for long- time use, such as residential buildings, that is why it is preferred to insulate the outer surfaces of the walls in such buildings. It was considered that the insulation materials and insulation thicknesses would differ for each of the various insulation alternatives applied on the outer surfaces of walls. Annual energy costs of various alternative insulation applications were calculated and evaluated against the energy saving occurring in a non-insulated building. The study will help investors and users in assessing in economic terms the various options for insulation before engaging in any ecological retrofitting works on existing buildings, and in selecting the right insulation application. For the national economy, the study will provide the energy saving gained from various retrofitting applications...|$|E

40|$|Cunningham’s rich {{personal}} experiences in World War Two, and his upbringing on a farm, fostered {{his desire for}} higher education. He attended a tiny one-room school in the early 30 ’s in rural Nebraska which had 16 students for the first 8 grades. Students rode horses to school, {{and the room was}} heated by a wood burning, potbellied stove. Teachers were not well trained, but {{there was a lot of}} family and community support. His high school had little more than 100 students, but a sound academic program. He enrolled at Midland Lutheran College at age 16, but left college at age 18 to volunteer for military service. He served in the Pacific theater for two years before the war ended. Returning to Midland Lutheran he earned his B. A. degree, and also earned his certification for teaching. After teaching for three years in small rural schools, he served for one year as admissions director at Midland Lutheran, his alma mater. He earned his Doctorate of Education at the University of Oregon. While there he became close friends with fellow graduate students Jack Corbally and Jack Culbertson, both of whom, like Cunningham, later would have significant careers at Ohio State. Other friends he made at Oregon included Vincent Ostrum, distinguished political scientist, and Keith Goldhammer, later Dean of Education at Michigan State. His dissertation was on decision and policy making at a school board in Springfield, Oregon, and was organized according to the conceptual principles of the brilliant Harold Lasswell, whom Cunningham would also meet at Ohio State. His first teaching experience at the college level was at the University of Chicago. Here he got deeply involved in issues of inner-city schools, including the impact of dense public housing on student performance at school. The difficulties at these overcrowded, underfunded public schools in Chicago were described as “unimaginable,” but unfortunately conditions there are said to be no better today than in the 1950 ’s. Cunningham decided to focus his career on urban schools, and he gained further experience at Chicago Heights and Rochester, Minnesota. James Conant, the influential author, educator, and President of Harvard University, wrote extensively at the time on the merits of large, comprehensive, schools, an approach Cunningham found to be detrimental. Cunningham also raises questions about the possible parallels between the rapidly increasing percentage of African-American students in Chicago, and the decline of certain schools. One such school, Hyde Park, was from 1940 to 1960 transformed from one of the best in Chicago to one of the worst. In addition to his emerging interests in matters of race and civil rights while at Chicago, Cunningham was very active within two professional organizations, the National Conference of Professors of Educational Administration, and the University Council for Educational Administration. In 1967 Cunningham accepted an offer from Novice Fawcett to become Dean of the College of Education at Ohio State. Earlier he had rejected several attractive offers from other institutions. Here he encountered several close friends, including Jack Corbally, and two former doctoral students, Virgil Blanke and Fred Staub. He could count on strong support from higher administration, including Fawcett, but he realized there were some major problems at the College that would require urgent attention. One thorny issue was the recent closing of University School, a decision which Fawcett had encouraged, but which had led to resignations from certain education faculty. At this point the issue was how to close the school with some dignity. Two faculty members who were thought to have engineered the closing of the school, Egan Guba and David Clark, found themselves ostracized by some of their colleagues. There were other divisive issues as well. Cunningham, in response, organized the Lake Hope Conference which brought the entire faculty of the College of Education together in a congenial setting. Through role playing, simulated faculty meetings, and intense discussions and negotiations in large and small gatherings, the outcome was a master plan for reorganizing the College of Education. Many of the angry feelings were dissipated, and the conference ended with “a lot of joy, a lot of feeling, and a lot of hope. ” Guba and Clark both resigned, and there were other departures as well, but enormous progress had been made in a short time. Two professors, husband and wife, who greatly aided Cunningham in his re-organization plans, were Harold and Elsie Alberty. Other great assets were John Ramseyer, former Head for many years of University School, John Richardson, Science Education, Jack Frymier, nationally known as an expert in curriculum development, and Alex Frazier, versatile expert on urban schools and an esteemed teacher. In his first year at Ohio State, Cunningham established the Ohio State University Advisory Commission on problems facing the Columbus Public School system, until recently headed by Novice Fawcett. The system was currently undergoing much tension of a racial nature. With strong backing from Fawcett, and five other Deans, as well as much involvement from graduate students, Cunningham and his co-partner, Arliss Rhoden, developed a comprehensive, university-wide plan. Hearings were held in various white and black schools. Charles Taylor, a social worker from South Side Settlement [House], “a handsome, well spoken, tough black man” asked hard questions, but ultimately his assistance was crucial. Later, with Cunningham’s support, Taylor earned his Ph. D. at OSU, and he later became President of Wilberforce University. The final report contained dozens of recommendations, not all of which, of course, were adopted, but Cunningham considered it “successful. ” It received considerable local publicity, thanks in part to the solid cooperation of Gene D’Angelo, President of the Dispatch Broadcast Group, and Robert and Charles Lazarus, influential civic leaders. An immediate benefit for the College of Education was the closer relationships that emerged with Columbus Public Schools, and other Colleges at OSU. Over time Cunningham and others, especially Jack Corbally, worked with varying success to bring to OSU more black students and faculty. For this he was called the “Red Dean” by people on the downtown school board. Despite such efforts being made at racial understanding they were insufficient. By April, 1970, the time of serious riots at Ohio State which led to closing the university, Cunningham believed that “cooperation between blacks and whites on campus is evaporating. ” Certain blacks, including Michael White, President of the Student Body, later Mayor of Cleveland, demanded creation of a Black Studies Center, speeded up recruitment of black students and faculty, and earlier promotions of black faculty. Cunningham’s own personal reputation grew on campus and beyond as he was seen “as someone who was willing to take the <b>heat,</b> <b>bridge</b> the gap, mediate the dispute, and try to get change effected. ” Similarly the reputation of the College of Education grew; it was recognized as the top land grant College of Education in the country. Early in 1973 Cunningham resigned his Deanship (while retaining his tenured Professorship) to take a position in Detroit to head a citizens’ Task Force being organized to leverage improvements in the Detroit Public Schools. It worked with some success to improve reading programs, and improve internal communication with the community at large, and state government in Lansing. At about the same time he chaired a similar group in San Francisco that was working to improve public schools there. In Columbus an anti-segregation lawsuit had been filed in the federal courts to be heard by Judge Duncan, who then invited Cunningham to serve as Special Master Commissioner in the Columbus desegregation case. This assignment brought a tremendous amount of power and authority with it, and it lasted for seven years. Various areas of concern were studied, including student achievement, membership in all-white sports, such as tennis and swimming, and participation in student councils and the homecoming court, also traditionally all white. Other issues were migration patterns of parents and their children, and minority gains in science and math. As blacks gains were realized there was white flight of students, teachers, and even principals. A general conclusion that for black students there were more problems for them in the communities than in the schools. Although schools were undeniably part of the problem of discrimination, there are limits to using the schoolhouse to solve societal problems. Bussing students to school did solve “pieces” of the problem. Although seeking solutions through housing and employment are essential, considering the fact that most families in this country use the public schools, desegregation of schools can only help to increase racial understanding and lessen prejudice. Cunningham concluded after extensive personal study of racial discrimination in various venues that society as a whole was better off for having undertaken the challenges of desegregating the public schools. He also reflected on several disappointments in his career. Some of these involved personnel. He regretted losing Professors Daniel Stufflebeam to Western Michigan University, and Ray Nystrand to the University of Louisville, and disappointments in failing to recruit as many African-American students and faculty as he had hoped. In fact, he said that Ohio State had actually lost ground in the past ten years. Cunningham was also involved with the Mershon Center for Public Policy. It was he who recruited Dick Snyder as Director of the Mershon Center, and he also served, at Snyder’s invitation, as co-director of the National Program for Educational Leadership at Mershon. Since his retirement from Ohio State, Cunningham has continued to be busy with various commitments. He is currently (2001) engaged in a project at the University of Akron to establish a Center for the sustained study of governance of education, has served as Director of the Ohio Commission on Interprofessional Education and Practice, and the Ohio Human Services Commission. Of all of his numerous accomplishments in intellectual, social, and law enterprise, his greatest accomplishment, he feels, was his success in working with his students, many of whom went on to distinguished careers in their own right. It has also been said that Cunningham “saved the College of Education. ”Jack Culbertson: Director of the University Council of Educational Administration (pp. 7, 13) [...] Jack Corbally: Provost (pp. 7, 17 - 19, 33 - 35, 50) [...] Vincent Ostrum: political scientist (p. 8) [...] Keith Goldhammer: Dean of Education at Michigan State University (p. 9) [...] Harold Lasswell: versatile and brilliant scholar (pp. 9 - 11, 53) [...] James Conant: influential advocate of large urban schools (p. 13) [...] Robert Havighurst: College of Education at OSU, and faculty member at University School (p. 16) [...] Roald Campbell: Dean of the College of Education at Univ. of Chicago (p. 17) [...] Novice Fawcett: President of OSU (pp. 17, 19 - 20, 28) [...] Egan Guba: Bureau of Educational Research, instrumental in closing University School (pp. 21 - 22) [...] David Clark: Associate Dean, College of Education, worked to close University School (pp. 21 - 22) [...] John Ramseyer: Head of University School (pp. 21 - 25) [...] Arliss Rhoden: Associate Dean, College of Education (pp. 20, 25 - 30, 36, 38) [...] Alex Frazier: diverse successes (p. 26) [...] John Richardson: Science Education (pp. 24 - 25) [...] Jack Frymier: expert in curriculum development (pp. 25 - 26) [...] Charles Taylor: respected advocate of African-American causes (pp. 29 - 30) [...] Harold Eibling: Superintendent of Columbus Public Schools (p. 31) [...] Richard Meiling, Dean of Medicine (pp. 29, 39) [...] Gene D’Angelo: President of Dispatch Broadcast Group (pp. 31 - 32) [...] Richard Snyder: Director of the Mershon Center (pp. 53 - 54) [...] Charles Herrmann: Director of the Mershon Center (p. 54) [...] Judge Duncan: Federal judge in Columbus desegregation case (pp. 42 - 44, 58) [...] Daniel Stufflebeam: Professor of Education (p. 50...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} {{years there has been}} {{reported}} considerable and rapid contamination on newly built rendered façades in Sweden due to biological growth. The problem is believed to occur mostly on façades of render applied on thermal insulation, but apart from this it is difficult to find clear relationships indication which façades might be infected. The aim of this project is to explain why certain façades gets heavy biological growth while other seemingly similar do not. We will do that with comparing biological knowledge with building physical and -technical knowledge. One of the major approaches in this project is to investigate building façades. We have investigated several buildings with discolored façades, mostly in Skåne, the southern most part of Sweden, and tried to identify the organisms growing. The most dominating organisms we found growing on the façades were lichens and algae. In addition we have investigated building façades with organized patterns of small round areas where no growth occur on otherwise quite fouled façades. These small round areas appears then on the façade as “white dots”. Further investigations of the façades show that the “white dots” appear at each fastener placed under the rendering to fasten the thermal insulation to the structural wall behind. We believe that the fasteners are <b>heat</b> <b>bridges,</b> with higher outer surface temperature and therefore a lower surface relative humidity at which no microbial growth occurs. Results from computer simulations showed that the fasteners are <b>heat</b> <b>bridges</b> and in cases with thin layers of thermal insulation and rendering give a 1 - 2 K higher night-time temperatures {{than the rest of the}} façade which made a difference in relative humidity at 11 %. This small difference in temperature gives high enough differences in moisture state to almost prevent microbial growth above the fasteners. As we know that organisms need a high relative humidity to grow, these results could explain the uneven distribution of biological growth on the façades with “white dots”. Temperature and relative humidity measurements on façades of thin rendering on thermal insulation (light façades) and brick wall with rendering (heavy façades) shows that light façades are more directly influenced by the weather conditions than the heavy façades. The temperature varied much more on the light façades than the on the heavy façades; in a day of October 2005 the temperature varied from 60. 4 °C during daytime to - 0. 4 °C during the next night. During nights there is no difference between the lowest temperatures on the light façades on the south- and north-facing façades. The light façades gets colder in the night then the heavy façades due to the lower heat capacity in the construction, whereas the heavy façades with the higher heat capacity can store the heat from daytime during night. The red-colored façades, which had a higher temperature than the white-colored façades, have a significantly lower relative humidity with a difference of 20 % relative humidity if it was not fully overcast. The relative humidity during night on the south-facing façades shows that the white-colored heavy façade had a higher maximum relative humidity with approximately difference of 10 % relative humidity during night than the red-colored light façade in spite of the higher minimum temperature during night on the white-colored heavy façade. The results from the temperature measurements above the fasteners show that the fasteners are <b>heat</b> <b>bridges</b> that increase the façade surface a few degrees during night, but also in the winter on the north-facing façade during daytime. We will continue our measurements of temperature and relative humidity on heavy and light façades in addition with investigations of biological growth on both the above façades and on newly built light façades. Also biological growth will be studied on samples with thin rendering on thermal insulation where we will investigate different abiotic factors on the samples.

Imprecise {{contact between the}} bridgewire and the primary explosive changes how quickly the explosive is heated up, and minor electrical variations in the wire or leads will change how quickly it heats up as well. The heating process typically takes milliseconds to tens of milliseconds to complete and initiate detonation in the primary explosive. This is roughly 1,000 to 10,000 times longer and less precise than the EBW electrical vaporization.|$|R
40|$|The {{irreversibility}} of {{heat conduction}} in porous media, {{its relation to}} effective thermal conductivities (ETCs), and the optimization of thermal conduction process are investigated in this work based {{on the concept of}} entransy dissipation. Two more new concepts of reference entransy dissipation and nondimensional entransy dissipation are first introduced. Then it is showed that the nondimensional entransy dissipation rate (NER) can be employed as an objective function to evaluate the efficiency of a thermal transfer process in a porous material. By using this criterion and a newly developed structure growth algorithms, different porous structures were generated and the corresponding values of both ETC and NER were derived to illustrate the usefulness and power of using NER to assess the thermal performance of the materials. The results show that the effective thermal conductivity not only influences the heat transfer ability of porous media, but also reflects the irreversibility of heat conduction in porous media, which is a dissipation coefficient for heat transfer. Meanwhile, decreasing the structural particle size will increase the contact points, i. e. more <b>heat</b> <b>bridges,</b> decrease the temperature gradient nearby the contact points, and hence significantly increase the effective thermal coefficient of porous media. Essentially, decreasing the particle size will result in a more uniform distribution of both temperature gradient and local entransy dissipation rate along the heat flow direction, and consequently lead to a larger effective thermal conductivity...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Infrared (IR) images depict thermal {{radiation}} of physical objects. Imaging the building façades and the roofs with an IR camera, thermal inspections {{of the buildings}} can be carried out. In such inspections a spatial correspondence between IR-images and the existing 3 D building models can be helpful. Texturing 3 D building models with IR images this spatial correspondence can be created. Furthermore in textures heat leakages can be detected and the <b>heat</b> <b>bridges</b> can be stored together with 3 D building data. However, before extracting leakages, the windows should be located. In IR images glass reflects the surrounding and shows false results for the temperature measurements. Consequently, the windows should be detected in IR images and excluded for the inspection. The most common algorithms for window detection were developed for the images in the visual band. In this paper, an algorithm for window detection in textures extracted from terrestrial IR images is proposed. In the first step, small objects have to be removed by scaling down the image (texture). Then in the scaled image, regions are detected using a local dynamic threshold. Morphological operations are used to remove false detections and unify substructures of the windows. For every extracted region, which {{is a candidate for}} a window, the center of gravity is calculated. It is assumed that windows on façades are ordered in regular rows and columns. First the points are grouped int...|$|R

With his family conspiring against them and aiding in his deceptions, {{there was no way}} it was going to work. Clarkson's hurt not only stems from his indifference to her, but his family's animosity towards her. [...] "You've got your mother and your brother/ Every other undercover/ Tellin' you what to say/", she sings. In the chorus, he asks her whether or not they should continue dating: [...] "I'm looking for attention/ Not another question/ Should you stay or should you go?/ Well, if you don't have the answer/ Why you still standin' here?/ Hey, hey, hey, hey/Just walk away." [...] In the second verse, she says that he stood up her plenty of evenings. However, each time she believed he would be there. After the chorus is the <b>heated</b> <b>bridge.</b> Clarkson says she wants a relationship where the guy loves her as passionately as she does him. She wants a lover who will support her, not disappear when she needs him the most. She asks if he thinks the relationship is worth fighting for. [...] "I wanna love/ I want a fire/ To feel the burn/ My desires/ I wanna man by my side/ Not a boy who runs and hides/ Are you gonna fight for me?/ Die for me?/ Live and breathe for me?/ Do you care for me?/ 'Cause if you don't then just leave," [...] she sings.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of buoyancy forces on oscillatory Marangoni flow in liquid bridges of different aspect ratio is investigated by three-dimensional, time-dependent numerical solutions and by laboratory experiments using a micro-scale apparatus and a thermographic visualisation system. Liquid <b>bridges</b> <b>heated</b> {{from above and}} from below are investigated. The numerical and experimental results show that for each aspect ratio and for both the heating conditions, {{the onset of the}} Marangoni oscillatory flow is characterized by the appearance of a standing wave regime; after a certain time, a second transition to a travelling wave regime occurs. The three-dimensional flow organization at the onset of instability is different according to whether the <b>bridge</b> is <b>heated</b> from above or from below. When the liquid <b>bridge</b> is <b>heated</b> from below, the critical Marangoni number is larger, the critical wave number (m) is smaller and the standing wave regime is more stable, compared with the case of <b>bridge</b> <b>heated</b> from above.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{pressure}} sensor {{based on the}} convective cooling of the air surrounding an electrothermally <b>heated</b> resonant <b>bridge.</b> Unlike conventional pressure sensors that rely on diaphragm deformation in response to pressure, the sensor does not require diaphragms of the large surface area, and hence is scalable and can be realized even at the nanoscale. The concept is demonstrated using both straight and arch microbeam resonators driven and sensed electrostatically. The change in the surrounding pressure is shown to be accurately tracked by monitoring {{the change in the}} resonance frequency of the structure. The sensitivity of the sensor, which is controllable by the applied electrothermal load, is shown near 57 811 ppm/mbar for a pressure range from 1 to 10 Torr. We show that a straight beam operated near the buckling threshold leads to the maximum sensitivity of the device. The experimental data and simulation results, based on a multi-physics finite element model, demonstrate the feasibility and simplicity of the pressure sensor. Published by AIP Publishing...|$|R
