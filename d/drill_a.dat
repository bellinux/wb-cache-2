5|$|Long {{before the}} Royal Military College of Canada was {{established}} in 1876, there were proposals for military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a 3 month long military courses from 1865 at the School of Military Instruction in London. Established by Militia General Order in 1865, the school enabled Officers of Militia or Candidates for Commission or promotion in the Militia to learn Military duties, drill and discipline, to command a Company at Battalion Drill, to <b>Drill</b> <b>a</b> Company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company's Officer. The school was not retained at Confederation, in 1867.|$|E
5|$|The Watts Brothers Tool Works square {{drill bit}} has {{the shape of}} a Reuleaux triangle, {{modified}} with concavities to form cutting surfaces. When mounted in a special chuck which allows for the bit not having a fixed centre of rotation, it can <b>drill</b> <b>a</b> hole that is nearly square. Although patented by Henry Watts in 1914, similar drills invented by others were used earlier. Other Reuleaux polygons are used to drill pentagonal, hexagonal, and octagonal holes.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to <b>drill</b> <b>a</b> well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to <b>drill</b> <b>a</b> shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E

25|$|Single steel {{drilling}} caisson is a drill barge {{that was}} built for year-round oil exploration in shallow ice-covered waters in the Beaufort Sea.

In response, Grayson introduced the Emergency Relief Well Act, which would require that an emergency relief well be drilled {{at the same time as}} any new exploratory well.|$|E

25|$|An {{adjustable}} wood bit, {{also known}} as an expansive wood bit, has a small center pilot bit with an adjustable, sliding cutting edge mounted above it, usually containing a single sharp point at the outside, with a set screw to lock the cutter in position. When the cutting edge is centered on the bit, the hole drilled will be small, and when the cutting edge is slid outwards, a larger hole is drilled. This allows a single drill bit to <b>drill</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of holes, and can {{take the place of}} a large, heavy set of different size bits, as well as providing uncommon bit sizes. A ruler or vernier scale is usually provided to allow precise adjustment of the bit size.|$|E
25|$|Between 1983 and 1990, BeauDril's mobile {{drilling}} units drilled a {{total of}} nineteen exploratory wells in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea {{with the support of}} Ikaluk and other icebreaking vessels: nine with the Mobile Arctic Caisson Molikpaq and ten with the Conical Drilling Unit Kulluk. Twelve wells alone were drilled in the Amauligak prospect, the most significant oil and gas field discovered in the region, but the high expections for the Beaufort Sea were not met: the area was characterized by a large number of small, widely scattered resources. Molikpaq was mothballed after completing the last well in 1990. However, Kulluk was used to <b>drill</b> <b>a</b> total of four wells in 1992 and 1993 for ARCO Alaska on the American part of the Beaufort Sea before being cold-stacked at Tuktoyaktuk.|$|E

25|$|While {{he worked}} {{to regain control}} of the Albertan, Bell also {{continued}} to invest in oil ventures. In 1944 he partnered with Frank McMahon and others forming Empire Petroleum Limited, in an unsuccessful attempt to raise capital to <b>drill</b> <b>a</b> wildcat well. Two years later he tried again with two new companies, Reef Petroleum and Tower Petroleum. The two new companies also failed to find oil, but the efforts raised enough money for Bell and his partners to form Calvan Petroleums on the heels of Imperial Oil's discovery of a large oil field at Redwater, Alberta. The company found success trading in leases and drilling rights on crown land, prompting Bell to form several other oil companies in the years that followed. In 1951, Bell amalgamated his various companies into Calvan Consolidated Ltd. The new company held an interest in 77 wells at the Redwater field. He sold Calvan to Petrofina in 1955 for $40 million and, while he continued to trade in oil and gas companies for several years, his focus returned to the newspaper business.|$|E
25|$|Staffed by British Regulars, {{the adult}} male {{students}} underwent a 3-month-long military course in Toronto, Ontario and Quebec, Quebec in 1864, and at Montreal, Quebec Kingston, Ontario London, Ontario and Hamilton, Ontario in 1865. The School of Military Instruction in Kingston {{was established by}} Militia General Order of 10 February 1865 {{for the purpose of}} enabling Officers of Militia or Candidates for Commission or promotion in the Militia to perfect themselves in a knowledge of their Military duties, drill and discipline. The Commandant certified that a cadet from a particular Regimental Division attended said School of Military Instruction and had proven himself to his satisfaction able to command a Company at Battalion Drill, to <b>Drill</b> <b>a</b> Company at Company Drill and that he has acquired a complete acquaintance with the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company's Officer and that he is qualified under the provisions of the said General Order to hold either a First or Second Class Certificate. Although the military colleges in London and Hamilton had disbanded in 1865, the schools at Quebec, Montreal, Kingston and Toronto were retained at Confederation, in 1867. In 1868, schools of Cavalry and Artillery were formed in Toronto and a school of artillery was formed in Montreal. Since these were not Boarding schools, students lived in the communities.|$|E
