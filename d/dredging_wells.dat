Seismoacoustic profiling, a multibeam echosounder, a side-scan sonar, a 3  m vibro-corer and a box-corer were used during the research cruises.

Mechanical dewatering of the sediments results in filter cakes, comprising clays (2 : 1 clay minerals and kaolinite), quartz, calcite and an amorphous phase as major mineral phases. Flash calcination of these filter cakes reduces the total organic carbon fraction and results in a dehydroxylation of the clay minerals.

40|$|Experience in transboundary river basins {{emphasizes}} {{the need for more}} cooperative transnational water management. In this respect, the Interreg IVB project AMICE aims at developing a shared adaptation strategy of the basin of the river Meuse to the hydrological impacts of climate change. The basin covers parts of France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. The project combines scientific research with innovative natural and structural water retention measures, as well as enhanced transnational crisis management. In this framework, common climate and hydrological scenarios were derived for the time horizons 2021 - 2050 and 2071 - 2100. A “coordinated” procedure was set up to conduct the first hydraulic modelling of the entire river Meuse, from its spring to its mouth. For the considered climate scenarios, the increases in future flood levels were found about twice higher in {{the central part of the}} Meuse basin compared to the upper and lower parts. This distinctive spatial pattern results from the morphology of the valley. The characteristics of the hydraulic models used for this “coordinated” analysis differed significantly from one region to the other (e. g., 1 D vs. 2 D, steady vs. unsteady). Therefore, a more refined analysis was undertaken on a 100 km long stretch of the Meuse, crossing the border between Belgium and the Netherlands, using very similar (“harmonized”) models for the whole computation (2 D unsteady models). As a result, the influence of using different interconnected models could be appreciated. The results of hydraulic modelling were used to conduct damage assessment based on a common methodology throughout the Meuse basin and combined with landuse change scenarios in the floodplains (change in vulnerability of the floodplains). In turn, several adaptation measures were tested, including upstream water retention, <b>dredging</b> as <b>well</b> as upgrade of flood defences and mobile weirs. Hydrological and hydraulic modelling was also performed for a sub-basin of the river Meuse, partly controlled by two large reservoirs. A detailed model of the operation rules of these reservoirs was implemented. This enabled to investigate the impact of the considered climate change scenarios on the performance of these multi-purpose reservoirs as well as to investigate possible enhancements in the operation rules, which may serve as adaptation measures to compensate for the detrimental effects of climate change.

Their significance {{is bound to}} increase further, due to increasing coastal zone development, stricter environmental regulation concerning land-won aggregates and increasing demand for beach replenishment material. Marine aggregate (MA) deposits can be differentiated into relict and modern deposits. The former consist of sedimentary material deposited {{in the past and}} under different environmental and sedimentary regimes than those existing presently (e. g. the gravel/ sand deposits of the Pleistocene buried river valleys of the northwestern European shelves). The latter are deposits, which have been formed and controlled by the modern hydro-and sediment dynamic conditions (e. g. the linear sand banks of the southern North Sea).

Acidophilic bacteria, Acidithiobacillus species were isolated from abandoned dredged spoils that were produced during the <b>dredging</b> of oil <b>well</b> access canals in the Niger Delta. Two different composite dredged spoil samples were collected, suspended in Starkey medium and inoculated with {{the culture of the}} bacteria for 1 - 7 weeks. The heavy metal concentration of the sediment prior to the bioleaching are as follows: copper (121. 1 ± 0. 30 mg/kg), cadmium (130. 8 ± 0. 53 mg/kg), chromium (143 ± 1. 00 mg/kg), nickel (138. 5 ± 0. 36 mg/kg), manganese (296 ± 2. 00 mg/kg) and zinc (131. 5 ± 0. 50 mg/kg). During the leaching process, the results of the physico-chemical monitoring show that pH decreased from 3. 5 to < 2. 0, while sulphate, conductivity, redox potential, turbidity, iron and optical density of the leaching broth increased. The physical observations (colour, turbidity, slime production, utilization of sulphur crystals) correlated with the physico-chemical measurements. After seven weeks of bioleaching, the heavy metal recoveries from the spoil 1 are copper (89 %), cadmium (100 %), chromium (56 %), nickel (81 %), manganese (68 %) and lead (96 %). We therefore conclude that Acidithiobacillus sp isolated from abandoned dredged spoils have the potential for the bioremediation of heavy metal contaminated dredged spoils.

Seven echo types offshore Porto (types IA- 1, IB, IB- 2, IC- 2, IIA, IIB, IIIA) and five echo types offshore Lisbon (types IB, IIA, IIB, IB- 2, IIIA) were identified on 3. 5 -kHz profiler data. In addition, 11 Meso–Cenozoic seismic units off Lisbon and Alentejo, plus three post-Turonian seismic packages offshore Porto were interpreted and dated by <b>well,</b> <b>dredge</b> and DSDP/ODP stratigraphic data. During the Cenozoic, the tectono-sedimentary evolution of the studied areas depended on their position {{in relation to the}} locus of compression in Iberia. Accommodation space and sediment pathways varied in relation to distinct pulses of uplift or subsidence occurring at different times in the three studied regions. The Porto and Lisbon margins record extensional collapse respectively after the early Eocene and early Chattian, interrupted by short episodes of uplift related to distinct tectonic phases. As a result, gravity flows dictated deposition on these margins in most part of the Cenozoic. Seamounts and halokinetic structures controlled deposition on the Porto margin by inducing topographic barriers to the westward progradation of slope-derived sediment. The relative proximity of the Alentejo margin to the Azores–Gibraltar Fracture Zone resulted in folding and exposure during the middle Oligocene, but subsidence after the early Chattian generated a palaeoslope buried under Neogene units. Oligocene and Burdigalian canyon incision offshore Alentejo preceded the emplacement of modern channels during the Pliocene. These presently transport sediment derived from the shelf and major onshore drainage catchments into abyssal areas...|$|R
