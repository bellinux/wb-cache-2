However, electrospinning is problematic for polymers such as biologically derived materials because of their higher viscosity. In this study, a new spinneret <b>design</b> <b>applies</b> shear <b>forces</b> to the polymer solution just prior to electrospinning. The efficacy of shear-electrospinning is proven using concentrated poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) solutions as a model, with solutions designed around the various concentration regimes of PVOH, initially identified via rheological studies. Conventional electrospinning of solutions up to 16. 8 wt...|$|R

For chips {{with a large number}} of pins, either zero insertion force (ZIF) sockets or land grid array (LGA) sockets are used instead. These <b>designs</b> <b>apply</b> a compression <b>force</b> once either a handle (for ZIF type) or a surface plate (LGA type) is put into place. This provides superior mechanical retention while avoiding the risk of bending pins when inserting the chip into the socket.|$|R

The robotic implant is <b>designed</b> to <b>apply</b> traction <b>forces</b> to the two disconnected esophageal segments to induce sufficient growth so that the two ends can be joined together to form a functioning esophagus. In contrast to the current manual method of externally <b>applying</b> traction <b>forces,</b> the implant offers the potential to avoid prolonged patient sedation and to substantially reduce the number of X-rays required.

40|$|Abstract: There {{are several}} factors {{influencing}} {{the performance of}} an electrical connector. Such as <b>design,</b> environmental conditions, <b>applied</b> <b>force,</b> electrical loads, and installation procedures. As the performance demands on electrical networks and plants in general, and electrical connectors in particular, constantly increase, {{the need for more}} reliable rules for design and testing of electrical connectors becomes necessary. As for the bolted bus-bar design factor, a number of more or less important design parameters can be identified, including: contact force, overlapping, etc. The initial joint resistance of overlapped bolted is assessed experimentally, The parameters influencing the initial joint resistance such as overlap distance,Holes diameter, tighten torque and bolt size are investigated.

40|$|By {{combining}} parabolic partial {{differential equation}} (PDE) theory with Lyapunov technique, the synchronization is studied {{for a class}} of coupled distributed parameter systems (DPS) described by PDEs. First, based on Kronecker product and Lyapunov functional, some easy-to-test sufficient condition is given to ensure the synchronization of coupled DPS with time delay. Secondly, in {{the case that the}} whole coupled system cannot synchronize by itself, the proportional-spatial derivative (P-sD) state feedback controller is <b>designed</b> and <b>applied</b> to <b>force</b> the network to synchronize. The sufficient condition on the existence of synchronization controller is given in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control design methodology is demonstrated in numerical simulations...|$|R

However, many studies were conducted to investigate the beam to column connection under accidental loads such as fire, blast and impact load to investigate the connection response. The study is a part of a PhD plan to investigate different types of connections under lateral impact load. The conventional test setups, such as cruciform setup, were <b>designed</b> to <b>apply</b> shear <b>forces</b> and bending moment on the connection, whilst, in the lateral impact case, the connection is subjected to combined tension and moment. Hence, a review is presented to introduce the previous test setup that is used to investigate the connection behaviour. Then, the design and fabrication of the novel test setup is presented. Finally, some trial test results to investigate the efficiency of the proposed setup are discussed. The final results indicate that the setup was efficient in terms of the simplicity and strength...|$|R

40|$|Study design: {{clinical}} measurement, cross-sectional. Objectives: {{to compare}} cervical mobilization <b>forces</b> <b>applied</b> by physiotherapists and students, and the {{factors associated with}} forces for each group. Background: cervical spine joint mobilization is a common manual technique for treating patients with mechanical neck pain. But {{little is known about}} the <b>forces</b> <b>applied</b> during this technique. Potential variability between therapists may result from clinical experience or may be due to factors present in individuals prior to clinical practice exposure. Methods: one hundred sixteen practicing physiotherapists and 120 physiotherapy students without clinical experience applied grades I through IV posteroanterior mobilization to the premarked C 2 and C 7 spinous and articular processes of 1 of 67 asymptomatic subjects. An instrumented table recorded <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> (N), force amplitudes (N), and oscillation frequencies (Hz), and a custom device measured subjectsâ€™ spinal stiffness (N/mm). Independent t tests were used to compare the <b>forces</b> <b>applied</b> by therapists and students, intraclass correlation coefficients were used to determine variability, and linear regression was used to establish factors associated with <b>applied</b> <b>forces.</b> RESULTS: Studentsâ€™ forces were generally lower (mean difference, 15. 7 N for grades III and IV; P<. 001) and applied with slower oscillation frequencies (0. 12 Hz; P<. 001) than therapistsâ€™ forces. Similar factors were associated with <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> for both groups: male gender and greater subject body weight were associated with higher <b>applied</b> <b>forces,</b> and greater C 2 stiffness with lower forces. Having thumb pain was associated with lower <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> for therapists but higher ones for students. Conclusions: students <b>apply</b> lower <b>forces</b> than therapists.

40|$|Structural shape deformation, in its {{conventional}} way, includes <b>applying</b> <b>forces</b> to a fixed-compliance {{structure to}} deform it to certain shapes. Rather than addressing shape {{control in the}} established way (<b>applying</b> <b>forces</b> to elastically or plastically deform a structure), this work studies the use of shape morphing, which involves combining <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> and local modulus changes. Specifically in this paper, a simply supported elastic beam that can exhibit variable compliance behavior is selected as the model. This study focuses on the forward approach of morphing, that is, determining possible beam shapes due to the <b>applied</b> <b>force</b> and modulus variability. The goal is to incorporate variable-modulus materials into a structure model and utilize the controllable modulus change to quantify the morphing of the structure with limited actuator numbers, locations, and force levels. The resulting morphed shapes are quantified in terms of various characteristic parameters. The study demonstrates that a larger, {{and in some cases}} nonintuitive, space of shapes becomes possible when modulus change is utilized, for the same set of <b>applied</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|R

When the grating surface was cleaned, and thus hydrophilic by removing the hydrocarbon film, enhanced imaging stability was observed at {{both positive and negative}} <b>applied</b> <b>forces.</b> The higher adhesive interaction between the tip and the surface explains the improved imaging stability. The effects of imaging rate on the imaging stability were tested on an even softer adhesive Escherichia coli biofilm deposited onto the grating structure.
