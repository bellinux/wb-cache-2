40|$|The new {{orientation}} of the Common Agriculture Policy encourages producers to respond to market forces. In addition, the public expect producers {{to contribute to a}} living countryside. Based on this context, the purpose of the paper is to discuss what other marketing alternatives exist for the promotion of mountain quality food products beyond labelling. This is done through the analyses of shelves and postal surveys to retailers, carried out as part of the EU project <b>EuroMARC,</b> which included information for Austria, France, Norway, Romania, Slovenia and UK (Scotland). The analysis concentrates on two product promotion aspects: display and store-promotion, and communication of product attributes. The results indicate that even without labelling policy there is scope to improve the promotion of mountain quality food products.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is, by {{comparing}} products with a mountain provenance with those from non-mountain areas, to explore whether the market puts a premium on the „mountain attribute‟. First, we present a theoretical framework on attributes and cues that helps answering the question what is “mountain” representing in a products or in other term, is it an attribute or a cue. Second, based on a shelves survey collected as part of the <b>EuroMARC,</b> we analyse for several products (apples, sausages, water and cheese) and countries (Austria, France, Norway, Scotland and Slovenia) using a hedonic price regression approach whether a premium is paid for mountain food products in comparison with identified similar non-mountain food products. The results indicate that the answer is mixed and depends on the product and country. Thus, premia was found only in the case of cheese and for Austria, Norway and Slovenia.

40|$|The {{current and}} planned extent of {{realisation}} of OHIM's objective of a totally paperless working environment is described. Those areas where paper copies are still needed - e. g., the Official Journal (in five languages), the Bulletin (in 11 languages), and certain publications on the CTM and national law - are outlined, {{together with an}} overview of the progress in providing more compact CD-ROM versions of those materials. Electronic public trademark search services enabled by the increasingly paperless environment for filing and processing include an Internet website. The site has information on, for instance, trademark law decisions, the OHIM annual report, links to other trademark office sites, and access to three databases (CTM-ONLINE, CTM-DOWNLOAD and CTM AGENT). A description is given of actioning public requests for information (such as file inspection and earlier national search reports) - currently by conventional paper copies - and the scope for using CTM-ONLINE to retrieve data from <b>EUROMARC,</b> the Office's internal database. Finally, the author concludes that further movement towards a totally paperless office is predicated on changes to the acceptable means of proof in judicial proceedings as well as further changes in public attitudes towards such a working environment. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTerritorial {{labelling}} {{of mountain}} food products {{serves as a}} marker of both product quality traits and cultural heritage. In mountain regions, the use of territorial labelling relates to competitiveness of farming enterprises and to the renewed attractiveness and identity of the territorial domain. A wide range of farming practices across European mountains, with a wealth of tradition and know-how, generates a variety of mountain products appreciated by consumers (<b>EuroMARC,</b> 2009; European Commission, 2011). However, farmers face difficulties in valorising this potential marketing advantage and in getting a fair price for their products (European Commission, 2009). The use of quality labels has been proposed as a strategy to resolve this. To help promote their products, mountain actors across Europe {{use a variety of}} quality labels linked to mountain territories. Territorial labels have the potential to structure and govern food chains and are conceptualised as processes of respatialization/relocalization of food systems studied in the literature on origin-based quality in the food sector. This literature contextualises the shift from production to quality-driven system in the specific histories and networks of territories (Allaire & Sylvander, 1997; Allaire, 2002, 2010); it is particularly interested in understanding how the regulatory frames underlying quality labels are shaped by local organisational actors and generate collaborative structures (Allaire, 2002) ...|$|E
40|$|From 30 September to 22 October 2007 {{a cruise}} with the Royal NIOZ {{research}} vessel Pelagia {{was carried out}} {{within the framework of}} the ESF (<b>EuroMARC)</b> project CARBONATE. The goal of this cruise was to complete the existing data set of carbonate mounds present at the European Atlantic margin in order to be able to choose suitable coring sites to drill complete top to base sections through the carbonate mounds with the MeBo drilling device. This is a remotely operated drill that is placed at the sea floor and capable of drilling sediment cores with a maximum length of 85 metres. The drilling cruise, with the Irish research vessel Celtic Explorer, is planned to take place in the summer of 2008. During the Pelagia cruise 5 carbonate mound provinces were visited. The mounds were selected based on two main criteria: the mound provinces should represent different stages in mound development it must be possible to penetrate the mounds from top to base with the MeBo (expected maximum sequence thickness in the order of 75 m) The first area that was visited is located at the SE Rockall Bank margin. These mounds are characterised by abundant living cold water corals at their top. The second mound province that was visited is located at the SW Rockall Bank. Initially a large mound cluster known as Franken Mound was chosen for detailed studies. This mound, as well as smaller mounds in the vicinity, is dominated by dead corals and it is considered to be in what is often called the retirement stage. At theWand N margin of the Porcupine Bank two areas were visited. Most of the mounds occur as isolated structures. Only limited amounts of living cold water corals are present. The mounds in the last area that was visited are also referred to as the Magellan Mounds. This is a group of small (< 100 m) mounds located in the Porcupine Seabight. These mounds are mostly fully buried and thus represent the final stage of mound development. At all sites a multibeam bathymetric survey was carried out. Subsequently a benthic lander was deployed which was equipped for a period of 2 to 4 days to measure near bed hydrography and sediment transport. This was followed by seismic and video surveys. The initial results of the cruise indicate that at all proposed drilling sites carbonate mounds with a total thickness that can be penetrated by the MeBo are present. The video observations did not reveal the presence of any rough terrain that may hamper the positioning of the MeBo at the seabed...|$|E
40|$|Along the European Atlantic {{continental}} margin, recent {{to young}} (late Quaternary) fossil carbonate mounds and build-ups by cold-water corals (predominantly the framework forming ahermatypic corals Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata) occur from northern Norway to the Gulf of Cadiz with an emerging global distribution pattern showing a European concentration (see Roberts et al., 2006). These {{have been the}} focus of multi-disciplinary European investigations that has moved from the discovery phase (where and what are they) to a more applied stage (how do they function and what do we need to know). One key question is how do these ecosystems function through time and how do they respond to environmental forcing. Investigations so far reveal that all mounds possess different growth histories depending on the environmental setting and the involved faunal associations. Unfortunately, existing cores only penetrated the upper few meters of the mounds thus limiting mound research to the very late stage of mound development. Access to the longer sequences preserved in giant carbonate mounds was overcome in May 2005 when the IODP Expedition 307 (Porcupine Mound Drilling) recovered complete sedimentary records from the 155 m high “Challenger Mound” in the Porcupine Seabight west off Ireland, including the underlying strata and the enigmatic mound base. Shipboard and preliminary shore based investigations of the recovered sediments exposed complex internal mound sedimentary structures and sedimentary fabrics. Coral occurrences throughout the core stressed the biological influence on mound development and construction. The common occurrence of hardgrounds is indicative of harsh environmental controls on mound formation and development with diagenetic effects playing a progressive role in internal mound geochemical environment influencing cementation, dissolution, porosity and permeability. Up to now the carbonate stored in carbonate mounds has not been considered in any global carbonate budget or linked to any global carbon budget involving greenhouse gases. A major challenge exists to quantify the amount and flux of carbon stored by these newly discovered areas of enhanced carbonate accumulation in intermediate water depth (e. g. carbonate mounds). The only existing integrative cold-water coral carbonate budget that has been performed is on short, post-glacial cores relevant to the Norwegian shelf only, which suggests that these small cold-water coral carbonate mounds alone may account for an additional 1 % of total marine carbonate production (Lindberg et al., 2005). IODP has delivered one complete record from base to top of one carbonate mound in the Belgica Mound Province, Porcupine Seabight, NE Atlantic. EU FP projects have revealed late stage history of giant mounds in different settings showing that different mounds respond in different ways to environmental forcing factors with no one mound being typical of all. <b>EuroMARC</b> – CARBONATE hopes to study sequences through various mounds in different environmental settings. By understanding how biogeochemical processes control the development of these carbonate mounds and their response to climate change, we will make an important step in quantifying their role as mid-latitude carbonate sinks. In the end, {{a better understanding of the}} processes involved in mound formation and development may also result in new views on fossil analogues many of which are less accessible hydrocarbon reservoirs...|$|E
