40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mapping of the {{brachial plexus}} with MR imaging has been {{reported}} and may have potential clinical applications (eg, precise localization of traumatic or tumoral nerve lesions, selective anesthesia of the brachial plexus). We sought to demonstrate that mapping of the brachial plexus may be performed by means of sonography. METHODS: Twelve healthy adult volunteers (seven women and five men; age range, 24 – 38 years; mean, 31 years) underwent bilateral sonographic examination {{for the assessment of}} the nerve structures of the brachial plexus from the extraforaminal part to the axillary part. Four formolated cadavers (two male and two female; age range, 66 – 84 years; mean, 77. 5 years) were frozen and sawed into 3 -mm-thick contiguous sections in the same plane as that used for the sonographic exploration. RESULTS: A satisfactory sonographic examination was performed in 10 of 12 volunteers, leading to a good association with anatomic sections. Two volunteers were excluded from the study because a clear depiction of the brachial plexus was difficult owing to a short neck and low echogenicity at examination. The association between sonographic images and anatomic sections allowed us to map the brachial plexus. The subclavian and <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>arteries</b> wer...|$|R

40|$|International audienceStroke in {{patients}} with acute <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> dissection may be anticipated by initial transient ischemic or nonischemic symptoms. Identifying risk factors for delayed stroke upon <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> dissection. <b>Cervical</b> <b>artery</b> dissection patients from the multicenter <b>Cervical</b> <b>Artery</b> Dissection and Ischemic Stroke Patients study were classified as patients without stroke (n = 339), with stroke preceded by nonstroke symptoms (delayed stroke, n = 244), and with stroke at onset (n = 382). Demographics, clinical, and vascular findings were compared between the three groups. Patients with delayed stroke {{were more likely to}} present with occlusive <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> dissection (P < 0. 001), multiple <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> dissection (P = 0. 031), and vertebral artery dissection (P < 0. 001) than patients without stroke. No differences were observed in age, smoking, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, migraine, body mass index, infections during the last week, and trauma during the last month, but patients with delayed stroke had less often transient ischemic attack (P < 0. 001) and local signs (Horner syndrome and cranial nerve palsy; P < 0. 001). Occlusive <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> dissection, multiple <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> dissection, and vertebral artery dissection were associated with an increased risk for delayed stroke. No other risk factors for delayed stroke were identified.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of degenerative changes in the arteries supplying the cervicobrachial region, and their relation to cervical disc degeneration. METHODS [...] Fifty postmortem aortic arch angiographies were evaluated for occlusions and variations in {{the diameter of the}} vertebral arteries and thyro- and costocervical trunks, as well as for tortuosity, average diameter and the highest cervical level to which the ascending cervical artery, an upward continuation of the thyrocervical trunk, and the <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>artery,</b> an upward continuation of the costocervical trunk, ascended. RESULTS [...] Localised segmental narrowings, usually situated close to the ostia of the arteries, were common, whereas total occlusions were rare. Thirty (60 %) of the subjects showed a segmental narrowing at least in one of the six arteries analysed, while only two (4 %) showed an occluded artery, which in both the cases was the thyrocervical trunk. Narrowings were most common in vertebral arteries, followed by costocervical and thyrocervical trunks. Segmental narrowings, as well as general tortuosity of the arteries, increased with age. It was also found that ascending and deep cervical arteries did not run as high up in the posterior neck muscles in older people as in younger ones. Twenty three subjects with marked cervical disc degeneration showed on average 2. 3 arteries with segmental narrowings, while the corresponding figure for twenty seven subjects without disc degeneration was 0. 6. Both the segmental narrowings and the disc degeneration, however, were strongly associated with age, and thus the causality between the former two remained unclear. CONCLUSION [...] The study showed that degenerative changes are common in the arteries supplying the cervicobrachial area, indicating that impaired blood flow might play a part in some cervicobrachial disorders...|$|E
40|$|The {{subclavian artery}} (a. subclavia) is the intra{{thoracic}} {{portion of the}} parent vessel to each thoracic limb in the ground squirrel. It arises {{on the left side}} from the arch of the aorta (a. subclavia sinistra) and on the right side subclavia dextra) as a terminal branch of the innominate artery (a. anonyma) not far from the thoracic inlet. Before they leave the thoracic cavity and continue as the axillary arteries (a. axillaris) each subclavian artery forms the following branches: The internal thoracic artery (a. thoracica interna) with its branches (a. musculophrenica, a. epigastrica cranialis, ramus intercostalis and ramus sternalis) supplies the diaphragm the last eight intercostal muscles, the abdominal and intercostal muscles and the thoracic mammary gland with blood. The supreme intercostal artery (a. intercostalis suprema) with its branches (a. intercostalis I, II, III and IV and truncus bronchoesophagicus of the right supreme intercostal artery) supplies the first four intercostal muscles, esophagus, lung and mediastinum. The vertebral artery (a. vertebralis) is the main vessel which supplies the brain. Its branches (rami spinales, a basilaris, a. ethmoidea interna, a. cerebelli nasalis, a. cerebri profunda, a. cerebri media and a. corporis callosi) supply the spinal cord, medulla oblongata, pons, cerebellum, caudal colliculi, mucous membrane of the nasal cavity, mesencephalon, diencephalon cerebral hemispheres and corpus callosum and hemisphere. The omocervical trunk (truncus omocervicalis) is a strong vessel, which with its branches (ramus descendens, a. cervicalis ascendens, a. transversa scapulae and cervicalis superficialis) supplies the deep ventral cervical muscles with associated brown fat tissue and lymphonodes as well as the subscapular and supraspinatus muscles. The transverse colli artery (a. transversa colli) branches into the extrinsic muscle of the shoulder. The <b>deep</b> <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> (a. cervicalis profunda) conveys blood to the dorsal cervical muscles. The axillary artery (a. axillaris) is a continuation of the subclavian artery. Its branches (a. thoracoacromialis, a. thoracica externa, a. profunda brachii) supply the lateral and medial shoulder muscles and dorsal antebrachium muscles. The brachial artery (a. brachialis) is a continuation of the axillary artery. Its branches (rami musculares, a. bicipitalis, a. collateralis ulnaris, a. nutritia humeri, a. collateralis radialis proximalis and a. collateralis radialis distalis) conveys blood to the triceps and biceps muscles, humerus and flexor muscle of the antebrachium. The median artery (a. mediana) is a continuation of the brachial artery. Its branches (rami musculares, a. interossea communis, a. radialis and a. ulnaris) supply the flexor and extensor digit muscles...|$|E
40|$|The {{accessory}} ascending <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> (Murakami et al., 1996), which {{arises from}} the subclavian artery and ascends between the scalenus anterior and medius muscles, was studied in 87 Japanese adult cadavers (174 sides), with special attention being given to its origin, distribution, and relationship to other <b>arteries</b> at the <b>cervical</b> or scalenus region. In 154 sides (88. 5 %), the accessory ascending <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> was found to originate from the subclavian artery behind the scalenus anterior muscle, and to branch out to the scalenus anterior and medius muscles {{as well as those}} entering the 5 th and 6 th intervertebral foramens along the 6 th and 7 th <b>cervical</b> nerves. This <b>artery</b> arose independently in 105 sides. The accessory ascending <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> issued off or formed a common trunk with the transverse <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> and/or costocervical trunk in 49 sides. In cases lacking the accessory ascending <b>cervical</b> <b>artery,</b> it was usually compensated for by the costocervial trunk and/or transverse <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> (18 sides).

40|$|Introduction. Spontaneous {{dissection}} of the <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> {{is a rare}} non-atherosclerotic vascular {{disease of}} unknown aetiology and unclear pathogenesis {{that may be a}} cause of ischemic stroke in young adults. Diagnosis. Precise diagnosis of dissection of the <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> - carotid or vertebral - is possible with cervical axial magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography. Treatment. The recommended treatment in the acute phase of <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> dissection is anticoagulant or antithrombotic therapy, aimed at preventing a primary or recurrent ischemic event. There have been as yet no results of randomized controlled studies comparing efficacy of both treatments. An ongoing randomized multicentre study is expected to provide answers about the effects of these treatments in <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> dissection. Outcome. Complete resolution of arterial abnormalities is achieved in around 46 % of stenoses, 33 % of occlusions, and 12 % of dissecting aneurysms. Recurrent events. Recurrence of cerebral ischemia and <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> dissection seems to be rare, although some data suggest that early ischemic and late <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> dissection recurrences could be underestimated. Mortality and functional outcome. In comparison with other causes of stroke in young adults, the functional outcome of <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> dissection is good in contrast to its socio-professional effects, which may be unsatisfactory. The mortality rate of <b>cervical</b> <b>artery</b> dissection is low, although it may be underestimated since some patients with malignant infarction die before the diagnosis is established. Conclusion. Further research is warranted to improve our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, to assess the long-term outcome, and ultimately to provide treatment and prevention strategies...|$|R
