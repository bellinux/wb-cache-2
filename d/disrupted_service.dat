5|$|The Chino Hills {{earthquake}} caused no deaths {{or significant}} damage {{due to the}} physical location of its epicenter. Most of the infrastructure in the Chino Hills area is relatively new and well suited to withstand a large quake. Unlike previous earthquakes in the region—such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, which caused serious structural damage and fatalities—this quake caused only minor damage. However, the high volume of telephone use following the shock overloaded provider capacity and <b>disrupted</b> <b>service</b> into the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|When the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914 <b>disrupted</b> <b>service</b> to Belgium, Kroonland shifted to alternate routes. On {{a trip to the}} Mediterranean in October 1914, Kroonland was detained by British authorities at Gibraltar, and part of her cargo was confiscated amidst diplomatic wrangling between the then-neutral United States and the United Kingdom. During a chartered circumnavigation of South America in February 1915, Kroonland became the largest passenger ship to date to transit the Panama Canal. Kroonland was placed in New York – Panama Canal – San Francisco service until a landslide temporarily closed the canal to navigation. Returned to transatlantic service, Kroonland {{was one of the first}} U.S. ships armed by the Navy for defense against German submarine attacks. In May 1917 Kroonland was struck by a torpedo, which failed to detonate and only slightly damaged the ship.|$|E

Amtrak {{canceled}} {{service on}} the Pacific Surfliner between San Luis Obispo and Union Station in Los Angeles and Thruway Motorcoach buses transported Coast Starlight passengers from Union Station to Santa Barbara to board the trains. Metrolink {{service on the}} Ventura County Line was interrupted north of Chatsworth, and all service resumed {{four days after the}} accident.|$|E

On August 8, 2007, {{after more than}} [...] of rain fell within an hour, the subway system flooded, causing almost every subway service to either be disabled or seriously disrupted, effectively halting the morning rush. This was the third incident in 2007 in which rain <b>disrupted</b> <b>service.</b> The system was disrupted on this occasion because the pumps and drainage system can handle only a rainfall rate of [...] per hour; the incident's severity was aggravated by the scant warning as to {{the severity of the}} storm.|$|E
500|$|The Johnstown Inclined Plane {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places on June18, 1973. On July20, 1977, the incline was again used as an escape route, {{evacuating}} residents from the valley amid rising floodwaters. It also carried [...] "boats, emergency personnel, and equipment down to the valley to aid in rescue operations". The incline was again sold for $1 by Westmont borough on March8, 1983, to the Cambria County Transit Authority, now CamTran. CamTran initiated a $4.2million renovation on September7, 1983, replacing [...] "the incline's foundation piers, structural steel, and track." [...] The renovations were completed on August22, 1984, and the incline was rededicated on September6. It was designated an Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in September1994. A footbridge spanning Pennsylvania Route 56 between the incline and Vine Street was opened around the same time. On September1, 2000, the incline was closed when the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) undertook an $2.3million renovation of the bridge and the access road leading to the bridge. It was reopened in April 2001, but again closed in September to allow PennDOT to finish repairs to the bridge deck. The repairs were completed on December 14, 2001. A strong thunderstorm disrupted power to the incline on April16, 2010, stranding the cars and two passengers almost halfway down the slope; the rescue took three hours and ended when firefighters rappelled down the tracks to reach the car. The Johnstown Inclined Plane was closed from September9 to October14, 2010, for the installation of a new [...] "hoist brake shaft." [...] From October 29 to October 31, 2012, CamTran shut down the incline fearing power outages due {{to the passage of}} Hurricane Sandy. During the annual Thunder in the Valley motorcycle rally, two resistors failed and stopped the incline just outside the stations on June 28, 2014; repairs took approximately a month after having experts brought in diagnose the failure. Sensor issues briefly <b>disrupted</b> <b>service</b> in August2014 and, again, December2014 forcing the incline to start its winter maintenance period early.|$|E
2500|$|On May 10, 2008, two {{separate}} early morning fires at different power substations <b>disrupted</b> <b>service</b> on the Fremont line. No injuries were reported from the incident.

2500|$|While Connecticut {{was one of}} {{the hardest}} hit areas, the state was well-prepared for the storm and managed to avoid major problems. Hartford {{received}} a total of 21.9inches (55cm) of snow — the second largest snowfall since 1906. A total of 18inches (46cm) fell in the small Sandy Hook village. West Hartford totaled 27inches (69cm) and Fairfield saw 27.8inches (70.6cm) of snow. Despite the large amounts of snow, there were only isolated individual power outages. [...] At the storm's onset, governor M. Jodi Rell ordered all tractor-trailer trucks off the state's highways to facilitate the efforts of highway crews with snow removal. [...] Motorists whose vehicles were not equipped with 4-wheel drive were required to use snow chains to travel on state roadways during the storm. [...] Connecticut mobilized 2,500 state-owned and privately contracted snowplows to keep state highways open during the storm. [...] The state's 169 cities and towns employed hundreds of additional plows to keep local roads passable. [...] Bradley International Airport was closed for several hours, and the storm <b>disrupted</b> <b>service</b> on Metro North.|$|E

50|$|In April 1972, {{the ferry}} was {{returned}} to the dockyard for modifications, prior to entering service on the Sydney to Tasmania route.

Australian Trader fared poorly on the run: the service was dogged by bad reviews of the ship's design and amenities, while maritime union strikes <b>disrupted</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
