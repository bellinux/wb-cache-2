500|$|Conversely, Noel Murray of The Onions The A.V. Club graded [...] "Snakehead" [...] with a B+, {{explaining}} {{the focus on}} Walter was a [...] "smart choice by the Fringe team thematically". Murray continued, [...] "Ordinarily I'd be <b>griping</b> that this episode was yet another mythology-free time-waster, with a plot that—two-foot-long parasites aside—could be passed along to any other procedural show currently on the air. But I really enjoyed 'Snakehead,' both {{because of the way}} the story reflected who Walter is and because of all the little touches of character development and scene-setting.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the tracks on Otis Blue are cover versions, including three by Sam Cooke who had been shot dead the previous December. The album opens with the [...] "mournfully harried" [...] "Ole Man Trouble". For Claudrena N. Harold of PopMatters, the song {{is one of his}} most phantasmagoric tunes. The lyrics deal with a man, who is [...] "unable to escape the brutal realities of the blues", and has been compared with Paul Robeson's [...] "Ole Man River". [...] "Respect" [...] was inspired by a quote of drummer Al Jackson, Jr., who allegedly said to Redding after a tour, [...] "What are you <b>griping</b> about? You're on the road all the time. All you can look for is a little respect when you come home." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray {{had a more}} mixed reaction, {{giving the}} episode a rating of C+ and criticizing lead guest actor Cameron Monaghan, [...] "In this role, he was a drag, playing 'rebellious teen' in a stock, wooden way, with no extra layers. Also, nobody—not even Joshua Jackson, whom I've come to {{appreciate}} more as an actor over the run of this show—could make the 'My mind is being controlled!' scenes look anything other than goofy." [...] Murray also said, [...] "Yet for all my <b>griping,</b> I was quite taken with {{the theme of this}} episode, and the motifs that writers Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman and director Joe Chappelle used to support it. From the tinfoil Peter Pan hats that Walter and Astrid wear to Tyler popping the medication that grants him his powers out of a Pez dispenser, there's a lot in 'Of Human Action' about childish things." [...] Ramsey Isler from IGN graded the episode 8.0/10, explaining that despite it being a [...] "standalone" [...] episode, it was [...] "a high-intensity, action-filled tale that kept the adrenaline flowing. Fringe is usually more of a cerebral show, but there's nothing wrong with appealing to our love of action every now and then". Also positive was Chanel Reeder of Newsarama, who believed Fringe [...] "totally deliver in its most recent episode. The twists are back, along with the dramatic high intensity moments that the show is known for." [...] Reeder praised the plot twist of Tyler being the mind controller, and was pleased with the increased presence of Massive Dynamic.|$|E

500|$|Carl Marbach of AVweb wrote {{positively}} of {{the first}} portion of the book, but was critical of the latter half: [...] "On the whole, the book has some worthwhile sections notwithstanding the soap opera ramblings at the end. Read the first half, then pass it along to another pilot-friend." [...] John Clark of The Plain Dealer gave the book a positive review, but was also critical of the instructive section {{at the end of}} the book: [...] "Narratively, the book breaks down when Schiavo resorts to lists and tables to provide information to help the reader fly more safely." [...] Robert W. Poole Jr. reviewed the book for Reason, and called it [...] "valuable and frustrating". Poole noted [...] "Only an outsider-insider like Schiavo could provide ordinary people with authentic accounts of how badly off-track the FAA has gotten in its job of looking after aviation safety," [...] but commented that some aviation veterans regarded her as a [...] "loose cannon". Jerry Fraser of The Boston Globe was critical in his review of the book, and wrote that [...] "a book that sets out to be 'everything you need to know to travel safer by air' winds up <b>griping</b> about how the FAA reimburses employees for moving expenses and conducts crude management-training seminars". The book received a critical review from Bill Adair in the St. Petersburg Times, who wrote: [...] "Schiavo is right about many problems at the FAA. ... But Schiavo seems unable to offer a calm and constructive account of the FAA's problems. She'd rather grab headlines with wild and often inaccurate comments." ...|$|E
500|$|... "One of Those Days" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Sean Daly of The Washington Post {{commented that the}} song was [...] "likably [...] bouncy". Craig Seymour of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called the song a [...] "breezy girls'-night-out" [...] cut. Writer for Blues & Soul wrote that the song [...] "is an excellent slice of soulful mid-beat head nod R". They also commended the sampling of [...] "Between the Sheets", noting that it is [...] "effective". Ernest Hardy of LA Weekly had different opinions of the song. Although he deemed it an [...] "underrated single" [...] at first and wrote that it [...] "leaps beyond its work-sucks-the-rent's-late-I-need-a-date <b>griping</b> {{into the realm of}} existential letting", he later commented that the song is [...] "grounded in retort". Chuck Taylor of Billboard remarked that the song marks a [...] "triumphant return of one of the great singers, who delivers the goods in glorious voice." [...] He further commented that the production of the song would be able to convince her [...] "pop fans", and also praised the Isley Brothers sampling. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that the song could have been titled [...] "How Whitney Got Her Groove Back". He noted that the [...] "smooth" [...] track allows Houston to offer a restrained delivery of her vocals. Keysha Davis of BBC Music called the sampling of [...] "Between the Sheets" [...] as [...] "clever". Nakesa Mumbi Moody, of the Associated Press, wrote it was [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "dreamy". Writing for The Boston Globe, Joan Anderman called it a [...] "breezy" [...] track with a [...] "disturbingly trite" [...] theme. [...] The German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, in their review for [...] "One of Those Days" [...] called the song [...] "schmaltzy" [...] and wrote {{that it could have been}} done in the 1980s. Jimmy Draper of San Francisco Bay Guardian noted that [...] "the song seems so anticlimactic in comparison to the real-life pot". Jon Caramanica of Rolling Stone called the track [...] "creaky and unconvincing". Entertainment Weekly gave the remix single a D rating and commented negatively that [...] "this chaotic mess isn't likely to find an enthusiastic audience" [...] as the producer [...] "laid a random Nelly verse and some whistle beats on top of Houston's vocals. It's as if someone opened the door between two rooms and cranked warring stereos". Following Houston's death in 2012, Entertainment Weekly published a list of Houston's 25 best songs and ranked [...] "One of Those Days" [...] at number 19; they noted that it was [...] "an underrated single off an underrated album". They further commented that [...] "Whitney gave women of the world an instruction manual for pampering themselves in the Sex and the City era".|$|E

In 1857 in Knoxville, Tennessee, he founded a new paper, the Southern Citizen, to promote [...] "the value and virtue of slavery, both for negroes and white men", advocate the reopening of the African slave trade and encourage the spread of slavery into the American West. He moved the paper to Washington in 1859. When the Civil War broke out in 1861 he moved to Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital, to edit the powerful Richmond Enquirer. As a spokesman for the cause of the South, {{he was the first to}} claim that slavery and abolition were not the cause of the conflict but simply used as a pretence. Two of his sons died in the war, and a third lost an arm. He equated the Confederacy with Ireland, claiming that both were agricultural economies tied into an unjust union. The Union States and England were [...] "..the commercial, manufacturing and money-broking power... greedy, grabbing, <b>griping</b> and grovelling".|$|E
2500|$|Mrs Williams is Aubrey's mother-in-law. [...] In HMS Surprise, Maturin {{describes}} her as [...] "a deeply stupid, <b>griping,</b> illiberal, avid, tenacious, pinchfist, a sordid lickpenny and a shrew". It {{is hard to}} see any likeness of the mother in the daughter. Despite being stingy and obsessed with money, she is quite credulous and snobbish, which leads her to get involved in, for example, an illegal bookmaking operation, where she loses a great deal of her fortune and is threatened with arrest. When Aubrey is flush with funds after returning from The Mauritius Command, he takes care of her debts, so she again owns Mapes Court free and clear, but she prefers to lease it out and live with Sophia and her grandchildren at Ashgrove Cottage. Her harsh ways drive servants away until Aubrey staffs his household with seamen who are immune to her words, and keep up the house as they would a ship. When Aubrey is found guilty in a fraud on the stock exchange (in The Reverse of the Medal), then makes a fortune in prizes on the shake-down cruise of Surprise as a letter of marque (in The Letter of Marque), she is pleased, but believes him guilty as charged, and would do the same herself if she had the chance, as one must always guard one's capital. Mrs Williams dies in an accident when the coach in which she is riding, driven by her niece Diana Villiers-Maturin, overturns.|$|E
