40|$|Geotechnical {{centrifuge}} modelling {{provides a}} means by which geotechnical events and processes can be better understood. In particular, the technique has proved invaluable when investigating collapse mechanisms in small scale models that can be related to full scale events. A series of eight plane strain centrifuge model tests investigating the effect of inserting inclusions around the annulus of a single tunnel in over consolidated clay has been conducted using the geotechnical centrifuge at City University London. The model used a compressed air supported circular cavity to simulate the tunnel. Stiff resin inclusions embedded around its periphery were used to represent closely spaced forepoles forming grout umbrella arches. Image processing was used to obtain patterns of displacements at the subsurface and displacement transducers measured vertical settlement at the ground surface level. The investigation focused on how different arrangements of <b>forepoling</b> affected tunnel stability. The influence of <b>forepoling</b> on normally accepted plastic collapse mechanisms is discussed. An optimisation of the <b>forepoling</b> layout is uggested in accordance with the findings...|$|E

Through analyzing for the specific reasons of the rib spalling, the theory of <b>forepoling</b> pre-stressed system and <b>forepoling</b> support project were put forward. The broken rock zone test in normal roadway support indicating that this technology can effectively prevent the rib spalling before and after digging, having good supporting effect and economic benefits. Foreword Coal mining technology in China has developed rapidly in recent years, including mining craft and roadway support, etc. especially in recent years, with the improvement of supporting technology, drivage in coal seam going more and more adapt to the need of roadway exploit and production of coal mine. Compare with rock roadway drivage, excavating in coal can improve the speed of excavation, decrease {{the strength of the}} tunneling, and increase the coal production. But due to complex conditions of coal-forming in our country, making the geological conditions of coal seam occurrence diverse, bringing great difficulties to excavate in coal roadway. This article is under the background of Shendong coal district, where met weak coal sandwich when excavating in coa...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{concerns the}} effects of a <b>Forepoling</b> Umbrella System (FUS) that comprises steel pipes installed in a canopy shape above a tunnel heading to reduce ground movements induced by tunnelling. As an in tunnel reinforcement measure, FUS is known to be beneficial in reducing soil deformations at source and has been used in a number of projects. An extensive literature review was provided covering the framework of tunnelling-induced soil movements and current understanding of the FUS. That highlighted deficiencies in how key parameters of a FUS can be combined to produce effective support. The aim of the research was to investigate the relative effect of the system parameters to gain a clearer insight into achieving an optimal design of a FUS...|$|E
40|$|Generally {{tunnelling}} {{in urban}} ground condition {{is not always}} favourable due to the tunnels’ susceptibility to major displacement especially when excavated in the soft soil and/or weak weathered rock formation. Apart from conventional support systems, pre-support measure like <b>forepoling</b> umbrella arch is frequently used to reinforce the ground. Modern computational tools allows the inclusion of multi-stage excavations and pre-support which was not possible in two dimensional (2 D) plane strain. This paper demonstrates the three dimensional (3 D) finite element analysis of Pahang-Selangor raw water transfer tunnel, as a reference case, where multi-stage excavation and pre-support are incorporated as intrinsic part of the model. The New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) - 3 segments which encountered Grade III weathered granite, having shallow overburden cover, was selected for numerical analysis using RS 3 software. Comparison between simulated and observed data has shown good agreement during verification...|$|E
40|$|Adequate heading {{stability}} {{is crucial to}} the safe construction of any tunnel. Insufficient support will lead to ground movements which have the potential to cause damage to existing infrastructure. Congested urban environments have led to a requirement to minimise these tunnelling-induced deformations. <b>Forepoling</b> Umbrella Systems (FUS) have proved to be a beneficial soil reinforcement measure for controlling ground movements due to NATM tunnelling in urban areas. However, there is limited understanding of the influence of tunnel geometry and FUS parameters on its reinforcing efficiencies. A series of centrifuge tests has been conducted to investigate the benefits of FUS using different arrangements of steel pipes placed in a model tunnel heading at various depths. The results show the importance of the steel pipes near the tunnel spring-line and the embedded lengths on the reinforcing effects of forepoles. In addition, relative benefits of forepole location and embedded length are shown to vary as the soil cover above the tunnel changes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Gongbei Tunnel {{project at}} the Zhuhai link of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge is to be {{constructed}} by a new construction method – ―Freeze-Sealing Pipe Roof‖ (FSPR), serving as a <b>forepoling</b> system, combining with mining method. The primary {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the problem of frost heave in FSPR construction. The analyses of the influence of frost heave on the deformation of ground surface and the displacement of the pipes is conducted using numerical simulation. The results demonstrate that: (1) Within the actual buried depth of the tunnel, the buried depth has little impact on the deformation of pipe-roof and ground surface caused by frost heave; (2) Both the amount and the range of the deformation of ground is positively correlated to the thickness of the frozen-wall; (3) The uneven settlement of ground surface caused by frost heave is more obvious within 50 m away from the tunnel axis and therefore the gradient of surface elevation beyond 50 m is relatively slight; (4) The influence of the deformation of pipe-roof should be taken into consideration during the design of supporting structures as the deformation of pipe-roof caused by frost heave is closely related to the thickness of frozen-wall...|$|E
40|$|This study {{develops}} {{criteria for}} predicting blowouts in compressed air tunnels through an integrated design approach using empirical laboratory test {{data in a}} finite element model. Compressed air tunnelling is first reviewed {{in the context of}} temporary works, and the relative merits of compressed air as a support system are compared with that of other methods commonly used. Design methods for estimating the stability of tunnel faces in general are discussed along with the particular problems of stability against a blowout. The various mechanical processes that contribute to the formation of blowouts are then discussed, including unsaturated shear strength, desaturation processes, and seepage forces. A plausible mechanism which can be used analytically in studying blowouts is presented, whereby the How of air desaturates the soil causing mechanical failure, which is the result of serious reductions in effective stress due to increased pore pressures and seepage forces. The failure self propagates with changes in the soil properties. The permeability of soils with respect to compressible fluids is a complex property not only dependent on the soil properties but on fluid properties and pressures as well. Permeability with respect to air is presented as an empirical power function of pressure. Laboratory methods of measuring permeability with respect to air is discussed along with a description of all relevant apparatus. A finite element package developed by NAg software was used as the basic model of potential flow. The model was adapted to account for the progressive desaturation of the soil and its influence on permeability. The model was also modified to account for compressible flow using the Rayleigh-Janzen method of linearizing the compressible potential equation. The model was run for subaqueous tunnels of various diameters in sands of different silt contents beneath rivers of various depth. The amount of excess air pressure was varied and provision was made for a <b>forepoling</b> hood on the shield. Results show compressible flow and incompressible flow are essentially the same except at the crown of the tunnel face. Blowouts demonstrate the unique feature of propagating from the surface down {{as well as from the}} tunnel up, a phenomenon which is attributed to high seepage forces and negligible total stresses at the ground surface. The overall factor of safety is most sensitive under shallow rivers, and critical tunnel depth is independent of river depth. The data satisfy a linear relationship between critical depth and tunnel diameter, with smaller diameter tunnels requiring more cover relative to tunnel diameter than large diameter tunnels. The effect of a hood is most significant at high air pressures and in clean sands. The critical tunnel depth is directly proportional to air pressure and is slightly more sensitive for small tunnels than for large tunnels. The critical depth generally is not influenced by silt content. A significant exception is a large drop in critical depth for silt contents between 5 % and 10 %. The results of the study were summed up in a set of nomographs to provide practical aid to the design of tunnels against blowouts. They can be used to estimate safe cover depths and operating pressures, or to estimate factors of safety for a given set of operating conditions...|$|E
