5|$|The {{physical}} properties of gallium are highly anisotropic, i.e. have different values along {{the three major}} crystallographical axes a, b, and c (see table), producing {{a significant difference between}} the linear (α) and volume thermal expansion coefficients. The properties of gallium are strongly temperature-dependent, particularly near the melting point. For example, the coefficient of thermal expansion increases by several <b>hundred</b> <b>percent</b> upon melting.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiation}} {{amplified by}} hydroxyl masers is the radio continuum of its host. This continuum is primarily composed of synchrotron radiation produced by Type II supernovae. Amplification of this background is low, with amplification factors, or gains, {{ranging from a}} few percent to a few <b>hundred</b> <b>percent,</b> and sources with larger hyperfine ratios typically exhibiting larger gains. Sources with higher gains typically have narrower emission lines. This is expected if the pre-gain linewidths are all roughly the same, as line centers are amplified more than the wings, leading to line narrowing.|$|E

30|$|The initial {{promise of}} nanofluids as {{advanced}} heat transfer fluids {{was based on}} the increased thermal conductivity of nanoparticle suspensions.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the sf {{exchange}} model and by the method of Green functions, a many-body theoretical formulation is given to the problem of exchange enhancement of electronic specific heat in a ferromagnetic metal. By introducing the spin wave description of localized spins, the sf Hamiltonian is reduced to a form similar to the coupled electron-phonon system, and Dyson equations are solved by the Migdal approximation. For the same reason as is known in the electron-phonon case, we expect, independently of the detail of the model, the exchange enhancement of electronic specific heat may amount to <b>hundred</b> <b>percents...</b>|$|R
5|$|In Malaysia, {{large areas}} of {{rainforest}} were felled {{to make way for}} oil palm plantations and with few tree cavities for breeding, the barn owl population, with its ability to control rodent pests, diminished. The provision of two hundred nest boxes in a trial saw almost one <b>hundred</b> <b>percent</b> occupancy and as the programme expanded, the plantations supported one of the densest barn owl populations in the world. Similarly, providing nesting boxes has increased the number of barn owls in rice-growing areas of Malaysia where the rodents do much damage to the crop. However, although barn owl numbers have increased in both these instances, it is unclear as to how effective this biological control of the rats is as compared to the trapping and baiting that occurred previously.|$|E

Our renormalization group analysis claims that this mechanism for the enhancement of the critical temperature is not limited on superconductivity but applied to various Fermi surface instabilities, proposing an underlying universal structure, which turns out to be essentially identical to that of a recent study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 046601 (2012) ] on the enhancement of the Kondo temperature in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interactions.

Moreover, some emissions like nitrate leaching occur mainly during the fallow periods between crops. It is therefore preferable to compare farming systems in {{the perspective of a}} crop rotation. Three farming systems (medium intensive, extensified and low input) were assessed by LCA. Their environmental impacts differed by up to several <b>hundred</b> <b>percents</b> for single crops, but only between 1 % and 34 % for the crop rotation, due to mutually compensating effects of the crops and the effect of grass-clover ley.

25|$|Efficiency, like resolution, can be {{expressed}} in absolute or relative terms. The same units are used (i.e., percentages); therefore, the spectroscopist must take care to determine which kind of efficiency is being given for the detector. Absolute efficiency values represent {{the probability that a}} gamma ray of a specified energy passing through the detector will interact and be detected. Relative efficiency values are often used for germanium detectors, and compare the efficiency of the detector at 1332keV to that of a 3in×3in NaI detector (i.e., 1.2×10 −3cps/Bq at 25cm). Relative efficiency values greater than one <b>hundred</b> <b>percent</b> can therefore be encountered when working with very large germanium detectors.|$|E
