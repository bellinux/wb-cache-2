Shortly after the book's publication, Longfellow attempted to join the literary circle in New York and asked George Pope Morris for an editorial role at one of Morris's publications. He considered moving to New York after New York University proposed offering him a newly created professorship of modern languages, though {{there would be no}} salary. The professorship was not created and Longfellow agreed to continue teaching at Bowdoin. It may have been joyless work.

500|$|Bohr {{read the}} 19th-century Danish Christian existentialist philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard. Richard Rhodes argued in The Making of the Atomic Bomb that Bohr was {{influenced}} by Kierkegaard through Høffding. In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard's Stages on Life's Way as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, [...] "It {{is the only thing}} I have to send home; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it would be very easy to find anything better... I even think {{it is one of the}} most delightful things I have ever read." [...] Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with Kierkegaard's philosophy. Some of Bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard's advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an atheist.|$|E

Shelby stated, [...] "For the safety, security and well-being of our citizens, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> we can trust that we will be protected while in Aruba." [...] Prime Minister Oduber stated that Aruban investigators have done their best to solve the case, and responded to the call for boycott, [...] "This is a preposterous and irresponsible act.

Roosevelt's secretary refused to see them, but Frick and Gary convinced James Rudolph Garfield, the Secretary of the Interior, to bypass the secretary and arrange a meeting with the president. With less than an hour before the Stock Exchange opened, Roosevelt and Secretary of State Elihu Root began to review the proposed takeover and appreciate the crash likely to ensue if the merger was not approved. Roosevelt relented; he later recalled of the meeting, [...] "It was necessary for me to decide on the instant before the Stock Exchange opened, for the situation in New York was such that any hour might be vital. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> anyone could justly criticize me for saying that I would not feel like objecting to the purchase under those circumstances". When news reached New York, confidence soared. The Commercial & Financial Chronicle reported that [...] "the relief furnished by this transaction was instant and far-reaching". The final crisis of the panic had been averted.|$|E

500|$|In April 2013, Activision {{community}} manager Dan Amrich attempted {{to explain the}} acquisition history of the No One Lives Forever IP in a public video. This history includes the 2003 acquisition of NOLF publisher Fox Interactive by Vivendi Universal Games (who also owned Sierra Entertainment), {{as well as the}} 2008 merger between Vivendi Universal Games (VUG, which had since been renamed Vivendi Games) and video game publisher Activision, forming the Activision Blizzard holding company. After the merger, Activision decided to sell off some IPs and retain others. In order to find out the legal details behind NOLF, Amrich asked his colleagues, saying that [...] "he person that I normally talk to about this stuff does not believe that we [...] currently have the rights. They've never seen it, they've never been given the permission to put that stuff on [...] He said, basically, 'If we had it, I would {{love to be able to}} reissue those old games.'" [...] Amrich also asked a friend of his who working at NOLF developer Monolith (since acquired by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment), who also did not know who the IP belonged to. Amrich concluded that [...] "at this time <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Activision has the rights to No One Lives Forever." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{long-range}} American fighter was the twin-engined P-38 Lightning {{but none}} reached the South West Pacific Area until October 1942 and, beset {{with a host}} of mechanical difficulties, it was not until December 1942 that they flew their first major combat mission over New Guinea. Deliveries were suspended in January 1943 owing to the requirements of the North African Campaign, forcing Kenney to accept the P-47 Thunderbolt, the first of which arrived in Australia in July 1943. Early model P-47s had less range than P-40 Kittyhawks until [...] fuel tanks could be manufactured for them in Australia. These enabled the 348th Fighter Group to become operational in August 1943. While the tanks were very successful on the P-38s and P-40s, overloading the P-47s caused numerous crashes, and the pilots were reluctant to fly with more than [...] of fuel. In 1945, the P-47s were replaced by P-51 Mustangs. By September 1943, Wurtsmith's five fighter groups had 598 aircraft but this included 70 P-39s, 30 P-400s and 118 P-40s, half of which were in the depots. The technical representative of Bell Aircraft reported that the P-39s and P-40s averaged 300 combat hours. That of Curtiss-Wright similarly reported that the P-40s had from 300 to 500 combat hours, which was equivalent to about 2,000 normal hours. General Kenney wrote to General Henry H. Arnold that [...] "With the possible exception of Chennault, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> anyone else is flying stuff as old and worn out as these youngsters out here." ...|$|E
