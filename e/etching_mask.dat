30|$|The {{specimens}} {{were designed}} for both micro- and nanoscale structures, with a heater on the backside. To form the microstructures, an anisotropic wet-etching technique was used. The nanostructures were then fabricated on the microstructures by deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE). The presence of microstructures with sloped rather than vertical sidewalls is an important condition to ensure conformal formation of nanostructures. In order to fabricate microstructures with sloped sidewalls, a (100) silicon (Si) wafer was selected, owing to its unique sloped sidewall profile during the wet-etching process. A layer of thermally grown SiO 2 was then formed on the wafer, and the top layer was patterned, using a photolithographic technique, as an <b>etching</b> <b>mask</b> for microstructure formation. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide was used to etch the exposed area of the (100) Si wafer for 12 min at 90 °C. After the microstructures were formed, the Si <b>etching</b> <b>mask</b> was removed. A 20 -nm Ti layer and a 150 -nm Pt layer were then deposited and patterned on the backside of the wafer for Joule heating. Nanograss structures were then fabricated by DRIE (specifically, the black silicon method). Conformal formation of silicon nanograss structures {{was made possible by}} the sloped sidewalls.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a simple, low-cost, and reliable {{process for the}} fabrication of a microfluidic Fabry–Pérot cavity in a Pyrex glass substrate. The microfluidic channels were etched in HF solution on a glass substrate using a Cr/Au/photoresist <b>etching</b> <b>mask</b> resulting in a channel bottom roughness of 1. 309 nm. An ef-fective thermocompressive gold–gold bonding technique was used to bond the photolithographically etched glass substrates inside a 350 C oven in a 10 3 torr vacuum. Pressure {{was applied to the}} glass pieces by using two aluminum blocks with intermediate copper sheets. This method takes advantage of using Cr/Au layers both as a wet <b>etching</b> <b>mask</b> and as intermediate bonding layers, requiring only one lithography step for the entire process. The fabrication method is also compatible with the incorporation of dielectric mirror coatings in the channels to form a high-finesse Fabry–Pérot cavity. A parallelism of 0. 095 degrees was measured, and a finesse as high as 30 was obtained using an LED. The microfluidic cavity developed here can be used in electrophoresis and intracavity spectroscopy experiments.
