Tisdale toured for two years with Les Misérables before landing a role in a touring production of Annie in Korea.|$|E

2500|$|Chris Cutler {{was born}} in January 1947 in Washington, D.C. to a British foreign {{correspondent}} and his Austrian wife. In 1948 {{the family moved to}} England, where Cutler was brought up. He never studied music but tried his hand at banjo, guitar, trumpet and flute while at school. He finally settled for drums [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a band and drummers were scarcest." [...] Cutler formed his first band in 1963, playing Shadows and Ventures instrumental covers, then played in several R and soul bands. In 1966 he joined a band called Louise, with Tony Durant (later of Fuchsia), which performed on the London psychedelic club circuit for three years before breaking up. Looking for work, Cutler placed a series of advertisements in Melody Maker over a period of nine months in 1970. This put him in touch with a number of musicians which led to Cutler and keyboardist Dave Stewart of Egg forming The Ottawa Music Company, a 26 piece rock composer's orchestra, in 1971. Soon afterwards, Henry Cow, looking to replace the drummer who had just left them, responded to one of Cutler's adverts and invited him to a rehearsal.|$|E
