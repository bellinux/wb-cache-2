While the group members remain in quite good connectivity to each other, the communication to other groups gets frequently disrupted.

40|$|Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an {{emerging}} network control paradigm focused on logical centralization and programmability. At the same time, distributed routing protocols, most notably OSPF and IS-IS, are still prevalent in IP networks, as they provide shortest path routing, fast topological convergence after network failures, and, perhaps most importantly, the confidence based on decades of reliable <b>operation.</b> Therefore, a <b>hybrid</b> SDN/OSPF <b>operation</b> remains a desirable proposition. In this paper, we propose a new method of <b>hybrid</b> SDN/OSPF <b>operation.</b> Our method {{is different from}} other hybrid approaches, as it uses SDN nodes to partition an OSPF domain into sub-domains thereby achieving the traffic engineering capabilities comparable to full SDN operation. We place SDN-enabled routers as sub-domain border nodes, while {{the operation of the}} OSPF protocol continues unaffected. In this way, the SDN controller can tune routing protocol updates for traffic engineering purposes before they are flooded into sub-domains. While local routing inside sub-domains remains stable at all times, inter-sub-domain routes can be optimized by determining the routes in each traversed sub-domain. As the majority of traffic in non-trivial topologies has to traverse multiple sub-domains, our simulation results confirm that a few SDN nodes allow traffic engineering up to a degree that renders full SDN deployment unnecessary.

40|$|AbstractTower concentrating {{systems with}} direct molten salt heat {{transfer}} and storage can deploy particularly inexpensive and scalable thermal storage, enabling cost-effective 24 -hour generation using only solar energy. While typical capacity factors (CFs) for intermittent renewables are generally between 20 % and 40 %, the SolarReserve Crescent Dunes project will offer above 50 %. This paper discusses how SolarReserve's CSP technology can cost-effectively produce a CF over 80 %, and when hybridized with PV, {{can raise the}} CF further to roughly 90 %. A detailed operational model of a hybrid system in Chile's Atacama Desert was produced, using localized data on weather and interconnection capacity, to illustrate this capability. Analysis of high CF CSP-PV hybrids leads to three important conclusions. First, {{it was found that}} effective configuration of high CF systems supported selection of fixed-tilt PV at a high angle, which is optimized for winter generation in order to minimize seasonal differences. Second, when a dispatch strategy was developed which incorporated multiple priority levels and which dispatched CSP in response to PV output, it enabled higher CF CSP-PV <b>hybrid</b> <b>operations</b> than the CSP accomplished alone. Third, it was found that average annual DNI was not a sufficient metric of solar resource, and that seasonal variability and consolidation of non-optimal days were also important to high CF designs. New metrics for solar resource measurement are proposed and discussed...|$|R
