40|$|We have {{developed}} a high-performance liquid chromatographic-UV-Vis-diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) method for the determination of <b>ethyl-p-hydroxybenzoate,</b> a hydrolytic degradation product of the synthetic protease inhibitor, gabexate-mesilate ethyl-p-(6 -guanidinohexanoyloxy) benzoate methanesulfonate (GM) (FOY) in sow pancreatic juice. Methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate (I) {{was used as the}} internal standard. The pancreatic juice was deproteinised by acetonitrile and the analytes were chromatographed on a reversed-phase C 18 LC column using the gradient elution method. The mobile phase consisted of a solution of 0. 017 M orthophosphoric acid and another solution of acetonitrile-water (80 : 20, v/v). The wavelength of detection was 237 nm. The limit of quantification of the method was 0. 20 μM at a 9 : 1 signal-to-noise ratio. The overall intra- and inter-day accuracy (relative error, RE) ranged from 14. 2 to 8. 3 % and from 13. 3 to 9. 8, respectively. The overall intra- and inter-day precision (relative standard deviation, RSD) ranged from 7. 6 to 2. 62 % and from 6. 7 to 3. 1 %, respectively. The method proved to be sensitive, specific, accurate and precise and was successfully used to determine the <b>ethyl-p-hydroxybenzoate</b> (II) in sow pancreatic juice. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.
