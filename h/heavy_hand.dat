On some decisions, Mao sought to mitigate the Gang's influence, but on others, he acquiesced to their demands. The Gang of Four's <b>heavy</b> <b>hand</b> in political and media control did not prevent Deng from reinstating his economic policies. Deng emphatically opposed Party factionalism, and his policies aimed to promote unity {{as the first step}} to restoring economic productivity.|$|E

Another negro, arrested on a similar charge, had his foot cut off, after which he was confiscated to the governor's use and put to work in his kitchen.|$|E
25|$|The {{term was}} coined in 1943 by the German biblical scholar Martin Noth {{to explain the}} origin and purpose of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. These, he argued, were {{the work of a}} single 6th-century BCE author seeking to explain recent events (the fall of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile) using the {{theology}} and language of the book of Deuteronomy. The author used his sources with a <b>heavy</b> <b>hand,</b> depicting Joshua as a grand, divinely guided conquest, Judges as a cycle of rebellion and salvation, and the story of the kings as recurring disaster due to disobedience to God.|$|E

25|$|The 1848 {{revolution}} {{had mixed}} {{results for the}} Catholic Church in Austria-Hungary. It freed the Church from the <b>heavy</b> <b>hand</b> {{of the state in}} its internal affairs, which was applauded by Pius IX. Similar to other countries, Austria-Hungary had significant anti-Catholic political movements, mainly liberals, which forced the emperor Franz-Joseph I in 1870, to renounce the 1855 concordat with the Vatican. Austria had already in 1866 nullified several of its sections concerning the freedom of Catholic schools and prohibition of civil marriages. After diplomatic approaches failed, Pius responded with an encyclical on 7 March 1874, demanding religious freedom and freedom of education. Despite these developments, there was no equivalent to the German Kulturkampf in Austria, and Pius created new dioceses throughout Austria-Hungary.|$|E
25|$|On {{the accusations}} of being docile, Mathieu writes in her {{autobiography}} {{that she and}} Johnny Stark understood each other. She {{wanted to be a}} singer, and he was tired of people who just wanted to be famous. They were both hard workers, and he kept her schedule filled with lucrative contracts. She also writes that she was forbidden to read the press, and, having peeked at some of it, was content to follow that rule. Stark, of course, had a <b>heavy</b> <b>hand</b> in manipulating the press. Mireille writes that her mother was often surprised to read on the front page that she was engaged to someone famous, or {{was going to be in}} a movie by some famous director. Her guiding principle was just to sing, and never have her family return to the tenements of Croix des Oiseaux.|$|E
500|$|Both {{newspapers}} {{went into}} gradual decline under their new proprietors. James Gordon Bennett, Jr.—"a swaggering, precociously dissolute lout who rarely stifled an impulse"—had a mercurial reign. He launched the New York Telegram, an evening paper, {{in the late}} 1860s and kept the Herald the most comprehensive source of news among the city's newspapers. [...] Bennett also bankrolled Henry Morton Stanley's trek through Africa to find David Livingstone, and scooped the competition on the Battle of Little Big Horn. However, Bennett ruled his paper with a <b>heavy</b> <b>hand,</b> telling his executives {{at one point that}} he was the [...] "only reader of this paper": [...] "I am the only one to be pleased. [...] If I want it turned upside down, it must be turned upside down. [...] I want one feature article a day. If I say the feature is black beetles, black beetles it's going to be." [...] In 1874, the Herald ran the infamous New York Zoo hoax, where {{the front page of the}} newspaper was devoted entirely to fabricated story of animals getting loose at the Central Park Zoo.|$|E

2500|$|Paul {{believes}} that juries deserve {{the status of}} tribunals, and that jurors {{have the right to}} judge the law as well as the facts of the case. [...] "The concept of protecting individual rights from the <b>heavy</b> <b>hand</b> of government through the common-law jury is as old as the Magna Carta. The Founding Fathers were keenly aware of this principle and incorporated it into our Constitution." [...] He notes that this principle is also stated in Thomas Paine's Rights of Man, Supreme Court of the United States decisions by Chief Justice John Jay, and writings of Thomas Jefferson.

2500|$|Louis Marie Turreau {{took over}} the {{direction}} of the conflict on 30 December. Turreau started a campaign of savage repression against the Vendeans by [...] "infernal columns" [...] on 24 January 1794. The columns roamed the countryside burning farms and killing any rebels they caught, including in many cases, women and children. Instead of ending the revolt, the severity of the repression provoked a fresh uprising. The <b>heavy</b> <b>hand</b> of the undisciplined Republican armies sometimes fell on those citizens who were loyal and, for this, the government suspended Turreau on 13 May. During the operation Amey commanded a garrison at Les Herbiers. According to one account his troops were guilty of some of the worst excesses. He was suspended for a month beginning in August 1794. Few generals who served in the Vendée {{during the first half of}} 1794 had successful careers; Amey and Georges Joseph Dufour became the exceptions.|$|E

The army numbered 4,000 fewer men than it had when it began the campaign. On the 14th, Soult turned back to the west and split his army into several columns. One column reoccupied Almería while the others began to hunt down the guerilla bands. The French laid a <b>heavy</b> <b>hand</b> on the countryside, sacking villages and shooting people out of hand. Soult also exhibited harshness. During the campaign, the French captured Charles Cléry, an émigré officer, the son of the servant of King Louis XVI of France. Though the man had since served in both the Austrian and Spanish armies, Soult had the man court-martialled and shot.|$|E

2500|$|The {{relationship}} of 52 to P.Egerton 2 has been further re-examined in detail by Stanley E. Porter. Porter offers two further comparator early biblical papyri for both texts, P. Oxy IV 656 (a fragment of Genesis) and P.Vindob. G. 2325 (another apocryphal gospel, the Fayum Fragment); {{and provides a}} wide-ranging survey of the history and range of opinion amongst papyrologists for the dating of 52 and P.Egerton 2, presenting arguments to support Robert's judgement that the two are close parallels, that {{they are unlikely to}} be of widely separate dates, and that 52 is more likely the earlier. Specifically he notes that P.Egerton 2 is in [...] "a less <b>heavy</b> <b>hand</b> with more formal rounded characteristics, but with what the original editors called [...] "cursive affinities"." [...] Porter adds that [...] "Both manuscripts were apparently written before the development of a more formal Biblical majuscule style, which began to develop in the late second and early third centuries." [...] In this respect, Porter also notes that although the hooked apostrophe form found in the Cologne fragment of P.Egerton 2 is unusual in the second century, {{there is at least one}} known dated example in a papyrus of 101 CE and three others of mid or late second century date. [...] "The result is to bring the two manuscripts together, somewhere in the middle of the second century, perhaps tending towards the early part of it." ...|$|E
