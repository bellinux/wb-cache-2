5000|$|The {{first two}} Lombard <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> were used near Eustis, Maine, in 1901 prior to {{construction}} of the Eustis Railroad. These early machines had an upright boiler and were steered {{by a team of}} horses. Most of the Lombard <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> were used in Maine and New Hampshire. A few were used in Michigan, Wisconsin and Russia. Lombard began building 6-cylinder gasoline-powered <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> in 1914, produced a more powerful [...] "Big 6" [...] later, and built one Fairbanks-Morse Diesel engine hauler in 1934. The internal combustion <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> were less powerful than the steam <b>log</b> <b>haulers.</b> The steam-powered haulers are thought to have been used as late as 1929.|$|R
50|$|Antarctic Mount Lombard {{was named}} in {{recognition}} of the Lombard <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler</b> as the first application of knowledge of snow mechanics to trafficability. The Lombard Steam <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler</b> was designated a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1982 following nomination by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.|$|R
50|$|An {{effective}} continuous {{track was}} invented and implemented by Alvin Orlando Lombard for the Lombard Steam <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler.</b> He {{was granted a}} patent in 1901 and built the first steam-powered <b>log</b> <b>hauler</b> at the Waterville Iron Works in Waterville, Maine, the same year. In all, 83 Lombard steam <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> {{are known to have}} been built up to 1917, when production switched entirely to internal combustion engine powered machines, ending with a Fairbanks diesel-powered unit in 1934. Undoubtedly, Alvin Lombard was the first commercial manufacturer of the tractor crawler.|$|R

50|$|Alvin Orlando Lombard was a {{blacksmith}} building logging equipment in Waterville, Maine. He built 83 steam <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> between 1901 and 1917. These <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> resembled a saddle-tank steam locomotive {{with a small}} platform {{in front of the}} boiler where the cow-catcher might be expected. A steering wheel on the platform moved a large pair of skis beneath the platform. A set of tracked vehicle treads occupied the space beneath the boiler where driving wheels might be expected. The locomotive cylinders powered the treads through a gear train. The <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> mechanically resembled 10- to 30-ton snowmobiles with a top speed of about 4.5 mph.|$|R

50|$|In {{a patent}} dispute {{involving}} rival crawler builder Best, testimony {{was brought in}} from people including Lombard, that Holt had inspected a Lombard <b>log</b> <b>hauler</b> shipped out to a western state by people who would later build the Phoenix <b>log</b> <b>hauler</b> in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, under license from Lombard. The Phoenix Centipeed typically had a fancier wood cab, steering wheel tipped forward at a 45 degree angle and vertical instead of horizontal cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} operational difficulty was on downhill grades where ice {{allowed the}} sleds to accelerate {{faster than the}} engine. Jack-knifing sleds pushed many <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> into trees, and most photos of <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> show rebuilt cabs and bent ironwork on the boiler and saddle tank. Hay was spread over the downhill routes {{in an effort to}} increase friction under the sleds, but hungry deer sometimes consumed the hay before the train arrived.|$|R
5000|$|The Phoenix Manufacturing Company {{produced}} {{a number of}} new products for the lumber milling industry. In 1887, Phoenix introduced a new band-type mill saw, known as the Esplin mill. This was followed by the Emerson bandmill, and later the Phoenix light bandmill, known for producing the [...] "largest cut of perfect sawed lumber for the least outlay". The firm also furnished building parts such as arches, plates, and columns. Many structures in the Eau Claire still feature slim support columns marked with the Phoenix name. The company's largest success was with the Phoenix <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler,</b> a licensed version of a Lombard Steam <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler.</b> Over 100 of these <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> were produced. Due to greater competition from gasoline tractors, particularly the Holt tractor, Phoenix began manufacturing the Phoenix Centipede Truck for agricultural and construction use.|$|R
50|$|Berlin Mills Company {{was one of}} {{the larger}} woods {{operators}} to use Lombard <b>log</b> <b>haulers.</b> They purchased one machine in 1904, and then purchased two more to maintain reliable operation when one needed repairs. The company maintained a single 6 mi iced haul road in Stetson, Maine, by nightly application of water from a sprinkler sled, and strung a telephone line with frequent call boxes to dispatch sled trains over that road. The company estimated those three Lombard <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> did the work of 60 horses.|$|R

50|$|While {{the ground}} was covered with snow and ice, a <b>log</b> <b>hauler</b> could tow a string of sleds filled with logs. Each sled train {{required}} a crew of four men. An engineer and fireman occupied the cab behind the boiler, and a steersman sat on the platform in front. A conductor rode on the sleds with a bell-rope or wire to signal the crew in the cab. The earliest <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> pulled three sleds, and later models were designed to pull eight sleds. Each train carried 40,000 to 100,000 board-feet of logs. The record train length {{was said to be}} 24 sleds with a total length of 1650 ft.|$|R
50|$|Alvin Orlando Lombard was the {{inventor}} of the track-wheeled vehicle. First patented in 1901, the Lombard Steam <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler</b> revolutionized the movement of harvested logs through the woods and set the stage for every snowmobile, tank and bulldozer ever built.|$|R
50|$|The {{applications}} include semi-trailer <b>haulers,</b> earthmovers, <b>logging</b> vehicles, flatbed <b>haulers</b> and tankers. Bronto Skylift used R-142 chassis for its 32-metre high reaching aerial platforms. The 6×4-driven R-143 {{was targeted}} to poor terrain conditions and closed construction sites without weight restrictions; the 4×4+2-driven R-145 was in particular for logging use {{on and off}} road conditions. The 1978 launched R-146 6×6 was designated to haul heavy flatbed trailers and it was made by combining existing components of the range.|$|R
50|$|Phoenix found {{particular}} {{success in}} 1903, manufacturing a steam <b>log</b> <b>hauler</b> under patent rights from Orlando Lombard. This, along with logging sleighs, snow plows and machinery for making logging roads, necessitated an expansion in 1907, adding a larger machine shop and boiler room.|$|R
50|$|The Lombard Steam <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler,</b> {{patented}} 21 May 1901, was {{the first}} successful commercial application of a continuous track for vehicle propulsion. The concept was later used for military tanks during World War I and for agricultural tractors and construction equipment following the war.|$|R
50|$|The first {{commercial}} continuous track vehicle was the 1901 Lombard Steam <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler.</b> The use of tracks became popular for tanks during World War I, and later for civilian machinery like the bulldozer. The largest engineering vehicles and mobile land machines are bucket-wheel excavators, built since the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|Other attractions in Wabeno include: {{an old-fashioned}} band shell {{located in the}} {{downtown}} green, a logging museum, a rare, and still functional, steam-powered Phoenix <b>log</b> <b>hauler,</b> a 20 ft fiberglass statue of Larry the Logroller, a World War II-era Sherman tank, and a nineteenth-century log cabin still in use as the Wabeno Public Library.|$|R

She was modified by Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing Co., of Lauzon, Quebec, {{for use as a}} <b>log</b> <b>hauler.</b> She later sunk, or was sunk, [...] off of St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands.|$|R
50|$|The concept {{originated}} with the hauling of logs {{in the northeastern}} US, with the Lombard Steam <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler</b> built by Alvin Lombard of Waterville, Maine, from 1899 to 1917. The vehicle resembled a railway steam locomotive, with sled steering (or wheels) in front and at the rear, crawlers driven by chains instead of the driving wheels of a locomotive.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the winter}} of 1926-27, Édouard Lacroix's Madawaska Company used <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> to move heavy railway {{equipment}} overland from Lac-Frontière, Quebec to Churchill Depot and then over frozen Churchill Lake and Eagle Lake. The <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> delivered two steam locomotives, two Plymouth gasoline-powered switchers, miles of steel rail, and sixty railroad cars for carrying pulpwood. Each railroad car was 32 feet (9.7 m) long with high, slatted sides to hold 12 cords of pulpwood. Three diesel-powered conveyors were built to lift pulpwood logs from Eagle Lake to a height of 25 feet (7.6 m) over a distance of 225 feet (68 m). Each conveyor could fill a railroad car in 18 minutes. Lacroix completed the Umbazooksus and Eagle Lake Railroad to a pulpwood unloading trestle {{at the north end}} of Umbazooksus Lake. Lacroix's railroad included a 1500-foot (460 m) long trestle across the north end of Chamberlain Lake.|$|R
5000|$|Wells [...] - [...] The {{hamlet of}} Wells, located on Route 30 and Algonquin Lake, {{which is a}} {{widening}} of the main branch of the Sacandaga River, originally created by a dam that powered a veneer mill c. 1910. In 1913, the first known gas-powered <b>log</b> <b>hauler</b> in the Adirondacks, a Lombard, {{was used by the}} veneer company between here and Speculator.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} {{acquired}} by the Holt Manufacturing Company in 1908 after a legal battle. C. L. Best, {{the son of the}} founder then formed his own rival company, the C. L. Best Gas Traction Company which built gasoline-powered tractors. This new company acquired the rights to manufacture the Lombard Steam <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler,</b> an early tracked crawler, and began producing [...] "tracklayer" [...] tractors.|$|R
50|$|The Alvin O. Lombard House is a {{historic}} house at 65 Elm Street in Waterville, Maine. Built in 1908, it is a distinctive local example of late Shingle style architecture. It is further notable {{as the home of}} inventor Alvin O. Lombard, who developed the Lombard Steam <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler,</b> an early commercial use of track-propelled vehicles. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.|$|R
50|$|At {{least one}} of Lombard's steam-powered {{machines}} apparently remains in working order. A gasoline-powered Lombard hauler is {{on display at the}} Maine State Museum in Augusta. In addition, there may have been up to twice as many Phoenix Centipeed versions of the steam <b>log</b> <b>hauler</b> built under license from Lombard, with vertical instead of horizontal cylinders. In 1903, the founder of Holt Manufacturing, Benjamin Holt, paid Lombard $60,000 for the right to produce vehicles under his patent.|$|R
5000|$|Benjamin Holt of the Holt Manufacturing Company of Stockton, California was {{the first}} to file a US patent for a {{workable}} crawler type tractor in 1907. [...] The centre of such innovation was in England, and in 1903 he travelled to England to learn more about ongoing development, though all those he saw failed their field tests. Holt paid Alvin Lombard [...] for the right to produce vehicles under Lombard's patent for the Lombard Steam <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler.</b>|$|R
50|$|Just to {{the north}} of the viaduct, the Makatote Tramway has a Category 2 listing by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, with {{remnants}} of rails, skid sites, a <b>log</b> <b>hauler,</b> water pits and bogie wheels. In the 1930s Western Red Cedar and Lawson's Cypress were planted near the tramway by the State Forests Service as part of a wider experimental high-altitude planting programme. Japanese Cedar, Douglas Fir, Ponderous Pine, Weymouth Pine and Sugar Pine were also considered for the experiment.|$|R
5000|$|Mount Lombard (...) is {{the highest}} peak {{dominating}} the mountain mass whose southern extremity is Cape Sobral, Graham Land, Antarctica, and surmounting Mundraga Bay to the west. It was mapped from surveys by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (1960-61), and was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee for American engineer Alvin O. Lombard of the Lombard Steam <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler</b> Company, Waterville, Maine, who designed {{some of the earliest}} successful over-snow tractors, the first application of knowledge of snow mechanics to trafficability, 1901-13.|$|R
50|$|The {{house was}} built in 1908; its {{architect}} is not known. It was built for Alvin O. Lombard, a Waterville native, who lived there for {{the last third of}} his life. Lombard is credited with developing an early version of caterpillar tracks, a vehicular propulsion mechanism that eventually saw broad application in a variety of application, most notably in military vehicles and earthmoving equipment. The Lombard Steam <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler</b> was Lombard's effort to capitalize on this invention. He also patented a turbine water wheel control mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Alvin O. Lombard of Waterville, Maine {{was issued}} a patent in 1901 for the Lombard Steam <b>Log</b> <b>Hauler</b> {{that resembles a}} regular {{railroad}} steam locomotive with sled steerage on front and crawlers in rear for hauling logs in the Northeastern United States and Canada. The s allowed pulp {{to be taken to}} rivers in the winter. Prior to then, horses could be used only until snow depths made hauling impossible. Lombard began commercial production which lasted until around 1917 when focus switched entirely to gasoline powered machines. A gasoline-powered hauler is on display at the Maine State Museum in Augusta, Maine.|$|R
5000|$|Spruce {{forests of}} the Maine North Woods were a source of {{pulpwood}} through the 20th century. Trees were bucked into 4 ft lengths and loaded onto sleds towed by draft animals or <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> to the nearest river or lake. Log drives would float the pulpwood logs to a downstream paper mill when the snow and ice melted. [...] Pulpwood growing in the upper Saint John River drainage was destined for Great Northern Paper Company's Millinocket mill on the West Branch Penobscot River. The problem was getting the pulpwood out of the north-flowing Saint John River into the east-flowing Penobscot River.|$|R
50|$|The {{steersman}} {{was regarded}} as {{the hero of the}} crew. In sub-freezing temperatures down to 40 degrees below zero, he sat in an exposed position in front of the train. Sparks flying out of the boiler stack above him would sometimes set his clothing afire as avoidance of trees required his full attention and effort turning the clumsy steering wheel. Some steersmen earned enough money to purchase fire-resistant leather clothing. Some <b>log</b> <b>haulers</b> had a small roofed shelter built on the steering platform, but the shelter limited the steersman's ability to jump clear when collision became inevitable, and few were able to avoid injury from the following trainload of logs.|$|R
