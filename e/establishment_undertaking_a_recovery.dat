40|$|While Mazagão {{represents}} the long-lasting Portuguese new settlement in Northern Africa (1514 - 1769), the Portuguese urban experience was mainly {{made by the}} occupation of existing Muslim cities. In fact, between 1415 and 1513, six coastal cities were seized from the kingdoms of Fes and Marrakesh (today Morocco). These <b>establishments</b> <b>undertook</b> <b>an</b> occupational praxis over pre-existent Islamic fabrics and implied a re-dimensioning and street layout revision. Case studies present, nevertheless, different perspectives {{in terms of how}} the narrow Portuguese stratum marked their urban image at a time when urban concepts and practices were being modernized through the experience with the founding of medieval new towns and the renovating hygienist spirit underlying an emerging modernity in Europe. Levels of adaptation or creation vary and the sources for their identification are scarce. Apart from Spanish Ceuta and Ksar Seghir, the thin Portuguese stratum is encapsulated between long Islamic periods. How is it possible to recover this particular European urban legacy? Ceuta and Tangier, major strongholds in the Strait of Gibraltar, have always gathered considerable cartography. However, in other cities the existence of any kind of historical mapping is almost absent. Through urban fabric analysis and resulting from recent field research, especially in Azemmour, Asilah and Safi, this paper wishes not only to unveil the Portuguese layer but, most significantly, to contribute for the identification of tools for that purpose. Despite centuries of Arab-Islamic re-occupation, urban morphology methodologies allow retrospective keys to the reading of important urban clashes occurred from mid 1400 s till the early 1500 s that still mark these cities’ present shape and street display. This paper will explore the interpretation of contemporary Islamic tissues in order to identify early-modern Portuguese urban signs in a retrospective approach...|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{and timely}} {{delivery}} of messages between processing nodes {{is essential in}} distributed real-time systems Failure to deliver a message within its deadline usually forces the system to <b>undertake</b> <b>a</b> <b>recovery</b> action, which introduces some cost (or overhead) to the system This recovery cost can be very high, especially when the recovery action fails {{due to lack of}} time or resources. Proposed in this paper is a scheme to minimize the expected cost recurred as a result of messages failing to meet their deadhnes. The scheme is mtended for distributed real-time systems, especially with a pomt-to-point interconnection topology The goal of minimizing the expected cost M achieved by sending multiple copies of a message through disjoint routes and thus mcreasmg the probability of successful message delivery within the deadhne. However, as the number of copies increases, the message traffic on the network increases, thereby increasing the dehvery time for each of the copies. There m therefore a tradeoff between the number of copies of each message and the expected cost incurred as a result of messages missmg their deadlines The number of copies of each message to be sent is determined by optimizing this tradeoff Simulation results for a hexagonal mesh and a hypercube topology indicate that the expected cost can be lowered substantially by the proposed scheme.

The assessment was made by comparing the predictions of the two methods with experimental pressure distributions and boattail pressure drag for several convergent circular-arc nozzle configurations. Comparisons of the predictions of the two methods with the experimental data showed that both methods provided good predictions of the flow characteristics of nozzles with attached boundary layer flow. The RAE method also provided reasonable predictions of the pressure distributions and drag for the nozzles investigated that had separated boundary layers. The NASA method provided good predictions of the pressure distribution on separated flow nozzles that had relatively thin boundary layers. However, the NASA method was in poor agreement with experiment for separated nozzles with thick boundary layers due primarily to deficiencies in the method used to predict the separation location...|$|R

The identified species were the Opuntia leucotricha DC., Opuntia stricta (Haw.) Haw., Opuntia monacanta (Willd.) Haw., Austrocylindropuntia subulata (Muehlenpf.) Backeb. and Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill. (2 unknown varieties), which Opuntia ficus-indica is most interesting variety from the agronomic point of view. The fruits of O. ficus-indica have little acidity, high content of vitamin C, total phenols and TSS and {{a considerable amount of}} seeds (> 150). From the 2 varieties of O. ficus-indica (fruits with light-green pulp and orange pulp), the former shows better physical-chemical features comparing with the orange pulp fruit cultivar. This study demonstrates the high potential of the O. ficus-indica´s fruits as source of natural antioxidants and that the consumption of fruits and subproducts can provide substantial amounts for the human diet.

40|$|Abstract—Much {{of modern}} {{software}} development consists of assembling together existing software components and writing the glue code that integrates {{them into a}} unified application. The term COTS-Based System (CBS) {{is often used to}} describe such applications, for which the components assembled are understood to be Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components written by a multitude of independent third parties. The manner of assembly in CBS includes full-source components that are integrated at compile-time, pure-binary libraries incorporated at loadtime, and plugins that are loaded into the application at execution time by the user. Because components have access to system resources, applications may crash due to faulty components or may be compromised by malicious components. In this paper, we ask the question: can hardware support the development and deployment of CBS by providing applications with a trusted platform for managing components and their interactions? We present an architecture that places each CBS component in a hardware-enforced container. The hardware then detects improper usage of system resources (unauthorized memory accesses or denial-of-service) and enables applications to <b>undertake</b> <b>a</b> hardware-supervised <b>recovery</b> procedure. Furthermore, the hardware also maintains a violation record to enable developers to recreate the violation for the purpose of debugging and further development. Taken together, the purpose of the architecture we propose is to enable executing untrusted CBS code on trusted hardware. I...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{investigates the}} sources and intertexts {{of a famous}} {{narrative}} episode in James Thomson's popular long poem "The Seasons" (1746), namely the sentimental tale of "Celadon and Amelia. " From its first publication onwards, this episode was repeatedly excerpted, illustrated and re-told, especially {{in the late eighteenth}} and early nineteenth centuries. As such, this story (of two pastoral lovers who are parted when one is struck by lightning) has a long afterlife and is implicated in the Romantic configurations of cultural affect that dominate Western understandings of art and literature up to the present day. However, while its widespread influence on later writers, artists and readers has been extensively studied, the composite sources of the tale have yet to be fully recovered. This article therefore <b>undertakes</b> such <b>a</b> <b>recovery.</b> In doing so, it not only reveals the wide range of media on which Thomson drew, from newspapers and scientific discourse to poetry and devotional works, but also offers a challenge to a long-established critical tradition which reads the whole of “The Seasons” as dominated by movement and sequence. Instead, it is argued, the static or "statuesque" finale of the "Celadon and Amelia" episode is replicated in many places throughout the poem, moments which reflect Thomson’s competitive engagements with intertexts in a variety of static media, and which cumulatively represent an attack on the authenticity and memorial efficacy of conventional funerary genres such as sculpture and epitaph...|$|R

40|$|The Italian Healthcare Service, {{originally}} {{managed by}} the central Government, has been gradually adjusted toward a decentralized model, with ample devolution of legislative, organizational and financial competencies to the regions, now responsible {{for the creation of}} an institutional framework where efficiency, efficacy and accountability have to inform the actions of the healthcare operators. In Sicily for decades those principles seem not to have received practical implementation, as the healthcare system has been chronically marked by unsatisfying social and economic performances. Due to the recent financial disequilibria, the central Government pushed the regional one to reform the entire health sector, <b>undertaking</b> <b>a</b> path of <b>recovery</b> and reorganization. The paper is part of a Ph. D project that will analyze the effects of this reform with a System Dynamic approach.

The present work will explore the main features of the reform, also showing, through causal loop diagrams and stock-and-flow structures, the outputs of the modeling activity undertaken up to now. This kind of approach can help to evaluate the impacts of the ongoing reform (trade-offs, delays or failures in goals achievement, possible areas of improvement). Moreover, it could also be useful to stimulate the empowerment of different healthcare actors, encouraging them to adopt a shared vision about what determined the problematic behavior patterns, why some decisions have been taken, and which contribution to the general performance is expected from each responsibility area...|$|R
