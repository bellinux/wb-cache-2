5|$|Ions {{typically}} pack into extremely regular crystalline structures, in {{an arrangement}} that minimizes the lattice energy (maximizing attractions and minimizing repulsions). The lattice energy is the summation of the interaction of all sites with all other sites. For unpolarizable spherical ions only the charges and distances are required to determine the electrostatic interaction energy. For any particular ideal crystal structure, all distances are geometrically related to the smallest internuclear distance. So for each possible crystal structure, the total <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energy</b> {{can be related to}} the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energy</b> of unit charges at the nearest neighbour distance by a multiplicative constant called the Madelung constant that can be efficiently computed using an Ewald sum. When a reasonable form is assumed for the additional repulsive energy, the total lattice energy can be modelled using the Born–Landé equation, the Born–Mayer equation, or in the absence of structural information, the Kapustinskii equation.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrostatic}} force, on {{the other}} hand, is an inverse-square force, so a proton added to a nucleus will feel an electrostatic repulsion {{from all the other}} protons in the nucleus. The <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energy</b> per nucleon due to the electrostatic force thus increases without limit as nuclei atomic number grows.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>energy</b> {{harvesters}} need a polarization {{source to}} work and to convert mechanical energy from vibrations into electricity.

Another solution consists in using electrets, that are electrically charged dielectrics able to keep the polarization on the capacitor for years.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{computational}} {{methods for}} predicting the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energies</b> are of major importance for {{our understanding of}} protein energetics in general, for computer-aided drug design and {{in the design of}} novel biocatalysts and protein therapeutics. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>energies</b> are of particular importance in applications such as virtual screening, drug design and protein-protein docking due to the high charge densitiy of protein ligands and small-molecule drugs, and the frequent protonation state changes observed when drugs are binding to their protein targets. Therefore, the development of a reliable and fast algorithm for the evaluation of <b>electrostatic</b> free <b>energies,</b> as an important contributor to the overall protein energy function, {{has been the focus of}} many scientists for the last three decades. In this review we describe the current state of-the-art in modeling electrostatic effects in proteins and protein-ligand complexes.

500|$|In September 1920, Fermi was {{admitted}} to the Physics department. Since there were only three students in the department—Fermi, Rasetti, and Nello Carrara—Puccianti let them freely use the laboratory for whatever purposes they chose. Fermi decided that they should research X-ray crystallography, and the three worked to produce a Laue photograph—an X-ray photograph of a crystal. During 1921, his third year at the university, Fermi published his first scientific works in the Italian journal Nuovo Cimento. The first was entitled [...] "On the dynamics of a rigid system of electrical charges in translational motion" [...] (...) [...] A sign of things to come was that the mass was expressed as a tensor—a mathematical construct commonly used to describe something moving and changing in three-dimensional space. In classical mechanics, mass is a scalar quantity, but in relativity it changes with velocity. The second paper was [...] "On the electrostatics of a uniform gravitational field of electromagnetic charges and on the weight of electromagnetic charges" [...] (...) [...] Using general relativity, Fermi showed that a charge has a weight equal to U/c2, where U was the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energy</b> of the system, and c is the speed of light.|$|E
40|$|We {{review the}} use of Legendre {{transforms}} {{in the formulation of}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energies</b> in condensed matter. We show how to render standard functionals expressed in terms of the electrostatic potential, Phi, convex - at the cost of expressing them in terms of the vector field D. This leads to great simplification in the formulation of numerical minimisation of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energies</b> coupled to other physical degrees of freedom. We also demonstrate the equivalence of recent functionals for dielectrics derived using field theory methods to classical formulations in terms of the electric polarisation.

2500|$|It {{has been}} noted that wet 1-octanol {{solution}} is a poor approximation of proteins or biological membranes because it contains ~2M of water, and that cyclohexane would be a much better approximation. [...] Investigation of passive permeability barriers for different compounds across lipid bilayers led to conclusion that 1,9-decadiene {{can serve as a}} good approximations of the bilayer interior, whereas 1-octanol was a very poor approximation. [...] A set of solvation parameters derived for protein interior from protein engineering data was also different from octanol scale: it was close to cyclohexane scale for nonpolar atoms but intermediate between cyclohexane and octanol scales for polar atoms. [...] Thus, different atomic solvation parameters should be applied for modeling of protein folding and protein-membrane binding. [...] This issue remains controversial. [...] The original idea of the method was to derive all solvation parameters directly from experimental partition coefficients of organic molecules, which allows calculation of solvation free energy. [...] However, some of the recently developed electrostatic models use ad hoc values of 20 or 40 cal/(Å2 mol) for all types of atoms.

2500|$|Ionization of charged {{groups has}} been {{neglected}} in continuum electrostatic models of implicit solvation, {{as well as}} in standard molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics. [...] The transfer of an ion from water to a nonpolar medium with dielectric constant of ~3 (lipid bilayer) or 4 to 10 (interior of proteins) costs significant energy, as follows from the Born equation and from experiments. [...] However, since the charged protein residues are ionizable, they simply lose their charges in the nonpolar environment, which costs relatively little at the neutral pH: ~4 to 7 kcal/mol for Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg amino acid residues, according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, ΔG = 2.3RT (pH - pK). [...] The low energetic costs of such ionization effects have indeed been observed for protein mutants with buried ionizable residues. and hydrophobic α-helical peptides in membranes with a single ionizable residue in the middle. However, all electrostatic methods, such as PB, GB, or GBSA assume that ionizable groups remain charged in the nonpolar environments, which leads to grossly overestimated <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energy.</b> [...] In the simplest accessible surface area-based models, this problem was treated using different solvation parameters for charged atoms or Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with some modifications. [...] However even the latter approach does not solve the problem. [...] Charged residues can remain charged even in the nonpolar environment if they are involved in intramolecular ion pairs and H-bonds. [...] Thus, the energetic penalties can be overestimated even using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. [...] More rigorous theoretical methods describing such ionization effects have been developed, and there are ongoing efforts to incorporate such methods into the implicit solvation models.|$|E
