5|$|On March 22, 1982, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey held (536 F. Supp. 317, (1982)) {{that the}} New Jersey statute was not unconstitutionally vague {{and did not}} impermissibly <b>infringe</b> on union members' First Amendment rights.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority. A concurrent majority is {{a system in which}} a minority group is permitted to exercise a sort of veto power over actions of a majority that are believed to <b>infringe</b> upon the minority's rights.|$|E

5|$|In this situation, {{the court}} had decided in {{previous}} cases that immigration detention, {{for the purposes of}} processing and removal, did not <b>infringe</b> on Chapter III. Al-Kateb argued that if indeed the provisions of the Migration Act extended as far as to allow the indefinite detention of people like him, then it would have gone beyond those valid purposes and would <b>infringe</b> Chapter III. That is, non-judicial detention is permitted for the purposes of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of removal are remote or impracticable for the reasonably foreseeable future, then the detention can no longer be considered to be for the purpose of removal. Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of the Federal Court in another case, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri, in which a Full Court of the Federal Court found that a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.|$|E
5|$|Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion, which held that §8772 does not <b>infringe</b> on {{the separation of}} powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government, considering also that the law is an exercise of congressional authority regarding foreign affairs. Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion (however, Justice Thomas did not join as to Part II-C of the opinion).|$|E

50|$|Section 512(c) {{applies to}} OSPs that store <b>infringing</b> material. In {{addition}} to the two general requirements that OSPs comply with standard technical measures and remove repeat infringers, § 512(c) also requires that the OSP: 1) not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the <b>infringing</b> activity, 2) {{not be aware of}} the presence of <b>infringing</b> material or know any facts or circumstances that would make <b>infringing</b> material apparent, and 3) upon receiving notice from copyright owners or their agents, act expeditiously to remove the purported <b>infringing</b> material.|$|R

5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, {{but will also}} eat larger prey, such as worms and mice. Unlike most frogs, they are active at day, although this is mostly to warm in the sun. They {{tend to be less}} active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they <b>infringe</b> on one another's space.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contemporary}} Orthodox scholars {{rule that}} the area {{in front of the}} Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which <b>infringe</b> on the sanctity of the Sabbath.|$|E

5|$|The First Amendment {{guarantees}} {{the rights of}} freedom of speech and peaceable assembly, among others. While not explicitly mentioned, the Supreme Court has held that the right to assembly includes the freedom of association, particularly political association. These protections not only prohibit the government from passing laws which <b>infringe</b> upon these rights, but also from taking actions which would violate them. While the Bill of Rights—which includes the First Amendment—applied originally only to the federal government, the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed for the application of the Bill of Rights to the states under the incorporation doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Unofficial {{versions}} of the game, which {{share some of the}} same playing features, but also incorporate changes so as not to <b>infringe</b> on copyrights, have been created by firms such as Late for the Sky Production Company and Help on Board. These are done for smaller cities, sometimes as charity fundraisers, and some have been created for college and university campuses. Others have non-geographical themes such as Wine-opoly and Chocolate-opoly. There is also a version called Make Your Own -OPOLY, which allows you to customize all the game equipment and rules to your liking.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, {{political}} friction increased {{between the}} Army and the Air Force over the {{close air support}} (CAS) mission. The Air Force asserted that the Cheyenne would <b>infringe</b> on the Air Force's CAS mission {{in support of the}} Army, which had been mandated with the Key West Agreement of 1948. The Department of Defense (DOD) conducted a study that concluded that the Air Force's A-X program, the Marine Corps' Harrier, and the Cheyenne were significantly different that they did not constitute a duplication of capabilities. On 22 October 1971, the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on Tactical Air Power conducted hearings to evaluate the CAS mission and the pending programs. The most damaging testimony for the Army's program came from the commander of the Air Force's Tactical Air Command, General William W. Momyer, who cited helicopter casualty statistics of Operation Lam Son 719.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{the court}} still {{rejected}} safe harbors for isoHunt because the trackers used by Fung generated information used for further <b>infringing.</b> Therefore, the websites were protected as service providers, {{but not as}} trackers. The district court had rejected the § 512(c) safe harbor for Fung {{for the same reason}} it had rejected the protection for the § 512(a) safe harbor. However, the circuit court maintained that the § 512(c) safe harbor covered not only the storage of the <b>infringing</b> content, but also the <b>infringing</b> activities that use the content on the system or network. Fung was denied eligibility for the § 512(c) safe harbor since the provision was only available if the service provider did not have knowledge that the content used on the system was <b>infringing</b> or was not aware of the facts or circumstances from which the <b>infringing</b> activity was apparent. The court maintained that Fung had [...] "red flag knowledge" [...] of the <b>infringing</b> activity on his systems and was thus ineligible for the § 512(c) safe harbor. The court also argued that the advertising on the site constituted a financial benefit from the <b>infringing</b> activity. Fung promoted advertising by attracting the site visitors who wished to engage in the <b>infringing</b> activity. Thus, a solid connection between the <b>infringing</b> activity and the revenue generation was established, and Fung was declared ineligible for protection under the § 512 (c)(1)(b) safe harbor.|$|R

5|$|John Tyler Jr. (March 29, 1790 – January 18, 1862) {{served as}} the tenth President of the United States (1841–45) after briefly being the tenth Vice President (1841); {{he was elected to}} the latter office on the 1840 Whig ticket with President William Henry Harrison. Tyler ascended to the {{presidency}} after Harrison's death in April 1841, a mere month after the start of the new administration. He was a supporter of states' rights, and as president he adopted nationalist policies only when they did not <b>infringe</b> on the powers of the states. His unexpected rise to the presidency, with the resulting threat to the presidential ambitions of Henry Clay and other politicians, left him estranged from both major political parties.|$|E
5|$|The Chamber of Deputies (1) expresses disapproval {{with the}} European Commission {{proposal}} {{to limit the}} possibility of acquisition and possession of firearms that are held legally in line with national laws of EU Member States, (2) refuses European Commission's infringement into a well established system of control, evidence, acquisition and possession of firearms and ammunition laid down by the Czech law, (3) expresses support for establishment of any and all functional measures to combat illegal trade, acquisition, possession and other illegal manipulation with firearms, ammunition and explosives, (4) refuses European Commission's persecution of Member States and their citizens through unjustified tightening of legal firearms possession {{as a reaction to}} terror attacks in Paris and (5) recommends the Prime Minister to conduct any and all legal and diplomatic steps to prevent enactment of a directive that would disrupt the Czech legal order in the area of trade, control, acquisition and possession of firearms and thus inappropriately <b>infringe</b> into the rights of the citizens of the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} it can judicially review the {{exercise}} of prosecutorial power and declare a prosecution to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power, for example, if a prosecution is brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an accused person for an offence he or she committed. A prosecution {{can also be found}} to have infringed the accused person's constitutional rights. This may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes, and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the accused persons but not the officers, as this may <b>infringe</b> the accused persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Eastman Kodak sued Apple and Research In Motion (RIM) in January 2010, filing two {{lawsuits}} against Apple and {{a complaint with}} the U.S. International Trade Commission against both Apple and RIM after the companies refused to pay royalties for use of Kodak's patents for digital cameras. Kodak alleged Apple's and RIM's phones infringed on patented Kodak digital imaging technology. Kodak sought an injunction against further imports into the United States of Apple's iPhone and RIM's BlackBerry. After Kodak filed an additional suit in January 2012 against Apple and another against HTC claiming infringement of four of its key patents, Apple filed a countersuit with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to block Kodak's efforts to use the disputed patents as collateral for loans. In the January complaint Kodak claimed violations of the same image preview technology at issue in the original dispute between Kodak, Apple, and RIM that is, as of 2012, pending before ITC. In March 2012, bankruptcy court judge Allen Gropper, overseeing Kodak's restructuring, denied Apple's request to file a patent complaint with the ITC over some of Kodak's cameras, photo frames, and printers. In July 2012, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Kodak did not <b>infringe</b> on Apple's patent technology for digital cameras, although a few days earlier Kodak lost its case before the ITC against Apple and RIM; Kodak announced it would appeal that decision.|$|E
5|$|In December 1689, Parliament passed one of {{the most}} {{important}} constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights. This measure—which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right—established restrictions on the royal prerogative; it declared, among other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, <b>infringe</b> the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments. The Bill of Rights also confirmed the succession to the throne. Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple, to be followed by Mary's sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage.|$|E
5|$|The {{report found}} that the {{tendency}} of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and {{that it did not}} explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not <b>infringe</b> any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that {{were not included in the}} broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.|$|E
5000|$|Robinson wrote {{two books}} on {{the failure of the}} major air {{carriers}} Eastern and Pan Am. The latter book was found to be substantially <b>infringing</b> on Robert Daley's book [...] "An American Saga."In attempting to seek a declaratory judgement asserting he had not <b>infringed,</b> the court decided that not only was the book <b>infringing,</b> but Robinson had acted in bad faith in the litigation.|$|R
50|$|The court {{made the}} {{distinction}} that the software system in A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc. and MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. were engineered and promoted explicitly {{for the purpose}} of facilitating infringement of copyrighted music, thereby reducing legitimate sales of such music. In contrast, the defendant's system did not facilitate access to <b>infringing</b> websites. Again, the defendants did not use its payment process system to copy, alter, distribute, or display <b>infringing</b> material. Consumers did not use Visa to locate, view, or download the <b>infringing</b> images. Thus, the court held that <b>infringing</b> websites simply use the defendants' system to process payments.|$|R
5000|$|The {{court held}} that if RTC could prove that Netcom had {{knowledge}} of the <b>infringing</b> activities, Netcom could be liable for contributory infringement since its failure to simply cancel Erlich's <b>infringing</b> message and thereby stop an <b>infringing</b> copy from being distributed could constitute substantial participation. However, there {{was a question of}} fact as to whether Netcom knew or should have known that such activities were <b>infringing</b> after receipt of RTC's letter. This genuine issue of fact precluded summary judgment on contributory liability. (I.e., the court could not make a decision on contributory liability without trial because of factual disputes.) ...|$|R
