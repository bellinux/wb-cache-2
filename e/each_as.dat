5|$|Currently, the {{earliest}} listed film is Newark Athlete (1891), {{and the most}} recent is 13 Lakes (2004). Counting the 11multi-year serials in the NFR once <b>each</b> (<b>as</b> the NFR does) by year of completion, the years with the most films selected are 1928, 1939, and 1940, with 18films from each year chosen for preservation. The time between a film's debut and its selection varies greatly. The longest span is 121years; Edison Kinetographic Record of a Sneeze was originally released in 1894 and selected for preservation in 2015. The shortest span is the minimum 10years; this distinction is shared by Raging Bull, Do the Right Thing, Goodfellas, Toy Story, Fargo and 13 Lakes.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the modest}} returns during the season, Kartik was {{selected}} for an India A tour of Pakistan in February and March 1998. In four first-class matches, which were persistently curtailed by the weather, Kartik bowled only 31 overs, and only two in the two matches against Pakistan A. He finished with four wickets at 27.50. In the two one-dayers, he proved expensive, taking 1/53 and 0/73 from ten overs <b>each,</b> <b>as</b> Pakistan won both matches easily.|$|E

5|$|Hesse had {{anticipated}} {{some kind of}} attack from the rear and had kept a mobile force in reserve to guard against such an eventuality. It was formed by an English company, and two Spanish companies: a regular company under captain Francisco de Sandoval and a Catalan company of miquelets under Jaume Burguy, numbering 300 men, all of them led by Hesse's brother Heinrich. This reserve immediately responded and engaged the Spanish Bourbons at Middle Hill. Although the Bourbons {{had the advantage of}} height, they were effectively trapped against the precipice of the Rock and only had three rounds of ammunition <b>each,</b> <b>as</b> a result of travelling light; they had not come prepared for a pitched battle.|$|E
5|$|In December 1921, the Australian Air Board {{prepared}} to form its first five squadrons and allocate aircraft to <b>each,</b> <b>as</b> {{well as to}} the nascent flying school. The plan was for No.1 FTS to receive twelve Avro 504Ks and four Sopwith Pups, and the squadrons a total of eight Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, eight Airco DH.9s, and three Fairey IIIs. Funding problems forced the Air Force to disband the newly raised squadrons on 1July 1922 and re-form them as flights in a composite squadron under No.1 FTS. The same month, Flight Lieutenant Frank McNamara, VC, took command of the school.|$|E

Kaiser Wilhelm II requested that the build time for the new battlecruisers be reduced to two years <b>each,</b> <b>as</b> opposed to three years. This proved unfeasible, because neither the armor or armament firms could supply the necessary materials according to an expedited schedule.|$|E

40|$|We provide {{combinatorial}} formulas for the multidegree and K-polynomial of an (arbitrarily oriented) type A quiver locus embedded {{inside of}} its representation space. These formulas are generalizations {{of three of}} Knutson-Miller-Shimozono's formulas from the equioriented setting: - The ratio formulas express <b>each</b> K-polynomial <b>as</b> a ratio of specialized double Grothendieck polynomials, and <b>each</b> multidegree <b>as</b> a ratio of specialized double Schubert polynomials. - The pipe formulas express <b>each</b> K-polynomial <b>as</b> an alternating sum over pipe dreams that fit inside of a particular shape, and <b>each</b> multidegree <b>as</b> a positive sum over reduced pipe dreams that fit inside of that same shape. - The component formulas express <b>each</b> K-polynomial <b>as</b> an alternating sum of products of Grothendieck polynomials, and <b>each</b> multidegree <b>as</b> a positive sum of products of Schubert polynomials. The summands are indexed by lacing diagrams associated to the type A quiver locus. The K-polynomial component formula was first conjectured by Buch-Rimányi, and the multidegree component formula was first proved by Buch-Rimányi. Comment: 40 pages.

5|$|A {{week later}} Eddleston took his tally of goals to eight, scoring twice as Nelson overcame Walsall 2–1 at Seedhill. He scored {{again in the}} next match as the team gained their first point of the season away from home, drawing 1–1 at Wigan Borough, who had been Nelson's first ever opponents in the Football League over three years previously. Half-back Ernie Braidwood scored his first goal of the {{campaign}} in the 2–1 win against Halifax Town. Eddie Cameron also scored for the home side, and Walter Moore made his senior debut in the match. November began badly for Nelson as they suffered their heaviest defeat of the season, a 0–5 loss away at New Brighton. Allan Mathieson and Joe Wilcox scored two goals <b>each</b> <b>as</b> New Brighton won the first ever competitive meeting between the two sides. Nelson moved up to sixth place in the league following the next match, a 1–0 win at home to Grimsby Town. However, the team continued their poor form away from Seedhill, losing 1–3 to table-topping Darlington on 15 November. Seven days later, Bottrill scored the only goal of the match as Nelson beat Rochdale to record their eighth consecutive home win.|$|E
5|$|In June 1999, Roma's then-president Franco Sensi sacked Zeman {{and signed}} Fabio Capello as a replacement, {{with the aim}} of winning the league title. By the 2000–01 {{campaign}} under the new coach, Roma were building a competitive team around Totti, who was by now being utilised as a creative attacking midfielder by Capello in a 3–4–1–2 formation, due to his passing skills and playmaking abilities. Totti scored in a 2–0 home win over Bologna on his season debut on 1 October 2000. On 10 December, Totti scored the match-winning goal in a 2–1 home win against Udinese with a powerful left-footed volley to help Roma to their fifth home win of the season. He continued his goalscoring form by scoring against Napoli at home in a 3–0 victory on 28 January 2001, as Roma finished {{the first half of the}} league season in first place. Totti continued to play an important role in keeping the club at the top of the table throughout the remainder of the season, gaining a comfortable lead over rivals Juventus. On 17 June 2001, at the Stadio Olimpico, Roma beat Parma 3–1, with their three main attackers, Totti, Vincenzo Montella and Gabriel Batistuta scoring one goal <b>each,</b> <b>as</b> Roma were crowned champions of Italy for the third time in their history. Totti finished the league season with 13 goals, equalling what was at the time his personal goalscoring record in a single Serie A season.|$|E
