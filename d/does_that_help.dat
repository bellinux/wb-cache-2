40|$|The {{issue of}} tax {{harmonization}} at EU level {{is becoming more}} present in the global crisis context, as it is both accepted and disputed by the European officials that manifest their preference for either coordination or tax competition. The crisis has generated, among other things, large budget deficits and a dangerous crisis of debts in the euro area, a situation that has attracted many followers in terms of tax harmonization. There is a European regulated Area, a unique European market, European unique currency and common monetary policy which regard the criteria relating to public finances (budget deficits, public debt). We ask ourselves to what extent {{it is necessary to}} achieve coordination or even tax unification and how <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>help.</b> This paper examines, according to the statistical database, the level and type of taxation, on categories of taxes and as a share of GDP, in Romania compared to EU countries, in order to clarify the current situation, the existing differences, the prospect of good European practice. If we speak of tax harmonization in terms of being acquired by Romania, the conclusion is that we can not report only to the technical or quantifiable aspects, as compared with the best results in European area, because they do not represent a guarantee of similar results. The fiscal policy must be both a prerequisite and a consequence of sustainable economic and financial policies, and the tax harmonization can only help insofar {{as it relates to the}} relationships between states and not at the tax level...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{purpose of}} the Clery Act is to {{increase}} students' awareness of crimes taking place on college and university campuses. Through the analysis of student perspectives related to crime, student affairs professionals can better understand {{the influence of the}} Clery Act. However, whether students are changing their behaviors over time with regard to their own safety is still in question. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate how the Clery Act has changed traditional students' (first-time, full-time, and first-year students attending college or university directly out of high school) behavior on college and university campuses and what it has taught these students about how to be safe.; Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to examine the impact of the Clery Act on Students. Qualitative research consisted of face-to-face interviews with 36 traditional undergraduate students at the University of Southern California, the University of California, Riverside, and Pepperdine University. Quantitative data was obtained by sending out an e-mailed link of the survey to traditional students at each of these institutions.; Two research questions guided the study: 1) How does the Clery Act affect current undergraduate students? In particular, what do students learn about crime as a result of the Clery Act and how <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>help</b> them protect themselves? 2) How has student behavior changed as a result of the Clery Act between students' first and fourth year at the school they attended? Particularly, does the Clery Act impact and change student behavior over time?; Overall, the findings regarding what students think about crime and the Clery Act were mixed. Through the data analysis process it became clear that some accomplishments of the Clery Act were considered very positive, while some areas needed to be improved.; This study adds to the practice of student affairs by assessing how students learn to be safe on college and university campuses. Through this assessment student affairs professionals are better able to understand what services to provide students in order to improve safety programs. In addition, student affairs professionals are able to determine how the Clery Act contributes to change in student behavior...|$|E
