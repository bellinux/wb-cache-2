5|$|Swaminarayan strived to {{maintain}} good relationships {{with people of}} other religions, sometimes meeting prominent leaders. His followers cut across religious boundaries, including people of Muslim and Parsi backgrounds. Swaminarayan's personal attendants included Khoja Muslims. In Kathiawad, many Muslims wore kanthi necklaces given by Swaminarayan. He also {{had a meeting with}} Reginald Heber, Lord Bishop of Calcutta and a leader of Christians in India at the time. Bishop Heber mentions in his account of the meeting that about two hundred disciples of Swaminarayan accompanied him as his bodyguards mounted on horses and carrying Matchlocks and swords. Bishop Heber himself had about a hundred horse guards accompanying him (fifty horses and fifty muskets) and mentioned that it was humiliating <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> two religious leaders meeting at the head of two small armies, his being the smaller contingent. As a result of the meeting, both leaders gained mutual respect for one another.|$|E
25|$|When {{my husband}} was {{translating}} the Book of Mormon, I wrote a part of it, as he dictated each sentence, word for word, {{and when he came}} to proper names he could not pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out, and while I was writing them, if I made any mistake in spelling, he would stop me and correct my spelling although it was impossible <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how I was writing them down at the time. Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at first, but had to spell it, and I would pronounce it for him.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, on March 1, 1970, von Braun and {{his family}} {{relocated}} to Washington, DC, when he was assigned the post of NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning at NASA Headquarters. After a series of conflicts associated with the truncation of the Apollo program, and facing severe budget constraints, von Braun retired from NASA on May 26, 1972. Not only had it become evident by this time that NASA and his visions for future U.S. space flight projects were incompatible, but also it was perhaps even more frustrating <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> popular support for a continued presence of man in space wane dramatically once the goal to reach the Moon had been accomplished.|$|E

Mandy finds a picture of him as a baby, and puts it on the mirror <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> When Fergus comes back through the mirror it transforms him into the baby version of himself in the photograph. The children do {{not know what to do}} and send him back through where he is found by Violette. Constance tells the other that her mother found him and they try to get him back. They realise they must find a more recent picture of Fergus. They decide to use the picture which had been taken that morning. They return through the mirror and Fergus is restored to his teenage self, unaware of what had happened.|$|E
25|$|Winthrop {{also studied}} {{astronomy}} with his 3½ foot refracting telescope. In 1664, {{he wrote a}} letter to Sir Robert Moray regarding a “fifth satellite of Jupiter” that he believed he observed. This was only fifty years after Galileo discovered the first four moons of Jupiter. His letter was cautious since he thought it may be a faint star in close proximity to the other satellites. Winthrop requested that his observations be validated by Lawrence Rooke, Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, but nothing was verified. Dr. Edward Emerson Barnard, who was credited for discovering Amalthea, Jupiter’s fifth moon, wrote “It makes me feel specially humiliated just now, for I have only caught the feeblest glimpses of the 5th satellite with the 40-inch during the past two years. Winthrop’s telescope must have been specially good <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this faint object with his imperfect instrument in 1664.” Although today it is assumed that Winthrop probably did see a faint star, he is still credited for being a dedicated and vigilant observer of natural phenomenon.|$|E

500|$|Barry and Oliver {{devise a}} plan to deliver Kendra and Carter as a ruse to {{get close enough to}} Savage to destroy the staff. The plan goes horribly wrong; Kendra's powers fail and Savage quickly overcomes the element of {{surprise}} and kills both her and Carter before using the staff to destroy Central City. Barry escapes and runs fast enough to go back in time to the point of the original negotiation before everyone else dies. Barry informs Oliver of his time travel and the mistakes that led to defeat. They change their approach to the plan and Barry is able to steal the staff. He and Oliver use it on Savage, burning his body. Kendra and Carter decide to use their powers to help others in another city. Cisco gives Kendra a tracking device. Oliver agrees to Samantha's conditions <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> William. Even though Barry encourages Oliver to tell Felicity about William (she has lost this knowledge because of Barry's time traveling) he decides to continue to keep the secret from her.

500|$|A {{week after}} the {{settlement}} of the Chandler's lawsuit was announced on January 25, 1994, L.A. District Attorney Gil Garcetti announced he supported amending a law that prohibits forcing {{people who say they}} have been sexually assaulted to testify in criminal proceedings. The amendment introduced into the state assembly the week of February 7 would have immediately allowed Garcetti to compel Jordan to testify. Around that time, Santa Barbara police interviewed the 13-year-old son of one of Jackson's former maids (who had told them her son had spent time with Jackson) and then arranged <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a therapist after he repeatedly denied being abused. [...] In a deposition, his mother stated when she asked the police about who she could speak to about her concerns about their meetings and phone conversations with her son without her present, they arranged for her and her son to see separate therapists. On April 11, 1994, the grand jury session in Santa Barbara was extended for an additional 90-day term to allow Sneddon to gather more evidence and prosecution sources admitted to being frustrated in their grand jury probe, failing to find direct evidence of the molestation charges. The final grand jury ultimately disbanded without ever returning an indictment against Jackson.|$|E

2500|$|The film {{is unique}} and offbeat as the often twisted humour is made {{genuinely}} funny by the actors. The logic and consequenses of the characters schemes seem secondary. For example, it doesn’t appear to bother Santiago that his wife would be a baby and not in fact [...] "Viviana" [...] in any way other than genetically. In fact he misses her to such an extreme that its hard not to end up rooting <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her.|$|E
2500|$|Brunson met {{his future}} wife, Louise, in 1959 and married her in August 1962. [...] Louise became pregnant, but later that year, a tumor was {{discovered}} in Doyle's neck. [...] When it was operated on, the surgeons found that the cancer had spread. [...] They felt that an operation would prolong his life long enough <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{the birth of the}} baby, so they went ahead with it. After the operation, no trace of the cancer could be found.|$|E
2500|$|It {{took another}} two years <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his second short story, [...] "Artyomy Semyonovich Bervenkovsky", a homage to the {{so-called}} 'natural school' apparently written {{under the influence of}} Nikolai Gogol's Dead Souls, published in the 1st volume of Count Vladimir Sollogub's Yesterday and Today almanac. The 2nd volume featured Amena, a novella, described as an extract from a novel called Stebelovsky which remained unfinished. Belinsky responded negatively to this publication, describing the piece as [...] "rather dull", and an [...] "unfortunate manifestation of mental irritation picked from Chateaubriand" [...] (meaning apparently Les Martyrs, 1809).|$|E

2500|$|After {{completing}} the walk, Wallenda {{said it was}} more difficult than he had expected. [...] "That mist was thick. It {{was hard to see}} at times. The wind was wild. It'd come at me one way and hit me from the front, and hit me from the back." [...] Weather instruments showed gusts up to 14mph during the walk. Wallenda further remarked that the turbulent waters below made it difficult <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the wire. Before the walk, Jay Cochrane, a veteran wire walker who had unsuccessfully petitioned to walk Horseshoe Falls for 30 years, said of the local weather [...] "Unpredictable is a mild word. It is unforgiving... can spray mist anywhere from 380 to 590feet in the air. I've seen it, I've measured it." [...] He added that walking Horseshoe Falls was an opportunity [...] "like none other in history." [...] Long-time circus performer, Jackie LeClaire, remarked [...] "aerialists always try to calculate risk. Nik couldn't do that because this walk had never been done before." [...] Local historian, Paul Gromosiak, who has researched daredevil activity in the Niagara region for his books, said Wallenda's proximity to the falls made his act far more dangerous than any prior act.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the renewal}} of the war with Poland, Gustavus Adolphus had to leave his wife again. It is likely that she gave way to hysterical grief, as we know she did in 1627, and it is {{probably}} {{for this reason that}} the king let his queen join him in Livonia after the Poles had been defeated in January 1626. By April, Maria Eleonora found she was again pregnant. No risks were taken this time and the astrologers predicted the birth of a son and heir. During a lull in the warfare, Gustavus Adolphus hurried back to Stockholm to await the arrival of the baby. The birth was a difficult one. On 7 December, a baby was born with a fleece (lanugo), which enveloped it from its head to its knees, leaving only its face, arms and lower part of its legs free. Moreover, it had a large nose and was covered with hair. Thus, it was assumed the baby was a boy, and so the King was told. Closer inspection, however, determined that the baby was a girl. Gustavus Adolphus' half-sister Catherine informed him that the child was a girl. She [...] "carried the baby in her arms to the king in a condition <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and to know and realise for himself what she dared not tell him". Gustavus Adolphus remarked: [...] "She is going to be clever, for she has taken us all in." [...] His disappointment did not last long, and he decided that she would be called Christina after his mother. He gave orders for the birth to be announced with all the solemnity usually accorded to the arrival of a male heir. This seems to indicate that Gustavus Adolphus, at the age of 33, had little hope of having other children. Maria Eleonora's state of health seems to be the most likely explanation for this. Her later portraits and actions, however, do not indicate that she was physically fragile.|$|E

2500|$|Producer Martin Gero {{described}} Carson Beckett as the [...] "older brother" [...] in the Atlantis crew, a [...] "superswell" [...] and [...] "loveable guy" [...] {{who has a}} lot of [...] "heart and warmth". McGillion {{described his}} character as , but Beckett gains more courage throughout the series as he becomes more familiar with his surroundings in Atlantis and offworld. Beckett can fly a Puddle Jumper, albeit reluctantly, and his piloting skills are shown to be flawed at best. He also despises Stargate travel, and is once compared with the [...] character Dr. McCoy. In [...] "Duet", Beckett admits to be somewhat infatuated with Lt. Laura Cadman, who at the time is trapped in McKay's consciousness. When Cadman learns of this, she shares a passionate kiss with Beckett through McKay's body. Beckett and Cadman have an off-screen relationship until season 3; Beckett blames the difficulties of the relationship on their first kiss through McKay. Although McKay often condescends Beckett as he usually does to all his colleagues, McKay considers him a close friend. Martin Gero stated that Beckett and McKay often complement each other in a [...] "wonderful" [...] way. Although they have completely different personalities, they are the [...] "everyday hero guys", and often share their thoughts after saving Atlantis or the galaxy from dire situations. Paul McGillion and David Hewlett (McKay) are also good friends in real life. Despite their personality differences, Beckett and Ronon Dex get along fairly well. In their first meeting, Beckett removed Ronon's tracking device, effectively saving his life. When Ronon is about to be killed by a powerful Wraith, Beckett disobeys Ronon's wishes to let him fight alone and kills the Wraith himself, quipping [...] "if he doesn't like it, he can sue me." [...] Surprisingly, Ronon is grateful to Beckett for his assistance rather than angry. Ronon is later shown to be devastated by the real Beckett's death and admits its hard <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the cloned Beckett be forced into stasis to possibly never return.|$|E
