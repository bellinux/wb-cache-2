5|$|The final {{gradient}} from Camden Town to Euston {{involved a}} crossing over the Regent's Canal {{that required a}} gradient of over 1 in 68. Because steam trains at the time could not climb such an ascent, they were cable-hauled on the <b>down</b> <b>line</b> towards Camden until 1844, after which they used a pilot engine. The L's Act of Parliament prohibited the use of locomotives in the Euston area, following concerns of local residents about noise and smoke from locomotives toiling up the incline.|$|E

The Santa Barbara County Fire Department initially responded around 11:40am {{to a report}} of a strong smell coming from the area. Fire crews found the crude oil flowing from a drainage culvert that passed under U.S. 101, and into the Pacific Ocean and reported the leak to authorities. Local pipeline workers {{did not know about}} the leak until they were notified by the state parks staff around noon that there was oil in the water. After struggling to find the leaking pipeline, workers located Line 901 where it had leaked and flowed into the storm culvert around 1:30pm. Clean-up efforts didn't begin for 16 to 18 hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{offense is}} given a series of four plays, known as downs. If the offense {{advances}} ten or more yards in the four downs, they are awarded {{a new set of}} four downs. If they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might also attempt to score a field goal. A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs and the distance measurements. On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first <b>down</b> <b>line</b> to the viewing audience.|$|E

On 23 February 1969, this service ceased and was replaced by an emergency bus service.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} London {{suburban traffic}} caused {{problems in the}} King's Cross area, as there were only 2 tracks through the various tunnels, and also goods trains entering King's Cross goods yard had to cross the <b>down</b> <b>line</b> on the level. Pending doubling of the tunnels, a connection was made between Finsbury Park and the North London Railway at Canonbury, and some suburban traffic then ran into Broad Street. The Broad Street trains were operated by the NLR as the LNWR, part owners of Broad Street, blocked GNR attempts to gain access.|$|E

This loop is also used by local services calling at Newbury Racecourse during race days. Special chartered trains hauled by steam locomotives often use the loop to take on water because it has good road access although the Down platform in Newbury station can also be used for this purpose. All trains that pass through the loop must continue through the loop for the Down platform to rejoin the mainline.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday, 18 April 1967 {{at about}} 2.31pm, a wagon on a goods train of 69 empty mineral wagons, {{travelling}} on the <b>down</b> <b>line</b> to Northampton, derailed {{just south of}} the village. The train travelled a further 1½ miles before more wagons derailed, a little distance north of the village playing field. Some of the wagons went towards the up line from Northampton to London and were hit by a four-coach passenger train at about 70mph. Although the brakes of the passenger train had been fully applied, two coaches were derailed with one falling onto its side. All 45 passengers and train crew were evacuated fairly promptly. Of these, 21 were injured but only two were detained at Northampton General Hospital. The driver of the passenger train was seriously injured but both he and the passenger detained overnight made a good recovery.|$|E

25|$|A {{signal box}} which {{contained}} 25 levers was {{situated on the}} north side of the level crossing and controlled the crossing gates as well as access to the small goods yard with a siding on each side of the line. The siding on the down side ran into a loading dock behind the down platform. Unlike Ludborough, the station had no goods shed. The goods yard closed on 30 December 1963, but the station remained open to passengers until 5 October 1970. In 1956-57, around a dozen passenger trains bound for Grimsby called at the station on weekdays, with the first two being local workings from Louth, save for a Mondays only service which called only to set down passengers. In the other direction, fewer services ran through to , but the up/down passenger workings balanced once services to Louth were taken into account. North Thoresby was the only intermediate station between Grimsby and Louth to remain open until October 1970.After 1970 the <b>down</b> <b>line</b> was removed and only the up line through the station remained. The line finally closed in December 1980.|$|E

In 2006, Mominpur – Behala stretch on Diamond Harbour Road closed for construction of an overpass at Taratala. Initially, there was a plan to route tracks on that overpass after its completion, but the road was later converted to a National Highway and the plan dismissed. Until 2012, the Behala – Joka stretch was still in existence, along with the Behala terminus.

500|$|Hacking's {{account of}} the events of 12 March is similar to that {{reported}} by The Times. [...] He claims to have travelled to Clifton to witness an L clerk being prevented from collecting tickets, and to have then continued on another train to Manchester. [...] On his arrival there, he saw L employees ready to pull up the rails to the ELR platform, although the rails were left intact. [...] He then mentions returning to Clifton after hearing that L employees had recently left for the station. [...] He blamed the Managing Director of the L, Captain Law, and Mr Blackmore, superintendent of the Bolton line, for ordering theline to be blocked with the baulk of timber. [...] Hacking also mentions an approaching up-train from Bolton, which on encountering the blockage apparently moved across to the <b>down</b> <b>line</b> to bypass it– in the face of oncoming traffic. [...] Expressing his shock, he claims to have ordered the ELR's stone train onto the <b>down</b> <b>line,</b> changing the signals accordingly. [...] Hacking's account ends by claiming that Blackmore ordered the L train to move, effectively resolving the dispute.|$|E

500|$|Initially {{there were}} to have been three tracks, one for goods and another two for passengers, but only two were built. [...] Work {{proceeded}} at a slow pace, in a piecemeal fashion, with contracts awarded for portions of the work as occasion demanded. [...] Advertisements in the Bolton Chronicle appealed to Quarrymen for quantities of stone blocks to support the rails, and for excavators to construct parts of a proposed addition to the embankment from Agecroft towards Clifton Hall. Another advertisement in November that year advertised for tenders for contracts {{for the construction of}} bridges, viaducts, culverts and other structures to finish the line from Irwell Street in Salford, to Bolton. [...] A difficult section of the railway was at Farnworth, where a tunnel was required to cut through the hillside. A double-bore tunnel [...] long was built between 1835 and 1838, driven from both sides, with a large vertical shaft in the centre. This was later joined by a narrower single-bore tunnel, through which the <b>down</b> <b>line</b> was routed. Traffic along the upline was routed through the original tunnel.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 March 1849, despite the {{presence}} of police from Bury and Pendleton, the L placed a large baulk of timber across the ELR's line at Clifton Junction, effectively blocking it. [...] Employees from both companies arrived at the scene, and a large crowd gathered to watch events unfold. [...] The L also pulled a train past the junction, blocking the up line to the city. [...] Its engine was pointed south-east toward Manchester, available to any ELR passengers who wished to continue their journey. [...] An ELR train arrived from Bury, and stopped. [...] L employees attempted to take tickets from the ELR's passengers, but were refused, as the ELR had already taken tickets at their Ringley Road station. [...] ELR employees then removed the baulk of timber, and in an effort to push the L train out of the way, drove their train forward. [...] The L had anticipated this, and moved another engine (taken from a L train from Manchester) to the front of their Manchester-bound train. [...] The ELR then blocked the L <b>down</b> <b>line</b> with another of their trains, laden with stone, moving it to a position directly abreast of the L train. [...] The line remained completely blocked until about mid-day, with a queue of trains from both companies, and from the Blackburn and Darwen Railway, building up {{on each side of the}} blockage. [...] The situation was eventually defused when the L withdrew their train.|$|E
2500|$|The {{station was}} {{initially}} named Waltham and Humberstone, {{although it was}} in fact two miles from each village.

Opposite, at the end of the [...] lay a signal box of typical East Lincolnshire Railway construction; this controlled the crossing and a small goods yard adjacent to the <b>down</b> <b>line.</b> The yard initially handled coal and potatoes, but was later expanded to take cattle with the addition of a large cattle holding pen at its southern end. The goods yard was served by a single siding trailing off the <b>down</b> <b>line</b> which forked either side of the cattle pen. A row of three terraced railwayman's cottages were built on the south side of the crossing, adjacent to the signal box.|$|E
