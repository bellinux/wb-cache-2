5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, the {{development}} team spent five days and four nights {{in a place called}} the Capcom Manor to work on the game; this was inspired by the filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who would gather scriptwriters in a hotel room to create the scripts for his films. During their stay in the manor, they discussed the game's plot and the new gameplay system, finalized the direction, and created rough sketches for most characters in the game. For the new character Hakari Mikagami, Iwamoto used a female saint as the main image for her design, and imagined her as being an older woman <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> up to. Another new character, Yumihiko Ichiyanagi, was Eshiro's favorite minor character in the series because of his character arc and how he grows throughout the game. The game was developed for the Ace Attorney series' tenth anniversary; because of this, several characters from previous games in the series made cameo appearances, including Frank Sahwit and Will Powers.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{occurred}} during Holy Week, 1799, amid rain and dense fog. Initially, the French {{were able to}} take, and hold, Ostrach and the nearby hamlet of Hoßkirch plus several strategic points on the Ostrach marsh. As the engagement began, Habsburg numerical superiority overwhelmed French defenses. By evening, the French left wing was flanked and Jourdan's men retreated from Ostrach to the Pfullendorf heights. On the next morning, as Jourdan considered a counter-attack, the weather broke, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> down on the Austrian battle array. The numbers and dispositions of the Austrians convinced him that any attack would be useless, {{and that he could}} not hope to maintain his position in the heights. As he withdrew, a portion of his right flank was cut off from the main force.|$|E
60|$|Buldeo hobbled away to {{the village}} as fast as <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>looking</b> back over his {{shoulder}} in case Mowgli should change into something terrible. When he got to the village he told a tale of magic and enchantment and sorcery that made the priest look very grave.|$|R

5|$|At Emma Town Bartlett met Baron Kleist, a {{distinguished}} Russian official who {{offered to take}} him to Emma Harbour on the coast, a week's journey away, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> for a ship to Alaska. Bartlett accepted, and on 10 May, though still weak from his journey and an attack of tonsillitis, said goodbye to Kataktovik (who was remaining for the time being in Emma Town), and set off with the baron. On the way they learned that Captain Pedersen was in the area. On 16 May they reached Emma Harbour; five days later Pedersen arrived in the whaler Herman and, without delay, took Bartlett on board and set out for Alaska. They arrived off Nome on 24 May, but ice prevented them reaching the shore. After three days' waiting they turned south, and landed at St Michael, where Bartlett was at last able to send a radio message to Ottawa informing the government of Karluk's fate. He also made enquiries about the whereabouts of the United States revenue cutter Bear, which he saw as a possible rescue vessel for the stranded party.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's likely he's alive {{enough if}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> it. The soul may be inside him {{if it had}} only a drop of vernaccia to warm it." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{these times}} Hart still had sufferings and {{uncertainties}} {{as to his}} conversion, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> always <b>look</b> back to his conversion, and believe that God saved his soul.|$|R
500|$|Petersen had {{difficulty}} ridding {{himself of the}} Will Graham character after principal photography wrapped. While rehearsing for a play in Chicago, he felt the old character [...] "always coming out" [...] instead of his new role. To try and rid himself of the character, Petersen went to a barbershop where he had them shave his beard, cut his hair and dye it blond so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> into the mirror and see a different person. At first {{he felt it was}} due to the rigorous shooting schedule for Manhunter, but later realized that the character [...] "had creeped in".|$|E
2500|$|Folklore records a {{story as}} a result of the {{explosion}}, Captain Jerome had been blown so high into the air, that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> down the ship's chimney, also flying through the air, and see pilot Bas Miller lying dazed on the river bank where the explosion had left him.|$|E
2500|$|Joaquín Argamasilla {{known as}} the [...] "Spaniard with X-ray Eyes" [...] claimed {{to be able to}} read {{handwriting}} or numbers on dice through closed metal boxes. In 1924, he was exposed by Houdini as a fraud. Argamasilla peeked through his simple blindfold and lifted up the edge of the box so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> inside it without others noticing. Houdini also investigated the Italian medium Nino Pecoraro, whom he considered to be fraudulent.|$|E
60|$|Then Peter wrapped this {{up in his}} {{handkerchief}} {{and took it to}} the palace. As for the King, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at it or listen to it enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--er--I--the wind didn't {{blow the}} cap," [...] was the lame answer. Just then Tom wished {{he was a}} {{thousand}} miles away. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> his chums in the face.|$|R

2500|$|As {{a member}} of the State House of Representatives, Djou had one term in the Hawaii House of Representatives from 2000 to 2002 and was the Minority Floor Leader. Djou {{launched}} a successful campaign to open the State Budget worksheets to the public after being told <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> at the budget worksheets in the committee room but was not allowed to take any notes or make copies of them. The documents detail the budget for various state departments and agencies. He opposed the state [...] "van cam" [...] program launched in 2002 to catch speeders using automated cameras instead of police officers, and successfully campaigned for its elimination.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanic}} {{said he had}} {{remarked to}} Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver there was [...] "less than half in the right tank and {{less than a quarter}} in the left tank". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> {{over his shoulder at the}} fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered in the wreckage. Denver said he would use the autopilot inflight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel, saying he would be flying for about an hour.|$|E
2500|$|After that, Bonhomme Richard started {{definitively}} {{losing the}} battle. Still, {{efforts to make}} the situation too hot for the British, both figuratively and literally, continued. Just after 9:30pm, one of these attempts succeeded in spectacular fashion. According to Jones's published campaign report, grenade-thrower William Hamilton ventured right out along a yard-arm until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> almost straight down {{on the deck of}} Serapis (by this time, almost cleared of men), and began trying to drop grenades, not onto the deck but down the hatches. By good fortune, one of these ignited a charge of gunpowder placed in readiness (contrary to standard fire safety practice, but Captain Pearson had encouraged his men to [...] "fire briskly") for loading into one of Serapis’ 18-pound guns.|$|E
60|$|Frank {{was taken}} aback. So appealed to {{he found that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not any longer say that he did love her. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> into her face with all his eyes, and sit there {{listening}} to her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{remember}} him acutely; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at me without {{a pang of}} reprobation, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not feel the pang without betraying it. He was to me a man of a great historical interest, but the interest was not returned.' ...|$|R
60|$|Before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> even <b>look</b> round, {{and survey}} this guard drawn up to receive him, a tap {{over the head}} with a capstan bar {{efficiently}} handled by Hagthorpe put him to sleep without the least fuss.|$|R
2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{his life}} Charles's fragile health {{deteriorated}} and he became increasingly hypersensitive and strange, at one point demanding that the bodies of his family be exhumed so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> upon the corpses. He officially retired when he had a nervous breakdown caused by the amount of pressure put on him to try to pull Spain out of the economic trouble it was going through. He lived a simple life from then on, playing games and engaging in other activities. He died in Madrid on 1 November 1700 (the 39th death anniversary of his immediate elder brother), five days before his 39th birthday. The physician who performed his autopsy stated that his body [...] "did not contain a single drop of blood; his heart was the size of a peppercorn; his lungs corroded; his intestines rotten and gangrenous; he had a single testicle, black as coal, and his head was full of water." ...|$|E
60|$|Henry {{eyed him}} inscrutably. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> inscrutable at times.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> at her; {{no words}} could have spoken {{for him as}} his silence spoke for him at that moment. When she took back the written paper there was pardon in her eyes already.|$|R
60|$|Jerry {{appeared}} to have sunk against the wall. His face was pallid, with drops of sweat standing out, with distorted, quivering lower jaw. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at Kurt. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not speak. With shaking hand he pointed {{toward the back of}} the house.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him. He felt her searching him tenderly with her eyes. But <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> back at her. She {{took his hand and}} kissed it, knowing he was {{thinking}} of his own youngest child.|$|R
60|$|The bandit {{raised his}} head and paced back to where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> out.|$|E
60|$|The {{man called}} Evans came swaying along the canoe until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> over his companion's shoulder.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{told you}} I haven't got your {{suitcase}} and don't {{know anything about}} it," [...] cried the loudly dressed youth. But {{at the same time}} his face grew flushed and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> Fred in the eyes.|$|R
60|$|Dale mounted, and, turning for a {{last word}} to Helen, he felt the words of cheer halted on his lips as he saw her {{standing}} white and broken-hearted, with {{her hands to her}} bosom. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> twice.|$|R
60|$|Nasmyth did so {{as clearly}} as <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and Acton <b>looked</b> at him thoughtfully {{for a moment or}} two.|$|R
