40|$|Background. Adulterants in Chinese {{medicines}} {{had always}} affected {{the efficacy of}} Chinese medicines and resulted in safety problems in drug use. We aimed to take the identification of fake velvet antlers as an example for establishment of a rapid and accurate <b>identification</b> <b>platform</b> for modern pharmaceutical companies and markets of Chinese medicine. Methods. In this study, we developed a novel electronic nose and DNA <b>identification</b> <b>platform</b> for identifying fake velvet antlers. Electronic nose was designed for rapid screening, while accurate identification based on DNA method was performed when electronic nose fails to accurately identify some complex samples. Results. Rapid identification of different velvet antlers based on electronic nose showed the good identification power, while accurate identification based on DNA sequencing technology demonstrated a correct identification rate of 100 %. We also mined thirty conserved specific sites of fake velvet antlers, which was useful for further work. Conclusions. The results suggested that electronic nose and DNA <b>identification</b> <b>platform</b> was effective for rapid and accurate identification of fake velvet antlers.

Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) {{technology has been}} established as a cost effective, reliable, and faster alternative <b>identification</b> <b>platform.</b> In this study, we evaluated {{the reliability of the}} two available MALDI-TOF MS systems for their routine clinical level identification accuracy and efficiency in a clinical microbiology laboratory setting. A total of 1, 341 routine phenotypically identified clinical bacterial and fungal isolates were selected and simultaneously analyzed using VITEK MS (bioMérieux, France) and Microflex LT (Bruker Diagnostics, Germany) MALDI-TOF MS systems. For any isolate that could not be identified with either of the systems and for any discordant result, 16 S rDNA gene or ITS 1 /ITS 2 sequencing was used. VITEK MS and Microflex LT correctly identified 1, 303 (97. 17 %) and 1, 298 (96. 79 %) isolates to the species level, respectively. In 114 (8. 50 %) isolates initial phenotypic identification was inaccurate. Both systems showed a similar identification efficiency and workflow robustness, and they were twice as more accurate compared to routine phenotypic identification in our sample pool.

We demonstrate a HMM structure <b>identification</b> <b>platform</b> that is novel and robustly-performing in a number of ways.

We then consider application to eukaryotic gene finding and show how such a metastate HMM improves the strength of coding/noncoding-transition contributions to gene-structure identification. We will describe situations where the coding/noncoding-transition modeling can effectively recapture the exon and intron heavy tail distribution modeling capability as well as manage the exon-start needle-in-the-haystack problem. In analysis of the C. elegans genome we show that the sensitivity and specificity (SN,SP) results for both the individual-state and full-exon predictions are greatly enhanced over the standard HMM when using the generalized-clique HMM.|$|E

Specifically, we constructed an experimental platform for System Identification based on a microfluidic device, a time-lapse microscope, and a set of automated syringes all controlled by a computer. The platform allows delivering a time-varying concentration of any molecule of interest to the cells trapped in the microfluidics device (input) and real-time monitoring of a fluorescent reporter protein (output) at a high sampling rate. We tested this platform on the GAL 1 promoter in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae driving expression of a green fluorescent protein (Gfp) fused to the GAL 1 gene. We demonstrated that the System <b>Identification</b> <b>platform</b> enables accurate measurements of the input (sugars concentrations in the medium) and output (Gfp fluorescence intensity) signals, thus making it possible to apply System Identification techniques to obtain a quantitative dynamical model of the promoter.

A total of 12 quality control, 64 challenge, and 623 clinical yeast isolates were used in the study. Comparisons of species <b>identification,</b> <b>platform</b> reliability, and substrate reproducibility were made between YST and API, with API considered the reference standard. Quality control testing to assess system and substrate reproducibility matched expected results ≥ 95 % of the time. The YST card correctly identified 100 % of the challenge strains, which covered the species range of the manufacturer's performance claims. Using clinical isolates, the YST card correctly identified 98. 5 %, with 1. 0 % of isolates incorrectly identified and 0. 5 % unidentified. Among clinical isolates, the YST card generated fewer low-discrimination results (18. 9 %) than did API (30. 0 %). The time to identification with YST was 18 h, compared to 48 to 72 h with API.

40|$|The {{functional}} analysis of highly complex microbial communities {{is a rather}} challenging discipline in proteomics. However, {{there is no alternative}} to its use if biological measures are required to improve the economic efficiency of biogas plants and waste water treatment plants, to remediate contaminated soil and water or to investigate the complex interactions in the human gut. Currently, analysis and interpretation of data derived from LC-MS/MS experiments present a major bottleneck in metaproteomics. In contrast to pure-culture proteomics, metaproteome samples are heterogeneous and much more complex. Moreover, for the major part of the microorganisms, protein sequence information is not available which results in a low protein identification rate. To overcome limits of existing solutions, we developed a software tool for the functional and taxonomic characterization of metaproteomics data we called MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA). Beside an advanced protein identification by a combination of multiple database search algorithms (Crux, OMSSA, X!Tandem, Inspect), and a spectral library search, the identification of proteins from unsequenced species by de novo sequencing and a BLAST search are included in the workflow.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nearly {{one-quarter of}} all avian species is either {{threatened}} or nearly threatened. Of these, 73 species {{are currently being}} rescued from going extinct in wildlife sanctuaries. One of the previously most critically-endangered is the crested ibis, Nipponia nippon. Once widespread across North-East Asia, by 1981 only seven individuals from two breeding pairs remained in the wild. The recovering crested ibis populations thus provide an excellent example for conservation genomics since every individual bird has been recruited for genomic and demographic studies. RESULTS: Using high-quality genome sequences of multiple crested ibis individuals, its thriving co-habitant, the little egret, Egretta garzetta, and the recently sequenced genomes of 41 other avian species that are under various degrees of survival threats, including the bald eagle, we carry out comparative analyses for genomic signatures of near extinction events in association with environmental and behavioral attributes of species. We confirm that both loss of genetic diversity and enrichment of deleterious mutations of protein-coding genes contribute to the major genetic defects of the endangered species. We further identify that genetic inbreeding and loss-of-function genes in the crested ibis may all constitute genetic susceptibility to other factors including long-term climate change, over-hunting, and agrochemical overuse. We also establish a genome-wide DNA <b>identification</b> <b>platform</b> for molecular breeding and conservation practices, to facilitate sustainable recovery of endangered species. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate common genomic signatures of population decline across avian species and pave a way for further effort in saving endangered species and enhancing conservation genomic efforts...|$|E

This is primarily {{due to the lack of}} suitable analytical tools for their simultaneous determination especially in an in vivo setting, which continues to constrain the evaluation of their relative health beneficiary potential and therefore prospective therapeutic application. Herein, we report a rapid and sensitive Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) based method for the simultaneous determination of the major catechins and theaflavins in black tea infusions as well as in different vital tissues and body fluids of tea-consuming guinea pigs. This method allowed efficient separation of all polyphenols within seven minutes of chromatographic run and had a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of ~ 5 ng/ml. Using this method, almost all bioactive catechins and theaflavins could be simultaneously detected in the plasma of guinea pigs orally administered 5 % black tea for 14 days. Our method could further detect the majority of these polyphenols in the lung and kidney as well as identify the major catechin metabolites in the urine of the tea-consuming animals. Overall, our study presents a novel tool for simultaneous detection and quantitation of both catechins and theaflavins in a single detection platform that could potentially enable precise elucidation of their relative bioavailability and bioefficacy as well as true health beneficiary potential in vivo. Such information would ultimately facilitate the accurate designing of therapeutic strategies utilizing high efficacy formulations of tea polyphenols for effective mitigation of oxidative damage and inflammation in humans as well as prevention of associated diseases...|$|E

Currently, assessing the potential crew health risk associated with a microbial contamination event requires return of representative environmental samples that are analyzed in a ground-based laboratory. It is therefore not currently possible to quickly identify microbes during spaceflight. This project addresses the unmet need for spaceflight-compatible microbial identification technology. The electrochemical detection and <b>identification</b> <b>platform</b> is expected to provide a sensitive, specific, and rapid sample-to-answer capability for in-flight microbial monitoring that can distinguish between related microorganisms (pathogens and non-pathogens) as well as chemical contaminants. This will dramatically enhance our ability to monitor the spacecraft environment and the health risk to the crew. Further, the project is expected to eliminate the need for sample return while significantly reducing crew time required for detection of multiple targets. Initial work will focus on the optimization of bacterial detection and identification. The platform is designed to release nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) from microorganisms without the use of harmful chemicals. Bacterial DNA or RNA is captured by bacteria-specific probe molecules that are bound to a microelectrode, and that capture event can generate a small change in the electrical current (Lam, et al. 2012. Anal. Chem. 84 (1) : 21 - 5.). This current is measured, and a determination is made whether a given microbe is present in the sample analyzed. Chemical detection can be accomplished by directly applying a sample to the microelectrode and measuring the resulting current change.

40|$|System {{identification}} is {{a branch of}} control engineering aimed at developing computational approaches to derive, from measurement data, a quantitative dynamical model of a physical system able to predict its future behaviour. There is a long tradition in the successful application of system identification approaches to Medicine and Physiology, however, in Molecular Biology, only few {{attempts have been made}} to infer a quantitative model of gene regulation due to experimental limitations of current techniques. Indeed, whereas in Engineering it is now common to measure thousands of time-points at a desired sampling rate for a physical system to be modelled, this has been very difficult in Biology, where time-series data consist of very few samples. In order to overcome the current limitations, I devised an experimental platform based on a microfluidic device, a time-lapse microscopy apparatus and, a set of automated syringes all controlled by a computer, that allows to provide a time varying concentration of any molecule of interest (input) to a population of cells, and to measure the single-cell response in the form of the fluorescence level of a reporter protein, at a sufficiently high sampling rate, thus making it possible to evaluate the dynamics of the process of interest. I tested the experimental platform to implement and compare different linear and nonlinear system identification approaches to a transcriptional network in the yeast S. cerevisiae. The results I obtained confirm that the experimental system <b>identification</b> <b>platform</b> I developed can successfully be used to infer quantitative models of a eukaryotic promoter in a rapid and efficient manner.

40|$|Polyketides and nonribosomal {{peptides}} constitute {{two classes}} of natural products which are well known for their application as antibiotic, antiparasitic, antifungal, and anticancer agents. One {{of the most remarkable}} discoveries yielded by studies into the biosynthesis of these compounds has been the finding that these seemingly disparate chemical structures are produced by a similar biosynthetic logic, in which multimodular enzymes activate, condense, and tailor a series of monomer units to produce the final natural product. The finding that the sequence and identity of active sites occurring in polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes dictates the structure and biological activity of the natural product has lead to studies towards reengineering these synthases for the production of novel small molecules, an approach known as combinatorial biosynthesis. However, the many difficulties encountered in such studies emphasize the need for a greater knowledge of these biosynthetic systems at the protein level before the full potential of such approaches can be achieved. The goal of the work in this thesis was to develop and apply chemical probes capable of facilitating structural and proteomic studies of PKS and NRPS enzymes, two aspects of these systems which have proven problematic to traditional methods of analysis. For this purpose, a series of fluorescence, affinity, and crosslinking probes were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to label enzyme activities commonly utilized by PKS and NRPS enzymes. These studies lead {{to the development of a}} chemoenzymatic crosslinking approach capable of directly reporting on the protein-protein interactions of the acyl carrier protein-dehydratase pair found in PKS systems, as well as methods for the specific labeling of PKS and NRPS carrier protein, ketosynthase, thioesterase, and dehydratase domains with fluorescence and affinity reagents in complex proteomic mixtures. Finally, these chemical proteomic probes were integrated with a high- content, mass spectrometry based protein <b>identification</b> <b>platform</b> for the global proteomic analysis of PKS and NRPS biosynthesis in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis.

Current developments in technological {{areas such as the}} Internet of Things (IoT), lead to new technological solutions that can aid this shift in the healthcare sector. This study presents the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a platform called Common Recognition and <b>Identification</b> <b>Platform</b> (CRIP), a part of the CareStore project, which aims at supporting caregivers and citizens to manage health routines in a seamless way. Specifically, the CRIP offers sensor-based support for seamless identification of users and health devices. A set of initial requirements was defined with a focus on usability limitations and current sensor technologies. The CRIP was designed and implemented using several technologies that enable seamless integration and interaction of sensors and people, namely Near Field Communication and fingerprint biometrics for identification and authentication, Bluetooth for communication with health devices and web services for wider integration with other platforms. Two CRIP prototypes were implemented and evaluated in laboratory during a period of eight months. The evaluations consisted of identifying users and devices, as well as seamlessly configure and acquire vital data from the last. Also, the entire Carestore platform was deployed in a nursing home where its usability was evaluated with caregivers. The evaluations helped assess that seamless identification of users and seamless configuration and communication with health devices is feasible and can help enable the IoT on healthcare applications. Therefore, the CRIP and similar platforms could be transformed into a valuable enabling technology for secure and reliable IoT deployments on the healthcare sector.

40|$|Identification {{of small}} {{molecules}} is of major importance for many applications. Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass spectrometry (LC- MSMS) is gaining increasing {{interest in the}} field of small molecule identification. LC-MSMS has a broad range of detection, is sensitive and does not need special sample pre-processing. As a major chal- lenge, spectra of the same compound can show great variability across acquisitions. High spectra variability limits the use of LC-MSMS for library search identifications. Dedicated identification tools such as MS Search from NIST show insufficient performances when it comes to cross-platform identification. In this thesis, we present the new library search scoring model X- Rank. X-Rank matches conserved properties of spectra and proposes a robust probability scoring model. Scoring parameters can be opti- mized from a training set. A re-training of X-Rank for a specific data set, was shown to essentially improve the results. The efficiency of X-Rank was compared to existing solutions, using two test-sets from different machine types. Overall X-Rank showed better results in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Especially in the case of cross-platform identification, X-Rank could better discriminate correct from wrong matches. Furthermore, X-Rank could correctly identify and top rank eight chemical compounds in a test mix. Even though these results confirm an important improvement for cross-platform identification, filters before and after the X-Rank scor- ing are still useful. In this perspective, a new approach to confidently use the retention time information is presented. Furthermore, a spec- tra filtering approach is applied, which improves the identification in terms of quality and speed. Finally, using a specific training configuration, X-Rank was adapted for proteomics data. Combined with the peptide identification tool Phenyx, X-Rank helped matching additional peptides. X-Rank was implemented into the small molecule <b>identification</b> <b>platform</b> SmileMS. SmileMS is designed for a routine use in laborato- ries. It is a multi-user platform, which provides a simple identification workflow and intuitive result visualization. Thanks to the generic software architecture and the mutual inte- gration with the open-source project Java Proteomic Library (JPL), the addition of new methods to SmileMS is facilitated. Such methods in- clude quantification, the combined use of several algorithms, GC-MS and exact mass identification...|$|E
5000|$|In {{creating}} the new box size the IEMA {{found itself in}} the unlikely position of platform guardian (where each console platform had a first-party publisher to oversee standardization matters, PC games {{by their very nature}} did not). As such, the industry pressured the organization to develop a <b>platform</b> <b>identification</b> mark which would unify the display and focus the customer's brand perception. Again the IEMA worked with publishers to create a new standard [...] "PC" [...] icon, and would provide its use on a royalty-free basis to the industry.|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{development}} has yielded the improved {{version of the}} radio frequency identification (RFID) called the wireless <b>identification</b> sensing <b>platform</b> (WISP). Recent research suggests the combined system of integrated RFID and wireless sensor network (WSN) used for coupling the virtual and physical world, bridging the gap between WSN and RFID. The possibility of having an integrated WISP sensor network might be {{a starting point for}} the new future smart system 2 ̆ 7 s application. And yet, in every system there will be sensitive data that requires various degree of data encryption. Given the steep design challenge and the limited resources provided on both WSN and WISP 2 ̆ 7 s platforms, we can foresee that the design trend has to be memory and hardware efficient. In this paper, we present a minimalist approach to securely encrypt, authenticate and exchange secret keys with a minimal instruction set computer (MISC) processor based on the AES algorithm, termed the enhanced AES (NAES) processor...|$|R

Protein biomarkers offer tremendous potential {{in this regard}} due to their great diversity and intimate involvement in physiology. An effective program to discover protein biomarkers using existing technology will require team science, an integrated informatics <b>platform,</b> <b>identification</b> and quantitation of candidate biomarkers in disease tissue, mouse models of disease, standardized reagents for analyzing candidate biomarkers in bodily fluids, and implementation of automation. Technology improvements for better fractionation of the proteome, selection of specific biomarkers from complex mixtures, and multiplexed assay of biomarkers would greatly enhance progress...|$|R
40|$|From {{political}} practitioners’ {{point of}} view the pre-election campaign publicity is a complicated political phenomenon {{and at the same}} time the process built upon the rules of political communication that fulfills a number of consistent functions during campaign. Among these functions are: political party, new election bloc or separate candidate’s name identification; election bloc and can didate’s im age building; election <b>platform</b> <b>identification,</b> issue development and exploitation; campaign messages symbolization and advertising as well as others. The author came to the conclusion that these types of factors in most cases motivate voter choices in elections in Ukraine...|$|R
