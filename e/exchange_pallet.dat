40|$|During my Spring 2016 internship, my {{two major}} {{contributions}} were {{the design of}} the Commodities <b>Exchange</b> <b>Pallet</b> and the design of a test stand for a 100 pounds-thrust sounding rocket. The Commodities <b>Exchange</b> <b>Pallet</b> is a prototype developed for the Human Exploration Spacecraft Testbed for Integration and Advancement (HESTIA) program. Under the HESTIA initiative the Commodities <b>Exchange</b> <b>Pallet</b> was developed as a method for demonstrating multi-system integration thru the transportation of In-Situ Resource Utilization produced oxygen and water to a human habitat. Ultimately, this prototype's performance will allow for future evaluation of integration, which may lead {{to the development of a}} flight capable pallet for future deep-space exploration missions. For HESTIA, my main task was to design the Commodities <b>Exchange</b> <b>Pallet</b> system to be used for completing an integration demonstration. Under the guidance of my mentor, I designed, both, the structural frame and fluid delivery system for the commodities pallet. The fluid delivery system includes a liquid-oxygen to gaseous-oxygen system, a water delivery system, and a carbon-dioxide compressors system. The structural frame is designed to meet safety and transportation requirements, as well as the ability to interface with the ER division's Portable Utility Pallet. The commodities pallet structure also includes independent instrumentation oxygen/water panels for operation and system monitoring. My major accomplishments for the commodities <b>exchange</b> <b>pallet</b> were the completion of the fluid delivery systems and the structural frame designs. In addition, parts selection was completed in order to expedite construction of the prototype, scheduled to begin in May of 2016. Once the commodities pallet is assembled and tested it is expected to complete a fully integrated transfer demonstration with the ISRU unit and the Environmental Control and Life Support System test chamber in September of 2016. In addition to the development of the Commodities <b>Exchange</b> <b>Pallet,</b> I also assisted in preparation for testing the upper stage of a sounding rocket developed as a Center Innovation Fund project. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the integration between a propulsion system and a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The upper stage and SOFC are scheduled to complete an integrated test in August of 2016. As part of preparation for scheduled testing, I was responsible for designing the upper stage's test stand/support structure and main engine plume deflector to be used during hot-fire testing (fig. 3). The structural components of the test stand need to meet safety requirements for operation of the propulsion system, which consist of a 100 pounds-thrust main engine and two 15 pounds-thrust reaction control thrusters. My main accomplishment for this project was the completion of the design and the parts selection for construction of the structure, scheduled to begin late April of 2016...|$|E
40|$|The pallet is a {{platform}} used for storing, handling and transporting products. There {{are hundreds of}} different pallet sizes around the world. The case of pallets is examined to illustrate the impact of multiplicity of standards on trade costs. We select this case because pallets are used all over the world, pallet standards are not too sophisticated, and data on pallet standards and costs are to some extent available. The paper examines why {{there are so many}} different pallet standards, the associated trade costs and the reasons why countries have not harmonised pallet sizes to eliminate such costs. It then presents options for exporters to mitigate the adverse effects of standards multiplicity while complying with destination markets' standard requirements. The range of options is limited for exporters from less developed countries because of the lack of rental and <b>exchange</b> <b>pallet</b> markets. To mitigate the costs of this multiplicity of standards, the international community's strategy should focus on developing awareness of the cost of multiplicity of standards and actively supporting standardisation.

50|$|Following the {{standardization}} {{most of the}} European industry switched over to use Euro-pallets with trucks, forklifts and high-rack warehouses {{optimized for}} their size. National associations developed framework agreements for <b>pallet</b> <b>exchange</b> in that freight would be delivered on Euro-pallets and be given {{the same number of}} Euro-pallets in return ("pallet for pallet"). The Euro-pallets are controlled by the association and the association takes care of repairing or removing old pallets from the pool. With the ongoing European integration, the European Pallet Pool allowed for <b>pallet</b> <b>exchange</b> even in cross-border dealings.|$|R
40|$|Company G {{has already}} taken many steps in {{preventing}} pollution in the facility, and is continually doing an excellent job. This was first noticed while touring the facility with Nobody. There are many examples of previous pollution prevention implementation, {{but the most important}} as far as producing less waste include the following: Approximately 20 pounds of office paper is generated per month, and it is shredded and used for packing. All polypropylene plastic waste is reground and treated as if it were virgin resin. This contributes to the low amount of plastic waste in the dumpsters. All gaylords and other cardboard products, which make up about 10 tons per month, are recycled and picked up three times a week. Because Company G already has excellent waste management habits, the suggestions provided are solely intended to supplement current practices. There are four main opportunities. and they The wooden <b>pallets</b> can be <b>exchanged</b> for plastic <b>pallets,</b> which cost more per pallet, but will last forever if properly cared for. Many large companies are switching to the plastic pallets because it greatly minimizes the waste produced and companies do no...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{present a}} review and {{recommendation}} for a standardization program for pallets {{in the food}} industry. Efficiency in the food distribution system would be significantly increased if standardizationof pallets should become a reality. The great variety of pallet sizes and types of construction {{is a result of}} many different handling, storing, and transporting requirements that have been thrust upon an industry which has had no incentive to standard-ize. However, evidence of the need for a standard pallet was apparent when the problem of <b>pallet</b> <b>exchange</b> arose as a major deterrent to efficiency. Since most consumers are vitally interested in lower food prices, and farmers and distributors are interested in increas-ing their profits, standardizationof pallets as a means of holding costs to a minimum has become an issue of great debate and interest in the food industry. The responsibility for implementing a standardizationprogram lies with the distributors and the food industry in general should be carried out on a voluntary basis. This paper presents a review of efforts by the food industry to stand-ardize pallet sizes and types of con-struction. It (1) ptesents the current status of pallet standardization, (2) defines the major problems the industry faces in implementing standardization, and (3) presents recommendations for alternative actions by industry. The scope of standardization includes nomen-clature for and the types, sizes, materials, and components of pallets, as well as inspection, testing, and sampling...|$|R
40|$|In {{the modern}} {{manufacturing}} industry {{the need for}} faster and more robust product development processes is seen {{as one of the}} main strategic areas to focus on in order to support sustainable growth and even long term survival of companies due to continuously increasing global competition. For the metal-cutting tool manufacturer Sandvik Coromant product development is seen as a key strategic area and due to that improvements in the overall product development chain are being worked on. In order to have more reliable production of prototypes {{and at the same time}} have them delivered within short and predictable lead time a new small-series flexible manufacturing line needs to be set up. This project takes on analysis of three levels of analysis for this new manufacturing line, that is production planning, flow analysis and scenario analysis. Through the analysis information has been collected to set up the boundaries for which the system needs to work within, such as demand forecast, processing requirements and planning as well as estimation of cycle times for different steps in the flow. The project provider had already made a framework of manufacturing techniques and concepts which are known but the idea for this project was to put those pieces together in a system model which could be analysed with regards to flow characteristics and system performance. The results would then be a basis for a decision on capacity and layout design for the new system. It is shown that the decision on capacity is mostly related to resource planning at the system bottleneck, which is a precision material removal station applying either high-speed milling or laser technology for material removal. Scenarios for variables such as order batch sizes are analysed and it is shown how the target for service level can be reached by for example increasing lead time definition for large order batches. For a higher capacity option at the bottleneck operation the robustness of the system is tested by adjusting demand and cycle time needs for the bottleneck step, and this gives results within service level target for those scenarios. The idea is that all machining operations and key measurements for the products should be possible to do within the flow line. This results in relatively low utilization for some of the equipment, but this is a trade-off which makes the system flexible and independent. The effect of having a transportation robot for the flow line is checked as an alternative to having operator at the line 16 hours per day. In the base case with the operators, automatic <b>pallet</b> <b>exchange</b> functionality is set up at the two most utilized machines with local pallet magazine for parts to be manufactured. It is shown that a solution with a transportation robot would only result in about 1 % higher serve level compared to the base case solution. It was a conclusion to recommend a solution with only one machine for the bottleneck operation and either add restriction on order batch sizes or define longer lead time for larger order batches. It was recommended to implement pallet exchanger with a local pallet magazine for pallets which hold the parts at two work stations which have the highest utilization. This solution would according to the given background information and input variables give a desired service level by operating with one operator 16 hours per day, 7 days a week, and unmanned night shifts for which the high utilization machines could be unloaded and loaded by an automated pallet exchanger and thus could operate automatically during night time...|$|R
