Now in cancers and <b>hydrophoby</b> they are quite ingenious. I will just take this bark home and analyze it; for, though it can’t be worth sixpence to the young man’s shoulder, it may be good for the toothache, or rheumatism, or some of them complaints.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide a {{comparative}} analysis of hydraulic characteristics of some modern organic coatings used for trenchless rehabilitation of engineering pipelines. Scotchkote 169 HB pipeline inner protective coating manufactured by « 3 M» production company (USA) and Subcote FLP coating by «Group POLYPLASTIC» Ltd (RF) were the objects of this investigation. The article presents general characteristics of alternative protective coatings. A methodical approach to determination of the protective coating hydraulic characteristics is described by the tests at a special patented small-sized bench through estimation of the coatings’ <b>hydrophoby</b> with the terms of hydraulic characteristics. Based on the obtained results the conclusions are made concerning the feasibility of application of organic coatings compared to non-organic ones (for example, cement-sand coatings). This will enable power savings due to a lower hydraulic resistance during the water transportation. Based on the experimental studies in static and dynamic conditions on a small-sized testing bench it was proved, that the Subcote FLP protective coating has hydrophilic properties. There are shown results of an automated processing of experimental data and comparison of the values of the coefficients of hydraulic friction, resistivity and roughness, which have been obtained at the large-sized and small-sized benches, as well as at a roughness indicator. Provision has been made of a possible and reasonable use of small-sized benches instead of large-sized ones for determination of <b>hydrophoby</b> and hydraulic parameters, which will considerably facilitate the traditional method of comprehensive estimation of the hydraulic performance of various types of protective coatings...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to study the biocidal mechanisms of spark discharge plasma radiation. Materials and Methods. The suspensions of studied bacterial strains were treated in optimal discharge conditions: pulse capacitor capacity C= 3. 3 nF, ballast resistance R= 10 MOhm, power supply voltage UPS= 11 kV, pulse recurrence frequency — 10 Hz. Biocidal effect of plasma radiation was estimated {{by the number of}} colony-forming units. The analysis of oxidative process intensity in procariotic cells after plasma radiation exposure was performed according to relative concentration of lipid peroxidation products and fluorescence level of bityrosine, tryptophan and glycated proteins, cell membrane <b>hydrophoby</b> change was studied by fluorescence intensity of 1. 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene. The character of metabolic changes in cells after plasma radiation exposure was studied by pyridine nucleotides fluorescence intensity, surface structures condition — by the concentration of sialic acids in extracellular medium. Extracellular pH change was assessed pH-metrically, and intracellular рH was analyzed by means of fluorometry, using fluoroscein probe. Results. 100...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the pellet can be translated {{by the quality of}} the pellet which is defined as the proportion of intact pellets that come to feeders for chickens, i. e., its resistance to breakage between the feed mill and farms. The use of diets with a higher percentage of intact pellets results in better performance of birds when compared with the feed rations. The main factors that affect pellet quality are: characteristics of pelleting, the feed composition, particle size, pelleting temperature, moisture and steam injection. From a nutritional standpoint, one can consider that the smaller the particle size of food increased their contact with the digestive juices, which aids digestion and absorption of nutrients. However, finely ground lead to less stimulation and growth of intestinal ephitellium. But from the standpoint of production of feed, the larger the particle size of ingredients largest economy with energy and greater efficiency (tons / hour) milling. Because of this, it is suggested that the particle sizes used vary between 500 and 700 ìm to not to cause loss of performance of the birds, nor the income from the factory. Increased energy, through the addition of oils and fats, have much influence on performance parameters of broilers {{and the quality of the}} pellet produced. The presence of oils and / or fat, depending on the amount, on its <b>hydrophoby</b> characteristic, causing damage to the particles aggregation acting as a lubricant between food particles and the matrix of pelleting, decreasing the pelleting pressure and its gelatinization, resulting into poor quality pellets...|$|E
