25|$|An athlete {{may choose}} to leave their sport due to many reasons, either due to an injury or due to them {{reaching}} an old age. If an athlete becomes injured, this must be looked deeper into, as an injury can vary between very subtle and very dangerous. If the athlete loves their sport, they will sometimes hide {{the severity of the}} injury and <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> till it heals slightly {{in order for them to}} get playing as soon as possible, which could cause catastrophic injuries later on in their career. This is why injuries need to be looked into, because if the injury is too extreme where the athlete can't physically go back to playing their sport, they may get forced to retire in order for them not to damage themselves at a more extreme level, resulting in the athlete experiencing many different feelings, such as alienation, distress or uselessness.|$|E
25|$|Maimonides {{argued that}} time was {{required}} between meat and dairy produce because meat can become stuck in the teeth, a problem he suggested would last for about six hours after eating it; this interpretation was shared by Solomon ben Aderet, a prominent pupil of his, and Asher ben Jehiel, who gained entry to the rabbinate by Solomon ben Aderet's approval, {{as well as by}} the later Shulchan Aruch. By contrast, tosafists argued that the key detail was just the avoidance of dairy produce appearing at the same meal as meat. Therefore, it was sufficient to <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> until a new meal—which to them simply meant clearing the table, reciting a particular blessing, and cleaning their mouths. Some later rabbinic writers, like Moses Isserles, and significant texts, like the Zohar (as noted by Vilna Gaon and Daniel Josiah Pinto), argued that a meal still did not qualify as new unless at least an hour had passed since the previous meal.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{confided in}} Branca {{that he wanted}} to be the biggest star in show {{business}} and [...] "the wealthiest". Jackson was upset about what he perceived to be the under-performance of Off the Wall, stating, [...] "It was totally unfair that it didn't get Record of the Year and it can never happen again." [...] He also felt undervalued by the music industry; in 1980 when Jackson asked the publicist of Rolling Stone if they would be interested in doing a cover story on him, the publicist declined, to which Jackson responded, [...] "I've been told over and over that black people on the cover of magazines doesn't sell copies ... <b>Just</b> <b>wait.</b> Someday those magazines are going to be begging me for an interview. Maybe I'll give them one, and maybe I won't." ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{thought the}} moral {{message of the}} {{original}} tale was inappropriate, and decided to [...] "put a spin on it" [...] by making the fulfillment of wishes seem like a great solution, but eventually becoming a problem. Another major theme was avoiding an attempt to be what the person is not – both Aladdin and Jasmine get into trouble pretending to be different people, and the Prince Ali persona fails to impress Jasmine, who only falls for Aladdin when she finds out who he truly is. [...] Being [...] "imprisoned" [...] is also presented, a fate that occurs {{to most of the}} characters – Aladdin and Jasmine are limited by their lifestyles, Genie is attached to his lamp, and Jafar to the Sultan – and is represented visually by the prison-like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace, and the scene involving caged birds which Jasmine later frees. Jasmine is also depicted as a different Disney Princess, being rebellious against the royal life and the social structure, and trying to make her own way, unlike the princesses who <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> for rescue.|$|E
500|$|In October 2016, in {{response}} to a fan's question about the lack of new Nine Inch Nails music, Reznor responded with [...] "2016 is not over yet". In December 2016, Reznor commented on his statement regarding Nine Inch Nails' return {{by the end of the}} year: [...] "Those words did come out of my mouth, didn't they? [...] <b>Just</b> <b>wait</b> and see what happens." [...] Three days later, Reznor announced an extended play entitled Not the Actual Events, along with reissues of Broken, The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile, with subsequent reissues of With Teeth, Year Zero, and The Slip being released later in 2017. Also announced was The Fragile: Deviations 1, which comprised 37 instrumental, alternate and unreleased tracks, many of which have never been heard before anywhere. Not the Actual Events was released on December 23, 2016, with fans who pre-ordered it receiving their download links one day earlier. Atticus Ross was also revealed to be an official full-time member of the band, the first member other than Reznor to be added to the band.|$|E

500|$|... "Ike's Wee Wee" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker. The scene where Mr. Mackey loses the marijuana cigarette in class was inspired by a real event from Parker's life, where a counselor came into his class in seventh grade, and passed around a lit piece of marijuana, which then disappeared. At {{the beginning and end of}} the episode, there are scenes where the kids imitate Mr. Mackey's voice to him, while he is oblivious to the fact that he is being made fun of. Parker and his classmates used to do the same thing to their counselor in junior high school, who was the basis for Mr. Mackey's character. Parker said that he was especially proud of Chef's line, [...] "There's a time and a place for everything, and it's called college", which is something Parker believes in, noting that if he had a child, he would tell him: [...] "Do whatever you want, <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> till college because you don't know what the fuck's up right now." [...] Chef's sentence would later return in the season four episode [...] "The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Clarence Waldron from Jet, Cole said the idea of recording a Christmas album started after {{a telephone call from}} producer and longtime friend Michael Masser, with whom Cole had worked on the song [...] "Someone That I Used to Love" [...] from her 1980 album Don't Look Back and her 1989 single [...] "Miss You Like Crazy". Cole described the telephone call from Masser as unexpected; Masser told her, [...] "I've got this beautiful Christmas song I wrote just for you". When they met, Messer played [...] "No More Blue Christmas"; after the session they both agreed to record a Christmas album. Cole described the decision to form a Christmas album as leaving her [...] "running around in April, looking for Christmas songs". Cole expressed hope that the album would remind her fans about [...] "the true spirit of the holiday season". She wanted it to communicate that Christmas is [...] "a time for families to reflect and not <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> until the holidays to be a family". Cole's twin sister Timolin Cole said, [...] "Christmas Eve has always been a magical time with Natalie" [...] when she could connect with family over holiday traditions.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} less positive. The Herald Suns head {{reviewer}} Leigh Paatsch gave the film no stars, claiming the film tried {{to match the}} edginess of the 2007 comedy film Juno but was, [...] "way, way off the mark". He wrote, [...] "If you think the title screams 'Go watch something else', <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> until you get a load of this lame local production." [...] Jim Schembri of The Age opined that the film {{was an example of}} [...] "just how bad local [...] films can get". In particular, he criticised the [...] "stiff" [...] performances, the [...] "woeful" [...] directing and the plot's implausibility. Variety magazine's Richard Kuipers wrote that the film was [...] "sporadically amusing" [...] and lacked [...] "scripting smarts and pulling power across demographics". He praised the soundtrack and Castle-Hughes' portrayal of Sunni, but felt that the film was brought down by dull cinematography and [...] "uninspired dialogue and direction". Bernadette McNulty of The Daily Telegraph noted that the film's greatest downfall was that [...] "the jokes aren't funny enough and the sadness barely breaks your heart". She complimented Toni Collette's performance but felt that [...] "her slight role is insufficient to make it fly the distance". Luke Goodsell, writing for Empire magazine, awarded the film 2 out of 5 stars and deemed it to be deserving of [...] "an all-purpose warning label to stay the Hell away".|$|E

[...] Due {{to the death of}} his uncle, Bruno {{initially}} gave up motor racing at his family's insistence. He eventually raced in F1 between 2010 and 2012, in the latter year for the Williams team, which was a decision that, reportedly, had a significant emotional impact on the Senna family and was seen by some as a signing only resulting from Bruno's big name and the money it could bring.|$|E

2500|$|The win {{attracted}} further {{attention on}} social media because Gun Runner ran the final half mile with a horseshoe caught in his tail: a shoe from Cautious Giant flew loose just as Gun Runner was starting his move.

2500|$|St. Petersburg Times critic Steve Persall {{found that}} the most {{offensive}} fact about the film was that it [...] "suggests that all this objectification of women makes them stronger.

[...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times described the film as a [...] "fantasia of misogyny" [...] that pretends to be a [...] "feminist fable of empowerment" [...] and {{found that the}} film's treatment of sexual violence was problematic and believes the target audience as a whole is in favour of it. Peter Debruge of Variety argued that the film is [...] "misleadingly positioned as female empowerment despite clearly having been hatched as fantasy fodder for 13-year-old guys" [...] and that the fact that the young women in the movie are [...] "under constant threat of being raped or murdered" [...] makes the film [...] "highly inappropriate for young viewers." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} rumored that Sorge {{provided}} the exact date of [...] "Barbarossa", but historian Gordon Prange in 1984 {{concluded that the}} closest Sorge came was 20 June 1941 and that Sorge himself never claimed to have discovered the correct date (22 June) in advance. [...] The date of 20 June was given to Sorge by Oberstleutnant (lieutenant-colonel) Erwin Scholl, the deputy military attaché at the German embassy. Despite knowing Germany was going to invade the Soviet Union sometime in May or June 1941, Sorge was still shocked on 22 June 1941 when he learned of Operation Barbarossa, going to a bar to get drunk while repeating in English: [...] "Hitler's a fucking criminal! A murderer. But Stalin will teach the bastard a lesson. You <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> and see!". The Soviet press reported in 1964 that on 15 June 1941, Sorge had sent a radio dispatch saying that [...] "The war will begin on June 22." [...] Prange, {{who did not have}} access to material released by the Russian authorities in the 1990s, did not accept the veracity of this report.

[...] Oliva also said that Savatage has [...] "already gotten offers" [...] to play in [...] "certain areas of the world, America being one, Greece, South America, places like that", and added that he does not rule out the possibility of any more shows. Though Oliva said he does not know what the future holds for Savatage, he said, [...] "I just wish that everything works out good and then we'll see what happens down the road. I'll never say no to anything anymore, because every time I do, I get rained on." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Marshall Mathers LP was {{recorded}} in a two-month-long [...] "creative binge", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording {{in order to stay}} focused on working and figuring out how to [...] "map out" [...] each song. He described himself as a [...] "studio rat" [...] who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, [...] "We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio. ' We <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> and see what happens when we get there. [...] " [...] Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from [...] "fucking around" [...] in the studio; [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while [...] "Criminal" [...] was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. [...] "Kill You" [...] was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.|$|E
