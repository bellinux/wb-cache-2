60|$|The girl <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> meekly on her bosom, {{and again}} {{appeared}} satisfied with herself {{and with the}} world.|$|E
60|$|She had <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> again, {{and looked}} as if she were ready to face some {{impending}} attempt at mastery.|$|E
60|$|She <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> tightly on her breast, {{and laughed}} {{in a tone}} that made the howl of the old woman musical.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't know,' she answered, <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> about him. 'You {{must not}} go out to-night. There are ghosts and dreams abroad.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Balthazar's child," [...] she said. Then <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> {{she retired}} herself a step, an {{attentive}} observer of what passed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My grandmamma,' {{returned}} Lavvy, <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{and leaning}} back in her chair, 'wouldn't have sat staring people out of countenance, I think.' ...|$|R
60|$|Nasha {{stood in}} the control room, {{watching}} the planet fall away behind them. She <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> sitting {{down on the edge}} of the table.|$|E
60|$|She shrugged her shoulders, <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{beneath her}} breast, nodded to Saduko as he passed, then leaned {{gracefully}} {{against the fence}} and awaited events.|$|E
60|$|She turned, {{and walked}} slowly towards the castle. The Lady of Lochleven <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> and smiled in bitter resentment, as she watched her {{retiring}} steps.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ha, ha, ha!' she cried, <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and wagging <b>her</b> head; 'and so he wasn't married after all, wasn't he. Not married after all?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs Gamp {{looked at}} her with amazement, incredulity, and indignation; when Mrs Prig, {{shutting}} her eye still closer, and <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> still tighter, uttered these memorable and tremendous words: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do as you wold, you know, and cetrer, eh!' {{observed}} Clemency, <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{comfortably in}} <b>her</b> delight at this avowal, and patting her elbows. 'Such a short cut, an't it?' ...|$|R
60|$|Then she <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> {{and stood}} silent; and the house, {{from floor to}} ceiling, rose and cheered her until {{there was no more}} breath left in its lungs.|$|E
60|$|Arthur, noticing {{this last}} action, laughed lightly. The major frowned. Mildred <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{and stood in}} the {{background}} unmoved and unobtrusive. Louise was chatting volubly with her two cousins.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's got to suit,'said Una, and laughed. 'We Can't magic back at you.' She <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{and leaned}} against the gate. 'Suppose, now, you wanted to magic me into something--an otter? Could you?' ...|$|E
60|$|LADY (<b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{on the end}} of the couch, {{and leaning}} on them with a marked access of {{interest}} in him). You were not born a subject at all, I think.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is awful!" [...] said Nanny, <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> about <b>her</b> child, [...] "and I {{wonder that}} such gentlemen as Mr. John and Mr. Powis {{should go on}} an {{enterprise}} so wicked!" ...|$|R
60|$|The lady ignored this advice, and {{by dint of}} much {{strength}} of mind regained her self-control. She {{sat down on the}} locker again, and <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> showed clearly <b>her</b> intention to remain.|$|R
60|$|With these words, {{he ordered}} his horse instantly; and his sister, ceasing {{to argue with}} him, <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> upon her bosom, and looked up to heaven with a {{resigned}} and yet sorrowful countenance.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Watcher-by-Night {{is pleased}} to say that I lie, so doubtless I do lie," [...] she answered, her fixed smile {{deepening}} a little. Then she <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> across her breast and remained silent.|$|E
6000|$|Hush, {{beating heart}} of Christabel! [...] Jesu, Maria, shield her well! [...] She <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> beneath her cloak, [...] 55 [...] And stole {{to the other}} side of the oak. [...] What sees she there? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} leave this house until I am paid every {{shilling}} of which I have been robbed," [...] hissed out Mrs. Mackenzie; and she sat down, <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> across <b>her</b> chest.|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary, Mr. Farebrother," [...] said Mary, {{giving up}} the roses, and <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> but unable to look up, [...] "whenever you have {{anything}} to say to me I feel honored." ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{being able}} to discover, and not {{rendering}} the subject much clearer by shaking it, Mrs. Tetterby put the baby away in a cradle, and, <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> sat rocking it angrily with her foot.|$|R
6000|$|Now Tua made no answer. She only let fall her veil, <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{upon her}} breast, and waited. But Asti, mocking him, cried {{in a loud}} voice, that he might hear above the howling of the {{hurricane}} without: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No wheels," [...] Tasso said calmly. She {{straightened}} up. [...] "No wheels, no parts, no relays. Not a claw. Not the Second Variety." [...] She <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b> [...] "You're {{going to}} have to be able to explain this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{the butcher}} do his work," [...] mocked Soa; [...] "it shall avail him little. Doubtless he is angry because I have spoken {{the truth about}} him," [...] and she <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> upon her breast, {{awaiting}} the bullet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--got away," [...] {{she said}} savagely. But {{she was taken}} with a sudden nervous shiver, which she at once {{repressed}} by tightly dragging her shawl over her shoulders and elbows, and <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> defiantly.|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{reclined}} in <b>her</b> chair, <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and gazing a {{while at}} her cousin. [...] "I don't think I understand you," [...] {{she said at}} last coldly. [...] "I don't know what you're talking about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, Dauphin, tell me {{what that}} is!" [...] says this {{magnificent}} old lady, as she deposits her queen very quietly and <b>folds</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b> [...] "I should be sorry to utter a word disagreeable to your feelings." ...|$|R
60|$|Overpowered by supernatural awe at appearances, {{of which}} her faith {{permitted}} {{her not to}} question the reality, the Lady Eveline <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> on her bosom, and prostrated her forehead on the pavement, as the posture most fitting to listen to divine communication.|$|E
60|$|Miss Euphemia {{stared at}} Sol. Mrs. Sol {{looked up in}} her lord's face, and <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> in a {{resigned}} expression. Sol {{rose to his feet}} again, and shaded his eyes with his hand, but this time quite seriously, and gazed at Rand's smiling face.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>folded</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> as {{she leaned}} back in her chair. “Look here, Mr. Littlemore; I’m about as sweet-tempered as I used to be in America, but I know a great deal more. Of course I ain’t {{travelling}} with that young man. He’s only a good friend.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... [HILLCRIST blows his nose. JILL, with a choke, {{leans back}} in [...] <b>her</b> seat and <b>folds</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> tightly on <b>her</b> chest. MRS. [...] HILLCRIST passes her {{handkerchief}} over her lips, sitting [...] perfectly still. HILLCRIST, too, is motionless.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, without doubt. I am not blind. You {{have made}} sure of me because you knew that. You had reason! I det-est her." [...] Mademoiselle <b>folds</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and throws this last remark {{at him over}} one of her shoulders.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Prig, thus baffled, {{threw herself}} {{back in her}} chair, and closing the same eye more emphatically, and <b>folding</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> tighter, {{suffered}} <b>her</b> head to roll slowly from side to side, while she surveyed her friend with a contemptuous smile.|$|R
