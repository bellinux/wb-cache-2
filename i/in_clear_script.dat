5000|$|Oirat (Clear script: [...] Oirad kelen; Kalmyk: Өөрд, Őrd; Khalkha-Mongolian: , Oirad) {{belongs to}} the group of Mongolic languages. Scholars differ as to whether they regard Oirat as a {{distinct}} language or a major dialect of the Mongolian language. Oirat speaking areas are scattered across the far west of the Mongolian state, the northwest of People's Republic of China (mainly in Xinjiang, but even Deed Mongol in Qinghai and, with a tiny population, in Gansu), and Russia's Caspian coast, where its major variety is Kalmyk. In all three nations, Oirat has become variously endangered or even obsolescent {{as a direct result of}} government actions or as a consequence of social and economic policies. Its most widespread tribal dialect, which is spoken in all of these nations, is Torgut.

50|$|Her {{involvement}} with the political right began around 1991. She met Uwe Mundlos, {{the son of a}} professor at the Jena University of Applied Sciences teaching computer science, who arrived in Winzerla with his family just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. She formed a relationship with him and entered the neo-Nazi world of Jena coming into contact with the national and international neo-Nazi network. Uwe Böhnhardt, the son of a teacher and an engineer, became a close friend of theirs. Another friend of theirs at the time later describes her as primitive, empty-headed, with a vulgar demeanour and way of expression lacking any concern for manners. Mundlos he describes as clever but lazy. Criminality (including stealing computers from his school) had left Böhnhardt without qualifications. Neither Zschäpe nor Mundlos were without criminal behaviour by this time. A co-accused in the NSU trial describes Zschäpe as an achiever and not one to be subordinated.

50|$|<b>Clear</b> <b>Script</b> is a Mongolian script, whose obvious closest forebear is {{vertical}} Mongolian.

Not only were vowels assigned symbols, but all existing symbols were clarified. All of the 'old' symbols, those that did not change from the previously used script, were assigned a fixed meaning, based mostly on their Uyghur ancestors. [...] New symbols and diacritics were added to show vowels and vowel lengths, as well as distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants. There were even some marks enabling distinctions such as between ši and si which are unimportant for words written in the Oirat language but are useful for the transcription of foreign words and names.|$|R

5000|$|When {{not engaged}} in {{diplomacy}} between the Oirat and the Khalkha, Zaya Pandita spread Tibetan Buddhism to the Oirats, the Khalkha and even the Kalmyk people in far away Russia. In furtherance of his missionary work, Zaya Pandita composed a new alphabet, based on the traditional Mongolian alphabet, called [...] "Clear script" [...] (todo bichig) to transcribe the Oirat language as it is pronounced. By doing so, Zaya Pandita eliminated the ambiguities of the traditional Mongolian alphabet. From the time Zaya Pandita developed the <b>Clear</b> <b>Script</b> <b>in</b> 1648 {{until his death in}} 1662, he translated approximately 186 Buddhist texts from Tibetan language to the Oirat language while still serving the religious needs of the Oirat tribes in Dzungaria.|$|R

25|$|The {{traditional}} or classical Mongolian alphabet, {{sometimes called}} Hudum 'traditional' in Oirat {{in contrast to}} the <b>Clear</b> <b>script</b> (Todo 'exact'), is the original form of the Mongolian script used to write the Mongolian language. It does not distinguish several vowels (o/u, ö/ü, final a/e) and consonants (t/d, k/g, sometimes ž/y) that were not required for Uyghur, which was the source of the Mongol (or Uyghur-Mongol) script. The result is somewhat comparable to the situation of English, which must represent ten or more vowels with only five letters and uses the digraph th for two distinct sounds. Ambiguity is sometimes prevented by context, as the requirements of vowel harmony and syllable sequence usually indicate the correct sound. Moreover, as there are few words with an exactly identical spelling, actual ambiguities are rare for a reader who knows the orthography.|$|R
5000|$|The {{script is}} derived {{primarily}} from Classical Mongol on {{the analogy of}} the <b>Clear</b> <b>script,</b> and like it is written vertically. The version published by Nicolai Amagaev and [...] "Alamzhi-Mergen" [...] (Rinchingiin Elbegdorj) in 1910 consists of 7 vowels and 21 consonants. Diacritics are used to indicate long vowels (a vertical line), palatization (a circle), and letters for use in rendering Russian (a dot), including a letter representing the historical Russian double consonant /ʃt͡ʃ/ (corresponding to Cyrillic Щ). The alphabet can therefore also be represented as having 36 letters including 8 vowels. [...] Unlike Classical Mongol, the letter forms are invariant regardless of position in the word, being based on the medial forms in Classical Mongol, {{with the exception of}} a, which is based on the Uighur script and has a reduced form in medial and final position.|$|R

50|$|Oirat {{has been}} written in two script systems: historically, the <b>Clear</b> <b>script,</b> which {{originated}} from the Mongolian script, was used. It uses modified letters shapes e.g. to differentiate between different rounded vowels, and it uses a small stroke {{on the right to}} indicate vowel length. It was retained longest in China where it can still be found in an occasional journal article. In Kalmykia, a Cyrillic-based script system has been implemented. It is strictly phonemic, not representing epenthetic vowels, and thus doesn’t show syllabification. In Mongolia, Central Mongolian minority varieties have no status, thus Oirats are supposed to use Mongolian Cyrillic which de facto only represents Khalkha Mongolian. In China, Buryat and Oirat are considered non-standard as compared to Southern Mongolian and are therefore supposed to use the Mongolian script and Southern Mongolian grammar (if not, as in current practice, rather Mandarin Chinese and Hanzi) for writing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Principle-based {{pedagogical}} {{and technological}} designs {{were used to}} support knowledge building in a grade 5 - 6 class. Pedagogical designs focused on collective responsibility for knowledge advancement. Technological designs focused on provision of a public space for generating and continually improving ideas with (a) social-network-analysis tools to analyze and support community processes, and (b) vocabulary-analyzer and semanticanalysis tools to analyze and support conceptual growth. The tools were used by teachers, students, and researchers. Multi-level content analyses revealed patterns of reflective and adaptive use of the technology to support sustained knowledge building. Knowledge building is a social process with focus on the production and continual improvement of ideas of value to a community (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2003).
