5|$|According to modern-day analysis, a {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} Pacific Ocean, south of El Salvador, early on September 27. It drifted northward across Central America and eastern Mexico before emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico near Ciudad del Carmen on September 30. Weather reports had indicated low air pressures over the area for several days. It is relatively rare for {{a tropical}} cyclone to cross from the Pacific into the Atlantic, or vice versa, and this storm is among less than a dozen known to have officially done so. Only three other tropical cyclones have crossed from the eastern Pacific <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Norman brought minor {{flooding}} {{to western}} Mexico and record rainfall to areas of Texas in September 2012. The fourteenth tropical cyclone and fourteenth named storm of the 2012 Pacific hurricane season, Norman developed near {{the southern tip}} of Baja California early on September28. Upon developing into a tropical cyclone on September28, Norman attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h). Heading northward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> California, the storm began to weaken later that day due to southwesterly wind shear and land interaction. Norman curved northwestward and weakened to a tropical depression early on September29. Around that time, it briefly moved inland near Topolobampo, Sinaloa, before re-emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> California. Later on September29, Norman degenerated into a remnant low pressure area.|$|E
5|$|When {{the storm}} tracked across Nova Scotia {{and into the}} Northumberland Strait, {{it was still a}} Category1 hurricane, {{weakening}} to a tropical storm as it emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Saint Lawrence. Wind gusts of 86mph (139km/h) were reported in Charlottetown and 67mph (107km/h) in the Iles de la Madeleine in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June24, eventually emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico on July7. An {{area of low pressure}} became discernible, and {{with data from}} a reconnaissance aircraft, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on July8. The depression failed to organize appreciably as it tracked west to west-northwest, moving ashore South Padre Island, Texas with winds of 35mph (55km/h) by 14:00UTC that day. The depression degenerated into a remnant low by 06:00UTC on July9 and dissipated over northern Mexico a day later.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico on July30, the cloud pattern of system quickly became better organized. Later after emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico, ships and satellite images confirmed that Tropical Depression Four had formed offshore {{of the north}} coast of the Yucatán Peninsula; although it was likely that the depression formed 80miles (129km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula several hours earlier than confirmed. The following morning after development occurred, the depression had intensified into a tropical storm 575miles (920km) southeast of Texas; the National Hurricane Center assigned it to the name Chantal. Although it became a tropical storm early that morning, the system was not upgraded to a tropical storm until a reconnaissance flight confirmed tropical storm force winds about six hours later, when sustained winds were already 50mph (85km/h). Tropical Storm Chantal rapidly strengthened thereafter, with weather satellites indicating t–numbers increasing from 2.5to 3.5within twelve hours using the Dvorak technique. Chantal continued to intensify, and headed northwestward at 11mph (18km/h) due to weak ridging over Florida.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Rubí's recommendations, Presidio de San Agustín de Ahumada was closed in 1771, leaving the Texas coast unoccupied except for La Bahía. In July 1772, however, the {{governor}} of Texas heard rumors that English traders were building a settlement {{in the area of}} the Texas coast that had been abandoned. The commander of La Bahía was sent to find the settlement, but saw no sign of other Europeans. His expedition did, however, discover that the San Jacinto River emptied into Galveston Bay and not <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico.|$|E

In northern Cameroon, the Bénoué River runs {{north and west}} and empties into the Niger. The Logone flows northward into Lake Chad, which Cameroon shares with three neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Debra's origins {{were from}} an area of {{convection}} over the western Bahamas and Florida related to an upper-tropospheric cold-core low and a tropical wave on July15. Whilst {{under the influence of}} a subtropical ridge–or a belt of high pressure–it slowly meandered southwestward and arrived <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico on July20. A weak surface circulation was observed near 1900EST (0100UTC on July21) which was affected by an inverted trough as they turned westward.

5|$|Hurricane Edith rapidly {{weakened}} {{over the}} mountainous terrain of northeastern Central America, and 18 hours after it made landfall, it emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Honduras as an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane. It continued to weaken {{as it moved}} northwestward, and made landfall near Belize City with tropical storm winds of 70 mph (115 km/h). Edith weakened further while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, and emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Mexico near Campeche, Mexico late on September 11 as a minimal tropical storm. Edith initially failed to re-intensify as it moved northwestward, despite low amounts of wind shear and warm waters. This was because an anticyclone over the Gulf was closely connected with Hurricane Fern, which developed and moved over the northwestern portion of the Gulf of Mexico. The anticyclone resulted in an easterly upper-level flow across Edith, creating conditions not conducive for intensification. As Fern moved inland over Texas, the flow became more favorable around Edith, and 36 hours after entering the Gulf of Mexico, the storm began to reintensify slightly.|$|E
