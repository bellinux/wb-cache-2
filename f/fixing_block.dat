The roller of the engine and the shell of the centrifugal outer rotor of the generator are designed together. The permanent material and the <b>fixing</b> <b>block</b> are fixed on the shell of the outer rotor. the centrifugal force increase with the rotate speed increase, so, the permanent material will not be damaged at high speed, and {{the reliability of the}} generator is improved. When the rotor turns, the magnet field turns, the generator generates electricity,with the permanent magnet material of high remnant magnetic induction and the optimized design of the generator, the output voltage is improved when the engine at low speed. We develope a single-phase double half-wave electric regulator is to ensure the stability of the output voltage and can direct output direct current. ...|$|E

50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of having <b>fixed</b> <b>blocks</b> {{is that the}} faster trains are allowed to run, the longer the stopping distance, and therefore the longer the blocks need to be, thus decreasing the line's capacity. The <b>fixed</b> <b>blocks</b> must be sized for the worst case stopping distance, regardless of the actual speed of the trains.|$|R

The new [...] CBTC system will instead maintain a fixed distance of empty space (a moving block) between trains. This allows trains to operate closer together, which increases the frequency of trains arriving at stations and increases an LRT system’s overall capacity for ridership.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we generalize N-fold integer {{programs}} and two-stage integer programs with N scenarios to N-fold 4 -block decomposable integer programs. We show that for <b>fixed</b> <b>blocks</b> but variable N, these integer programs are polynomial-time solvable for any linear objective. Moreover, {{we present a}} polynomial-time computable optimality certificate for the case of <b>fixed</b> <b>blocks,</b> variable N and any convex separable objective function. We conclude with two sample applications, stochastic integer programs with second-order dominance constraints and stochastic integer multi-commodity flows, which (for <b>fixed</b> <b>blocks)</b> can be solved in polynomial time {{in the number of}} scenarios and commodities and in the binary encoding length of the input data. In the proof of our main theorem we combine several non-trivial constructions from the theory of Graver bases. We are confident that our approach paves the way for further extensions...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, video {{broadcast}} {{has become a}} popular application, but the traditional hierarchical design requires the source to pick a bitrate and video resolution for encoding before transmission, it cannot be efficient to accommodate users with different channel quality. The proposed DCAST scheme can solve this problem. DCAST uses the ME and MC technology to generate a predicted frame which helps current frame to do coset coding. However, in the ME process, DCAST uses <b>fixed</b> <b>block</b> size. In this paper, we use the variable block size motion estimation to replace the <b>fixed</b> <b>block</b> size motion estimation, it can effectively reduce the block effect and {{improve the quality of}} the reconstructed frame generated by MC and predicted frame. The DCAST with variable block size motion estimation is 0. 5 dB better than DCAST with <b>fixed</b> <b>block</b> size motion estimation. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|The BlockCopy {{stochastic}} local search {{algorithm is}} a state-of-the-art optimiser for the Wind Farm Layout Optimisation problem. Unlike many other metaheuristics-based optimisers, BlockCopy requires the specification {{of only one}} key parameter, namely a block size. In this paper, we investigate the effect on different block sizes on the optimisation results. Using standard benchmarks for the Wind Farm Layout Optimisation problem, we show that smaller <b>fixed</b> <b>block</b> sizes (relative to overall layout size) produce better optimised layouts than larger <b>fixed</b> <b>block</b> sizes. More interestingly, we also show that randomising the block size parameter results in optimisation performance at the same or a better level than that produced by the best algorithm with a <b>fixed</b> <b>block</b> size. Effectively, {{this means that the}} user can ignore the need to tune the block size parameter and simply randomise it instead. Such a strategy results in what is effectively a parameterless, but none-the-less effective, optimisation algorithm for the Wind Farm Layout Optimisation problem...|$|R

50|$|FICON is {{technically}} {{quite similar to}} more popular storage protocols, such as FCP. Both FICON and FCP share levels 1-3 of Fibre Channel specifications. Some administrators argue that FICON offers somewhat easier troubleshooting in mainframe environments, but the inherent technical advantages and disadvantages between FICON and FCP are much alike. Some mainframe-specific setups, such as GDPS, require FICON (or its predecessor ESCON). Mainframe-attached storage, such as IBM's System Storage DS8000, often supports both protocols. The storage is divided into <b>fixed</b> <b>block</b> storage volumes and mainframe-specific CKD/ECKD storage volumes. To access the <b>fixed</b> <b>block</b> volumes, one uses FCP. To access the CKD/ECKD volumes, one uses the FICON and/or ESCON.|$|R

An IBM mainframe constructs CKD track images in memory and executes the ECKD and CKD channel programs against the image. To bridge between the native <b>fixed</b> <b>block</b> sized disks and the variable length ECKD/CKD record format, the CKD track images in memory are mapped onto a series of <b>fixed</b> <b>blocks</b> suitable for transfer to and from an FBA disk subsystem.|$|R
40|$|A {{recently}} developed method of constructing protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes provides for low iterative decoding thresholds and minimum distances proportional to block sizes, {{and can be}} used for various code rates. A code constructed by this method can have either <b>fixed</b> input <b>block</b> size or <b>fixed</b> output <b>block</b> size and, in either case, provides rate compatibility. The method comprises two submethods: one for <b>fixed</b> input <b>block</b> size and one for <b>fixed</b> output <b>block</b> size. The first mentioned submethod is useful for applications in which there are requirements for rate-compatible codes that have <b>fixed</b> input <b>block</b> sizes. These are codes in which only the numbers of parity bits are allowed to vary. The fixed-output-blocksize submethod is useful for applications in which framing constraints are imposed on the physical layers of affected communication systems.
