50|$|Atherosclerosis (also {{known as}} arteriosclerotic {{vascular}} disease or ASVD) {{is a specific}} form of arteriosclerosis in which an artery wall thickens {{as a result of}} invasion and accumulation of white blood cells (foam cells) and proliferation of intimal-smooth-muscle cell creating an atheromatous (<b>fibrofatty)</b> plaque.|$|E
50|$|The {{disease is}} a type of nonischemic {{cardiomyopathy}} that involves primarily the right ventricle. It is characterized by hypokinetic areas involving the free wall of the right ventricle, with <b>fibrofatty</b> replacement of the right ventricular myocardium, with associated arrhythmias originating in the right ventricle.|$|E
50|$|Another prominent-earlobe {{correction}} {{technique is}} suturing the helical-cartilage tail to the concha, yet, because {{the tail of}} the helix does not extend much into the lobule, setting it back does not reliably correct the set back of the earlobe proper; other techniques involve skin excision and sutures, between the <b>ﬁbrofatty</b> tissue of the lobule and the tissues of the neck.|$|E
50|$|The cauda helicis (tail of the helix) {{is bound}} to the <b>fibrofatty</b> tissues of the earlobe by a network of {{connective}} tissue. The tail of the helix (cauda helicis), which projects outwards from the concha, carries the earlobe with it, causing it to protrude, which physical condition contributes to prominence of the lower pole of the pinna, the external ear.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that the development of apoptosis, or “programmed cell death” in response to pathological, physiologic, and/or genetic signals, may be a key developmental factor in causing cardiac arrhythmias. For example, apoptosis associated with atrophy and <b>fibrofatty</b> replacement of right ventricular tissue has been identified as the likely mechanism forarrhythmia development in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, a condition that may lead to sudden death in otherwise healthy young individuals.|$|E
5000|$|Surgical {{excision}} of hemangiomas is rarely indicated, and limited to lesions which fail medical therapy (or {{when it is}} contraindicated), which are anatomically distributed in a location which is amenable to resection, and in which resection would likely be necessary and the scar will be similar regardless of timing of the surgery. [...] Surgery may also be useful for removal of residual <b>fibrofatty</b> tissue (following hemangioma involution) and reconstruction of damaged structures.|$|E
50|$|Hallmark {{features}} of ARVC include {{enlargement of the}} right ventricle, replacement of right ventricular cardiomyocytes with <b>fibrofatty</b> deposits, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and arrhythmias. Biopsies from patients with ARVC consistently show abnormalities in intercalated discs, with decreased numbers of desmosomes and widening of intercellular gaps between adjacent cardiomyocytes, suggesting that this disease is a disease of intercalated discs. Studies investigating two heterozygous DSC2 mutations have shown that certain mutations in the N-terminal region can modify the subcellular localization of desmocollin-2 from the desmosomal plaque to the cytoplasm.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in PKP2 {{have been}} {{associated}} with, {{have been shown to}} cause, and are considered common in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by <b>fibrofatty</b> replacement of cardiomyocytes, ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death. It is estimated that 70% of all mutations associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy are within the PKP2 gene. These mutations in general appear to disrupt the assembly and stability of desmosomes. Mechanistic studies have shown that certain PKP2 mutations result in instability of the plakophilin-2 protein due to enhanced calpain-mediated degradation.|$|E
5000|$|The sole is a sensory organ {{by which}} we can {{perceive}} the ground while standing and walking.

[...] Each chamber is composed of internal <b>fibrofatty</b> tissue covered by external collagen connective tissue. The septa (internal walls) of these chambers are permeated by numerous blood vessels, making the sole one of the most vascularized, or blood-enriched, regions in the human body.|$|E
50|$|The {{constellation}} of clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic findings typically allow {{the diagnosis of}} FAVA. The most helpful imaging studies are ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The major imaging features of FAVA include the presence of complex intramuscular solid lesion replacing normal muscle fibers with <b>fibrofatty</b> overgrowth and phlebectasia. The extrafascial part is composed of fatty overgrowth, phlebectasia, and occasional lymphatic malformation. The histopathologic findings in FAVA include dense fibrous tissue, fat, and lymphoplasmacytic aggregates within atrophied skeletal muscle. Adipose tissue within skeletal muscles are associated with large, irregular, and sometimes excessively muscularized venous channels and smaller, clustered channels. Organizing thrombi, lymphatic foci and enlarged nerves encircled by dense fibrous tissue are also frequently noted in FAVA.|$|E
50|$|In the {{involution}} phase, a hemangioma finally {{begins to}} diminish in size. While it was previously thought that infantile hemangiomas improved by about 10% each year, newer {{evidence suggests that}} maximal improvement and involution is typically reached by 3.5 years of age. The majority of hemangiomas resolve by age 10, however, in some patients, the hemangioma doesn't completely resolve. Residual redness may be noted and can be improved with laser therapy, most commonly pulsed dye laser. Ablative fractional resurfacing may be considered for textural skin changes. Hemangiomas, especially those that have gotten very large during the growth phase, may leave behind stretched skin or <b>fibrofatty</b> tissue that may be disfiguring or require future surgical correction. Areas of prior ulceration may leave behind permanent scarring.|$|E
50|$|To {{distribute}} the compressive forces exerted on the heel during gait, {{and especially the}} stance phase when the heel contacts the ground, the {{sole of the foot}} is covered by a layer of subcutaneous connective tissue up to 2 cm thick (under the heel). This tissue has a system of pressure chambers that both acts as a shock absorber and stabilises the sole. Each of these chambers contains <b>fibrofatty</b> tissue covered by a layer of tough connective tissue made of collagen fibers. These septa ("walls") are firmly attached both to the plantar aponeurosis above and the sole's skin below. The sole of the foot {{is one of the most}} highly vascularized regions of the body surface, and the dense system of blood vessels further stabilize the septa.|$|E
5000|$|A hemangioma, {{also known}} as {{infantile}} hemangioma (IH), {{is one of the}} most common benign tumors of infancy and occurs in approximately 5-10% of infants. Infantile hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors composed of an increased number of unique endothelial cells that line blood vessels. They occur more frequently in female, premature and low birth weight infants. Infantile hemangiomas usually appear within the first weeks of life and grow most rapidly during the first three to six months of life. For most hemangiomas, 80% of infantile hemangioma size is generally reached by 3 months of age. Usually, growth and proliferation is complete and involution commences by twelve months of age. However, involution occurs slowly over many years with a majority of infantile hemangioma regression occurring by five years of age. Although infantile hemangiomas spontaneously regress over time, some may leave residual redundant <b>fibrofatty</b> tissue, scar, residual telangiectasia, or pigmentary changes. The word [...] "hemangioma" [...] comes from the Greek haema- (αίμα), [...] "blood"; angeio (αγγείο), [...] "vessel"; -oma (-ωμα), [...] "tumor".|$|E
50|$|Infantile {{hemangioma}} is {{the most}} common vascular tumor. It is a benign tumor, which occurs in 4-5% of Caucasian infants, but rarely in dark skinned infants. It occurs in 20% of low weight premature infants and 2.2 to 4.5 times more frequently in females. IH most commonly presents {{in the head and neck}} region (60%), but also involves the trunk and extremities. One third of these lesions is present at birth as a telangiectatic stain or ecchymotic area. During the first four weeks of life, 70% to 90% appear. Lesions that are situated beneath the skin may not appear until 3 to 4 months of age, when the tumor is large enough. During the first 9 months, IH undergoes rapid growth, which is faster than the growth of the child. This is called the proliferating phase. After 9 months, the growth of the tumor will decrease and equal the growth of the child for about 3 months. After 12 months, the tumor will start to involute and might even disappear. Involution occurs in one-third of patient by the age of 3 years, in 50% by the age of 5 years and in 72% by the age of 7 years. Involution may result in residual telangiestasis, pallor, atrophy, textural changes and sometimes <b>fibrofatty</b> residuum.Since 90% of IH is small, localized and asymptomatic, treatment mainly consists of observation and awaiting until involution is complete. IH can be treated with corticosteroids, which accelerate involution: in 95% of patients, growth is stabilized and 75% of tumors decrease in size. Intralesional corticosteroids are most effective, but may require additional injections, as the effect is only temporarily. Systemic corticosteroids may cause a number of side-effects and are only used in problematic IH, which is too large to treat with intralesional injections.During the proliferating phase, the tumor is highly vascular. Patients who undergo operative treatment during this period, are at risk for blood loss. Moreover, surgery during this phase, often leads to an inferior aesthetic outcome. However, patients may require intervention during childhood, because 50% of IH leave residual <b>fibrofatty</b> tissue, redundant skin, or damaged structures after involution. Waiting until involution is completed, ensures that the least amount of fibro fatty residuum and excess skin is resected, giving the smallest possible scar. Another option for treatment in the pulsed-dye laser. After involution residual telangiectasias can be treated with laser therapy.|$|E

Methods and Results—Myocardial thickness, epicardial fat thickness, percent fibrosis, and intramyocardial fat infiltration were measured in 16 sections each from 25 hearts with typical (<b>fibrofatty)</b> ARVC, 7 hearts with fat replacement of the right ventricle without fibrosis (FaRV), and 18 control hearts from patients who died of noncardiac causes. Patients with <b>fibrofatty</b> ARVC were younger than those with FaRV (31 ± 14 versus 44 ± 13 years, P=. 02), {{more likely to have}} a history of arrhythmias or a family history of premature sudden death (56 % versus 0 %, P=. 01), more likely male (80 % versus 29 %, ^=. 02), and less likely to have coexisting conditions that might have predisposed to sudden death (12 % versus 86 %, P<. 001). <b>Fibrofatty</b> ARVC was characterized by right ventricular myocardial thinning, fat infiltration of the anterobasal and posterolateral apical right ventricle, subepicardial left ventricular <b>fibrofatty</b> replacements (64 %), myocyte atrophy (96 %), and lymphocytic myocarditis (80 %).

40|$|Arrhythmogenic {{cardiomyopathy}} (AC) is {{a disease}} of the heart involving myocardial dystrophy leading to <b>fibrofatty</b> scarring of the myocardium and is {{associated with an increased}} risk of both ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.

Although there has been significant progress in understanding the role of underlying desmosomal genetic defects in AC, there is still a lack of data regarding the cellular processes involved in its progression. The development of cardiac <b>fibrofatty</b> scarring is known to be a principal pathological process associated with ventricular arrhythmias, and it is vital that we elucidate the role of various cell populations involved in the disease if targeted therapeutics are to be developed. The known role of mesenchymal progenitor cells in the reparative process of both the heart and skeletal muscle has provided inspiration for the identification of the cellular basis of <b>fibrofatty</b> infiltration in AC.

BackgroundEffects of statin treatments on coronary plaques have not been sufficiently evaluated. MethodsOne hundred patients without significant lesion stenosis underwent baseline and 12 -month follow-up virtual histology (VH) intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies and were treated with statin for 1 year. They were randomized to simvastatin (20 mg/day, n = 50) or rosuvastatin (10 mg/day, n = 50). With VH-IVUS, plaque was characterized as fibrotic, <b>fibrofatty,</b> dense calcium, and necrotic core. ResultsIn overall patients, necrotic core volume significantly reduced (15. 7 to 13. 7 mm 3, p = 0. 010) and <b>fibrofatty</b> plaque volume increased (4. 3 to 5. 5 mm 3, p = 0. 006) after statin treatments for 1 year. There {{were no significant differences}} of changes in either plaque component volume between simvastatin- and rosuvastatin-treated subgroups. In serial comparisons during 1 -year follow-up, simvastatin treatment did not achieve statistically significant changes in <b>fibrofatty</b> plaque (4. 1 to 5. 1 mm 3, p = 0. 131) and necrotic core volume (15. 8 to 14. 4 mm 3, p = 0. 216).

40|$|Objective—Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-) {{has been}} implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of human atherosclerosis but its actions during lesion progression are poorly understood. Smad 2, Smad 3, and Smad 4 proteins are signaling molecules by which TGF- modulates gene transcription. Our objective was to define the actions of TGF- during lesion progression in humans by examining the expression of Smads in relation to TGF-–mediated responses. Methods and Results—Immunohistochemistry and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction demonstrated Smad 2, Smad 3, and Smad 4 expression in macrophages of <b>fibrofatty</b> lesions and their upregulation after differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. The major Smad splice variants expressed by the macrophages were those that are transcriptionally most active. Macrophages also expressed cyclin inhibitors whose expression is induced via Smad proteins. The cytoplasmic location of p 21 Waf 1 suggests it may protect macrophages from apoptosis. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within the <b>fibrofatty</b> lesions did not express the Smad proteins or the cyclin inhibitors. SMCs of fibrous plaques expressed all 3 Smad proteins. Conclusions—In human atherosclerotic lesions, the actions of TGF- appear restricted to SMCs in fibrous plaques and macrophages in fatty streaks/fibrofatty lesions. The lack of key TGF- signaling components in SMCs of <b>fibrofatty</b> lesions indicates impaired ability of these cells to initiate TGF-–mediated Smad-dependent transcriptional responses.

40|$|Arrhythmogenic {{cardiomyopathy}} (AC) has {{originally been}} described as a disorder characterized by <b>fibrofatty</b> replacement of the myocardium, primarily of the right ventricle (RV), and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, sudden death, and at a late stage progressive heart failure. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia or cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) was the previous name of the disease. However, similar histopathologic changes are also found in the left ventricle (LV). AC is also considered a hereditary disease. Recent molecular genetic studies provide accumulating evidence that <b>fibrofatty</b> replacement is preceded by mutation-related desmosomal changes. Desmosomal dysfunction may lead to mechanical en thereafter electrical uncoupling, ultimately resulting in conduction delay. This activation delay and conduction block, provide a substrate for re-entrant mechanisms and thereby ventricular tachycardia (VT). The gold standard for AC diagnosis is demonstration of transmural <b>fibrofatty</b> replacement in cardiac tissue obtained by autopsy or surgery. To facilitate diagnosis in clinical practice, an international Task Force defined in 1994 a set of criteria (TFC) based on electrocardiographic, functional and morphologic features, and family history. These criteria have recently been revised. Routine 12 -lead electrocardiography {{is one of the most}} important tools for AC diagnosis in all stages of the disease. Even in the absence of other markers in the early concealed stage of the disease, in line with early slow conduction and electrical uncoupling ECG analysis may contribute to early diagnosis.

40|$|Arrhythmogenic right {{ventricular}} cardiomyopathy is {{a primary}} heart muscle disease characterized by progressive myocardial atrophy of the right ventricle, with transmural fatty or <b>fibrofatty</b> replacement, either segmental or diffuse, accounting for electrical instability at risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. It was recently included among cardiomyopathies in the revised WHO classification. The disease {{was found to be}} a major cause of sudden death in the young and in athletes of the Veneto Region, Italy. A familial occurrence with autosomic dominant inheritance was then discovered with a prevalence estimated to be 6 / 10, 000 inhabitants and 5 loci have been identified by linkage analysis so far, 2 mapping to chromosome 14 and to chromosome 1, 2 and 3 one each. A recessive form associated with palmoplantar keratosis has also been reported, mapping to chromosome 17. Nonetheless, the specific gene defects as well as the defective coded proteins have not yet been identified. At gross examination, {{the right side of the}} heart appears yellowish or whitish as to suggest a fatty or <b>fibrofatty</b> infiltration of the underlying myocardium; the myocardial loss frequently accounts for a parchment like, translucent look of the right ventricular free wall. Aneurysms of the right ventricular free wall, whether single or multiple, were reported in about 50 % of cases in a recent pathologic investigation, and are considered a pathognomonic feature of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy; they are typically located in the inferior, diaphragmatic wall, underneath the posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve, as well as in the infundibulum and at the apex. Right ventricular enlargement, whether mild, moderate or severe, is a constant feature. Involvement of the left ventricle has been reported in almost 50 % of cases. At histology, the pathologic process generally starts from the subepicardium and extends to the endocardium in a wave-front phenomenon. The residual, spared myocytes are located within the subendocardial trabeculae and few myocardial fascicles are scattered throughout the <b>fibrofatty</b> tissue. All stages of myocardial injury and repair are recognizable: acute cell death with sarcolysis and inflammatory infiltrates; subacute damage with "active fibrosis", including dying myocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages, or otherwise adipocytes replacing vanished myocytes; and, eventually, chronic stage with fibrous tissue and adipocytes surrounding residual surviving myocytes. Both the etiology and pathogenesis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy are still unknown. In particular, the mechanisms leading to progressive loss of myocardium and <b>fibrofatty</b> replacement are speculative. According to the frequent finding of inflammatory infiltrates at histology, an inflammatory theory has been advanced and infective, toxic or immune mechanisms have been investigated. Recently, apoptosis has been documented both in autoptic and bioptic material, suggesting that recurrent bouts of apoptosis may account for progressive atrophy of the myocardium which is then replaced by <b>fibrofatty</b> tissue.
