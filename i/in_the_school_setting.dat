25|$|Assistive {{technology}} {{in this area}} is broken down into low, mid, and high tech categories. Low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging. Examples include adapted paper and pencil grips for writing or masks and color overlays for reading. Mid tech supports used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>setting</b> include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to keyboard writing. High tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software. Software supports for writing include the use of auditory feedback while keyboarding, word prediction for spelling, and speech to text. Supports for reading include the use of text to speech (TTS) software and font modification via access to digital text. Limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using MathML and Daisy.|$|E

RPGamer's Michael A Cunningham enjoyed the characters despite being shallow, with him saying Machina and Rem had the best development out of the main cast. Destructoid's Chris Carter said that, as with other Final Fantasy games, players would find favorites among the characters, and was entertained by the conflict between classes and classmates, which worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>setting.</b> Most of the reviewers made mixed to negative comments {{on the quality of the}} localization; Sullivan drew attention to Nine's incongruous addition of [...] "yo" [...] and [...] "hey" [...] to his sentences, Cunngingham found the experience better when she switched to the Japanese voice track, while Cunningham appreciated the effort put into the translation while finding the final product inconsistent with the new platforms. The exception was Cartar, who said that the English cast [...] "do a great job".|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, the New York Committee for Stress-Free Schools held a {{press conference}} in New York City. The conference {{included}} testimony from students, educators and scientists who support the use of TM <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>setting.</b> The following year the TM technique was taught to [...] "more than 100 administrators, teachers and students" [...] and over the next five years, 300 additional high school students learned the technique. According to the DLF web site, the TM program was introduced to the Arts and Technology Academy at Weaver High School in Hartford CT in 2006. Four hundred and fifty students as well as principals and administrators are reported to have been instructed in the technique. A voluntary program at the Kingsbury School, a Washington D.C. private school [...] "for students with learning disorders" [...] in grades K-12, was featured on the PBS program, To The Contrary in 2007. According to the school director, about 10 percent of the teachers, parents and students declined to participate because they found it be religious and cult-ish. Conferences sponsored by the New England Committee for Stress-Free Schools were held in Providence, Rhode Island; Fairfield, Connecticut; and Boston, Massachusetts in 2005. The Boston conference was attended by 100 teachers and featured testimony from school principals who have experience with the TM program in schools. In the mid-2000s the TM technique was incorporated into the educational program at the Daburiya High School in Israel.|$|E

The project began in a single Rochester, New York elementary school in 1957 and was eventually implemented in over 500 school districts around the world.

50|$|Schools {{became a}} common place of {{recruitment}} for the movement. In direct actions, dubbed Jailbreaks, Weather members invaded educational institutions as {{a means by which}} to recruit high school and college students. The motivation of these jailbreaks was the organization's belief that school was where the youth were oppressed by the system and where they learned to tolerate society’s faults instead of rise against them. According to “Prairie Fire”, young people are channeled, coerced, misled, miseducated, misused <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>setting.</b> It is in schools that the youth of the nation become alienated from the authentic processes of learning about the world.|$|E
50|$|Another study {{emphasized}} the importance of home-based parental involvement. Altschul (2011) conducted a study that tested the effects of six different types of parental involvement and their effect on Mexican American students. The study used previous data from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) of 1988. The data was used to evaluate the influence of parental practices in the 8th grade and their effect on students once they were in the 10th grade. Altschul (2011) noted that home-based parental involvement had a more positive effect on the academic achievement of Mexican American students, than involvement in school organizations. The literature suggests that parental involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>setting</b> is not necessary, parents can impact the academic achievement of their children from their home.|$|E
50|$|Many {{psychological}} {{studies show that}} switching between tasks, use of technology, and overstimulation has increased levels of distraction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>setting.</b> At school, distraction is often viewed {{as a source of}} poor performance and misbehavior. Distraction makes focusing on singular, assigned tasks more difficult. Digital components of learning are an emerging component to classroom distraction. Parents, teachers, students, and scholars all have opinions about how technology either benefits or harms a students’ focus in an academic setting. Research studies show that neuron circuits indicate a decrease in ability to be attentive to goal relative stimulus with the addition of distracting stimuli interference. School-aged students, with developing brains, are more apt to conflicting stimuli while trying to focus. Large classroom sizes, technology use in and outside the classroom, and less natural stimuli have been seen as contributing factors to deflating test scores and classroom participation.|$|E
