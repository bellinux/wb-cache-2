The {{company is also}} claimed to have [...] "routinely used defective parts designated as [...] "scrap only" [...] and concealed internal records of potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>defects</b> in its engine making process. The incendiary allegations are made in a lawsuit filed in the district court for the Southern District of Indiana by two former quality-control officers at Rolls-Royce Corp, part of the UK aerospace group's American operations. It is the legal filing in a long-running dispute brought by Thomas McArtor, a senior quality-control officer from 2003 to 2006 at Rolls' Indianapolis plant, its main US facility. His original complaint in 2008 was joined in 2011 by a second former employee, Keith Ramsey, a quality-control officer who oversaw key parts of the manufacturing and assembly process. Mr. Ramsay alleges he was dismissed for [...] "refusing to cooperate" [...] in the company's [...] "knowing deviations from its quality-control plan". The pair claim that Rolls routinely concealed thousands of defects in engines it sold to clients including the US Department of Defense, collating them in a [...] "secret set of books". The duo are now challenging a court order that prevents them releasing information they claim reveals what Rolls allegedly concealed. The lawsuit comes at a difficult time for Rolls, which was recently taken to task by Australian safety regulators for failing to spot a problem which led to one of its engines on board a Qantas A380 exploding shortly after taking off from Singapore in November 2010. The report criticised the culture at Rolls’ Hucknall plant in the UK, saying it was “considered acceptable to not declare what manufacturing personnel determined to be ‘minor’ non-conformances in manufactured components”.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{ultrasonic}} testing of welds, detection of small flaws {{is often difficult}} by the introduced distortion due to the material grain structure. The scattering of ultrasonic waves from grain boundaries can interfere and introduce disturbance in the received signal that can sometimes mask indications due to a small but potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>defect.</b> However, to enhance the flaw characterization, methods based on “thresholding ” have given good results only when the {{signal to noise ratio}} is high. Since, both the structure noise and flaw signal concentrate energy in the same frequency band, linear filtering does not provide good results while non linear filtering can improve the signal resolution. One way out is to use the time frequency transforms, the method is based on the wavelet packet decomposition. The Debauchee of order 8 function has been chosen as the analyzing function, and each measured ultrasonic signal is analyzed by a filter bank through only 3 levels of decomposition. This work demonstrates that the following analysis is very efficient with respect to signal recovery from noisy data. The experiments have shown that the proposed method has excellent performances on SNR enhancements. 1...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{examination}} of eleven main buildings of power plants, analysis of defects and damages of building structures was performed. Thereafter, the damageability of principal bearing structures of main buildings of thermal plants was analyzed. It was identified that {{the fastest growing}} defects and damages were concentrated in the structures of operating sites. The research of the rate of development of the most frequent damages and defects {{made it possible to}} conclude that internal corrosion of the reinforcing steel was the most <b>dangerous</b> <b>defect,</b> as far as the reinforced concrete elements of operating sites were concerned. Methods of mathematical statistics were applied to identify the reinforcing steel development pattern inside reinforced concrete elements of floors of operating sites. It was identified that the probability of corrosion of reinforced concrete elements of operating sites was distributed in accordance with the demonstrative law. Based on these data, calculation of strength of reinforced concrete slabs and metal beams was performed in terms of their regular sections, given the natural loads and the realistic condition of structures. As a result, dependence between the bearing capacity reserve ratio and the corrosion development pattern was identified for reinforced concrete slabs and metal beams of operating sites. In order to analyze the sufficiency of the bearing capacity of building structures of operating sites in relation to their time in commission, equations were derived to identify the nature of dependence between the sufficiency of the bearing capacity of reinforced concrete slabs and metal beams of the operating sites and their time in commission...|$|R

In contrast to previous experiments in determining surface cracks by MW method, the author has produced new experimental data in identifying invisible metal defects, i. e. active defects. Although the described method {{is based on the}} well-known Acoustic Emission (AE) method, there are significant differences. Firstly, according to calculations and experiment results the propagation speed of active defects generated by this new method is close to the speed of light. Secondly, in contrast to single AE events, occurring under conditions of excessive mechanical force, displayed signals in this new method can be detected during a time-interval excluding an additional mechanical load.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{particle}} production via preheating {{at the end}} of inflation in supersymmetric theories. The inflaton and matter scalars are now necessarily complex fields, and their relevant interactions are restricted by holomorphy. In general this leads to major changes both in the inflaton dynamics and in the efficiency of the preheating process. In addition, supersymmetric models generically contain multiple isolated vacua, raising the possibility of non-thermal production of <b>dangerous</b> topological <b>defects.</b> Because of these effects, the success of leptogenesis or WIMPZILLA production via preheating depends much more sensitively on the detailed parameters in the inflaton sector than previously thought. 1 Introduction. The inflationary paradigm [1] has been remarkably successful in explaining the observed large-scale features of the universe.

The aim was to find out how ultrasonic devices can sense this type of defect in a butt weld. In addition radiography was used to detect the occurrence of lack of fusion in the welded joint. In the ultrasonic examination 60 ° and 70 ° angle probes were applied. They showed lack of fusion at the opposite side-walls of the groove. A normal probe was then used to detect the occurrence of inter-run lack of fusion. The weld defects provided a multiple reflection of ultrasonic waves, which confirmed the presence of lack of fusion in a certain depth. This was additionally confirmed by an ultrasonic thickness measuring gage. Finally, micro sections of the weld were made to establish the actual location and shape of lack-of-fusion defects. 1...|$|R

Electrochemical polarization tests and free corrosion tests were performed in 0. 1  M HCl aqueous solution. The corrodkote test (ASTM B 380 - 97 R 02) was also performed, to evaluate the coatings qualitatively. The heat treatment improves the corrosion resistance of the Co- 28 Mo- 17 Cr- 3 Si coating and of the Ni- 20 Cr- 10 W- 9 Mo- 4 Cu- 1 C- 1 B- 1 Fe coating by enhancing their passivation ability. The precipitation of sub-micron sized secondary phases after the treatment may produce galvanic microcells at intralamellar scale, but the beneficial contribution provided by the healing of the very small but <b>dangerous</b> interlamellar <b>defects</b> (normally present in thermal spray coatings but not detectable using ordinary scanning electron microscopy) prevails.

Air coupled ultrasonic inspection of aluminium/ composites laminates In modern aircrafts fibber metal laminates are widely used such as the GLARE composite material which consists of multiple aluminium layers glued together using glass fibre composite. The most <b>dangerous</b> <b>defects</b> in such materials are delaminations between adjacent layers. For detection of such defects the most attractive is the air-coupled ultrasonic technique which does not require acoustic coupling between material and ultrasonic transducers. This technique may be implemented using two-side or single- side access and exploiting bulk or Lamb ultrasonic waves (Fig. 1) [1 - 3]. From a practical point of a view a more attractive is single-side access air-coupled ultrasonic technique. The experiments were carried out on the GLARE- 3 / 2 sample with artificial defects. In the experiments air-coupled 1...|$|E
