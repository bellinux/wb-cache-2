25|$|Nevertheless, in 1903 {{at the age}} of 24, {{her plans}} to study to become a teacher in Tokyo came to nothing. In a letter to Mrs. Abendanon, R.A. Kartini wrote that the plan had been {{abandoned}} because {{she was going to be}} married..."In short, I no longer desire to take advantage of this opportunity, because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married..". This was despite the fact that for its part, the Dutch Education Department had finally given permission for R.A. Kartini and R.Ay. Rukmini to study in Batavia.|$|E
25|$|After God created Adam, who was alone, He said, 'It is {{not good}} for man to be alone.' He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith {{immediately}} began to fight. She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the superior one.' Lilith responded, 'We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.' But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.|$|E

[...] He was also skeptical about Cooney's qualifications as CTW's first director, but Cooney later stated, [...] "...I couldn't begin to measure how proud <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Gerry Lesser's colleague and how happy I am to know the pleasure of his company".|$|E

[...] A court of inquiry later placed the blame for the Crater fiasco on Burnside and his subordinates. In December, Burnside met with President Lincoln and General Grant about his future. He was contemplating resignation, but Lincoln and Grant requested that he remain in the Army. [...] At the end of the interview, Burnside wrote, [...] "I was not informed of any duty upon which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> placed."

McHale has stated that performing as Artie has made him {{more aware of the}} challenges that people with disabilities face: [...] "It's a completely different side of life.

500|$|Röhm {{was held}} briefly at Stadelheim Prison in Munich, while Hitler {{considered}} his future. In the end, Hitler decided that Röhm had to die. On July 1, at Hitler's behest, Theodor Eicke, Commandant of the Dachau concentration camp, and his SS adjutant Michel Lippert visited Röhm. Once inside Röhm's cell, they {{handed him a}} Browning pistol loaded with a single bullet {{and told him he}} had ten minutes to kill himself or they would do it for him. Röhm demurred, telling them, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed, let Adolf do it himself." [...] Having heard nothing in the allotted time, they returned to Röhm's cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance. Eicke and Lippert then shot Röhm, killing him. In 1957, the German authorities tried Lippert in Munich for Röhm's murder. Until then, Lippert {{had been one of the}} few executioners of the purge to evade trial. Lippert was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Lesser {{was asked}} to help develop and lead the {{research}} department of the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later the Sesame Workshop), the organization responsible {{for the production of}} Sesame Street and other educational television programs. [...] He was invited by Carnegie Foundation vice-president and Sesame Street co-creator Lloyd Morrisett, whom he had met while they were both psychology students at Yale. [...] At first, Lesser was skeptical about the new show's potential and its ability to teach children; according to Morrisett, [...] "he took some convincing". [...] As Lesser later reported, he would be involved only if he was able to make a real contribution. [...] When he saw that Morrisett and his co-creator, Joan Ganz Cooney, were serious about developing goals and a curriculum for the new show, {{and that it would be}} an [...] "experimental venture in education by television", he became the first chairman of the CTW's advisory board, a position he held from 1967 to 1997. [...] Lesser was skeptical about Cooney's qualifications as CTW's first CEO, although by the time he wrote Children and Television in 1974, she stated in the book's foreword, [...] "...I couldn't begin to measure how proud <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Gerry Lesser's colleague and how happy I am to know the pleasure of his company".|$|E

2500|$|As a Congressman, Meyer London {{was one of}} 50 {{representatives and}} six {{senators}} to vote against entry into World War I. Once America was at war, however, London felt obliged to support the nation's efforts in the conflict. He strongly opposed the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, which made criticism of {{the president or the}} war a crime, and in the end cast the only vote in the House against the Sedition Act of 1918. [...] These actions angered his constituency but London said: [...] "I wonder whether <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> punished for having had the courage to vote against the war or for standing by my country’s decision when it chose war." ...|$|E

[...] Marcus Porcius Cato was put forward by the optimates for the praetorship. [...] To counter him, Pompeius and Crassus secured the {{election}} for Vatinius and thus successfully defeated Cato. [...] After his year in office, Vatinius was accused of bribery by Licinius Calvus. [...] Calvus had previously accused Vatinius, but this was his most eloquent speech. [...] Vatinius even interrupted him to exclaim, [...] " [...] I ask you, judges, if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> condemned because the accuser is eloquent." [...] Cicero, despite his previous attacks against Vatinius, defended him. He did this because he was afraid of offending the triumvirs and wanted their protection from Publius Clodius. [...] His acquittal though was more likely due to bribery by his patrons instead of Cicero's speech.|$|E

[...] However, Evans noted that Blott was left with a decision as to whether to return to the Reds in 1925, realizing he would likely be “sitting on the bench as a substitute possessing just enough ability to fill in when one of the regulars was out of the lineup.” [...] Evans opined that it was a “waste of time” for a collegian to play such a role. [...] Evans later revealed that Blott had confided in him that he liked football best and would prefer to coach a grid team than play baseball.|$|E
