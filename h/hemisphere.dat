50|$|The {{cerebrum}} of cerebral <b>hemispheres</b> make up {{the largest}} visual portion of the human brain. Various structures combine forming the cerebral <b>hemispheres,</b> among others, the cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala and hippocampus. The <b>hemispheres</b> together control {{a large portion of}} the functions of the human brain such as emotion, memory, perception and motor functions. Apart from this the cerebral <b>hemispheres</b> stand for the cognitive capabilities of the brain.|$|R
50|$|The {{vertebrate}} cerebrum (brain) {{is formed}} by two cerebral <b>hemispheres</b> that {{are separated by}} a groove, the longitudinal fissure. The brain can thus be described as being divided into left and right cerebral <b>hemispheres.</b> Each of these <b>hemispheres</b> has an outer layer of grey matter, the cerebral cortex, that is supported by an inner layer of white matter. In eutherian (placental) mammals, the <b>hemispheres</b> are linked by the corpus callosum, a very large bundle of nerve fibers. Smaller commissures, including the anterior commissure, the posterior commissure and the fornix, also join the <b>hemispheres</b> and these are also present in other vertebrates. These commissures transfer information between the two <b>hemispheres</b> to coordinate localized functions.|$|R
40|$|By {{introducing}} an asymmetry {{between the}} two <b>hemispheres,</b> we study whether the solar dynamo solutions in the two <b>hemispheres</b> remain coupled with each other. Our calculations {{are based on the}} solar dynamo code SURYA, which incorporates the helioseismically-determined solar-rotation profile, a Babcock–Leighton α effect concentrated near the surface, and a meridional circulation. When the magnetic coupling between the <b>hemispheres</b> is enhanced by either increasing the diffusion or introducing an α effect distributed throughout the convection zone, we find that the solutions in the two <b>hemispheres</b> evolve together with a single period even when we make the meridional circulation or the α effect different in the two <b>hemispheres.</b> On the other hand, when the hemispheric coupling is weaker for other values of parameters, an asymmetry between the <b>hemispheres</b> can make solutions in the two <b>hemispheres</b> evolve independently with different periods...|$|R
5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants point to the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which <b>hemisphere</b> the station is standing. The barbs in the figure at the right are located at the Northern <b>Hemisphere,</b> because the wind is circling counter clock-wise around a low-pressure area at the Northern <b>Hemisphere</b> (the wind is blowing in the opposite direction at the Southern <b>Hemisphere,</b> see also Buys Ballot's law).|$|E
5|$|The {{latitude}} and longitude are expressed in , in which a positive latitude value refers to the northern <b>hemisphere,</b> and a negative value refers to the southern <b>hemisphere.</b> Similarly, a positive longitude value refers to the eastern <b>hemisphere,</b> and a negative value refers to the western <b>hemisphere.</b> The coordinates used {{in this article are}} sourced from Google Earth, which makes use of the WGS84 geodetic reference system. Additionally, a negative altitude value refers to land below sea level.|$|E
5|$|This {{is because}} land birds in high {{northern}} latitudes, where food becomes scarce in winter, leave for areas further south (including the Southern <b>Hemisphere)</b> to overwinter, {{and because the}} continental landmass is much larger in the Northern <b>Hemisphere.</b> In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of the Southern <b>Hemisphere</b> {{are more likely to}} migrate. This is because there is a large area of ocean in the Southern <b>Hemisphere,</b> and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that abnormal vibrissae input to the motor cortex (M 1) mediates short-term cortical reorganization after facial nerve lesion. To test this hypothesis, we cut first the infraorbital nerve (ION cut) and then the facial nerve (VII cut) in order to evaluate M 1 reorganization without any aberrant, facial-nerve-lesion-induced sensory feedback. In each animal, M 1 output was assessed in both <b>hemispheres</b> by mapping movements induced by intracortical microstimulation. M 1 output was compared in different types of peripheral manipulations: (i) contralateral intact vibrissal pad (intact <b>hemispheres),</b> (ii) contralateral VII cut (VII <b>hemispheres),</b> (iii) contralateral ION cut (ION <b>hemispheres),</b> (iv) contralateral VII cut after contralateral ION cut (ION + VII <b>hemispheres),</b> (v) contralateral pad botulinum-toxin-injected after ION cut (ION + BTX <b>hemispheres).</b> Right and left <b>hemispheres</b> in untouched animals were the reference for normal M 1 map (control <b>hemispheres).</b> Findings demonstrated that: (1) in ION <b>hemispheres,</b> the mean size of the vibrissae representation was {{not significantly different from}} those in intact and control hemispheres; (2) reorganization of the vibrissae movement representation clearly emerged only in <b>hemispheres</b> where the contralateral vibrissae pad had undergone motor output disconnection (VII cut hemispheres); (3) the persistent loss of vibrissae input did not change the M 1 reorganization pattern during the first 48 h after motor paralysis (ION + VII cut and ION + BTX <b>hemispheres).</b> Thus, after motor paralysis, vibrissa input does not provide the gating signal necessary to trigger M 1 reorganization...|$|R

40|$|Hemispheric {{shape is}} studied using {{magnetic}} resonance imaging and 3 -D reconstructions in right-handed, male and female, European and Japanese subjects. Japanese <b>hemispheres</b> are relatively shorter, but wider than European <b>hemispheres.</b> Regions of maximal intersubject variability in hemispheric shape {{are present in the}} occipital and temporal lobes in each sample. Deviations from this general pattern are found in the (i) right inferior parietal lobule (European <b>hemispheres</b> are more variable than Japanese), (ii) lower third of the pre- and postcentral gyri (female Japanese <b>hemispheres</b> are less variable than the other samples), (iii) right inferior frontal gyrus (male European <b>hemispheres</b> are more variable than the other samples), and (iv) polar part of the frontal lobe (female European <b>hemispheres</b> are less variable than the other samples). The distribution of intersubject variability between the <b>hemispheres</b> is less asymmetric in female than male brains. Male Japanese <b>hemispheres</b> are shorter but wider than female Japanese <b>hemispheres,</b> whereas European <b>hemispheres</b> show the inverse gender relations. These results demonstrate that hemispheric shape shows a considerable intersubject variability, which is not randomly distributed over the cortical surface but displays distinct regions of higher variability. Despite this intersubject variability significant interethnic- and gender-related differences in hemispheric shape are present, which may be relevant if individual brains have to be warped to a single or mean reference brain or realistic brain models are to be constructed...|$|R
5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} {{moved into the}} southern celestial <b>hemisphere.</b> The comet was much less impressive to southern <b>hemisphere</b> observers {{than it had been}} in the northern <b>hemisphere,</b> but southerners were able to see the comet gradually fade from view during the second half of 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the comet had remained visible without aid for 569days, or about 18 and a half months. The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811, which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} Galilean {{satellites}} and the Moon, Io rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face nearly pointed toward Jupiter. This synchronicity provides the definition for Io's longitude system. Io's prime meridian intersects the equator at the sub-Jovian point. The side of Io that always faces Jupiter {{is known as}} the subjovian <b>hemisphere,</b> whereas the side that always faces away {{is known as the}} antijovian <b>hemisphere.</b> The side of Io that always faces in the direction that Io travels in its orbit is known as the leading <b>hemisphere,</b> whereas the side that always faces in the opposite direction is known as the trailing <b>hemisphere.</b>|$|E

5|$|Noctilucent clouds {{may be seen}} by {{observers}} at a latitude of 50° to 65°. They seldom {{occur at}} lower latitudes (although there have been sightings {{as far south as}} Paris, Utah, Italy, Turkey and Spain), and closer to the poles it does not get dark enough for the clouds to become visible. They occur during summer, from mid-May to mid-August in the northern <b>hemisphere</b> and between mid-November and mid-February in the southern <b>hemisphere.</b> They are very faint and tenuous, and may be observed only in twilight around sunrise and sunset when the clouds of the lower atmosphere are in shadow, but the noctilucent cloud is illuminated by the Sun. They are best seen when the Sun is between 6° and 16° below the horizon. Although noctilucent clouds occur in both hemispheres, they have been observed thousands of times in the northern <b>hemisphere,</b> but fewer than 100 times in the southern. Southern <b>hemisphere</b> noctilucent clouds are fainter and occur less frequently; additionally the southern <b>hemisphere</b> has a lower population and less land area from which to make observations.|$|E

5|$|Planets {{also have}} {{varying degrees of}} axial tilt; they lie {{at an angle to}} the plane of their stars' equators. This causes the amount of light {{received}} by each <b>hemisphere</b> to vary over the course of its year; when the northern <b>hemisphere</b> points away from its star, the southern <b>hemisphere</b> points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore has seasons, changes to the climate over the course of its year. The time at which each <b>hemisphere</b> points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its solstice. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one <b>hemisphere</b> has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. The varying amount of light and heat received by each <b>hemisphere</b> creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices. Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt {{as a result of their}} proximity to their stars.|$|E

40|$|Previously, {{measurements}} {{were made of}} the transmission of 14 MeV neutrons through various spherical shell thicknesses of iron in a comprehensive investigation at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) about 30 years ago. Two of these spheres, composed of hemispherical sections, have appropriate dimensions for the lower energy neutron measurements that we propose to make. Due to their interest in our experimental results, LLNL has agreed to make these <b>hemispheres</b> available for our work. Those <b>hemispheres</b> have been shipped. In addition, a spherical iron shell, composed of two hemispherical sections with an annular thickness of approximately 1 inch, was fabricated at NEST. However, since we will need additional <b>hemispheres</b> for our experiments, we purchased a radius cutter {{that will allow us}} to fabricate <b>hemispheres</b> as large as 5 inches in radius at the Ohio University Machine Shop. This will give us maximum flexibility to adapt to the needs of the spherical shell transmission experiments. High purity (99. 94 % iron) Armco iron has been obtained which can be used to make the smaller <b>hemispheres.</b> Larger <b>hemispheres</b> will be made using ASTM designation steel with high iron content.
