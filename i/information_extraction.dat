Nodes that are depicted as lying along vertical lines {{are associated with}} the cell/environment interfaces, while the others are free-floating and can diffuse. Edges between nodes represent interactions between the nodes, that can correspond to individual molecular reactions between DNA, mRNA, miRNA, proteins or molecular processes through which the products of one gene affect those of another, though the lack of experimentally obtained information often implies that some reactions are not modeled at such a fine level of detail. These interactions can be inductive (usually represented by arrowheads or the + sign), with an increase in the concentration of one leading to an increase in the other, inhibitory (represented with filled circles, blunt arrows or the minus sign), with an increase in one leading to a decrease in the other, or dual, when depending of the circumstances the regulator can activate or inhibit the target node. The nodes can regulate themselves directly or indirectly, creating feedback loops, which form cyclic chains of dependencies in the topological network. The network structure is an abstraction of the system's molecular or chemical dynamics, describing the manifold ways in which one substance affects all the others to which it is connected. In practice, such GRNs are inferred from the biological literature on a given system and represent a distillation of the collective knowledge about a set of related biochemical reactions. To speed up the manual curation of GRNs, some recent efforts try to use text mining, curated databases, network inference from massive data, model checking and other <b>information</b> <b>extraction</b> technologies for this purpose.|$|E

In addition, two new concepts of information rate (IR) and accumulated information rate (AIR) are proposed, which are used to illustrate the degree of <b>information</b> feature <b>extraction</b> of PCA. In the end, through simulated application in practice, the results show that the method proposed in this paper is efficient and satisfactory.

In addi-tion, conditions for environmental management keep changing with time, demanding periodically updated decision support. These properties can be realized by learning from data, using knowledge discovery techniques. In the pre-sent paper, data mining techniques are applied for data analysis and for the construction of forecasting modules to-wards decision making, on the basis of selected air quality information for Athens, Greece.
