5|$|After the {{independence}} of Pakistan and the partition of Bengal in 1947, {{there have been more}} attempts to compile and publish an <b>encyclopedia.</b> The first was a project to produce a Bengali adaptation of Columbia Viking Desk <b>Encyclopedia</b> by Franklin Book Programs Inc., undertaken in 1959 and aborted ten years later. The unfinished papers were compiled into four unequal volumes as Bangla Visvacos (1972) with Khan Bahadur Abdul Hakim as the chief editor. After {{the independence}} of Bangladesh in 1971, three specialized encyclopedias were published - the multi-volume Islami Bishwakosh (<b>Encyclopedia</b> of Islam, 1986) by Islamic Foundation Bangladesh, 5-volume Shishu-Biswakosh (<b>Encyclopedia</b> for Children, 1995) by Bangladesh Shishu Academy, and 4-volume Vijnan Biswakosh (<b>Encyclopedia</b> of Science, 1998) by Bangla Academy.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} by School Library Journal, Smith's <b>encyclopedia</b> was praised for its {{reference}} value.

Booklist commented in its review that the <b>encyclopedia</b> was a good resource to have in libraries at the academic, public, and high school levels. Publishers Weekly reviewed the <b>encyclopedia</b> and criticized Smith's objectivity, suggesting that he took an unabashedly positive view of the agency's role and focused exclusively on its operational successes. Despite the issue with bias, the review concluded that the book was still a useful reference work.|$|E

50|$|The German-language Conversations-Lexikon was {{published}} at Leipzig from 1796 to 1808, in 6 volumes. Paralleling other 18th century <b>encyclopedias,</b> its scope was expanded {{beyond that of}} earlier publications, in an effort at comprehensiveness. It was, however, intended not for scholarly use but to provide results of research and discovery in a simple and popular form without extensive detail. This format, a contrast to the Encyclopædia Britannica, was widely imitated by later 19th century <b>encyclopedias</b> in Britain, the United States, France, Spain, Italy and other countries. Of the influential late-18th century and early-19th century <b>encyclopedias,</b> the Conversations-Lexikon is perhaps most similar in form to today's <b>encyclopedias.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this article}} we examine {{scientific}} knowledge of animals and disciplines pertaining to them in British, French, and German <b>encyclopedias</b> from around 1700 {{to the time of}} the publication of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species.

At the same time, our goal is to study differences in the representations of animals among <b>encyclopedias,</b> notably between popular and scholarly <b>encyclopedias.</b> By studying the sources of encyclopedias’ entries on animals, we will establish the pathways by which representations of animals were formed, thus connecting knowledge of animals to commercial and literary processes. By studying the intellectual premises of the entries, we will connect knowledge of animals to reading publics, thereby illuminating the status of <b>encyclopedias</b> as intermediaries in the movement of knowledge...|$|R

General <b>encyclopedias</b> could amount to several volumes, sometimes more than ten, while more specific dictionaries usually comprised only one or two volumes. During the eighteenth century, many encyclopedic works were adapted for different audiences, resulting in many books being translated.
