25|$|The normal {{method of}} {{installation}} of a large spinner on a light aircraft involves installing a circular spinner back plate over the engine driveshaft, then the propeller, followed by a spinner front plate. The spinner dome is then mounted over this assembly and secured with screws to the back and <b>front</b> <b>plates.</b> Small plates are usually fitted behind the propeller {{to fill in the}} spinner dome cutouts and are secured to the backplate again with screws. Some spinner designs do not incorporate the front plate, although these are not suitable for higher-powered engines.|$|E
25|$|The Motor Car Act 1903, {{which came}} into force on 1 January 1904, {{required}} all motor vehicles to be entered on an official vehicle register, and to carry alphanumeric plates. The Act {{was passed in}} order that vehicles could be easily traced {{in the event of}} an accident or contravention of the law. Vehicle registration alphanumeric plates in the UK are rectangular or square in shape, with the exact permitted dimensions of the plate and its lettering set down in law. <b>Front</b> <b>plates</b> are white, whereas back plates are yellow.|$|E

2500|$|During production, {{the type}} was {{gradually}} improved, which caused further delays. [...] From the 245th vehicle onwards an automatic starter was installed, engaged by a handle, {{as the original}} manual system did not allow for a sufficiently quick response to a changing battlefield situation. [...] Also it was decided the design was too poorly protected. [...] In response to the first use of British Mark I tanks on 15 September 1916, the Germans had begun to introduce anti-tank weapons and tactics. One of the measures taken by them was the issuing of the Kerngeschoss or [...] "K-bullet", a hardened steel core round capable of piercing the thin armour of tanks. To defeat it, from the 210th vehicle onwards the Schneider tank was fitted with extra 5.4mm thick armour plates on the sides and front with a space of four centimetres between the main armour and these appliqué plates. Even without the spaced armour, the <b>front</b> <b>plates</b> would have been immune against K-bullet fire {{from a distance of}} two hundred metres, because they were angled at 60°, providing an effective line-of-sight thickness of [...] During the spring of 1917 existing vehicles were uparmoured (creating a surblindé version) by the army workshop at Champlieu. Some of these, such as a vehicle with series number 61213, were fitted with additional armour plates on the vertical front surfaces, including an extra rectangular shield around the gun barrel. On 1 April 1917 of the 208 tanks available only about a hundred had been retrofitted. None of the older tanks had at this point yet received the new starter engine, this part of the improvement process would take {{until the end of the}} summer.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{appearance}} of compound armor in the 1880s, armor plating was made from uniform homogeneous iron or steel plates backed by several inches of teak to absorb the shock of projectile impact. Compound armor appeared in the mid-1880s and was made from {{two different types of}} steel, a very hard but brittle high-carbon steel <b>front</b> <b>plate</b> backed by a more elastic low-carbon wrought iron <b>plate.</b> The <b>front</b> <b>plate</b> was intended to break up an incoming shell, while the rear plate would catch any splinters and hold the armor together if the brittle <b>front</b> <b>plate</b> shattered.|$|R

2500|$|In Nevada, all motor vehicles, {{with the}} {{exception}} of motorcycles and trailers, are issued two license plates. According to state law, most standard passenger vehicles issued two plates are required to display them on both the front and rear bumpers of the vehicle. Display of the <b>front</b> license <b>plate,</b> however, is optional for vehicles that either were not designed to have a <b>front</b> <b>plate,</b> or the manufacturer did not provide a plate bracket or other means for front display of a license plate. As a result, the law to display both the <b>front</b> and rear <b>plates</b> is rarely enforced, and {{it is not uncommon for}} owners of vehicles with Nevada license plates to remove the manufacturer-supplied <b>front</b> license <b>plate</b> brackets from their vehicles and display only the rear plate. In 2015, Wyoming passed a law, similar to Nevada, that does not require a <b>front</b> license <b>plate</b> on vehicles that either are not specifically designed to have a <b>front</b> <b>plate,</b> or the manufacturer did not provide a plate bracket or other means for front display of a license plate. Nebraska passed an identical law in 2016. In 2017, Montana also passed a similar law, exempting such passenger vehicles from displaying a <b>front</b> <b>plate</b> but requiring motorists to first obtain approval from the Montana Highway Patrol.|$|R
