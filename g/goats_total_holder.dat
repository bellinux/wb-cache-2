40|$|Herbivores {{can play}} an {{important}} role as seed dispersal vectors, ungulates constituting potential seed dispersal agents of Mediterranean grasses and shrubs. We evaluated the role of domestic goats as seed dispersers of five representative Mediterranean forage shrub species (Cistus albidus L., Phillyrea angustifolia L., Calicotome villosa (Poir.) Link., Rhamnus lycioides L. and Atriplex halimus L.). Following seed ingestion by <b>goats,</b> <b>total</b> faeces were collected at 24 -h intervals for five days. The total number of seeds recovered varied among species, with R. lycioides showing the minimum recovery percentage (1. 3 %) and C. albidus (35. 8 %), the maximum. Seed recovery was significantly related to seed hardness and length. In most species, the maximum amount of seeds recovered occurred 48 - 72 h after ingestion. The passage through the goat gut significantly depressed seed germination in C. albidus, C. villosa and A. halimus; inhibited it in R. lycioides and increased it in P. angustifolia. Seedling emergence was significantly lower in intact dung pellets than in broken-down ones, and both significantly lower than in uneaten seeds (control). The results of this study show that goats can potentially favor or inhibit seed dispersal of browsed Mediterranean shrub species. Therefore, goat grazing could be a potential management tool for expanding target shrub species populations or preventing shrub encroachment in undesired areas...|$|R

Residual activity in mutant liver was 52 % of control but no activity was detectable in mutant kidney or brain tissue. Normal adult goat liver contained two forms of beta-D-mannosidase, a nonlysosomal form (52 %) with a broad pH range for optimum activity (4. 5 - 8. 0) and a lysosomal form (48 %) with a pH optimum of 5. 5. Residual enzyme in mutant liver consisted entirely of the nonlysosomal form. Normal adult thyroid, kidney and brain contained two major lysosomal isoenzymes with pIs 5. 5 and 5. 9 and traces of a minor isoenzyme with pI 5. 0. Normal liver contained three isoenzymes with similar pIs; however, an isoenzyme with pI 5. 0 predominated. In 60 -day fetal liver lysosomal isoenzymes predominated and only trace amounts of nonlysosomal isoenzyme were detectable. Total hepatic beta-D-mannosidase activity increased towards adult levels during the last 90 days of gestation as a result of increasing nonlysosomal isoenzyme activity. Intraperitoneal injection of fetal liver cells into 60 -day goat fetuses resulted in sustained hemopoietic chimerism in surviving kids without evidence of graft-versus-host-disease. These results suggest that transplantation of normal fetal liver cells into preimmunocompetent goat fetuses affected with beta-D-mannosidosis is feasible and may provide an alternative strategy for evaluation of postnatal bone marrow transplantation in the treatment of human lysosomal storage disorders...|$|R

Our objective was to determine whether goats generalized foraging skills from older growth blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) to shrub live oak (Quercus turbinella). Blackbrush (OGBB) has small leaves that are difficult to ingest without the twigs, whereas shrub live oak (SLO) has larger leaves that can be ingested easily without twigs. In Yr 1, 6 -mo-old goats and in Yr 2 18 -mo-old goats were given experience browsing with OGBB for 0, 10, 20, or 30 d. They were next tested for 5 min/d for 2 d on OGBB, and then tested in the same way on SLO. The number of bites and bite rate increased significantly as goats of both ages gained experience browsing OGBB. Likewise, goats with more experience browsing OGBB took more bites during a 5 -min period when foraging on SLO. Thus, goats generalized foraging skills from OGBB to SLO. Plant life form also affected the response of <b>goats.</b> <b>Total</b> intake, intake rate, and bite size were significantly higher for SLO than for OGBB. There was an interaction between level of experience and plant life form. The interaction occurred because goats with no experience browsing OGBB took more bites per 5 min of SLO than of OGBB, whereas goats with increasing levels of experience browsing OGBB generally took more bites of OGBB than of SLO.
