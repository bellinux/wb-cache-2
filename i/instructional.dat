25|$|<b>Instructional</b> design, the {{systematic}} design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research.

Bloom discovered {{that a combination of}} mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in classroom instruction.
