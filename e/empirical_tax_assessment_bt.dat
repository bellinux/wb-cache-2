40|$|Time Limit for <b>Tax</b> <b>Assessment</b> The thesis {{deals with}} the time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment</b> as it is {{regulated}} especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment</b> represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This time limit thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of time limits. It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of time limits. Part Two explains general aspects of the time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment.</b> Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation of time limits. Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation of the time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment.</b> Chapter Two is divided in ten parts. Part One defines the beginning of the time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment.</b> Part Two looks at the extension of the time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment.</b> Part Three deals with the interruption of time [...] ...|$|R

25|$|In April 2003, PGSMA hired Lynne Spriggs as its {{permanent}} executive director. Spriggs' {{tenure at}} the museum, which began in September, proved difficult. PPL Montana, the owner of Black Eagle Dam (a hydroelectric dam located in the county), challenged the amount of property taxes assessed on its dam, protesting 10.87 percent of the $4.48 million 2000 <b>tax</b> <b>assessment,</b> 6.5 percent of the $4.8 million 2001 <b>tax</b> <b>assessment,</b> and 85.65 percent of the $4.96 million 2002 <b>tax</b> <b>assessment.</b> This amounted to 30 percent of the $14.2 million property <b>tax</b> <b>assessment</b> from 2000 to 2003 {{in the state of}} Montana—with one-third of the amount owed payable solely in Cascade County. Under severe budgetary stress, the county reduced PGSMA's maintenance budget to $60,720. The county also advised that the mill levy would raise only $157,280 in 2003 (about $22,000 less than the previous year). The historical society asked the county to revise the 1993 agreement so that it would receive more of the mill levy, but the county declined.|$|R
2500|$|Taxation {{of the dam}} {{has been}} an issue of {{contention}} since 2000. [...] During the 2002 ballot initiative fight, PPL Montana said its dams were worth at least $767 million. But in 2003, PPL argued that the dams were worth much less. PPL Montana challenged the amount of property taxes assessed on Black Eagle and its four other dams in the area, protesting 10.87 percent of the $4.48 million 2000 <b>tax</b> <b>assessment,</b> 6.5 percent of the $4.8 million 2001 <b>tax</b> <b>assessment,</b> and 85.65 percent of the $4.96 million <b>tax</b> <b>assessment.</b> This amounted to 30 percent of its total property <b>tax</b> <b>assessment</b> {{in the state of}} Montana—with one-third of amount owed payable solely in Cascade County. In February 2005, the Montana State Tax Appeal Board gave the state a partial victory, reducing the state's assessments by 10 percent but otherwise upholding the assessment method. However, the tax board did not address PPL Montana's primary claim that the state was assessing its plants differently solely because they were unregulated. PPL Montana appealed the ruling to the Montana Supreme Court in 2007. On December 4, 2007, the Montana Supreme Court unanimously ruled in State Dept. of Revenue v. PPL Montana that the tax appeal board had properly assessed PPL Montana's dams. However, PPL Montana had continued to dispute its <b>tax</b> <b>assessments</b> from 2003 to 2007, and the ruling did not directly address those challenges. But on December 14, 2007, PPL Montana offered to pay its 2003-to-2007 <b>tax</b> <b>assessments</b> at the slightly lower rate established by the tax appeal board.|$|R
