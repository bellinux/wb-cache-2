5|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to {{know that}} there is a real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, I do not believe that the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
25|$|My {{acquaintance}} with him, though short, was fruitful by strengthening many a spiritual thought in me. He was {{certainly one of}} the most remarkable personalities <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> across in my life.|$|E
25|$|From being a {{supporter}} of British membership of the Common Market in 1970 <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> {{to believe that the}} United Kingdom would be Better Off Out of the developing European Republic of the 21st century. We British have a thousand year history of self-government. We have been free and democratic longer than any other nation. The European Union is too diverse, too bureaucratic, too corporatist and too centralist to be a functioning democracy. We are happy to trade with our European friends {{and the rest of the}} world â€“ but we would prefer to govern ourselves.|$|E
60|$|At last <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to the Galu country. Though not {{conceived}} in Caspak, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> indeed <b>come</b> up cor-sva jo--from the beginning <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> {{up through the}} hideous horrors of the lower Caspakian spheres of evolution, and I could not but feel something of the elation and pride which had filled To-mar and So-al when they realized that the call <b>had</b> <b>come</b> {{to them and they}} were about to rise from the estate of Band-lus to that of Kro-lus. I was glad that I was not batu.|$|R
50|$|Had {{you called}} me, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> <b>come.</b> / Were you to <b>have</b> called me, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> <b>come.</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to {{the clear}} {{conclusion}} {{that there is}} no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken. Nor do I consider that there is any justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the emergency and hospital services. I have considered the circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self-written statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, but I do not consider that there is any occasion for any further investigation.|$|E
25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E
500|$|My Lords, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to the {{conclusion}} that, {{as a matter of}} law, there are sound reasons for making a limited modification to the existing rule [...] unless there are constitutional or practical reasons which outweigh them. In my judgment, subject to the questions of the privileges of the House ...|$|E
60|$|This was the {{man whose}} advice <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to ask--who {{assistance}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> confidently counted on in my hour of need.|$|R

500|$|Critchell re-signed for Weymouth on {{a two-year}} {{contract}} {{for an undisclosed}} fee on 9 August 2012, with the club now in the Southern League Premier Division. He explained the transfer by saying [...] "The biggest reason why <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> back is seeing everyone smiling and being positive again. The right atmosphere seems to {{be back at the}} club and that can only bode well for the future".|$|E
500|$|When Virgil saw the Cowboys, he testified, he {{immediately}} commanded the Cowboys to [...] "Throw up your hands, I want your guns!" [...] Wyatt said Virgil told the Cowboys, [...] "Throw up your hands; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to disarm you!" [...] Virgil and Wyatt both testified they saw Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton draw and cock their six-shooters. Virgil yelled: [...] "Hold! I don't mean that!" [...] or [...] "Hold on, I don't want that!" [...] The single-action revolvers carried by both groups {{had to be}} cocked before firing.|$|E
500|$|In 1810 Bishop Asbury visited {{an obscure}} {{part of the}} western country (Kanawha) which was then a wilderness, and pleasantly told the Rev. Thomas S. Hinde that he had visited the region in order that the people might see and know their superintendent; remarking, [...] "The {{shepherd}} ought to know the flock, and the flock the shepherd: they ought to know what man it is that governs them, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> nearly one hundred miles {{out of my way}} to see them." [...] The writer exclaims, [...] "O Asbury, the inhabitants of these hills and mountains will long make mention of thee!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} yes. That <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> {{for a last}} look at the old place before I left.|$|R

500|$|Also in 1974, the PLO was {{declared}} the [...] "sole legitimate {{representative of the}} Palestinian people" [...] and admitted to full membership of the Arab League at the Rabat Summit. Arafat became the first representative of a non-governmental organization to address a plenary session of the UN General Assembly. In his United Nations address, Arafat condemned Zionism, but said, [...] "Today <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighter's gun. Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand." [...] He wore a holster throughout his speech, although it did not contain a gun. His speech increased international sympathy for the Palestinian cause.|$|E
500|$|Kapoor {{has gone}} on record to add, [...] "I would be {{surprised}} if I don't get unbelievable critical acclaim for The Dirty Picture and a national award for my actress, Vidya Balan. The film {{has one of the most}} well-written scripts <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> across and a lot of youngsters in my office have looked at it with great admiration." [...] She pointed out that the purpose of the film was neither to justify nor criticise Smitha's life but for the audience to live her life. Additionally, all actors, including Balan and Shah attended workshops for almost two months before filming began, to familiarise themselves with the body language of their characters.|$|E
500|$|He enterered the University of Pisa {{intending}} to study engineering, {{but after two}} years he decided to switch to physics in 1931. On {{the advice of his}} brother Guido, he decided to study at the University of Rome La Sapienza, where Enrico Fermi had gathered together a group of promising young scientists known as the Via Panisperna boys after the name of the street where the Institute of Physics of Rome University was then situated. At the age of 18 he was admitted to the third year of Physics. Fermi described Pontecorvo as [...] "scientifically one of the brightest men with whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> in contact in my scientific career". As their youngest member, the group nicknamed him Cucciolo, which means [...] "puppy".|$|E

60|$|An officer ordered {{several other}} warriors to {{accompany}} him, {{and a moment}} later we were retracing the way <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just <b>come.</b> My friend walked close beside me, asking many silly questions about the country from which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come,</b> until finally his fellows paid no further attention to him or his gabbling.|$|R

500|$|In {{a recent}} {{editorial}} written by Bannon in Curve, she discussed how her books survived despite criticisms by censors, Victorian moralists, and purveyors of literary [...] "snobbery" [...] in writing, [...] "To the persistent surprise {{of many of}} us, and of the critics who found us such an easy target years ago, the books by, of and for women found {{a life of their}} own. Theyâ€”and weâ€”may still not be regarded as conventionally acceptable 'nice' literature, as it wereâ€”but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to value that historical judgment. We wrote the stories no one else could tell. And in so doing, we captured a slice of life in a particular time and place that still resonates for members of our community." ...|$|E
500|$|Steinitz {{strove to}} be {{objective}} in his writings about chess competitions and games, for example he attributed to sheer bad luck a poor tournament score by Henry Edward Bird, whom he considered no friend of his, and was generous in his praise of great play by even his bitter enemies. He could poke fun at {{some of his own}} rhetoric, for example [...] "I remarked that I would rather die in America than live in England. ... I added that I would rather lose a match in America than win one in England. But after having carefully considered the subject in all its bearings, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to the conclusion that I neither mean to die yet nor to lose the match." [...] At a joint simultaneous display in Russia {{around the time of the}} 1895â€“96 Saint Petersburg tournament, Emanuel Lasker and Steinitz formed an impromptu comedy double act.|$|E
500|$|The single's {{reception}} {{was generally}} positive. It reached number 35 on the UK Singles Chart. It also reached number 26 at the US Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. The song remains, to this day, an audience favorite in live performances. It {{has earned the}} band praise from critics. Adrian Denning, in his review of the album, wrote, [...] "'Shiver' has a vocal that could be Jeff Buckley influenced, the soaring vocals are a joy over a reasonably guitar rock based instrumental track." [...] A review by David DeVoe in Hybridmagazine.com reads, [...] "'Shiver' is a delightfully laid back tune, full of that great guitar sound that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to appreciate this band for." [...] Spencer Owen of Pitchfork noted, [...] "It's the only truly decent song on Parachutes, but simultaneously, it's {{the only one that}} blatantly shows its influences. In fact, the influence can even be pinned to a single song: Jeff Buckley's 'Grace.'" ...|$|E
60|$|I peered anxiously {{around me}} in every direction, but I {{could see no}} sign of her whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to meet.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to the Hotel de l'Epee, exulting, joyous, and {{confident}} of victory. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to confess everything to her, and {{by virtue of}} what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done that confession was rendered easy. <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> said to her: [...] "The woman whom I wagered to win was not you, Roxalanne, but a certain Mademoiselle de Lavedan. Your love <b>I</b> <b>have</b> won, but that you may foster no doubts of my intentions, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> paid my wager and acknowledge defeat. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made over to Chatellerault and to his heirs for all time my estates of Bardelys." ...|$|R

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "a solid example of the showâ€™s mid-period form". However, {{he noted that the}} episode {{is not one of the}} series bests, unlike the way many fans portray itâ€”due largely to the fact that [...] "it allows us to see what it would be like if Mulder and Scully were a happily married couple"â€”and that [...] "the episodeâ€™s monster is a little hard to figure out". Other reviews were more mixed. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6â€“9 of the X-Files gave the episode a more mixed review, writing [...] "after {{watching}} 'Arcadia', I feel like I just had a couple slices of pizza for dinner on Thanksgiving. Not bad, but hardly the feast <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to expect." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris, despite praising David Duchovny's performance during the scenes wherein he [...] "rebels against the rules", called the episode's main villains [...] "stereotypes of self-indulgent, insulated suburbanites." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{pneumatic}} value {{failure in}} the preceding race, the United States Grand Prix, had forced HÃ¤kkinen to retire from the Grand Prix. With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, HÃ¤kkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I know that what happened to me in the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And {{the same can be said}} of the entire team." [...] Ferrari team principal Jean Todt and former World Champion Jody Scheckter called for Barrichello and Coulthard to race fairly as both drivers were ordered by their teams to assist their teammates in the Championship battle.|$|E
500|$|Davison {{joined the}} Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in November 1906. Formed in 1903 by Emmeline Pankhurst, the WSPU brought {{together}} {{those who thought}} that militant, confrontational tactics were needed to achieve their ultimate goal of women's suffrage. Davison joined in the WSPU's campaigning, and became {{an officer of the}} organisation and a chief steward during marches. In 1908 or 1909 she left her job teaching and dedicated herself full-time to the union. She began taking increasingly confrontational actions, which prompted Sylvia Pankhurstâ€”the daughter of Emmeline and a full-time member of the WSPUâ€”to describe her as [...] "one of the most daring and reckless of the militants". In March 1909 she was arrested for the first time; she had been part of a deputation of 21 women who marched from Caxton Hall to see the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, the march ended in a fracas with police, and she was arrested for [...] "assaulting the police in the execution of their duty". She was sentenced to a month in prison. After her release she wrote to Votes for Women, the WSPU's newspaper, saying that [...] "Through my humble work in this noblest of all causes <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> into a fullness of job and an interest in living which I never before experienced." ...|$|E
