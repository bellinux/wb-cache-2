40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an on-chip design topology that compensates {{the effects of}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> (EMI) in a low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) transmitter. The pro-posed structure enables the transmitter to maintain a wide dif-ferential opening by achieving a superior common-mode level independent driving current and common-mode feedback closed-loop gain. Direct power injection measurements illustrate that the proposed LVDS transmitter structure demonstrates a superior EMI immunity as it maintains an eye opening of at least 100 mVp-p in presence of a conductive EMI injection ranging from 150 to 2 GHz with an amplitude of up to 9 Vp-p. Additionally, transverse electromagnetic cell measurements validate the radiated immu-nity of the proposed integrated LVDS transmitter in presence of an EMI injection of 30 dBm (150 kHz– 2 GHz). This EMI robust LVDS transmitter was designed using the UMC 0. 18 -μm CMOS process.

CFM techniques dither the switching period with a small amplitude variation around the nominal value, so that the harmonic power is redistributed over the spectrum of concern. Two types of dithering signals, including the periodic and random signals, are investigated in this paper. The operational characteristics {{as well as the}} input and output power spectra of the converters with the two modulating signals are compared. In particular, their characteristics in the low- and high-frequency harmonic power redistribution will be depicted. It is shown that random CFM (RCFM) gives a more effective way to disperse the harmonics around the switching frequency than the periodic CFM (PCFM) with the same frequency deviation. However, RCFM introduces higher low-frequency harmonics than the PCFM at the converter output. Furthermore, effects of the resolution filter bandwidth in the electromagnetic compatibility analyzer on conducted EMI measurement is discussed.

40|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} {{embedded in}} polymer matrices have excellent potential for electromagnetic device applications like <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> (EMI) <b>suppression.</b> Using chemical precipitation methods and Nanogen, a microwave plasma method, we have synthesized various nanoparticles including iron, polystyrene-coated iron, iron oxide (both hematite and magnetite), nickel ferrite, and manganese zinc ferrite. We have synthesized polymer nanocomposites of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polystyrene (PS), and polypyrrole (PPy) doped with varying concentrations of these nanoparticles. These nanocomposites were processed using melt blending and sonication techniques. The concentration of nanoparticles was varied {{in a controlled}} way. Although polymer processing conditions were optimized to achieve good uniform dispersion of the nanoparticles in the polymer matrix, surface characterization with SEM indicates areas of clustering of the nanoparticles. This agglomeration is attributed to the particle interactions mediated by steric forces in the polymer matrix. Static magnetic properties such as susceptibility and M-H loops were studied using a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). The variation of the magnetic responses {{were consistent with the}} varying volume concentration of the nanoparticles, the polymers themselves contributing diamagnetic responses.

40|$|Metallized {{polymer film}} {{capacitors}} are important passive electrical components nowadays, which are currently used in any electronic devices and circuits without hesitation. Amongst other components, {{they are used}} in EMC-filters as X- and Y-capacitors, so-called RFI/EMI suppression capacitors. The latest results of studies show that under critical operating conditions, the reliability of those components is called into question. In one case an Inverter supplier was forced to call back a number of inverters, {{because one of the}} capacitors used has degraded. "This process results in outgassing within the wiring component of the inverter itself, possibly causing the compartment's cover to pop off with enough force to cause injury or property damage". This circumstance suggests, that the requested quality tests, according to the standard IEC 60384 - 14 : 2005 "Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment - Part 14 : Sectional specification - Fixed capacitors for <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> and connection to the supply mains" are not sufficient. There are no sufficient tests, specific to capacitors exposed to the conditions corresponding, when they are used in solar inverters for the outdoor area. The norm only includes a general climate test for the RFI/EMI suppression capacitors in all range of applications. At Fraunhofer IWES an accelerated aging test has been conducted for 1, 000 hours, at a defined temperature and relative humidity with different voltage stress conditions (d. c., a. c. and without voltage), after a short time a degradation of some metallized polymer film capacitors was observed. The ageing of RFI/EMI suppression capacitors cause, not only the rise of the electrical disturbances above the permitted limits, but could also affect the leakage currents at the event of a fault in a negative way, so that the isolation ability of the capacitors in case of failure is severely limited and thereby a risk for humans could occur...|$|E
