30|$|Due to {{the high}} {{spectral}} efficiency and high data rate, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely used in both military and commercial communications, e.g., UAC and PLC [15, 16].

The use of optics also makes remote sensing feasible by eliminating the need for electrical wires to be connected between sensors and computers.

Each application of fiber optics for aircraft control has different requirements for both the optical cables and the optical connectors. Sensors that measure position and speed by using slotted plates can use lossy cables and bundle connectors if data transfer is in the parallel mode. If position and speed signals are multiplexed, cable and connector requirements change.

Histopathological studies were conducted to confirm localizations of MCMV infected cells in the inner ear.

ResultsIn the mouse model of CMV induced SNHL, inflammasome related kinase Caspase- 1 and downstream inflammatory factor IL- 1 β and IL- 18 were found increased and activated after CMV infection in the cochlea.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] {{on the principles of}} laser Doppler velocimetry, the laser torsional vibrometer (LTV) was developed for non-contact measurement of torsional oscillation of rotating shafts, offering significant advantages over conventional techniques. This paper describes comprehensive theory to account for the sensitivity of the LTV's measurements to shaft motion in all degrees of freedom. The optical geometry of the LTV offers <b>inherent</b> <b>immunity</b> to translational motion of the target shaft, either axial or radial. However, its measurements are sensitive to angular lateral vibration of the shaft. The significance of this sensitivity is compared with the instrument noise floor and typical torsional and lateral vibration levels. Optimum alignments of the instrument are then specified to ensure effective immunity to all lateral motion in typical applications. To overcome this problem more reliably, a new technique is proposed permitting unambiguous measurement of pure torsional vibration in situations where use of a single LTV demonstrates unacceptable sensitivity to angular lateral vibrations. Practical application of this technology is demonstrated with torsional vibration measurements from a diesel engine crankshaft. Simultaneously, previously unattained measurements of shaft bending vibration measurements are made. The first bending mode of the crankshaft was identified and its vibration amplitude and damping estimated. This application of laser vibrometry for non-contact measurements of shaft vibration represents a further step forward in the use of this technology for machinery diagnostics...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (DTech (Mechnical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2005 Among {{the issues}} that are taken into {{consideration}} for many years by Engineers and Technologists is the integrity of the servicing elements in structures and mechanisms. It is a documented phenomenon that after a certain period of time, in service, engineering components tend to change their original state, and begin to develop faults and defects. This includes the original shape distortion due to effects such as bending, twisting, and cracks. The above-sited effects may be caused by the sudden or accumulative effect of overloading, thermal shocks, corrosion etc, which eventually lead to malfunction of these engineering components. The occurrence of the cracks may be as a result of stress variation in excess of different or similar materials; thermal shocks, vibration, etc. A system of structural health monitoring using optical fiber sensors to track down a crack occurrence and its propagation {{is considered to be a}} promising method in warning of catastrophic events. Taking advantage of optical fibers' properties and behavior, such as easy interaction with other materials, small size, low weight, corrosion resistance, geometrical flexibility and an <b>inherent</b> <b>immunity</b> to electromagnetic interference, there is potential in adopting the Fiber Optic Sensors (FOS) for structural health monitoring systems.

40|$|Because of the <b>inherent</b> {{advantage}} of <b>immunity</b> to RFf, EMf, ground loop currents {{and to a}} large extent to nuclear radiations, optical transmission through dielectric wave guide or fiber optic transmission as it is popularly known is gaining considerable importance for both civil and military communication. The additional unique {{advantage of}} large bandwidth transmission capabilities, low weight, cost and use of inexhaustible raw material (silica) makes the use of this new technology as a forerunner, which would ultimately replace coaxial transmission completely. To use this new technology for transmission of signals both in analog and digital formats, for short haul low bit rate signals or long high bit rate signals special attention has to be given in the selection of the four basic components namely the fiber source, detector, and the amplifier. This paper discusses the progressive development of the above four components to meet the present day demand for high data rate long haul communication systems...|$|R
40|$|The IEEE 488 (or IEC 625) {{interface}} standard for programmable instrumentation is used widely, {{all over the}} world, in laboratories and manufacturing plants. The main limitation of this data bus system is distance: the maximum cabling distance is 20 meters or 2 meters per instrument, whichever is less. Fiber optics can help us getting rid of this serious distance limitation problem. DATEABUS 488 is a ring shaped physical local area network, which is totally transparent to the IEEE 488 protocol. It uses optically bypassed, fail-safe, transceivers (Servotaps), for high reliability. Maximum distance between stations is one kilometer. Maximum data rate is 140 kilobyte per second. The number of stations can be higher than 100, but addresses are limited to 31 by the protocol. The noise <b>immunity</b> <b>inherent</b> to optical fiber precludes any deterioration of bit-error-rate. Technical background Optical networks Local Area Networks (LANs) have mostly been implemented on coaxial cable or twiste...|$|R
