5|$|Iridium has two {{naturally}} occurring, stable isotopes, 191Ir and 193Ir, {{with natural}} abundances of 37.3% and 62.7%, respectively. At least 34 radioisotopes {{have also been}} synthesized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 199. 192Ir, which falls between the two stable isotopes, is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 73.827days, and finds application in brachytherapy and in <b>industrial</b> <b>radiography,</b> particularly for nondestructive testing of welds in steel in {{the oil and gas}} industries; iridium-192 sources have been involved in a number of radiological accidents. Three other isotopes have half-lives of at least a day—188Ir, 189Ir, and 190Ir. Isotopes with masses below 191 decay by some combination of β+ decay, α decay, and (rare) proton emission, with the exceptions of 189Ir, which decays by electron capture. Synthetic isotopes heavier than 191 decay by β− decay, although 192Ir also has a minor electron capture decay path. All known isotopes of iridium were discovered between 1934 and 2001; the most recent is 171Ir.|$|E

Thus, the search of new scintillating materials for these applications has continued emerged, the goal is to be coupled with the existing devices, like the CCD cameras. The purpose of the present work is the elaboration of Ln 2 O 3 :Eu 3 +, Tb 3 + (X=Gd, Y, Lu) thin films, employing the sol-gel process along with the dip-coating technique. The proposed methodology has demonstrated a high versatility to obtain high quality oxide thin films. The as- prepared oxides were chosen due to their excellent X-Ray scintillation properties, whereas the dopant ions (Eu 3 +, Tb 3 +) as because of their well recognized capacity to emit in the red visible region, preserving its high light yield, being the maximum CD cameras efficiency. In the present work, the protocols to obtain Gd, Y and Lu sols have been established, as well as the conditions to obtain their corresponding nanopowders. The dependence of the nanopowders microstructural behavior along the heat treatment process has been also studied. Afterwards, the radioluminescent test have been performed on powders under X-Ray, in order to determinate the effect of theTb 3 + codoping in the luminescence properties. The results showed that the highest light yields were observed for samples codoped with 2. 5 Eu 3 + at. %, 0. 005 Tb 3 + at. %. As Tb 3 + content were higher than 0. 005 Tb 3 + at. %, the light yield diminished. Finally, Gd 2 O 3 and Y 2 O 3 (. 5 Eu 3 + at. %, 0. 005 Tb 3 + at. %.) thin films were characterized in waveguiding configuration by using “m-lines” spectroscopy with the aim to determine the optogeometrical parameters (thickness and refractive index). The films thicknesses were 500 nm thick and their specific densities were about 6. 48 and 7. 4 g cm- 3. The study performed by High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) demonstrated that the obtained films were composed of nanometric grains, whereas the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) showed roughness below to 20 nm, value similar to that obtained by polishing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Efficient and {{reliable}} nondestructive evaluation techniques {{are necessary to}} ensure the safe operation of complex parts and constructions in an <b>industrial</b> environment. <b>Radiography</b> {{is one of the}} classical nondestructive testing techniques widely applied in industry. Over the years modelling became more and more important in modern NDE. It is increasingly used to optimize techniques for complex applications and to support the preparation of written procedures. Hence, computer modelling is nowadays able to handle all significant properties of a NDE system with sufficient accuracy. In case of radiographic applications the model includes the radiation source, the interaction of radiation with material, the detection process, and the geometrical description of the part or the construction. As known from practice the last can be very complex and requires a description that allows the handling of arbitrary geometries. The link between NDE models and CAD provides the ability to quantitatively evaluate complex inspection procedures. Depending on the formulated inspection problem or the influencing factors that should be accessed by modelling an appropriate physical model has to be chosen to describe the underlying interaction mechanisms. The developed simulation capabilities are used to assess the reliability of the radiographic inspection of thick section welds for a special application and to determine the probability of detection (POD) for flaws of different size and shape. www. ndt. net/index. php?id= 8350 1...|$|R
40|$|Bentonite-bonded {{molding sand}} {{is one of}} the most common mold {{materials}} used in metal casting. The high casting temperatures cause dehydration and alteration of the molding sand, thereby degrading its reusability. Neutron radiography and neutron diffraction were applied to study these processes by using pure bentonite-quartz-water mixtures in simulation casting experiments. The aim of the experiments was to compare the dehydration behavior of raw and recycled mold material in order to assess possible causes of the limited reusability of molding sands in <b>industrial</b> application. Neutron <b>radiography</b> provided quantitative data for the local water concentrations within the mold material as a function of time and temperature. Dehydration zones, condensation zones, and areas of pristine hydrated molding sand could be established clearly. The kinematics of the zones was quantified. Within four cycles of de- and rehydration, no significant differences in water kinematics were detected. The data, therefore, suggest that the industrial handling (molding-sand additives and the presence of metal melt) may have greater effects on molding-sand reusability than the intrinsic properties of the pure bentonite-quartz-water system. ...|$|R

40|$|Two main spatial {{frequency}} and quantitative calculations and measurements am, {{used to study}} the imaging system of three <b>industrial</b> digital <b>radiography</b> (IDR) modules for non-destructive testing (NDT), namely {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) flat-panel digital detector with 50 mu m pixel pitch, computed radiography (CR) with phosphor imaging plate with 25 mu m pixel pitch and laser-type film digitiser with 50 mu m pixel pitch. The modulation transfer function (MTF) and noise power spectrum (NPS) measurement and calculations were adapted on order to evaluate the image quality of IDR images. The MTF has been used to characterise the resolution properties of analogue and digital X-ray imaging systems and measure image deterioration due to optical factors, such as diffusion of image forming radiation. The NPS is used in determining noise in images produced and the choices of normalisation of the NPS vary slightly from researcher to researcher, but the underlying methodology is consistent. In order to easily compare these two measurements and calculations, the integral of up to the system Nyquist frequency was used as the final image quality quantitative evaluation. For the MTF measurement and calculation, four regions of interest (ROI) were, defined to portray the randomness in performing real testing. The four ROI are then compared with each other. For the NPS measurement and calculation, ten ROI were defined, scattered and averaged to have overall noise estimation. From the measurements and calculations which were done, the averaged MTF at 20 % modulation for the laser-type film digitiser system is 6. 55 cycles/mm, CR modulated 4. 48 and CMOS modulated 2. 83 cycles/mm. For NPS measurement and calculation, the result obtained in decreasing order is laser-type film digitiser, CMOS and CR. The laser-type film digitiser system modulates the best transfer function at 20 % but does not have the lowest NPS. The lowest and stable NPS is the CR system but it has the lowest modulating capability at 20 %. The study shows that in order to perform NDT by using the evaluated modules, the user must know the true capability, of the system and how, it is designed for specific application and discontinuity detection...|$|R
