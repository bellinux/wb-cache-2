In this position Arnold worked patiently for the next thirty- five years, traveling about the country, examining teachers, and correcting <b>endless</b> examination <b>papers.</b> For ten years (1857-1867) he was professor of poetry at Oxford, where his famous lectures On Translating Homer were given. He made numerous reports on English and foreign schools, and was three times sent abroad to study educational methods on the Continent. From this it will be seen that Arnold led a busy, often a laborious life, and we can appreciate his statement that all his best literary work was done late at night, after a day of drudgery. It is well to remember that, while Carlyle was preaching about labor, Arnold labored daily; that his work was cheerfully and patiently done; and that after the day's work he hurried away, like Lamb, to the Elysian fields of literature. He was happily married, loved his home, and especially loved children, was free from all bitterness and envy, and, notwithstanding his cold manner, was at heart sincere, generous, and true. We shall appreciate his work better if we can see the man himself behind all that he has written.|$|R
40|$|Introductory physics {{courses are}} an {{important}} rung on the curricular ladder in STEM. These courses help to strengthen students critical thinking and problem solving skills while simultaneously introducing them to many topics they will explore in more detail in later courses in physics and engineering. For these reasons, introductory physics is a required element on the curricular ladder. Most often, introductory physics is offered as a two-semester sequence with basic mechanics being taught in the first semester and electricity and magnetism in the second. In fact, this curricular sequence has not been altered in decades. Is there a reason for this? There are many other enduring questions that arise pertaining to these foundation courses in physics. These questions include: Does taking the introductory course sequence “out of order” {{have an impact on}} student learning in physics? What topics should be taught? When should these topics be taught? What topics could be left out? The list of questions is essentially <b>endless.</b> This <b>paper</b> will address some of these questions in part, through a brief discussion on student learning in a second-semester algebra-based physics course. Connections will also be made to the broader curricular ladder in STEM. To this end, an illustration that makes connections to an engineering statics course will be presented. This discussion will conclude by presenting some broader implications for the larger STEM communities...|$|R

This <b>paper</b> presents a miniature rotary motor based on shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires and overrunning clutches, which produces high output torque and unlimited rotation. The concept features an SMA wire tightly wound around a low-friction cylindrical drum to convert wire strains into large rotations within a compact package. The seesaw motion of the drum ensuing from repeated contraction-elongation cycles of the wire is converted into unidirectional motion of the output shaft by an overrunning clutch fitted between drum and shaft. Following a design process developed in a former paper, a six-stage prototype with size envelope of 48 × 22 × 30 mm is built and tested. Diverse supply strategies are implemented to optimize either the output torque or the speed regularity of the motor with the following results: maximum torque = 20 Nmm; specific torque = 6. 31 × 10 - 4 Nmm/mm 3; rotation per module = 15 deg/cycle; and free continuous speed = 4. 4 rpm...|$|R

At times it seems after numerous observation, that the rate of progress in the knowledge of wear is very slow. Modern design activities are mostly concern in the wear cumulative values determination rather than the wear values determination in successive time units of friction nods during the operation time. Therefore, presented paper determines in analytical way the cumulative wear values of friction nods after specified finite and infinite units of operation time. Therefore are considered the convergences and divergences of wear value cumulative processes for various friction nods. The kind of friction nods depends on type of wear process propagation. Such propagation is described in this paper by the recurrence first order equation. Mentioned equation is formulated with constant or variable parameters. This parameters are determined by virtue of experimental measurements and depend on: bearing materials properties, environmental conditions, roughness of cooperating surfaces, vibration effects, electrical conductivity of materials, hardness of materials, deformations mode of cooperating surfaces, temperature, air humidity, kind of the friction, sliding velocity, loading of the friction nod and others.

40|$|Tourism's {{potential}} {{as a tool for}} poverty reduction in developing countries is still part of an <b>endless</b> controversy. This <b>paper</b> argues that one of the main problems of the debate is rooted in a missing nexus between micro- and macro-perspectives. The result is a lack of an adequate consideration of local socio-political power structures and their influence on development issues. Macro-perspective paradigms – like dependency or neoclassic theory – tend to argue from a Euro-centric perspective and largely ignore local political conditions. On the other hand, micro-perspectives – like the alternative development paradigm – emphasize local conditions, but tend to underestimate superior structures on the national level. On the contrary, this paper aims to demonstrate, that even if economic benefits of tourism are undoubted, the same benefits do not necessarily have equal beneficial impacts on development. By discussing the Egyptian example, the paper demonstrates how tourism connects economic and political spheres. It suggests that {{it is not possible to}} understand the development of the Egyptian tourism industry without embedding it into the neo-patrimonial political system of the country and its political economy as a semi-rentier state. At the end of the 1980 s, Egypt's government took the decision to develop tourism, when other sources of rent income were in crisis and the government was in danger of being destabilized. Since then, tourism has been a great success story in Egypt and contributes substantially to the economic development of the country. The tremendously increasing tourism revenues have significantly contributed to the stabilization of the political system and the neo-patrimonial structure of power in Egypt...|$|R

To begin with, the first instances of application of mathematics to physics, then the first appearance of something like modern mathematical physics, and, eventually, a particular kind of mathematical physics theory, called rational mechanics, are discussed.

40|$|The {{controversy}} over the killing of seals on the ice floes off of Atlantic Canada {{continues to be a}} very heated, socio-political and moral debate. Sealers’ activities first came under intense public scrutiny in the early 1960 s with the broadcast of a television documentary showing graphic footage of seals being clubbed. Since that time, the “seal war” has become an emotional war of words and images fought primarily via media outlets. This paper focuses on analyzing the content of public opinions as published in Canadian news sources. The aim was to elucidate the relevant arguments and delineate the major concerns of each “side” to the conflict. The language used was closely examined. Through this type of inquiry, it is hoped that underlying causes of the disagreement and apparent impasse may be discovered so that a more informed, respectful, and meaningful discourse may someday take place. The results showed that improved communication will be critically important if we are ever to change the status quo which is endless protest, endless backlash, and <b>endless</b> sealing. The <b>paper</b> is divided into three general sections. Section I gives important background information, without which the issue cannot be adequately understood. A synopsis of the pertinent legal and policy framework is also included. Section II establishes theories and perspectives on the human treatment of non-human animals, explores how our conceptions are conditioned both socially and through the very language we employ, and sets the tone for further inquiry by relating these ideas to the Canadian seal hunt. Section III uses content analysis to explore seal hunt opinion. One interpretation regarding the root of this controversy is offered. The central thesis is that human beings ultimately accept varying treatments of “others” in direct relation to how they perceive themselves and their own status in the world around them...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} {{millennium}} {{and across the}} length and breadth of China and beyond, people have been burning paper replicas of the material world to send to their deceased family members, ancestors, and myriads of imaginary beings. The paper replicas, which include all types of goods and treasures, mostly old and new forms of money, is {{commonly referred to as}} the paper money custom. Studies of the paper money custom have neglected the native opposition to it, especially that of the contemporary intelligentsia, one form of which consists of news reports and human interest stories in the popular press that lampoon the practice of burning paper money. Many stories lampoon the paper money custom by showing how it burlesques traditional virtues such as filial piety. One of the interesting maneuvers in this criticism is how it employs the old and newer kinds of paper monies to shape the response of the readers. FOR A THOUSAND YEARS people in China have been replicating their materialworld of social things in paper in order to provender and avail the family ghosts, ancestors, and myriads of imaginary beings by the magic of fire. Cut from an <b>endless</b> scroll of <b>paper,</b> the effigies replicate everyday items, utensils, valuables, money—a virtual inventory of things that constitute the effects of Chinese civilization, both old and new.

40|$|Along {{time the}} European Union (EU) has been pointed {{as the most}} succeeded example of {{regional}} integration. Now, this example has been cruelly shaken by the EZ (Euro Zone) crisis, originating increasing doubts about the integration process. It is evident that the proposed solutions for attacking the crisis have hurt the European cohesion making more and more clear the separation of two big regions: one composed by North and Central European countries and the other constituted by the Southern and South-western countries. Why regardless of the uncountable meetings announced as decisive for its solution, and the recurrent EU proclamations of ?policies to restore European growth?, {{the crisis in the}} EZ looks more and more like an <b>endless</b> problem? Our <b>paper</b> deals with answers to this question emphasizing some problems affecting the solution to the EZ crisis. Some of them are political while others result from misconceptions about putting in place the correct economic policy. Given the enormous private and public debt accumulated in periphery after the single currency inception, and aggravated by the first attack to the international financial crisis, it is not questionable the need of fiscal consolidation in peripheral countries. Our paper shows why is erroneous to consider budgetary contraction as the only way of attaining fiscal consolidation and explains why austerity is so fiercely advocated by both core and periphery governments. The main reasons for the lack of competitiveness in periphery are explained and the possible options to minimize the structural imbalance inside EZ, between its core and periphery, are indicated. Our paper shows that the solutions to the EZ crisis applied by national governments, in cooperation with the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF, based on further austerity and wage cuts aggravate the crisis, instead of solve it. Such solutions are unlikely to reduce both sovereign and external debt ratios of periphery countries, but surely they will drive Euro Area as a whole to stagnation and lost decades of economic growth, if not to its disintegration. Considering the debt crisis as a problem of the PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain) that can be contained in the periphery is not the most adequate perspective either for solving the crisis or for the credibility of the EU integration process and will inevitably impact on the spreading of the integration model to other regions of the world...|$|R
40|$|The public acts of {{violence}} {{during the summer of}} 2012 in Toronto brought the theme of gangs back to the forefront in Canadian media coverage. As renewed debates argued old subject matters, our understanding of gangs was not able to diverge from its <b>endless</b> roundabout. This <b>paper</b> inverts the study of gangs that has classically looked towards the gang as a collective to explain its sub-cultural delinquent and sometimes violent tendencies, and explores the individualized interpretation of gang membership from the perspective of four Latin-Canadian males from the Greater Toronto Area. This study takes on the challenge of observing the trajectory of gang membership based on the first hand experiences of self-proclaimed ex-gang members and through an in-depth dialogue with these participants, ventures through the turning points that led these individual actors through the process of onset; commitment and desistance. This exploration into the lived experiences of gang membership is seen through a Symbolic Interactionist lens and views gang membership as one of many identities that can actively be portrayed by the social being. In this perspective, the concepts of gangs and gang membership are described as a subjective experience completely open to interpretation, but guided by the flow of unique interactions that these individuals encountered within a variety of complex situations and environments. That which is being observed herein is the process of how the participants interacted with their existing environments and the circumstances produced by them, highlighting the momentous events that continuously defined the individuals understanding of their own self concept as a gang member up until the point of non-membership. What was observed by a dissection of the interviewee’s accounts was that the onset of gang membership was influenced primarily by a feeling of disassociation and alienation which the participants actively sought to suppress, whereby the idea of belonging to a gang offered the remedy. The aspect of commitment was shown to be focused more towards upholding the identity of gang membership and their reputation than towards the gang itself. Reinforcing the identity maintained the individual’s social status and relevance amongst their peers, solidifying the aspired identity of gang membership. Finally, the process of desistance surfaced once the gang member identity no longer seemed beneficial. Life threats, a re-emergence of the feeling of solidarity, the experience of disloyalty and the acceptance of another identity as being more imperative were factors that separately influenced the move for the discontinuance for the projection of the gang member identity. Although the participants admit to and self proclaim ex-membership, they do nonetheless acknowledge that the gang mask could once again be put back on...|$|R
