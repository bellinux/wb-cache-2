40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a lightweight, yet software friendly, block cipher. Most of the lightweight block ciphers are nibble-oriented as the implementation of a 4 -bit S-box is much more compact than an 8 -bit S-box. This paper uses a novel implementation of multi-plicative inverse for 8 -bit S-boxes using LFSR requiring only 138 gate-equivalent. With this powerful scheme, we design a lightweight block cipher competitive with existing standards in terms of <b>hardware</b> <b>gate</b> equivalent first time using an 8 -bit S-box...|$|E
40|$|A {{hardware}} {{architecture is}} proposed which allows direct mapping of design simulation topology onto an acceleration platform. In order to clarify architectural principles, the simulation {{is confined to}} functional verification of unit delay, binary valued gate level logic designs. Under this approach, a rank ordered design description is executed on a massively parallel processor grid which implements an efficient and direct model of the design, similar to prototyping. Architectural innovation reduces logic complexity and execution time of boolean evaluation and fanout switching circuits, while large scale parallelism is integrated at die level to reduce cost and communication delays. The results of this research {{form the basis for}} a multiple order of magnitude improvement in reported state-of-the-art cost-performance merit for <b>hardware</b> <b>gate</b> level simulation accelerators...|$|E

Field Programmable Gate Arrays enable the implementation of algorithms at the <b>hardware</b> <b>gate</b> level, leading to orders of magnitude performance increase over microprocessor based systems. The automatic classification of spaceborne multispectral images {{is an example of}} a computation intensive application that can benefit from implementation on an FPGA-based custom computing machine (adaptive or recon gurable computer). A probabilistic neural network is used here to classify pixels of a multispectral LANDSAT- 2 image. The implementation described utilizes Java client/server application programs to access the adaptive computer from a remote site. Results verify that a remote hardware version of the algorithm (implemented on an adaptive computer) is significantly faster than a local software version of the same algorithm (implemented on a typical general-purpose computer) ...|$|E

30|$|Data-driven and {{hardware-based}} gating are {{two very}} different approaches for acquiring essentially the same respiratory signature for a scan. Identical results cannot be expected from <b>hardware</b> and data-driven <b>gating</b> since <b>hardware</b> <b>gating</b> is based on signal recorded by a small device (in our case, an 18 -mm-diameter pressure-sensitive pad placed under {{some part of the}} thorax of the rat), while the data-driven algorithm used in this study combines respiratory motion signals identified as periodic changes in activity concentration at any and all locations in the image volume. Nevertheless, in this work, visual and quantitative assessments confirmed that the two methods performed similarly with respect to trigger points and 4 D image presentation for a subset of 24 scans, as has been observed by others [12, 15]. In this assessment, however, we can note that there were two (/ 24) scans in which the median measured periods for these scans differed between hardware and software signal, and for which observers did find motion. Closer inspection revealed that for the first scan, both the hardware and software respiratory traces appeared very erratic, with significant portions of the scan interval exhibiting frequent large changes (> 20 %) in periodicity. Such behavior precludes useful respiratory gating, irrespective of the gating system. For the second scan, <b>hardware</b> <b>gating</b> yielded observable respiratory motion on the reconstructed images, while the software failed. Further scrutiny revealed that modifications to the frequency window parameter used in the software gating process could fix the error. This example highlights the importance of optimizing gating parameters and is discussed more below.|$|R

30|$|Understanding {{this issue}} of what {{constitutes}} an optimal and non-optimal signal is of great importance as the field of gating moves forward in both the software-based and hardware-based arenas. Patient motion, uptake patterns, and scan statistics are very case specific. With <b>hardware</b> <b>gating,</b> results are variable {{with respect to the}} placement of monitoring devices and particular patient geometry/behavior, and parameter optimization in software gating can be understood as analogous. Our work demonstrated to us, however, {{that there may be a}} large advantage with software gating in that scans can be reprocessed retrospectively in an effort to achieve an optimal signal. There is potential for future methodological advancements in data-driven gating to incorporate iterative steps that will optimize all parameters during processing, making the algorithm more appropriate for use in diverse populations, possibly using the concept of a motion score [19]. Data-driven gating research could expand the classic concept of motion control achieved through gating towards algorithms that extract an optimal motion signal and present it with an optimal benefit.|$|R

A method called Gated Envelope Feedback is proposed to allow the automatic hardware reconfiguration of a stand-alone RFIC PA in multiple states for power efficiency improvement purposes. The method uses self-operating and fully integrated circuitry comprising RF power detection, switching and sequential logic, and RF envelope feedback {{in conjunction with a}} <b>hardware</b> <b>gating</b> function for triggering and activating current reduction mechanisms {{as a function of the}} transmitted RF power level. Because of the critical role that RFIC PA components occupy in modern wireless transceivers, and given the major impact that these components have on the overall RF performances and energy consumption in wireless transceivers, very significant benefits stem from the underlying innovations. The method has been validated through the successful design of a 1. 88 GHz COMA RFIC PA with automatic hardware reconfiguration capability, using an industry renowned state-of-the-art GaAs HBT semiconductor process developed and owned by Skyworks Solutions, Inc., USA. The circuit techniques that have enabled the successful and full on-chip embodiment of the technique are analyzed in details. The IC implementation is discussed, and experimental results showing significant current reduction upon automatic hardware reconfiguration, gain regulation performances, and compliance with the stringent linearity requirements for COMA transmission demonstrate that the gated envelope feedback method is a viable and promising approach to automatic hardware reconfiguration of RFIC PA's for current reduction purposes. Moreover, in regard to on-chip integration of advanced PA control functions, it is demonstrated that the method is better positioning GaAs HBT technologies, which are known to offer very competitive RF performances but inherently have limited integration capabilities. Finally, an analytical approach for the evaluation of inter-modulation distortion (IMD) in envelope feedback architectures is introduced, and the proposed design equations and methodology for IMD analysis may prove very helpful for theoretical analyses, for simulation tasks, and for experimental work...|$|R
