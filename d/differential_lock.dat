25|$|After having built {{a number}} of prototypes and {{experimental}} vehicles, AvtoVAZ designers launched the first car entirely of their own design, the VAZ-2121 Niva, in 1977. This highly popular and innovative SUV was made with off-road use in mind, featuring a gearbox with a central <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> lever {{as well as a}} low- and high-range selector lever.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{integrated}} active differentials {{are used}} on the Ferrari F430, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, and on the rear wheels in the Acura RL. A version manufactured by ZF is also being offered on the B8 chassis Audi S4 and Audi A4.

25|$|The Range Rover used {{permanent}} four-wheel drive, {{rather than}} the switchable rear-wheel/four-wheel drive on Land Rover Series vehicles, and had a lever for switching ratios on the transfer box for off-road use. Originally, the only gearbox available was a four-speed manual unit, until Fairey overdrive became an option after 1977. A three-speed Chrysler TorqueFlite automatic gearbox became an option in 1982, which was upgraded to a 4-speed ZF box in 1985, coupled to an LT230 transfer box. The other major transmission upgrade in the Range Rover's lifetime was the switch from the LT95 combined four-speed manual gearbox and transfer box to the LT77 five-speed gearbox and separate LT230 transfer box in 1983. The LT230 was later used on both the Defender and Discovery models, but was replaced on the Range Rover by a Borg Warner chain-driven transfer box incorporating an automatic viscous coupling limited slip differential - earlier transmissions had a manual <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> (operated by a vacuum servo on the LT95 and mechanically on the LT230). The LT77 had two major design changes: first an upgrade to larger bearings for the layshaft and new ratios around 1988, then a newly designed synchro hub for third and fourth gear and double synchros for first and second. This {{is also known as}} the suffix H gearbox or LT77s.|$|E

2500|$|Launched in 2001, Defröck is Nishikawa's {{clothing}} line. The {{name comes}} from a play on words, most notably the near-phonetic indifference between [...] "l” and [...] "r” in Japanese. Cars, which Nishikawa likes, use a device called <b>differential</b> <b>lock.</b> Nishikawa's favourite music genre is rock (although he does enjoy various kinds of music). He took the first few syllables of “differential”, changed “lock” into “rock”, and combined the two together to form this name. On a side note, in Gundam SEED, the Defröck label appears on Nishikawa’s character’s mobile suit as a custom sticker.|$|E
2500|$|The 110 was {{launched}} in 1983, and the 90 followed in 1984. From 1984, wind-up windows were fitted (Series models and very early 110s had sliding panels), and a , [...] diesel engine was introduced. This {{was based on the}} earlier [...] engine, but had a more modern fuel-injection system as well as increased capacity. A low compression version of the [...] V8 Range Rover engine transformed performance. It was initially available in the 110 with a Range Rover LT95 four-speed transmission with integral transfer case and vacuum operated <b>differential</b> <b>lock,</b> then later in conjunction with a high strength [...] "Santana" [...] five-speed transmission.|$|E

[...] The {{rear axle}} {{was equipped with}} an Eaton Automatic <b>Differential</b> <b>Lock</b> (ADL) [...] while the front was a standard open differential. The M1008 trucks used open Dana 60 front axles, with the M1028 and M1031 variations often having a Trac-Lok limited slip. In the rear, the M1008s used the GM [...] 10.5" [...] Corporate 14 Bolt Differential with No-Spin lockers (the commercial trade name for the Detroit Locker). Rear axles on M1028A2 and A3 duallies are Dana 70 HD. The axle gear ratios were 4.56:1.|$|E

Often seen with radio sets installed, however the large square tube stock mounts {{prevented}} the rear seat from being lowered. The M1009 was rated for a [...] payload and a [...] towed load. It used the heaviest duty GM springs available for the chassis and the rear axle was a 10-bolt unit.

2500|$|Post-war {{shortages}} {{delayed the}} development of an entirely new tractor. In 1952, the [...] "New Major" [...] entered production with an all new all Ford engine range.The 4D engine was designed and manufactured in UK at Dagenham and was available as Diesel, Petrol or Petrol/Kerosene. The tractor had a 6 speed modified version of the E27N transmission. [...] The driver sat significantly lower, which led to the E27N being nicknamed the 'High Major'. In 1958, - the Power Major - was introduced with 51.8hp and an improved transmission and 'live-drive' hydraulics, and then in 1960 the final version, the Super Major came out with a weight transfer system and <b>differential</b> <b>lock.</b> [...] The Super Major was produced until 1964. These tractors were exported to the US - the first since 1939 - badged as Fords.|$|E

50|$|Note: The {{electronic}} <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> (EDL) {{employed by}} Volkswagen is not — {{as the name}} suggests — a <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> at all. Sensors monitor wheel speeds, and if one is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e., slipping), the EDL system momentarily brakes it.

5000|$|The 6x2 {{variants}} use a Meritor MS 23-185 tractive rear axle, {{and this}} has a maximum capacity of 60 tons. [...] It includes a series <b>differential</b> <b>locking</b> system when used on the VW 25.370 tractor unit.|$|R
50|$|How {{does the}} system perform: When all {{differentials}} are unlocked, the car {{will not be}} able to move if one wheel (front or rear) loses traction (is on ice or raised in the air). When center <b>differential</b> is <b>locked</b> with rear <b>differential</b> unlocked, the car {{will not be able}} to move if one front wheel and one rear wheel lose traction. When rear <b>differential</b> <b>locked</b> with center unlocked, the car {{will not be able to}} move if two rears or one front loses traction. When both center and rear <b>differentials</b> are <b>locked,</b> the car will not be able to move if two rears and one front lose traction.|$|R
50|$|An On&Off Road Package is {{available}} for most markets (now including North America) as of the 2013 model year.

The rear <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> has been discontinued.|$|E
50|$|The {{electronic}} <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> (EDL) {{employed by}} Volkswagen is not, {{as the name}} suggests, a <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> at all. Sensors monitor roadwheel speeds across an individual driven axle, and if one wheel is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e. slipping) the EDL system momentarily brakes it. This effectively transfers power to the other wheel.|$|E
