50|$|The first {{business}} {{to open in}} Ceres was the Wheat Sheaf Inn in September 1850, which became a social centre {{for much of the}} Barrabool district. A second hotel, the Rising Sun, opened in 1853. The Post Office opened on 14 February 1856. In 1856, the village was reported to have the Seidel Bros. vineyard, a blacksmith's forge and quarrier, a physician, a store, a shoemaker, a post office, a butcher, a surgeon, the two hotels, and a second <b>forge.</b> <b>Coal</b> was first discovered at Ceres in 1842, and a shaft sunk in 1854, but despite much excitement economical quantities were never found. A meeting at Ceres on 10 November 1855 agreed to build a cemetery, which subsequently opened as the Barrabool Hills Cemetery (now Highton Cemetery) in modern Highton.|$|E
5000|$|The {{series is}} filmed in Brooklyn, New York. The set, {{referred}} to as [...] "The Forge," [...] is stocked {{with a wide range}} of metalworking equipment, including propane <b>forges,</b> <b>coal</b> <b>forges,</b> grinders, power hammers and hydraulic presses. At the end of each round, the smith whose weapon is judged to be the least satisfactory must surrender it and leave the competition. Medical personnel are present to treat any injuries or other health problems and may, at their discretion, disqualify smiths who are unable to continue safely.|$|R
50|$|The company {{established}} its own {{mechanical engineering}} plant and a <b>forge,</b> operated <b>coal</b> mines and power plant and invested in range of companies in chemical and food processing industry. A branch in Moravsk√° Ostrava {{was set up}} in 1906.|$|R
50|$|In this episode, Martin {{helps to}} {{overhaul}} and later drives a steam locomotive on the Severn Valley Railway, Shropshire, {{in the process}} working on its boiler, safety valves and a wheel. Using Victorian methods, he also lays some track, <b>forges</b> a <b>coal</b> shovel out of wrought iron, and repairs a 100-year-old train driver's pocket watch.|$|R
50|$|Coke and {{charcoal}} may {{be burned}} in the same <b>forges</b> that use <b>coal,</b> but {{since there is no}} need to convert the raw fuel at the heart of the fire (as with coal), the fire is handled differently.|$|R
50|$|Individual smiths and {{specialized}} applications have fostered {{development of a}} variety of forges of this type, from the <b>coal</b> <b>forge</b> described above, to simpler constructions amounting to {{a hole in the ground}} with a pipe leading into it.|$|R

50|$|Ruardean is {{a village}} in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England, {{to the west of}} Cinderford. It is {{situated}} on a hillside with views west towards the mountains of South Wales. Little now remains of the village's industrial history, but once it was a centre for iron ore smelting furnaces, <b>forges</b> and <b>coal</b> mines. The Norman castle, now little more than a mound, commanded the shortest route from Gloucester Castle to the Welsh Marches and the Wye Valley.|$|R
50|$|Across {{the road}} from the Nature area is Foxfire. On this fenced-in property, there is a tipi for Indian lore classes and a {{blacksmith}} shop with a <b>coal</b> <b>forge</b> and three anvils. This is home of the Mountain Man program, where scouts can learn blacksmithing, woodcarving, and tomahawk throwing.|$|R
50|$|Machen was {{a village}} {{rooted in the}} iron and coal {{industries}} stretching from the 17th Century. Though little trace remains, the village {{was the site of}} the Machen <b>Forge</b> and several <b>coal</b> mines. A local history trail visits some of these sites. Machen Forge was an early adopter of the Osmond process for the production of wrought iron.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2005, the company's {{name was}} changed from [...] "National Thermal Power Corporation Limited" [...] to [...] "NTPC Limited". The {{primary reason for}} this change was the company's foray into hydro and nuclear based power {{generation}} along with backward integration by coal mining. In 2006, it entered into an agreement with Government of Sri Lanka to set up two units of 250 MW each in Trincomalee in Sri Lanka.During 2008 and 2011, NTPC entered into Joint Ventures with BHEL, Bharat <b>Forge,</b> NHPC, <b>Coal</b> India, SAIL, NMDC and NPCIL to expand its business of power generation. By the end of 2010, its installed capacity crossed 31,000 MW.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of a gas forge is ease of use, particularly for a novice. A gas forge is simple to operate compared to <b>coal</b> <b>forges,</b> and the fire produced is clean and consistent. They are less versatile, as the fire cannot be reshaped to accommodate large or unusually shaped pieces;. It is also difficult to heat a small section of a piece. A common misconception is that gas forges cannot produce enough heat to enable forge-welding, but a well designed gas forge is hot enough for any task.|$|R
5000|$|One {{of these}} bladesmiths was William F. Moran, who forged his knives using a <b>coal</b> <b>forge</b> {{in the manner}} of a {{blacksmith}} using a hammer and anvil to shape the steel. Moran began trying to revive the ancient process of forging Damascus steel in the late 1960s. However, no living bladesmith knew the exact techniques and without a recipe for the process, it was in danger of being lost; through trial and error he taught himself pattern welding and referred to his end product as [...] "Damascus steel".|$|R
5000|$|Placements abroad {{can be a}} {{means for}} {{achieving}} intercultural understanding, learning how to live peacefully together in Europe {{and in the world}} and develop a sense of [...] "European Citizenship" [...] as opposed to a strictly nationalist outlook (corresponding to the initial thoughts of Jean Monnet when <b>forging</b> the European <b>Coal</b> and Steel Union in 1951 - as a means to promote peace and understanding in a war-torn Europe). Latterly, this discourse has also been used in connection with the fight against racism and xenophobia. An example refers the activities of the Franco-German Youth Office.|$|R

5000|$|Song Yingxing {{wrote that}} ancient rulers of early China cast {{inscriptions}} of writing onto bronze tripods {{since this was}} a much more durable method of preserving the written record than using the perishable materials found in books and scrolls. He noted that musical and announcing bells of higher quality were made of different copper alloys, while those of lesser quality were made of iron. He also provided weighted formulas of different metal compositions for certain bells, for example, the casting a large bell in an audience hall or pavilion that required 47,000 catties of copper, 4,000 catties of tin, 50 oz. of gold, and 120 oz. of silver in its composition. In the smelting process, long pits for the liquid metal flow had to be dug, having a drymold construction of lime and mortar that was dried and covered in ox fat and beeswax. Then he noted the following process of pounded earth and charcoal powder that was screened and mixed into a mud paste that would be gradually spread {{on the surface of}} the wax several inches thick. When dried and heated so that the melted fat and wax could flow out entirely by means of apertures at the base, the bell or tripod could be cast in the vacated cavity between the core and the mold. With the individual casting process for bells and tripods, Song Yingxing also described the intricate individual casting processes for making cooking pots and pans, metal statues, metal barrels of cannons, metallic mirrors, and different metallic coins of copper or iron. He described the processes of hammer forging with the initial casting of an anvil, and noted that in the heating process of <b>forging,</b> <b>coal</b> accounted for 70% of the fuel, charcoal taking the rest at 30%. He also outlined the quench-hardening process of rapid cooling in clear water immediately after iron and steel products were forged. He outlined the different types of knives, axes, hoes, file tools, awls, saws, wood chisels, anchors, and metal needles that could be forged and produced. For the making of the finest swords, he said, they are coated with steel after [...] "a hundred smeltings," [...] but the core of the sword was still made of wrought iron; this was because a sword made entirely of steel would easily break when making hard strikes.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a typical}} <b>coal</b> <b>forge,</b> a firepot will be {{centered}} {{in a flat}} hearth. The tuyere will enter the firepot at the bottom. In operation, the hot core of the fire will be a ball of burning coke in and above the firepot. The heart of the fire will be surrounded by a layer of hot but not burning coke. Around the unburnt coke will be a transitional layer of coal being transformed into coke by {{the heat of the}} fire. Surrounding all is a ring or horseshoe-shaped layer of raw coal, usually kept damp and tightly packed to maintain the shape of the fire's heart and to keep the coal from burning directly so that it [...] "cooks" [...] into coke first.|$|R
5000|$|Moran {{was born}} on a dairy farm near Lime Kiln, Maryland in 1925. There he learned the craft of blacksmithing {{by trial and error}} using an old <b>coal</b> <b>forge</b> that he found on the farm and made his first knife at the age of 12; by the age of 14 he was making knives to sell. [...] As a {{teenager}} he taught himself how to forge a blade, obtaining advice from local blacksmiths (although in a 2003 interview with The Washington Post, Moran said he was [...] "getting all the wrong answers" [...] from them) and by the 1950s he was publishing a catalog and selling his forged blades. [...] In 1960 he sold the family farm to become a full-time knife maker.|$|R
5000|$|Matter-Additive, Matter-Preserving, and Matter-Subtractive [...] "Manufacturing" [...] {{can proceed}} in 16 ways: The work may {{be held in}} a hand or a clamp; the tool may be held in a hand (the other hand) or a clamp; the power can come from the hand(s) holding the tool and/or the work, or from some {{external}} source, including a foot treadle by the same worker, or a motor without limitation; and the control can come from the hand(s) holding the tool and/or the work, or from some other source, including computer numerical control. With two choices for each of four parameters, the types are enumerated to sixteen types of Manufacturing, where Matter-Additive might mean painting on canvas as readily as it might mean 3D printing under computer control, Matter-Preserving might mean <b>forging</b> at the <b>coal</b> fire as readily as stamping license plates, and Matter-Subtracting might mean casually whittling a pencil point as readily as it might mean precision grinding the final form of a laser deposited turbine blade.|$|R
50|$|Because few {{methods of}} {{precisely}} measuring temperature existed until modern times, temperature was usually judged {{by watching the}} tempering colors of the metal. Tempering often consisted of heating above a charcoal or <b>coal</b> <b>forge,</b> or by fire, so holding the work at exactly the right temperature for the correct amount of time was usually not possible. Tempering was usually performed by slowly, evenly overheating the metal, as judged by the color, and then immediately cooling, either in open air or by immersing in water. This produced much the same effect as heating at the proper temperature for {{the right amount of}} time, and avoided embrittlement by tempering within a short time period. However, although tempering-color guides exist, this method of tempering usually requires a good amount of practice to perfect, because the final outcome depends on many factors, including the composition of the steel, the speed at which it was heated, the type of heat source (oxidizing or carburizing), the cooling rate, oil films or impurities on the surface, and many other circumstances which vary from smith to smith or even from job to job. The thickness of the steel also plays a role. With thicker items, it becomes easier to heat only the surface to the right temperature, before the heat can penetrate through. However, very thick items {{may not be able to}} harden all the way through during quenching.|$|R
5000|$|During the 20th century various gases (natural gas, acetylene, etc.) {{have also}} come {{to be used as}} fuels for {{blacksmith}}ing. While these are fine for blacksmithing iron, special care must be taken when using them to blacksmith steel. Each time a piece of steel is heated, there is a tendency for the carbon content to leave the steel (decarburization). This can leave a piece of steel with an effective layer of unhardenable iron on its surface. In a traditional charcoal or <b>coal</b> <b>forge,</b> the fuel is really just carbon. In a properly regulated charcoal/coal fire, the air in and immediately around the fire should be a reducing atmosphere. In this case, and at elevated temperatures, there is a tendency for vaporized carbon to soak into steel and iron, counteracting or negating the decarburizing tendency. This is similar to the process by which a case of steel is developed on a piece of iron in preparation for case hardening.A renewed interest in blacksmithing occurred as part of the trend in [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] and [...] "self-sufficiency" [...] that occurred during the 1970s. Currently there are many books, organizations and individuals working to help educate the public about blacksmithing, including local groups of smiths who have formed clubs, with some of those smiths demonstrating at historical sites and living history events. Some modern blacksmiths who produce decorative metalwork refer to themselves as artist-blacksmiths. In 1973 the Artists Blacksmiths‚Äô Association of North America was formed with 27 members. By 2013 it had almost 4000 members. Likewise the British Artist Blacksmiths Association was created in 1978, with 30 charter members and had 2013 about 600 members and publish for members a quarterly magazine.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{hundreds}} of tools which can be used. They are generally made by the jeweller/crafts person. They are typically made from bars of tool steel, which is forged and tempered at the tip. These hardened steel punches may be purchased by a supplier, but the specialized punches are made by the jeweler or special ordered to suit a particular design. [...] A saw {{can be used to}} cut designs into the tip for making patterns, or the tool can be hammered onto a patterned surface, which will indent the tip. The end of the tool which is to be hammered should be bevelled to allow for expansion of the metal from repeated hammering. Some of the main styles of tool include: Liners, planishers, matting, and doming. Liners have thin tips, which are slightly rounded. If they are too thin they will cut the metal. They are used in the initial marking out of the design, and in the finishing stages to refine any thin outlines. Planishers have smooth, flat tips which are used for pushing out large, flat areas of metal. Matting tools have patterns cut into them, and provide detail to areas of the design. Matting tools can also be made by filing a thin line around a steel bar, hardening it, then snapping it. This will result in a fine grain pattern. Doming tools push out rounded areas of metal, and can either be round or oval, quite pointed or almost flat. An oxyacetylene torch, <b>coal</b> <b>forge</b> or propane forge is required for heating the steel sufficiently for forging. The more tools available, the easier it is to create a detailed, accurate piece.|$|R
