5|$|The 407ETR is contractually {{responsible}} for maintaining <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> levels as justification for increasing tolls, but conduct their own traffic studies. Despite increased usage, parallel roads that Highway407 {{was intended to}} supplement continue to grow congested, forcing the MTO to revisit costly widening projects of Highway401 and the QEW.|$|E
5|$|Employment {{possibilities}} within El Hatillo – {{a bedroom}} community of Caracas – are reduced; {{businesses in the}} municipality are almost strictly commercial, and the economy has not expanded in other directions. Office space underdevelopment has resulted {{from a lack of}} land for large scale office construction, making it costly to locate large offices or businesses in the area. Those seeking employment in offices or larger businesses must look outside of El Hatillo, contributing to the <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> to, from, and in El Hatillo.|$|E
5|$|Lehman Brothers sold One Times Square in 1997 to the Jamestown, L.P. for $117 million. Filings {{related to}} the sale {{revealed}} that the billboards on the tower had been generating a net revenue of $7 million yearly, representing a 300% profit. With growing tourism and <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> in the Times Square area (with a yearly average of over 100 million pedestriansalongside its prominence in media coverage of New Year's festivities, seen by a wide audience yearly), annual revenue from the signs grew to over $23 million by the year 2012rivaling London's Piccadilly Circus as the most valuable public advertising space in the world.|$|E

5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} surrounds the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. It has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane, and like that structure, features ribosomes attached to the surface. The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear pores that perforate the {{nuclear envelope}}. These pores are about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some {{to pass through the}} membrane, but not others. Since the nuclear pores are located in an area of <b>high</b> <b>traffic,</b> they {{play an important role in}} the physiology of cells. The space between the outer and inner membranes is called the perinuclear space and is joined with the lumen of the rough ER.|$|E
5|$|On 3February, {{the head}} of the State Emergency Service (SES) and then-Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen toured {{northern}} Queensland to inspect damage. The government of Australia vowed to assist by providing financial and emergency services, also offering to provide aid to banana and sugar cane farmers who suffered losses as a result of Winifred. Two government helicopters were sent shortly thereafter, assessing the severity of damage, evacuating residents, and delivering food. Bjelke-Petersen later expressed anger at the federal government for having increased the threshold for disaster relief before raising loans, and also stated that the Federal Minister for Primary Industry, John Kerin, had no right to accompany him on his visit to northern Queensland, only offering to discuss an offer provided that the federal government was willing to provide financial assistance. Approximately 500volunteers for the SES were deployed the same day, reinstating electrical and other essential services, evacuating regional citizens, delivering bread to numerous towns, and sending 700tarpaulins to shield roofless houses. Rescue and relief work was hindered by <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> on telephone networks, forcing Telecom to cease calls between Townsville and Ingham.|$|E

25|$|Difficult {{political}} situations such {{as civil}} war and social conflict are push factors for migration and trafficking. A study reported that larger countries, the richest and the poorest countries, and countries with restricted press freedom are {{likely to engage in}} more sex trafficking. Specifically, being in a transitional economy made a country nineteen {{times more likely to be}} ranked in the <b>highest</b> <b>trafficking</b> category, and gender inequalities in a country's labor market also correlated with <b>higher</b> <b>trafficking</b> rates.|$|R

25|$|During {{business}} days in most major cities, traffic congestion reaches great intensity at predictable {{times of the}} day due to the large number of vehicles using the road at the same time. This phenomenon is called rush hour or peak hour, although the period of <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> intensity often exceeds one hour.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, {{a replica}} of the Angel de la Independencia was brought to Zócalo as a way of {{spreading}} out the protesters from the original Angel site. This is because the original site of the Angel is located in a financial area, with a <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> flow, making policing more difficult than the Zócalo.|$|E

25|$|Fort Washington Way was {{originally}} designed to accommodate 90,000 vehicles per day of local traffic. By July 1998, however, traffic had risen to 120,000 vehicles per day. The highway was the most crash-prone mile of urban freeway in Ohio, due to <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> volumes and the system of 14 interwoven entrance and exit ramps, many {{of them on the}} left.|$|E
25|$|US 20 {{continues}} in an east-southeast direction {{through the town}} center of Bloomingdale and becomes six lanes at the Bloomingdale-Roselle border. It maintains six lanes through a very <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> corridor to Interstate 290 and onwards to Illinois Route 53 before it returns to four lanes while serving downtown Addison, paralleling Interstate 290 to the north. Past Elmhurst, the road overlaps Interstate 290 for a mile.|$|E
