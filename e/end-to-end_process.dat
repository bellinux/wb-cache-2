[...] In order to automate these processes, connectors {{are needed to}} fit these systems/solutions together with a data exchange layer to transfer the information. A Process Driven Messaging Service is an option for optimizing your data exchange layer. By mapping your <b>end-to-end</b> <b>process</b> workflow, you can build an integration between individual platforms using a Process Driven Messaging Platform. Process Driven Messaging Service gives you the logic to build your process by using triggers, jobs and workflows. Some companies uses an API where you build workflow/s and then connect various systems or mobile devices. You build the process, creating workflows in the API where the workflow in the API acts as a data exchange layer.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{companies}} need information systems to implement their business <b>processes</b> <b>end-to-end.</b> BPM systems are promising candidates for that, {{because they are}} highly adaptable due to their business process model-driven operation mode. <b>End-to-end</b> <b>processes</b> contain different types of sub-processes that are either procedural, data-driven or business rule-based. Modern BPM systems support modeling notations for all these types of sub-processes. Moreover, <b>end-to-end</b> <b>processes</b> contain parts of shadow processing, so consequently, they must be supported in a performant way, too. BPMN {{seems to be the}} adequate notation for modeling these parts due to its procedural nature. Further, BPMN provides several elements that enable the modeling of parallel executions which are very interesting for accelerating shadow processing parts of the process. The present paper will observe the limitations and potentials of BPM systems for a high-performance execution of BPMN models representing shadow processing parts of a business process. ...|$|R
