5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern {{wrote a paper on}} game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.|$|E

When Cipriani, Napoleon's major-domo died, Boys and his junior chaplain buried the man, a Catholic, according to the rites of the Protestant Church. Napoleon was astonished when he heard of <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> a priest would not have done so much for a Protestant. As a token of appreciation of their conduct Napoleon desired to give the two chaplains a present. A snuffbox was purchased in Jamestown and offered to Boys, but was refused owing to the severe penalties attached to any acceptance of gifts from the exile.|$|E

Haughey was {{involved}} in the drafting of this {{at the time he was}} in office and had agreed to potential scenarios for improving the political situation of Northern Ireland. However, on publication, Haughey rejected <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> the only possible solution was a United Ireland. This statement was criticised by the other leaders who forged the New-Ireland Forum, John Hume, Garret FitzGerald and Dick Spring. Desmond O'Malley supported the Forum report and criticised Haughey's ambiguous position, accusing him of stifling debate. At a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting to discuss the report, the whip was removed from O'Malley, which meant he was no longer a Fianna Fáil TD. Ironically when Haughey returned to power he embraced the Anglo-Irish Agreement that had developed from the New Ireland Forum Report.|$|E

That was not what I cared about... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that [...] "Sequelism has become an annoying thing. [...] I don't think Francis Coppola should have done Godfather III because Godfather II was quite great. [...] When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much".|$|E

500|$|Clarkson has {{cited the}} color red as the album's only theme. A color {{traditionally}} associated with Christmas, she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays. Wanting to stray {{away from her}} usual pop sound, she described Wrapped in Reds music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz, country and Memphis soul. She recalled: [...] "What's cool about Christmas albums is you can do jazz, rock and roll, you can do pop, you can do blues, like {{you can do all}} that stuff and it works—cause it's all classic and it's Christmasy sounding." [...] She also noted that the album's multitude of styles positively contributed to her artistic goal, saying: [...] "My best friend from childhood heard <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'This is what you sound like, before everything else.' And I agree, It's my core sound. Back in the day, when artists came out with things like [...] "Fall to Pieces" [...] and [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", those songs transcended genres.

500|$|Townshend thought McInnerney, {{a fellow}} {{follower}} of Baba, {{would be a}} suitable choice to do the cover. As recording was near completion, McInnerney received a number of cassettes with completed songs and a brief outline for the story, which he immediately recognised as being based on Baba's teachings. He wanted to try and convey the world of a deaf, dumb and blind boy, and decided to [...] "depict a kind of breaking out of a certain restricted plane into freedom." [...] The finished cover contained a blue and white web of clouds, a fist punching into the black void {{to the left of}} it. The inner triptych, meanwhile, showed a hand reaching out to light and a light shining in a dark void. Townshend was too busy finishing the recording to properly approve the artwork, but Lambert strongly approved of <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> it would work. The final step was for record company approval, who decided the cover was more sensible than The Who Sell Out, though making one concession that pictures of the band should appear on the cover.

500|$|Soundgarden {{utilized}} alternative tunings and {{odd time}} signatures on {{several of the}} album's songs. [...] "Spoonman", [...] "Black Hole Sun", [...] "Let Me Drown" [...] and [...] "Kickstand" [...] were performed in drop D tuning while [...] "Mailman" [...] and [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] employed CGDGBE tuning. Some songs used more unorthodox tunings: [...] "My Wave" [...] and [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] are both in an EEBBBB tuning. [...] "Head Down" [...] and [...] "Half" [...] used CGCGGE tuning and [...] "Like Suicide" [...] is performed in DGDGBC tuning. Soundgarden's use of odd time signatures was varied as well; [...] "My Wave" [...] uses 5/4, [...] "Fell On Black Days" [...] is in 6/4, [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] is played in 15/8, [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] and [...] "Spoonman" [...] both alternate between 7/4 and 4/4 sections, and [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] is in 4/4 with instrumental sections in 9/4.

[...] Corgan played the self-recorded demo to {{producer}} Butch Vig and {{to the rest of}} his band, all of whom responded positively. [...] "Today" [...] already had a chord progression and a melody, but Corgan felt there needed to be an opening riff to the song. One day, [...] "out of the blue, I heard the opening lick note for note in my head", Corgan said. [...] "When I added the opening riff, it completely changed the character of the song. Suddenly, I had a song that was starting out quiet and then got very loud." [...] Soon afterwards, Virgin Records executives were sent to check up on the band after hearing about their problems, but were pleased with the demo. The reaction from the executives only served to put more stress on Corgan; as a result, he recorded most of the guitar and bass guitar parts himself, including on the finished version of [...] "Today".|$|E

Rumors spread about kids that died trying to pass the curve surrounding the area. Clark created a beat which sounded unlike what Bruce had initially expected, leading him to write a song about a haunted pond hidden in the woods. Bruce describes the production of [...] "Imma Kill U" [...] as similar to that of early albums by Ice Cube and Public Enemy. Bruce states that Utsler initially hated [...] "Juggalo Island" [...] when they began recording <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that it was [...] "too soft" [...] for Insane Clown Posse. Bruce maintained his confidence in the song, but promised Utsler that if he still felt the same way after the song was completed, it would be left off the album. As the recording continued, Utsler began to like the track more, and later praised the song in a phone conversation.|$|E
