50|$|The {{development}} of color theory by Michel Eugène Chevreul and others {{by the late}} 19th century {{played a pivotal role}} in shaping the Neo-Impressionist style. Ogden Rood’s book, Modern Chromatics, with Applications to Art and Industry, acknowledged the different behaviors exhibited by colored light and colored pigment. While the mixture of the former created a white or gray color, that of the latter produced a dark, murky color. As painters, Neo-Impressionists had to deal with colored pigments, so to avoid the dullness, they devised a system of pure-color juxtaposition. Mixing of colors was not necessary. The effective utilization of pointillism facilitated in eliciting a distinct luminous effect, and from a distance, the dots came together as a whole <b>displaying</b> maximum <b>brilliance</b> and conformity to actual light conditions.|$|R

Alex grabs onto Sam and takes his power from him via sexual intercourse mid-flight, causing them both to fall. Alex lands in a skip and survives the fall but Sam is less than fortunate, hitting the pavement with immense force. When the gang enter the community centre (except for Jess, who stays outside with Leo), they are then attacked by Karen who uses her camouflage and a knife in tandem with each other. As she is about to kill Alex, Finn uses his telekinesis to launch a piano at her in an unusual <b>display</b> of <b>brilliance.</b> Helen then appears, intent on killing the gang before Rudy Two intervenes. After a brief exchange Rudy Two rejoins Rudy who proceeds to tell Helen that together [...] "they are twice as strong" [...] (although this really has no truth).

Helen electrocutes Rudy but is fried herself as her electric current travels back to her through Rudy's stream of urine. Helen dies quickly but Rudy lays gravely injured in the gang's arms. Rudy gives Jess a scratch card, having won a quid on it, and tells Jess to look after the baby before dying himself.|$|R

40|$|In his 1922 modernist {{masterpiece}} Ulysses, James Joyce <b>displays</b> his stylistic <b>brilliance</b> {{by using}} a new, different style {{in each of the}} last 8 of the book’s 18 chapters (which he called episodes). In the 16 th episode, unofficially entitled “Eumaeus, ” Joyce’s narrative is left to his main character, Leopold Bloom, whose long harangue to Stephen Daedalus, very late into the night, is strewn with clichéd idioms. Several critics have identified a few handfuls of them, and one estimated there might be as many as 700, but none has tried to identify them all, and none was able to fully explain why Joyce himself described the “Eumaeus ” narrative as “rilassatta, ” or “tired ” prose. Close reading reveals the extraordinary extent of Joyce’s cliché project. Indeed, there is hardly a phrase in “Eumaeus ” that isn’t a cliché. “Eumaeus ” is a thesaurus of Dublin cliché in 1904, and Joyce was a phraseologist avant la lettre. My phraseological analysis led me to construct a database (unpublished) of at least 2561 “Eumaeus ” clichés, along with fields for Lexical, Semantic, Stylistic, etc., attributes for each cliché. The Semantic and Stylistic analysis is crucial for translators, because Joyce’s textual drama depends upon the collision of disparate Semantic and Stylistic levels as the discourse moves from cliché to cliché. Bloom is in fact a linguistically incompetent autodidact striving for stylistic effects above his native register. This makes “Eumaeus” the most difficult chapter for translators in all of English literature, and more so because such a large percentag...|$|R

40|$|Ave Maria from OTELLO by Giuseppe Verdi (1813 – 1901) Performed by Alexis Raymond Faculty Mentor: Dr. Louise Lofquist In {{the fourth}} act of Giuseppe Verdi’s opera Otello, Desdemona {{suspects}} that her husband, Otello, {{is going to}} kill her. She kneels before a depiction of the Virgin Mary and begins to pray. Her prayer acts as a plea for forgiveness, not only for herself, but also for all of God 2 ̆ 7 s children. She prays for acceptance to those who are loyal to the Lord, and those who are not, those who are young and old, weak and strong, and all those remaining. The aria foreshadows her murder when she asks for the Virgin Mary to be there in the presence of death, the death that will be brought by the hand of her husband Otello immediately following the prayer. The words she speaks are touching, but it is her final call to 2 ̆ 2 Ave 2 ̆ 2 and her last 2 ̆ 2 Amen 2 ̆ 2 that make the piece truly heartbreaking. Addio, fiorito asil from MADAMA BUTTERFLY by Giacomo Puccini (1854 - 1924) Performed by Alex Papandrea Faculty Mentor: Dr. Henry Price Giacomo Puccini 2 ̆ 7 s Madama Butterfly has been a staple in operatic repertoire since the early 20 th century. The opera <b>displays</b> the <b>brilliance</b> of Puccini 2 ̆ 7 s music, specifically in layering melodic phrases with certain harmonic textures to enhance the plot 2 ̆ 7 s intricate drama. In Madama Butterfly the young Japanese girl Cio Cio San (Butterfly) falls in love and marry Lieutenant Benjamin Pinkerton, who leaves Cio Cio San for an American woman after leaving Japan. Throughout the opera, Pinkerton sees Butterfly as a possession rather than a person - something he doesn 2 ̆ 7 t truly realize until he leaves her behind. In Pinkerton 2 ̆ 7 s aria Addio fiorito asil (Goodbye, flowered refuge), Pinkerton avoids saying goodbye to Cio Cio San and cowardly flees from her home in remorse and regret. Riez, allez from DON QUICHOTTE by Jules Massenet (1842 - 1912) Performed by Fernando Grimaldo Faculty Mentor: Dr. Henry Price In the aria Riez, allez from Jules Massenet’s opera Don Quichotte, Don Quichotte’s manservant Sancho Panza defends his master from the cruelty of the townspeople. Based on Le chevalier de la longue figure, a play by the poet Jacques Le Lorrain, Don Quichotte tells the tragic story of a noble knight journeying to obtain a necklace for Dulcinée, his love. After Don Quichotte successfully completes this mission, Dulcinee rejects him, and Sancho has to defend his master as the townspeople mock him. This aria demonstrates Massenet’s ability to effectively portray drama through the vocal line and the powerful accompaniment. His romantic style fills the music with passion and is theatrical in its intensity...|$|R
