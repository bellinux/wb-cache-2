40|$|Abstract. The {{industrial}} {{solid wastes}} mainly include mining tailings and industrial slags. Their typical applications in glass-ceramics are reviewed. The compositional {{design of the}} glass-ceramics based on the compositional features of wastes and the routes to increase the percentage of wastes in the <b>glass</b> <b>batches</b> are emphasized. To increase the addition of industrial solid wastes in the glass preparation {{is one of the}} key factors influencing the utilization of the wastes. One way to achieve this is to apply different wastes with compositional complementarity in <b>glass</b> <b>batches.</b> A few successful examples are summarized in this paper to provide good references for the further related research...|$|R
25|$|Following the <b>glass</b> <b>batch</b> {{preparation}} and mixing, {{the raw materials}} are transported to the furnace. Soda-lime glass for mass production is melted in gas fired units. Smaller scale furnaces for specialty glasses include electric melters, pot furnaces, and day tanks.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} description of the layered structure developing in the walls of Egyptian Late Bronze Age glass-making vessels, and in similar vessels successfully replicated in laboratory experiments. The analyses show that this layered discoloration and change in ceramic composition is due to the interaction of the <b>glass</b> <b>batch</b> with the vessel during firing. The formation of this visually striking and easy to recognise pattern is due to the chloride content of primary <b>glass</b> <b>batches</b> and does not occur in vessels used to re-melt existing glass. Thus, we argue that these discolorations can be used as a reliable and easy field guide to identify glassmaking waste among Late Bronze Age ceramic assemblages, hopefully increasing the currently very small number of identified LBA glassmaking workshops...|$|R

To simulate the melting behavior of these batches, the shear and flow behaviors, respectively the effective viscosities, of the granular <b>glass</b> <b>batches</b> are required particularly for the low temperature range up to 800 °C.

40|$|A novel optical {{measuring}} method is described {{which was used}} for the density measurement of model samples of <b>glass</b> <b>batch</b> during the melting process. It used a sample volume of some 1000 mm(3) which was sufficiently large to suppress single particle effects. Shape changes of batch samples during heating were taken into account by the optical method. Volumetric changes of soda-lime-silica <b>glass</b> <b>batch</b> were monitored between room temperature and 1100 degreesC. Initially a sintering stage was observed showing self similar reduction in the sample volume. Thereafter, the sample shape approached the equilibrium surface of drops. This was accompanied by a large increase in volume, which was attributed to the formation of gas bubbles within the batch samples. A strong influence of heating rate and composition on this volume increase was observed...|$|R
50|$|The first <b>glass</b> <b>batch</b> did not melt properly, and the {{stoneware}} crucible that Littleton {{had made}} to hold the molten glass in the furnace broke apart in the intense heat. Labino suggested that they melt the glass directly in the furnace; he then directed {{the conversion of the}} pot furnace into a small day tank. Instead of trying to melt another load of <b>glass</b> <b>batch,</b> Labino re-charged the furnace with the low-melting formula #475 glass marbles that he had developed for Johns-Manville for the production of fiberglass. The marbles, which melted at a relatively low temperature, produced glass that was malleable enough to blow. This enabled the workshop to continue and, with the craft's technique demonstrated by two retired industrial glassblowers, Harvey Leafgreen and Jim Nelson, participants blew glass around the clock.|$|R

50|$|If the <b>glass</b> <b>batch</b> is used {{to create}} a large massive block instead of pre-shaping it as it cools, the result may then be carved into smaller items {{in the same manner as}} stone.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the Fe 3 � /Fe 2 � ratio on the crystallization of iron-rich glasses was investigated in this study. The <b>glass</b> <b>batches</b> were made from two hazardous industrial wastes: mud (goethite and jarosite) originating from the zinc hydrometallurgical process and electric arc furnace dust (EAFD). Glass compositions were prepared by adding different percentages of carbon powder. The crystallization process was investigated by a combined thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis technique, in air or nitrogen atmospheres, using powder and bulk glass samples. The crystalline phases formed, i. e., pyroxene and spinels, and their relative ratio were determined by X-ray diffractometry. The experimental results indicated that melting temperature and crystallization behavior were influenced by the initial Fe 3 � /Fe 2 � ratio and {{by the amount of}} carbon added to the <b>glass</b> <b>batch.</b> For goethite and jarosite glass compositions, decreasing the Fe 3 � /Fe 2 � ratio increased the crystallization rate by favoring magnetite formation. For EAFD glass compositions, the addition of carbon to the batch inhibited chromite–magnetite spinel formation and favored the attainment of an amorphous glassy phase. I...|$|R
40|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>batch</b> melting {{has been}} studied by many {{researchers}} on various scales and under various conditions but no comprehensive understanding has been reached. In view of this situation, {{a major part of}} this work was devoted to the improvement of five new experimental methods suitable for the investigation of batch melting. These are: conductometry, thermal diffusivity, heating microsopy, batch free time (BFT) and weight loss measurement. Firstly, as for the development of conductometry, three meaningful ways to present batch reactions in terms of "DTA", "voltage drop", and "electrical conductivity" were concluded. It was also possible to determine the duration of stages characterized by foaming. Secondly, for thermal diffusivity, an optimized output signals at a frequency of 50 Hz with time interval of 150 s was applied. It showed good measurment results. As a conclusion, the grain-to-grain contact in model calculations should be taken into account by a dimensionless shape factor of 2. 5 to 3. 5. Local conductometry combined with temperature measurement allowed to measure simultaueously the electrical conductivity and the local temperature in a melting batch. The measurement of the local thermal diffusivity was performed by an evaluation of the runtime of a periodically generated heat pulse. Thirdly, for the heating microscope, a new way to present the effect of gas release from <b>glass</b> <b>batches</b> prior to refining was developed. It was found that minor batch additions additions have a large influence. Fourthly, the BFT results show that the reaction behavior of container flint and green <b>glass</b> <b>batches</b> was more sluggish than that of crystal <b>glass</b> <b>batches.</b> By observation through a silica tube furnace, the beginning of batch reactions with cullets at the surface deep into the glass melt were observed. After 2 minutes foam was formed and decreaed within 10 minutes. Finally, weight loss determination for samples up 200 g was developed. It was found that the mass loss of soda ash detected in a vertical tube furnace started at a lower temperature and was completed at a higher temperature than suggested by the results measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These new characterization methods not only open concepts for the presentation and interpretation of batch reactions, but also close the experimental gap between conventional lab scale characterization and the behavior actually observed in industrial production...|$|R

5000|$|... "Fire-polished" [...] faceted beads are a less {{expensive}} alternative to hand-cut faceted glass or crystal. They derive their name from {{the second half of}} a two-part process: first, the <b>glass</b> <b>batch</b> is poured into round bead molds, then they are faceted with a grinding wheel. The faceted beads are then poured onto a tray and briefly reheated just long enough to melt the surface, [...] "polishing" [...] out any minor surface irregularities from the grinding wheel.|$|R
25|$|Another common glass {{ingredient}} is crushed alkali {{glass or}} 'cullet' ready for recycled glass. The recycled glass saves on {{raw materials and}} energy. Impurities in the cullet can lead to product and equipment failure. Fining agents such as sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, or antimony oxide may be added {{to reduce the number}} of air bubbles in the <b>glass</b> mixture. <b>Glass</b> <b>batch</b> calculation is the method by which the correct raw material mixture is determined to achieve the desired glass composition.|$|R

30|$|The {{results of}} the {{electron}} microprobe (SEM-WDS) compositional analyses of 59 samples of transparent glass from the Jebel Khalid Acropolis are reported as oxides in Table  1. Ancient glass was typically made of silica from sand or quartz pebbles, combined with a soda flux derived from either plant ash or mineral soda (natron), and lime as a stabiliser [3, 22, 51, 54, 61].

30|$|The {{majority}} of sands contain iron as an impurity at usually less than 1  % [33 : p. 36 – 41].

The colouring effects of iron are complex, depending on its oxidation–reduction equilibrium. Colours produced include blue, green, yellow and brown [2 : pp. 143, 155, 66 : pp. 89 ff, 119 – 120].|$|R
40|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>batch</b> from {{a bottle}} {{manufacturing}} facility was sampled at twelve different times during a year. The quality of the bottles produced from this batch was investigated and correlated with the chemical composition of the glass. It {{was found that the}} cords, devitrification and density directly affect the efficiency of the products. Increasing the AI,OJ and Na,O concentration in the glass inhibited the formation of cords and crystal glass. On the other hand, increased levels of silica (SiO,) and calcium oxide (CaO) favored the formation of wollastonite (CaSiOJ) crystals...|$|R

40|$|The kinetic {{aspects of}} batch melting related to grain size, primary melt formation, gas liberation, and quartz {{dissolution}} {{can only be}} characterized by performing laboratory experiments, whereas the thermodynamic aspects can be quantified theoretically. One approach {{to close the gap}} between laboratory and industrial practice is scaling up experiments from the milligram to the kilogram range. In the micro scale (less than 150 mg sample), physical and chemical reactions of one component, as well as binary and ternary systems, can be observed through the differential thermal analysis (DTA), coupled with the thermo-gravimetry instrument (TG). Experiments at the mesoscale are: thermal-optical observations (30 g batch), conductometry (200 g batch), modified batch-free time (50 g batch and 250 g cullet), and kilogram 10 kg tests in which 4 kg batch and 7 kg cullet are involved. The present study aims to investigate whether these methods could be applied to free alkali and B 2 O 3 containing <b>glass</b> <b>batches.</b> The investigated system were the eutectic CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (CAS) and CaO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (CMAS) based E-glass combined with various B 2 O 3 content. The onset of melting or primary melt formation in free alkali <b>glass</b> <b>batches</b> is generated by its eutectic melting, while in soda-lime-silica batch, the onset of melting corresponds to physical melting of soda ash. The last part of the present paper is feasibility study of alternative B 2 O 3 carriers applied in boron containing <b>glass</b> <b>batches.</b> Conventional borax pentahydrate is one of the substance in the list of SVHC (Substance of Very High Concern) under EU REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization of Chemical substances) regulation. For borosilicate batches, no significant impact is observed between the conventional and alternative B 2 O 3 carrier. Ulexite as alternative B 2 O 3 carrier shows kinetic advantages in E-glass and insulation wool glass in terms of early onset of melting and short foaming decay, respectively. However, these advantages could not be seen during industrial trial in insulation wool glass melter tank, due to insufficient ulexite data. Both borax pentahydrate and ulexite batches demonstrate similar behavior in respects to energy consumptions. Furthermore, since ulexite is beneficiated in finely ground powder, it contributes to higher emission level after filtration in an electrostatic precipitator equipment...|$|R
