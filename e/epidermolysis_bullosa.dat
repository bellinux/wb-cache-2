25|$|Missense {{mutations}} or nonsynonymous mutations are {{types of}} point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to cause substitution {{of a different}} amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as <b>Epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa,</b> sickle-cell disease, and SOD1-mediated ALS.|$|E
25|$|TALEN {{has also}} been {{utilized}} experimentally to correct the genetic errors that underlie disease. For example, {{it has been used}} in vitro to correct the genetic defects that cause disorders such as sickle cell disease, xeroderma pigmentosum, and <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa.</b> Recently, it was shown that TALEN can be used as tools to harness the immune system to fight cancers; TALEN-mediated targeting can generate T cells that are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs and show anti-tumor activity.|$|E

500|$|The American Cream Draft {{is a rare}} {{draft horse}} breed, the only such breed {{developed}} in the United States that is still in existence. It is recognized by its cream color, known as [...] "gold champagne", produced {{by the action of}} the champagne gene upon a chestnut base color, and by its amber eyes, also characteristic of the gene; the only other color found in the breed is chestnut. Like several other breeds of draft horses, the American Cream is at risk for the autosomal recessive genetic disease junctional <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{autosomal}} {{recessive genetic disease}} junctional <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> (JEB) {{has been found in}} some American Cream Drafts. This is a lethal genetic disorder that causes newborn foals to lose large areas of skin and have other abnormalities, normally leading to euthanasia of the animal. It is most commonly associated with Belgian horses, but is also found in other draft breeds. A DNA test was developed in 2002, and JEB can be avoided as long as two carriers are not bred to one another. The American Cream registry states that it has [...] "been pro-active in testing its registered animals since JEB was discovered".|$|E

In 2008 she hosted the 4th Annual Pink Party {{to raise funds for}} the Women’s Cancer Research Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and organised a screening of All About Eve for FilmAid International. In 2012 Beckinsale joined Nestlé's Share the Joy of Reading Program to raise awareness about the importance of children's literacy.|$|E

[...] It is recommended only as a third line treatment in graft versus host disease in adults, based on lack of efficacy and side effects observed in clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|There exist {{other types}} of {{inherited}} <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa,</b> junctional <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> and <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> simplex, which {{are not related to}} type VII collagen deficiency. These arise from mutations in the genes encoding other proteins of the epidermis or the basement membrane at the junction between the epidermis and the dermis.|$|E

50|$|In {{the absence}} of {{mutations}} of the COL7A1 gene, an autoimmune response against type VII collagen can result in an acquired form of <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> called <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> acquisita.|$|E
50|$|Junctional <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> with pyloric atresia {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive form of junctional <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> that presents at birth with severe mucocutaneous fragility and gastric outlet obstruction.

50|$|<b>Epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> simplex {{is a form}} of <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> {{that causes}} {{blisters}} at the site of rubbing. It typically affects the hands and feet, and is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, affecting the keratin genes KRT5 and KRT14.|$|E
50|$|An {{estimated}} 20 {{per million}} live births are diagnosed with EB, and 9 per {{million people in}} the general population have the condition. Of these cases, approximately 92% are <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> simplex (EBS), 5% are dystrophic <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> (DEB), 1% are junctional <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> (JEB), and 2% are unclassified. Carrier frequency ranges from 1 in 333 for JEB, to 1 in 450 for DEB; the carrier frequency for EBS is presumed to be much higher than JEB or DEB.|$|E
50|$|A 2014 study {{classified}} cases {{into three}} types—epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), junctional <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> (JEB), and dystrophic <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> (DEB) -- and reviewed their times of death.

5000|$|Dystrophic <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> is an {{inherited}} variant affecting {{the skin and}} other organs. [...] "Butterfly children" [...] is the term given to those born with the disease, as their skin is seen to be as delicate and fragile as a butterfly's wings. Dystrophic <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> is caused by genetic defects (or mutations) within the human COL7A1 gene encoding the protein type VII collagen (collagen VII). DEB-causing mutations can be either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Epidermis bullosa pruriginosa and Albopapuloid <b>epidermolysis</b> <b>bullosa</b> (Pasini's disease) are rare subtypes of this disease.|$|E
