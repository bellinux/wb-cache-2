2500|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>behavior</b> is {{different}} in every ecosystem and the organisms in those ecosystems have adapted accordingly. One sweeping generality is that in all ecosystems, fire creates a mosaic of different habitat patches, with areas ranging from those having just been burned to {{those that have been}} untouched by fire for many years. This is a form of ecological succession in which a freshly burned site will progress through continuous and directional phases of colonization following the destruction caused by the fire. [...] Ecologists usually characterize succession through the changes in vegetation that successively arise. After a fire, the first species to re-colonize will be those with seeds are already present in the soil, or those with seeds are able to travel into the burned area quickly. These are generally fast-growing herbaceous plants that require light and are intolerant of shading. As time passes, more slowly growing, shade-tolerant woody species will suppress some of the herbaceous plants. Conifers are often early successional species, while broad leaf trees frequently replace them in the absence of fire. Hence, many conifer forests are themselves dependent upon recurring fire.|$|E

[...] In the northwest, the fire continued to burn on the northern slope of Black Crater; and in the southwest, it moved into the lighter fuels that have grown up in the area burned by the 2012 Pole Creek Fire. [...] On the northeast and southeast sides of the fire, crews patrolled the fire lines and prepared to begin mop-up operations while state fire marshal teams spent the day at the Black Butte Ranch and other residual areas helping homeowners make their property more fire resistant.

40|$|Pathological <b>fire</b> setting <b>behavior</b> is {{characterized}} by various types of <b>fire</b> setting <b>behavior</b> that lasts at least 6 months. This behavior can be observed both during childhood and adolescence and it develops {{as a result of}} the complex interaction between individual, social and environmental factors. Sample population based studies show that <b>fire</b> setting <b>behavior</b> occurs in children and adolescents by 5 - 10 %. The studies that have been conducted have yielded to various theories and findings concerning the mechanism of occurrence of pathological <b>fire</b> setting <b>behavior,</b> the factors that affect this behavior and the demographic, individual, family and environmental characteristics of the children and adolescents who engage in such behavior. The objectives of effective treatment strategies are reducing <b>fire</b> setting <b>behavior</b> as well as making significant changes in the causes underlying the psychopathology. Outpatient care is the preferred method. In addition, there are some inpatient treatment programs designed especially for young people who set fires. The two most common approaches in intervention concerning <b>fire</b> setting <b>behavior</b> are firefighting (<b>fire</b> service) based training interventions and mental health based psycho-social interventions. Even though numerous studies have been conducted in the world concerning pathological <b>fire</b> setting <b>behavior</b> from the 19 th century onwards, no epidemiological data or study on pathological <b>fire</b> setting <b>behavior</b> exists in Turkey.

40|$|AbstractThe {{experimental}} {{observation of}} pool fires under dynamic pressure is of significant meaning {{to understand the}} <b>fire</b> <b>behaviors</b> under different low pressure environments. Previous studies on low-pressure fires mainly focused on <b>fire</b> <b>behaviors</b> at static low pressure, where the fire tests were usually conducted at several discrete altitudes. An altitude chamber of size 3 m× 2 m× 2 m has been built for this study, where different dynamic pressure descent rates were configured to simulate pool <b>fire</b> <b>behaviors</b> under different low pressures. In each test, the chamber pressure varies from standard atmospheric pressure 101. 3 KPa to 34 KPa. The dynamic pressure descent rate is controlled by replenishing air at different rates: 0, 15 and 20 Nm 3 /h. The study tested two different sizes of pool fires, where the pan heights are all 2 cm and the pan diameters are 6 cm and 10 cm respectively. N-Heptane with industrial purity of 99 % {{was used as the}} testing fuel. Parameters were measured along the whole burning process, including axial flame temperature, burning rate, radiative heat flux, chamber pressure as well as fire video recording. Some specific phenomena were observed for the fires under dynamic depressurization, e. g. the flame transmitted from turbulent to laminar and its base turned blue as pressure drops, then in the final burning stage a polyhedral flame appeared and swirled in the pan until extinguishment. The measurement data, i. e. mass burning rate, flame temperature and radiative heat flux, were analyzed to reveal the pressure effect in influencing <b>fire</b> <b>behaviors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Changes are {{observed}} in the strength of central synaptic transmission and the <b>firing</b> <b>behavior</b> of primary afferents damaged by peripheral nerve injury. To clarify the relationship between synaptic strength and amount of spontaneous activity, <b>firing</b> <b>behavior</b> was studied in adult, male Sprague–Dawley rats in which sciatic nerve afferents were axotomized. Intra-axonal recordings were taken from Aαβafferents within 7 h (acute, n= 309), at 3 days (n= 228), or at 10 days (n= 230) after sciatic nerve cut. The proportion of spontaneously discharging afferents fell from 22 % in the acute group to ≤ 13 % in chronic groups. Thus, neither the progressive decline in the strength of central synaptic transmission from cut primary afferents nor the altered sensation observed after nerve cut {{can be explained by}} chronic changes in spontaneous activity of cut Aα/Aβ afferents...|$|R

40|$|Pyramidal cells, {{the most}} {{abundant}} neurons in neocortex, exhibit significant structural variability across different brain areas and layers in different species. Moreover, {{in response to a}} somatic step current, these cells display a range of <b>firing</b> <b>behaviors,</b> the most common being (1) repetitive action potentials (Regular Spiking - RS), and (2) an initial cluster of 2 - 5 action potentials with short ISIs followed by single spikes (Intrinsic Bursting - IB). A correlation between <b>firing</b> <b>behavior</b> and dendritic morphology has recently been reported. In this work we use computational modeling to investigate quantitatively the effects of the basal dendritic tree morphology on the <b>firing</b> <b>behavior</b> of 112 three-dimensional reconstructions of layer V PFC rat pyramidal cells. Particularly, we focus on how different morphological (diameter, total length, volume and branch number) and passive (Mean Electrotonic Path length) features of basal dendritic trees shape somatic firing when the spatial distribution of ionic mechanisms in the basal dendritic trees is uniform or non-uniform. Our results suggest that total length, volume and branch number are the best morphological parameters to discriminate the cells as RS or IB, regardless of the distribution of ionic mechanisms in basal trees. The discriminatory power of total length, volume and branch number remains high in the presence of different apical dendrites. These results suggest that morphological variations in the basal dendritic trees of layer V pyramidal neurons in the PFC influence their firing patterns in a predictive manner and may in turn influence the information processing capabilities of these neurons...|$|R

One region intimately connected with the cerebral cortex, i. e., lobules VI/VII of the neocerebellum, and another one strongly connected with the vestibular apparatus, i. e., lobule X of the archaeocerebellum. Given their connections, we hypothesized that activity in neurons in lobules VI/VII and lobule X may be expected to be more phasic and tonic, respectively.

The <b>firing</b> <b>behavior</b> of Purkinje cells is severely affected in Cr-/- alert mice, with alterations of simple spike firing rate, complex spike duration, and simple spike pause. In contrast, in slices, transmission at parallel fiber- or climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synapses is unaltered, indicating that marked modifications of the <b>firing</b> <b>behavior</b> in vivo can be undetectable in slice.

Two units with median frequencies 40 and 59 Hz were encountered in one 7 -day-old rat. Integrated rectified gross EMG developed from being phasic only to predominantly tonic during {{the second and third}} postnatal week.
