2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s most North American GFCI devices {{were of the}} circuit breaker type. [...] GFCIs built into the outlet {{receptacle}} became commonplace beginning in the 1980s. The circuit breaker type, installed into a <b>distribution</b> <b>panel,</b> suffered from accidental trips mainly caused by poor or inconsistent insulation on the wiring. False trips were frequent when insulation problems were compounded by long circuit lengths. So much current leaked {{along the length of}} the conductors' insulation that the breaker might trip with the slightest increase of current imbalance. The migration to outlet receptacle based protection in North American installations reduced the accidental trips and provided obvious verification that wet areas were under electrical code-required protection. European installations continue to use primarily RCDs installed at the distribution board, which provides protection in case of damage to fixed wiring; In Europe socket-based RCDs are primarily used for retro-fitting.|$|E
2500|$|Three-phase {{electrical}} {{generation is}} very common. The simplest {{way is to}} use three separate coils in the generator stator, physically offset by an angle of 120° (one-third of a complete 360° phase) to each other. Three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120° out of phase to each other. If coils are added opposite to these (60° spacing), they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together. In practice, higher [...] "pole orders" [...] are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10° spacing). The advantage is that lower rotational speeds {{can be used to}} generate the same frequency. For example, a 2-pole machine running at 3600rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed is preferable for larger machines. If the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases, no current flows through the neutral point. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load, the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g. the switch-mode power supplies widely used) may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream <b>distribution</b> <b>panel</b> to handle harmonics. Harmonics can cause neutral conductor current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors.|$|E
2500|$|For {{three-phase}} at utilization voltages a {{four-wire system}} {{is often used}}. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (3-wire) primary and a Star (4-wire, center-earthed) secondary is often used {{so there is no}} need for a neutral on the supply side. For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a single phase and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations all three phases and neutral are taken to the main <b>distribution</b> <b>panel.</b> From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. Three-wire single-phase systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two live conductors, is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as [...] "two phase". A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of electric shock in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110V between the two conductors for running the tools.|$|E

50|$|Other issues {{affecting}} lethality are frequency, {{which is an}} issue in causing cardiac arrest or muscular spasms. Very high frequency electric current causes tissue burning, but does not penetrate the body far enough to cause cardiac arrest (see electrosurgery). Also important is the pathway: if the current passes through the chest or head, there is an increased chance of death. From a main circuit or power <b>distribution</b> <b>panel</b> the damage {{is more likely to}} be internal, leading to cardiac arrest. Another factor is that cardiac tissue has a chronaxie (response time) of about 3 milliseconds, so electricity at frequencies of higher than about 333 Hz requires more current to cause fibrillation than is required at lower frequencies.|$|E

The engine was capable of a maximum of 35 horsepower. The MS engine was combined with the PSC transmission in one unit rather than being in two separate housings. The PSC transmission gave the tank four forward speeds and one reverse speed. The engine-transmission compartment in the back let air in via holes drilled in the rear plate. This improved protection, but also led to the engine overheating.

50|$|The {{historically}} older open diving chamber, {{known as}} an open diving bell or wet bell, is in effect a compartment with an open bottom that contains a gas space above a free water surface, which allows divers to breathe underwater. The compartment may {{be large enough to}} fully accommodate the divers above the water, or may be smaller, and just accommodate head and shoulders. Internal air pressure is at the pressure of the free water surface, and varies accordingly with depth. The breathing gas supply for the open bell may be self-contained, or more usually, supplied from the surface via flexible hose, which may be combined with other hoses and cables as a bell umbilical. An open bell may also contain a breathing gas <b>distribution</b> <b>panel</b> with divers' umbilicals to supply divers with breathing gas during excursions from the bell, and an on-board emergency gas supply in high-pressure storage cylinders.

50|$|A 66 {{block is}} a type of punchdown block used to connect sets of wires in a {{telephone}} system. They have been manufactured in three sizes, A, B, and M. A and B have six clips in each row while M has only 4. The A blocks spaced the rows farther apart, and has been obsolete for many years. The B style is used mainly in <b>distribution</b> <b>panels</b> where several destinations (often 1A2 key telephones) need to connect to the same source. The M blocks are often used to connect a single instrument to such a distribution block. 66 blocks are designed to terminate 22 through 26 AWG solid copper wire.

The term 66 block reflects its Western Electric model number.|$|R

50|$|According to the United States NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board), the {{triggering}} {{event in}} the sinking was the loss {{of one of the}} two rudders. This allowed water to pour into the rudder room by way of the 9-inch diameter rudder trunk. The marine architect designed the opening of the rudder trunks to be above the waterline so that water would not enter the rudder room should a rudder fall out. However, United Marine Shipbuilding changed the ship from an oil well service boat to a fishing boat in 1988. The changes raised the waterline 2.5 feet. This put the rudder trunk openings below the water line. The ceiling of the rudder room was only 20 inches above the trunk openings. Flooding of the rudder room should not have sunk the ship since there was a watertight bulkhead. The NTSB can only speculate that the door was left open, the seals or latching dogs failed, or that the holes cut in the bulkhead for refrigeration lines needed for fish processing were not watertight. If the conversion installed a watertight bulkhead between sections of the fish processing area the boat would not have sunk. Whatever the reason, the water flooded the engine room. At some point the water level became high enough to short out the main electrical <b>distribution</b> <b>panel.</b> This caused the loss of electrical power throughout the boat.|$|E

By using {{the principle of}} virtual work, the element nonlinear stiffness formulation for a panel under a combined thermal and aerodynamic loads is derived on the bases of von Karman's large deflection plate theory, the first-order piston theory aerodynamics and the quasi-steady thermal stress theory.
