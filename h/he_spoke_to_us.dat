The Reverend William P. Barker presided over a public memorial in Pittsburgh. More than 2,700 people attended the memorial at Heinz Hall, including former Good Morning America host David Hartman, Teresa Heinz Kerry, philanthropist Elsie Hillman, PBS President Pat Mitchell, Arthur creator Marc Brown, and The Very Hungry Caterpillar author-illustrator Eric Carle. Speakers remembered Rogers' love of children, devotion to his religion, enthusiasm for music, and quirks. Teresa Heinz Kerry said of Rogers, [...] "He never condescended, just invited us into his conversation. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> as the people we were, not as the people others wished we were."

500|$|As an Aviation Officer it was Dodd's job {{to liaise}} with, and understand, the Allies' needs, requirements, and recommendations. To do so he spent {{several days in}} London where <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the <b>US</b> Military Attaché, Colonel William Lassiter, and various British officials.

6000|$|I had for fellow-student {{an unhappy}} [...] "village genius" [...] sent to Dublin by some {{charitable}} Connaught landlord.

He did not paint the model as we tried to, for some other image rose always before his eyes (a St. John in the Desert I remember,) and already <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> of his visions.

'We sat {{afterwards}} {{outside the}} hut while the sun rose, and De Aquila marked our churls going {{to their work}} in the fields, and talked of holy things, and how we should govern our Manors in time to come, and of hunting and of horse-breeding, and of the King's wisdom and unwisdom; for <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{as though we were}} in all sorts now his brothers. Anon a churl stole up to me--he was one of the three I had not hanged a year ago--and he bellowed--which is the Saxon for whispering--that the Lady Ælueva would speak to me at the Great House.

5000|$|The {{document}} was mentioned {{and published in}} January 1988 in the Belgrade newspaper Borba, and later in Zagreb-based magazine Start. Čubrilović's {{document was}} not supported by Yugoslav historians and professors except for Ivo Andrić. The text was later often quoted and cited {{as one of the}} fundamental documents of the Greater Serbia ideology in the 20th century; that is the basis for methods that were used during the breakup of Yugoslavia by the Serbian authorities for the purpose of ethnic cleansing of Albanians, Muslims, and Croats. Some authors believe that Čubrilović's plan to expel Albanians from Kosovo actualized in 1999 by Slobodan Milošević's government under the name [...] "Operation Horseshoe". The report is deemed chauvinistic and nationalistic and was used as a reference to the Serbian atrocities in Kosovo in 1999 by Joe DioGuardi as <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the <b>US</b> parliament demanding that the United States should be launching NATO-attacks against Yugoslavia. During the brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing, over 850,000 Albanians left Kosovo, but soon returned after the withdrawal of Serbian troops.|$|R
6000|$|Most {{of the men}} {{had escaped}} with only a few cuts and bruises, but one poor fellow was hauled out of the water with a leg broken, and another was so badly knocked about the head that {{it was a long time}} before he was again fit for duty. The worst case, however, was that of poor Fred Borders. He had a leg broken, and a severe wound in the side from a harpoon which had been forced into the flesh over the barbs, so that we could hardly get it drawn out. We laid him in the stern of the boat, where he lay for some time insensible; but in a short time <b>he</b> revived, and <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in a faint voice.

6000|$|One day we {{was sitting}} on a bench in The Slopes, enjoying a bit of {{sunshine}} that had just come along, when a middle-aged man, with a very high collar and a silk hat, came and sat down by Jone. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> civilly <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> and then {{went on to say that}} if ever we happened to take a house near Liverpool he'd be glad <b>to</b> supply <b>us</b> with coals, because he was a coal merchant. Jone told him that if he ever did take a house near Liverpool he certainly would give him his custom. Then the man gave us his card. [...] "I come here every year," [...] he said, [...] "for the rheumatism in my shoulder, and if I meet anybody that lives near Liverpool, or is likely to, I try to get his custom. I like it here. There's a good many 'otels in this town. You can see a lot of them from here. There's St. Ann's, that's a good house, but they charge you a pound a day; and then there's the Old Hall. That's good enough, too, but nobody goes there except shopkeepers and clergymen. Of course, I don't mean bishops; they go to St. Ann's." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{the next}} few days it amused me to see how hard our lordling tried to suit his {{conversation}} to myself and Elsie. He was absurdly anxious to humour us. Just at first, it is true, he had discussed the subjects that lay nearest to his own heart. He was an ardent votary of the noble quadruped; and he loved the turf--whose sward, we judged, he trod mainly at Tattersall's. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> with erudition on 'two-year-old form,' and gave us several 'safe things' for the spring handicaps. The Oaks he considered 'a moral' for Clorinda. He also retailed certain choice anecdotes about ladies whose Christian names were chiefly Tottie and Flo, and whose honoured surnames have escaped my memory. Most of them flourished, I recollect, at the Frivolity Music Hall. But when he learned that our interest in the noble quadruped was scarcely more than tepid, and that we had never even visited 'the Friv.,' as he affectionately called it, he did his best in turn to acquire our subjects. He had heard us talk about Florence, for example, and he gathered from our talk that we loved its art treasures. So he set himself to work to be studiously artistic. It was a beautiful study in human ineptitude. 'Ah, yaas,' he, murmured, turning up the pale blue eyes ecstatically towards the mast-head. 'Chawming place, Florence! I dote on the pickchahs. I know them all by heart. I assuah yah, I've spent houahs and houahs feeding my soul in the galleries.' ...|$|E
60|$|One summer {{afternoon}} in Oxford--'that sweet city with her dreaming spires,' lovely as Venice in its splendour, noble in its learning as Rome, {{down the long}} High Street that winds from tower to tower, past silent cloister and stately gateway, till it reaches that long, grey seven-arched bridge which Saint Mary used to guard (used to, I say, because they are now pulling it down to build a tramway and a light cast- iron bridge in its place, desecrating the loveliest city in England)--well, we were coming down the street--a troop of young men, some of them like myself only nineteen, going to river or tennis-court or cricket-field--when Ruskin going up to lecture in cap and gown met us. He seemed troubled and prayed us to go back with him to his lecture, which {{a few of us}} did, and there <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> not on art this time but on life, saying that it seemed to him to be wrong that all the best physique and strength of the young men in England should be spent aimlessly on cricket- ground or river, without any result at all except that if one rowed well one got a pewter-pot, and if one made a good score, a cane-handled bat. He thought, he said, that we should be working at something that would do good to other people, at something by which we might show that in all labour there was something noble. Well, we were a good deal moved, and said we would do anything he wished. So he went out round Oxford and found two villages, Upper and Lower Hinksey, and between them there lay a great swamp, so that the villagers could not pass {{from one to the other}} without many miles of a round. And when we came back in winter he asked us to help him to make a road across this morass for these village people to use. So out we went, day after day, and learned how to lay levels and to break stones, and to wheel barrows along a plank--a very difficult thing to do. And Ruskin worked with us in the mist and rain and mud of an Oxford winter, and our friends and our enemies came out and mocked us from the bank. We did not mind it much then, and we did not mind it afterwards at all, but worked away for two months at our road. And what became of the road? Well, like a bad lecture it ended abruptly--in the middle of the swamp. Ruskin going away to Venice, when we came back for the next term there was no leader, and the 'diggers,' as they called us, fell asunder. And I felt that if there was enough spirit amongst the young men to go out to such work as road-making for the sake of a noble ideal of life, I could from them create an artistic movement that might change, as it has changed, the face of England. So I sought them out--leader they would call me--but there was no leader: we were all searchers only and we were bound to each other by noble friendship and by noble art. There was none of us idle: poets most of us, so ambitious were we: painters some of us, or workers in metal or modellers, determined that we would try and create for ourselves beautiful work: for the handicraftsman beautiful work, for those who love us poems and pictures, for those who love us not epigrams and paradoxes and scorn.|$|E

The entire generation of socialists which has survived two wars is now disappearing; we can expect many more theoretical obituaries in the next decade.

60|$|Yet poetry, {{though the}} last and finest result, is a natural fruit. As {{naturally}} as the oak bears an acorn, and the vine a gourd, man bears a poem, either spoken or done. It is the chief and most memorable success, for history is but a prose narrative of poetic deeds. What else have the Hindoos, the Persians, the Babylonians, the Egyptians done, that can be told? It is the simplest relation of phenomena, and describes the commonest sensations with more truth than science does, and the latter at a distance slowly mimics its style and methods. The poet sings how the blood flows in his veins. He performs his functions, and is so well that he needs such stimulus to sing only as plants to put forth leaves and blossoms. He would strive in vain to modulate the remote and transient music which he sometimes hears, since his song is a vital function like breathing, and an integral result like weight. It is not the overflowing of life but its subsidence rather, and is drawn from under {{the feet of the}} poet. It is enough if Homer but say the sun sets. He is as serene as nature, and we can hardly detect the enthusiasm of the bard. It is as if nature <b>spoke.</b> <b>He</b> presents <b>to</b> <b>us</b> the simplest pictures of human life, so the child itself can understand them, and the man must not think twice to appreciate his naturalness. Each reader discovers for himself that, with respect to the simpler features of nature, succeeding poets have done little else than copy his similes. His more memorable passages are as naturally bright as gleams of sunshine in misty weather. Nature furnishes him not only with words, but with stereotyped lines and sentences from her mint.|$|R
