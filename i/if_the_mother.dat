The nymphs look similar to their parents, only smaller, and will nest under their mother and she will continue to protect them until their second molt. The nymphs feed on food regurgitated by the mother, and on their own molts. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> dies before the nymphs are ready to leave, the nymphs may eat her.|$|E

25|$|Both viruses {{may also}} be {{transmitted}} vertically during childbirth. However, the risk of infection transmission is minimal <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> has no symptoms or exposed blisters during delivery. The risk is considerable when the mother is infected with the virus {{for the first time}} during late pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|A 1989 {{survey found}} that 75.8 percent of its {{respondents}} believed that abortion should be legally permitted <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> life is in danger or the child would be born deformed. More recently in 2000, 77.9 percent of survey respondents said abortion should be permitted <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> life is in danger, and 55.1 {{percent of respondents said}} abortion should be permitted <b>if</b> <b>the</b> pregnancy is the result of rape.|$|R

25|$|Clouds {{initially}} form {{in clear}} air or become clouds when fog rises above surface level. The genus {{of a newly}} formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content. If these characteristics change over time, the genus tends to change accordingly. When this happens, the original genus is called a mother cloud. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> cloud retains much of its original form after {{the appearance of the}} new genus, it is termed a genitus cloud. One example of this is stratocumulus cumulogenitus, a stratocumulus cloud formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> cloud undergoes a complete change in genus, it {{is considered to be a}} mutatus cloud.|$|E
25|$|Typically, mainly men {{and boys}} drop by to convey their congratulations, to have a bite to eat, to share words of Torah, and to sing songs {{welcoming}} the newborn and thanking God for the birth. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> is already back home with the baby, female relatives or friends will usually drop by to visit her as well.|$|E
25|$|Contraindications to {{breastfeeding}} {{are those}} conditions that could compromise {{the health of}} the infant if breast milk from their mother is consumed. One example of this is galactosemia. This is. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> has HIV or antiretroviral therapy, untreated active tuberculosis, human Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 or II, uses illicit drugs, or mothers undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment.|$|E

50|$|Some {{politicians}} condemn pregnancy in unmarried teenagers as a {{drain on}} taxpayers, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> and children receive welfare payments from the government.|$|R
50|$|In Panama, {{abortion}} is illegal {{with the exception}} of two circumstances: <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> life is endangered by <b>the</b> pregnancy, or <b>if</b> she is <b>the</b> victim of rape or incest.|$|R
25|$|Re-lactation is {{most easily}} {{accomplished}} with a newborn {{or with a}} baby that was previously breastfeeding; if the baby was initially bottle-fed, the baby may refuse to suckle. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> has recently stopped breastfeeding, she {{is more likely to}} be able to re-establish her milk supply, and more likely to have an adequate supply. Although some women successfully re-lactate after months-long interruptions, success is higher for shorter interruptions.|$|E
25|$|Scurvy or {{subclinical}} scurvy {{is caused}} by a deficiency of vitamin C. In modern Western societies, scurvy is rarely present in adults, although infants and elderly people are affected. Virtually all commercially available baby formulas contain added vitamin C, preventing infantile scurvy. Human breast milk contains sufficient vitamin C, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> has an adequate intake. Commercial milk is pasteurized, a heating process that destroys the natural vitamin C content of the milk.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{a lack of}} folic acid, a vitamin B, in {{the diet}} of a mother can cause {{cellular}} neural tube deformities that result in spina bifida. Congenital disorders such as a neural tube deformity (NTD) can be prevented by 72% <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> consumes 4 milligrams of folic acid before the conception and after 12 weeks of pregnancy. Folic acid, or vitamin B9, aids {{the development of the}} foetal nervous system.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time in 1942, the {{recently}} created College of Physicians was allowed to perform abortions not only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> life was in danger but also when her health was seriously compromised. Switzerland was also among the first countries to allow abortions <b>if</b> <b>the</b> life or health of <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> was in danger.|$|R
50|$|In 1994 the Nebraska Correctional Center for Women {{opened their}} prison nursery. An infant {{is allowed to}} reside with <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> in prison <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother’s</b> release date is before the child turns 18 months. Childbirth and {{parenting}} classes are mandatory {{before and after the}} birth of an incarcerated inmate’s child.|$|R
50|$|Hansen {{does not}} favor {{euthanasia}} or abortion unless {{in cases of}} rape or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> life is at risk. This is a central policy in {{the ideology of the}} Christian Democratic Party (KRF), and as such Hansen has identified herself as Pro-life.|$|R
25|$|Most {{cases of}} spina bifida can be {{prevented}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> gets enough folate before and during pregnancy. Adding folic acid to flour {{has been found to}} be effective for most women. Open spina bifida can be surgically closed before or after birth. A shunt may be needed in those with hydrocephalus, and a tethered spinal cord may be surgically repaired. Devices to help with movement such as crutches or wheelchairs may be useful. Urinary catheterization may also be needed.|$|E
25|$|Toxoplasmosis {{is usually}} spread by eating poorly cooked food that {{contains}} cysts, exposure to infected cat feces, {{and from a}} mother to a child during pregnancy <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> becomes infected. Rarely the disease may be spread by blood transfusion. It is not otherwise spread between people. The parasite is only known to reproduce sexually in the cat family. However, it can infect most types of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Diagnosis is typically by testing blood for antibodies or by testing amniotic fluid for the parasite's DNA.|$|E
25|$|Breeding {{can be at}} {{any time}} of year {{depending}} on conditions, with spring being favoured. Pregnancy usually takes 38–41 days but can be extended significantly <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> is still suckling the previous brood. Litters of 3 or 4 are typical, 6 being the maximum. The young remain in the nest while the female forages; if they wander both male and female adults retrieve them. They reach sexual maturity in {{about two and a half}} months. After mating, a copulatory plug is formed in the female's reproductive tract.|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis {{presenting}} {{during the}} neonatal period is uncommon, but does occur and may prove fatal if not diagnosed {{in a timely}} manner.

5000|$|Fetal size in {{relation}} to maternal pelvic size - <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> pelvis is roomy and the baby is not large, this is favorable for vaginal breech delivery. However, prenatal estimates {{of the size of}} the baby and the size of the pelvis are unreliable.|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> medical {{condition}} {{is such that}} there is no reasonable prospect of maternal resuscitation or viability (for example, after a nonsurvivable injury, or an unwitnessed arrest with prolonged pulselessness), then the procedure may be attempted immediately as a means of saving the unborn fetus primarily.|$|R
25|$|Advocates of this {{treatment}} {{also believe that}} emotional attachment of a child to a caregiver begins during the prenatal period, during which the unborn child {{is aware of the}} mother's thoughts and emotions. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> is distressed by the pregnancy, especially if she considers abortion, the child responds with distress and anger that continue through postnatal life. If the child is separated from the mother after birth, no matter how early this occurs, the child again feels distress and rage that will block attachment to a foster or adoptive caregiver.|$|E
25|$|African Americans adopted some {{elements}} of the European-American patriarchal system. But, under the South's adoption {{of the principle of}} partus sequitur ventrem in the 17th century and incorporated into slavery law in slave states, children of slave mothers were considered legally slaves. Under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> escaped to a free state, she and her children were legally considered slaves and fugitives. As a result, the Black Seminoles born to slave mothers were always at risk from slave raiders.|$|E
25|$|All {{the members}} of the troop are {{interested}} in the newborn, and they take advantage of any opportunity to examine and look at its genitals <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> permits it. With time the baby begins to climb up on other members of the troop, including the adult males who are interested in protecting the little one. Playing behavior is principally with a companion, and all members of the troop from the alpha male, the mother and all young members of the group solicit play with the young one.|$|E
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> life {{is at risk}} Hinduism permits {{abortion}}. The Vedic texts compare {{abortion to}} the killing of one's own parents. The general value system of Hinduism teaches that the correct course of action in any given situation {{is the one that}} causes the least harm to those involved. Thus in the case where <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> life is at risk, abortion is considered acceptable.|$|R

25|$|The {{fetus is}} even more {{susceptible}} to damage from carbon monoxide intake, which can be harmful when inhaled during pregnancy, usually through first or second-hand tobacco smoke. The concentration of carbon monoxide in the infant born to a non-smoking mother is around 2%, and this concentration drastically increases {{to a range of}} 6%–9% <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> smokes tobacco. Other possible sources of prenatal carbon monoxide intoxication are exhaust gas from combustion motors, use of dichloromethane (paint thinner, varnish removers) in enclosed areas, defective gas hot water heaters, indoor barbeques, open flames in poorly-ventilated areas, atmospheric exposure in highly polluted areas.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{composition}} of the offspring depends on what type of apomixis takes place. When endomitosis occurs before meiosis or when central fusion occurs (restitutional meiosis of anaphase I or the fusion of its products), the offspring get all to {{more than half of}} the mother's genetic material and heterozygosity is mostly preserved (<b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> has two alleles for a locus, it is likely that the offspring will get both). This is because in anaphase I the homologous chromosomes are separated. Heterozygosity is not completely preserved when crossing over occurs in central fusion. In the case of pre-meiotic doubling, recombination -if it happens- occurs between identical sister chromatids.|$|E
25|$|In Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking) areas {{it remains}} {{customary}} {{to use a}} name composed of the first name, followed by the father's name in the genitive case, followed {{by the name of}} the paternal grandfather, also in the genitive. Thus Seán Ó Cathasaigh (Seán O'Casey), son of Pól, son of Séamus, would be known to his neighbours as Seán Phóil Shéamuis. Occasionally, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> or grandmother was a well-known person locally, her name may be used instead of that of the father or grandfather. If the mother's name is used, then that of the maternal grandfather (or potentially grandmother) follows it, for example, Máire Sally Eoghain.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent review}} found {{research}} into giving Anti-D to all Rhesus D negative pregnant women is of low quality. However the research did {{suggest that the}} risk of <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> producing antibodies to attack Rhesus D positive fetal cells was lower in <b>mothers</b> who had <b>the</b> Anti-D in pregnancy. There were also fewer mothers with a positive kleihauer test (which shows <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother’s</b> and unborn baby’s blood has mixed).|$|R
25|$|Under {{the current}} law, abortions are allowed up 12 weeks <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> life or mental or {{physical}} health is at risk, up to 16 weeks {{in cases of}} rape and up to 24 weeks <b>if</b> <b>the</b> child may be born with an incurable disease or deformity.
