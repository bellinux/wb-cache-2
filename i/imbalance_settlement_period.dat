40|$|There is {{no natural}} inertia in a {{photovoltaic}} (PV) generator {{and changes in}} irradiation can be seen immediately at the output power. Moving cloud shadows are the dominant reason for fast PV power fluctuations taking place typically within a minute between 20 to 100 % of the clear sky value roughly 100 times a day, on average. Therefore, operating a utility scale grid connected PV power plant is challenging. Currently, in many regions, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind receive feed-in tariffs that ensure a certain price for the energy. On the other hand, electricity markets operate on a supply-demand principle and a typical <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>period</b> is one hour. This paper presents the energy, power and corresponding requirements for an energy storage system in a solar PV power plant to feed the power to the grid meeting the electricity spot markets practices. An ideal PV energy production forecast {{is assumed to be}} available to define reference powers of the system for the studied imbalance settlement periods. The analysis is done for three different PV system sizes using the existing irradiance measurements of the Tampere University of Technology solar PV power station research plant...|$|E
40|$|The <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> {{design is}} the part of an {{electricity}} balancing market design that stimulates so-called Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) to balance their electricity production and consumption portfolio and to stick to their energy schedules by penalizing any deviations from these schedules with an imbalance price. There are numerous <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> design options, each of which gives different incentives to BRPs. The aim of this work is to analyze the impact of the <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> design on BRP behaviour, and thereby on balancing market performance. For this purpose an agent based model has been built, in which the BRPs are the agents that decide autonomously in each round on their balancing strategy based on results in past rounds. Six alternative <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> designs are analyzed. We conclude from the analysis results that it is generally a better strategy for BRPs to opt for a long position rather than a short position, and to opt for a small imbalance rather than a large one. Furthermore, different <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> designs will lead to different but still similar results, because of the balancing market equilibrium that emerges {{as a result of the}} dynamic feedback loop between BRP behaviour and balancing market outcomes. An exception is formed by two-price settlement, which leads to much higher imbalance costs. Finally, it was found that the imbalance costs for large BRPs are relatively higher, and that the choice of <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> design has a greater impact on the behaviour of small BRPs.

40|$|Abstract—Imbalance {{settlement}} {{is a vital}} part of the balancing market, i. e. the institutional arrangement that establishes market-based balance management in liberalized electricity markets. We investigate the impact of the <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> design on the behaviour of Balance Responsible Parties and thereby on balancing market performance by means of a comparison of the German and Dutch <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> designs and balancing market results for the period May-December 2009. It is found that Germany has much higher activated balancing energy volumes, imbalance prices and actual BRP cost levels than the Netherlands, but these differences are perhaps rather caused by balancing energy market design differences and differences in intermittent generation shares than by <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> design differences. The real-time publication of balance regulation in the Netherlands enables internal balancing by BRPs, which may reduce the size of system imbalances. Generally, BRPs will over-contract a little, because of the lower risk of having a negative individual imbalance and because of the evening out of imbalance costs over a longer time period.

40|$|Abstract — In liberalized power markets, balance {{responsibility}} and <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> are two closely related elements {{that constitute the}} heart of a balancing market (which is actually an institutional arrangement establishing market-based balancing). This paper aims to compare balance {{responsibility and}} <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> in the Nordic region, Germany, and the Netherlands. For this purpose, an overview is given of existing design variables and variable values in Northern Europe. Furthermore, the effects of different variables and values on four identified performance indicators have been rated with the support of a causal diagram of the balancing system. We conclude that different design variables create large differences in balancing market performance in Northern Europe, with the Program Time Unit, the scope of balance responsibility and the main imbalance pricing mechanism having the largest impact.

40|$|The subject {{addressed}} in this paper is the intra-hour scheduling of a distributed battery energy storage system (BESS). The case study is about a lithium-ion BESS integrated in a low voltage (LV) distribution system with residential customers and photovoltaic (PV) generation in the Netherlands. The BESS has been developed to enable field-testing and research of energy storage technologies in LV distribution grids, with emphasis on network support functions. As part of the research related to electricity markets, a proposal is presented about the economic optimisation of the BESS, whereas the simulation scenario addresses the passive contribution within the Dutch <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> system. Energy storage solutions can provide an attractive option for the integration of renewable energy sources {{and the establishment of}} efficient generation and delivery of electrical power. In the Netherlands, market parties have an incentive to assist the Transmission System Operator (TSO) in correcting system imbalances, largely attributable to the organisation of the system. The Dutch TSO publishes the system balance position and imbalance price close to real-time. This information can be used by market participants to voluntary contribute to the system balance by utilising non-contracted control power. This approach is called passive contribution and is believed to result in a substantial reduction in the required control energy. The <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> in the Netherlands for passive balancing is based on the net volumes of provided control energy per <b>settlement</b> <b>period.</b> Therefore, market participants might try to minimise or maximise the net amount of energy per <b>settlement</b> <b>period</b> when the system state is explicitly short or long. Assuming certain predictions of the system state and imbalance prices, the formulation of the optimisation problem is the maximisation of a profit function, and is solved by utilising an internal model of the BESS to plan the future response of the charging and discharging process over a receding horizon. The results of the optimisation problem are charging and discharging schedules of the BESS, which can be further employed in real-time operations. The main contribution of this work is a proposal for the intra-hour scheduling of the BESS, whereas the outcome of simulations provides an economic evaluation of the specified application based on actual market data of the Dutch TSO...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Since the {{liberalization}} of the Dutch electricity mar-ket in 1998, duties and interests of market players changed from minimizing overall costs to maximizing individual profits. Natu-rally, this {{has an effect on}} their behavior. After the introduction of the <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> system by the transmission system operator in 2001, deployment of control power has changed over time. This paper analyses this deployment of control power to examine the behavior of market players.

50|$|Financial <b>settlement</b> <b>periods</b> {{used to be}} much longer: Before {{the early}} 1990s at the London Stock Exchange, for example, stock could be paid for up to 10 working days after it was bought, {{allowing}} traders to buy (or sell) shares {{at the beginning of}} a <b>settlement</b> <b>period</b> only to sell (or buy) them before the end of the period hoping for a rise in price.

40|$|Gas fired {{power plants}} {{make up the}} main back-up {{technology}} to deal with intermittency induced by massive wind power integration. Therefore, the flexibility needs with respect to unpredictable power generation are actually transferred to the gas market. Applying the well known electric power generation concepts of ‘unit commitment’ and ‘dispatching’ to the gas market, hypothetical electricity generation and gas transmission systems have been modeled to verify, first, the physical impact of wind power forecasting errors on the gas system, and, second, its effect on gas <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement.</b> We find that increasing unpredictability leads to more expensive physical balancing of the gas system. Cost recovery by means of non-market based settlement faces the problem of defining an appropriate unique penalty that covers the balancing costs and incentivizes shippers. Market based settlement relates the variable imbalance tariffs to the actual system imbalance and thus any factor that strongly impacts on the system state like unpredictability. However, this mechanism raises <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> tariffs for all unbalanced gas network users, even if {{the major source of}} unpredictability is the shipper with the wind power related gas demand; whereas these costs should be borne as much as possible by those effectively causing them...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{document}} is to present SiSTEM, a multi-level simulation model of European short-term electricity markets, covering day-ahead and intraday exchanges to balancing activations in real-time, and <b>imbalance</b> <b>settlement.</b> In this model, power companies interact by making offers, notifying their positions to the system operator and impacting {{the balance of the}} electric system. The system operator activates balancing energy to restore the balance of the system, using all balancing activation offers, including from balancing reserves. <b>Imbalance</b> <b>settlement</b> implies bidirectional transactions between the system operator and power companies depending on the direction of their imbalance. A simulation of the model is performed by sequentially considering each time step and simulating actors’ decisions. The objective of this model is to understand the problems behind decisions of the actors within the short-term electrical system operation, to provide insights on how these problems can be solved through market design and to see how the decisions are linked together to shape a coherent system. This paper presents different simulation cases of an illustrative system in order to portray main features of the model in a practical and effective manner. In particular, the results show the importance of considering steady-state constraints and notice delays of generation units when looking at short-term issues. Future works could use this model to provide quantitative assessments of short-term market designs. Peer reviewe...|$|R
