500|$|The Warriors saw Lin as a {{potential}} backup for Curry. Lacob said the team received more than one trade offer for Lin {{while he was in}} the D-League, but he was happy with Lin's progress as an undrafted free agent. [...] "He's a minimum, inexpensive asset. You need to look at him as a developing asset. Is <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a superstar?

500|$|Entering 2008, Baseball America ranked Davis {{the number}} two {{prospect}} in the Rangers' organization, behind Elvis Andrus. Davis began the season playing first base for Frisco. He batted [...]333 with 62 hits, 13 home runs, and 42 RBI in 46 games before earning a promotion to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League. In 31 games with Oklahoma, he hit [...]333 with 37 hits, 10 home runs, and 31 RBI. He {{was named to the}} All-Star Futures Game but was unable to play in it because he was promoted to the major leagues by the Texas Rangers. Later, during his breakout 2013 season, Davis referred to his time with Round Rock in 2008: [...] "I know nobody really cares about Triple-A, but I put up these numbers up in Triple-A. That was kind of the question, 'Was <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to do it at the big league level?' The thing about it was, I just couldn't do it consistently. I couldn't put the bat on the ball. I was striking out an astronomical amount, and this year it's just been consistency day in and day out." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Bangladesh toured for two Tests {{and three}} ODIs in August and September that year, Maharoof was against {{selected}} in Sri Lanka's squad, allowing senior players to be rested {{for some of}} the matches. Although he didn't play in either of the Tests, in the two ODIs Maharoof played he took six wickets at an average of 9.00, finishing equal with Tillakaratne Dilshan as leading wicket-taker in the series. The Sri Lanka coach at the time, Tom Moody, praised Maharoof's bowling, saying [...] "Maharoof bowled superbly well in the Indian Oil series and has shown [...] that <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a more valuable bowler going into the future".|$|E

60|$|That was the {{stunning}} reality to Dorn--the actual {{existence of the}} Huns a few rods distant. But realization of them had not {{brought him to the}} verge of panic. He would not flinch at confronting the whole German army. Nor did he imagine he put a great price upon his life. Nor did he have any abnormal dread of pain. Nor had the well-remembered teachings of the Bible troubled his spirit. Was <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a coward because of some incalculable thing in him or force operating against him? Already he sat there, shivering and sweating, with the load on his breast growing laborsome, with all his sensorial being absolutely at keenest edge.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} {{stopped and looked}} perplexed. A sudden change had passed over the strange gentleman's face. His swarthy cheeks had turned to a cold clay color, through which his two scars seemed to burn fiercer than ever, like streaks of fire. His heavy hand and arm trembled a little as {{he leaned against the}} counter. Was <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken ill? No: he walked at once from the counter to the door--turned round there, and asked where Joanna Grice lived. The young man answered, the second turning to the right, down a street, which ended in a lane of cottages. Miss Grice's was the last cottage on the left hand; but he could assure the gentleman that it would be quite useless to go there, for she let nobody in. The gentleman thanked him, and went, nevertheless.|$|E

6000|$|He looked. The {{figure of}} a woman {{standing}} in the steely light, her hands stretched forth in a suppliant gesture, confronted him from the far-off end of the verandah; and {{in the space between}} him and the obstinate phantom floated the murmur of words that fell on his ears in a jumble of torturing sentences, the meaning of which escaped the utmost efforts of his brain. Who spoke the Malay words? Who ran away? Why too late--and too late for what? What meant those words of hate and love mixed so strangely together, the ever-recurring names falling on his ears again and again--Nina, Dain; Dain, Nina? Dain was dead, and Nina was sleeping, unaware of the terrible experience through which he was now passing. Was <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tormented for ever, sleeping or waking, and have no peace either night or day? What was the meaning of this? ...|$|E
6000|$|Left to herself, Salomy Jane stared a {{long while}} at the coffee-pot, and then called the two squaws who {{assisted}} her in her household duties, to clear away the things while she went up to her own room to make her bed. Here she was confronted with a possible prospect of that proverbial bed she might be making in her willfulness, and on which she must lie, in the photograph of a somewhat serious young man of refined features--Reuben Waters--stuck in her window-frame. Salomy Jane smiled over her last witticism regarding him and enjoyed it, like your true humorist, and then, catching sight of her own handsome face in the little mirror, smiled again. But wasn't it funny about that horse-thief getting off after all? Good Lordy! Fancy Reuben hearing he was alive and going round with that kiss of hers set on his lips! She laughed again, a little more abstractedly. And he had returned it like a man, holding her tight and almost breathless, and <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hung the next minute! Salomy Jane had been kissed at other times, by force, chance, or stratagem. In a certain ingenuous forfeit game of the locality known as [...] "I'm a-pinin'," [...] many had [...] "pined" [...] for a [...] "sweet kiss" [...] from Salomy Jane, which she had yielded {{in a sense of}} honor and fair play. She had never been kissed like this before--she would never again; and yet the man was alive! And behold, she could see in the mirror that she was blushing! ...|$|E
6000|$|What was <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be?</b> What sort of {{life had}} he before him--he being nothing of any consequence? And {{with only a}} little {{difference}} in events {{he might have been}} as important as Grandcourt, nay--her imagination inevitably went into that direction--might have held the very estates which Grandcourt was to have. But now, Deronda would probably some day see her mistress of the Abbey at Topping, see her bearing the title which would have been his own wife's. These obvious, futile thoughts of what might have been, made a new epoch for Gwendolen. She, whose unquestionable habit it had been to take the best that came to her for less than her own claim, had now to see the position which tempted her in a new light, as a hard, unfair exclusion of others. What she had now heard about Deronda seemed to her imagination to throw him into one group with Mrs. Glasher and her children; before whom she felt herself in an attitude of apology--she who had hitherto been surrounded by a group that in her opinion had need be apologetic to her. Perhaps Deronda himself was thinking of these things. Could he know of Mrs. Glasher? If he knew that she knew, he would despise her; but he could have no such knowledge. Would he, without that, despise her for marrying Grandcourt? His possible judgment of her actions was telling on her as importunately as Klesmer's judgment of her powers; but she found larger room for resistance to a disapproval of her marriage, because it is easier to make our conduct seem justifiable to ourselves than to make our ability strike others. [...] "How can I help it?" [...] is not our favorite apology for incompetency. But Gwendolen felt some strength in saying-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{take him}} home,' {{repeated}} the child, with a determination which I heartily admired, 'and <b>he's</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> my dog. I shall call him Fido.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That trash!" [...] Grant's sharp cry {{expressed}} incredulity. [...] "The man can't {{have any}} sense! <b>He's</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sorry {{all the time}} if he gets her." ...|$|R

6000|$|An {{objection}} may {{be anticipated}} here, {{but it is}} very easily answered. It may be said that we do, in fact, call in medical specialists to settle whether a man is mad; and that these specialists go by technical and even secret tests that cannot be known to the mass of men. It is obvious that this is true; it is equally obvious that it does not affect our argument. When we ask the doctor whether our grandfather is going mad, we still mean mad by our own common human definition. We mean, is <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a certain sort of person whom all men recognise when once he exists. That certain specialists can detect the approach of him, before he exists, does not alter {{the fact that it is}} of the practical and popular madman that we are talking, and of him alone. The doctor merely sees a certain fact potentially in the future, while we, with less information, can only see it in the present; but his fact is our fact and everybody's fact, or we should not bother about it at all. Here is no question of the doctor bringing an entirely new sort of person under coercion, as in the Feeble-Minded Bill. The doctor can say, [...] "Tobacco is death to you," [...] because the dislike of death can be taken for granted, being a highly democratic institution; and it is the same with the dislike of the indubitable exception called madness. The doctor can say, [...] "Jones has that twitch in the nerves, and he may burn down the house." [...] But it is not the medical detail we fear, but the moral upshot. We should say, [...] "Let him twitch, as long as he doesn't burn down the house." [...] The doctor may say, [...] "He has that look in the eyes, and he may take the hatchet and brain you all." [...] But we do not object to the look in the eyes as such; we object to consequences which, once come, we should all call insane if there were no doctors in the world. We should say, [...] "Let him look how he likes; as long as he does not look for the hatchet." ...|$|E
60|$|Deronda {{looked around}} for Grandcourt, {{wondering}} whether he followed his bride's movements with any attention; but it was rather undiscerning to him to suppose that he could find out the fact. Grandcourt had a delusive mood of observing whatever had an interest for him, which could be surpassed by no sleepy-eyed animal on the watch for prey. At that moment he was plunged in the depth of an easy chair, being talked to by Mr. Vandernoodt, who apparently thought the acquaintance of such a bridegroom worth cultivating; and an incautious person might have supposed it safe to telegraph secrets in front of him, the common prejudice being that your quick observer is one whose eyes have quick movements. Not at all. If you want a respectable witness who will see nothing inconvenient, choose a vivacious gentleman, {{very much on the}} alert, with two eyes wide open, a glass in one of them, and an entire impartiality as to the purpose of looking. If Grandcourt cared to keep any one under his power he saw them out of the corners of his long narrow eyes, and if they went behind him he had a constructive process by which he {{knew what they were doing}} there. He knew perfectly well where his wife was, and how she was behaving. Was <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a jealous husband? Deronda imagined that to be likely; but his imagination was as much astray about Grandcourt as it would have been about an unexplored continent where all the species were peculiar. He did not conceive that he himself was a likely subject of jealousy, or that he should give any pretext for it; but the suspicion that a wife is not happy naturally leads one to speculate on the husband's private deportment; and Deronda found himself after one o'clock in the morning in the rather ludicrous position of sitting up severely holding a Hebrew grammar in his hands (for somehow, in deference to Mordecai, he had begun to study Hebrew), with the consciousness that he had been in that attitude nearly an hour, and had thought of nothing but Gwendolen and her husband. To be an unusual young man means for the most part to get a difficult mastery over the usual, which is often like the sprite of ill-luck you pack up your goods to escape from, and see grinning at you from the top of your luggage van. The peculiarities of Deronda's nature had been acutely touched by the brief incident and words which made the history of his intercourse with Gwendolen; and this evening's slight addition had given them an importunate recurrence. It was not vanity--it was ready sympathy that had made him alive to a certain appealingness in her behavior toward him; and the difficulty with which she had seemed to raise her eyes to bow to him, in the first instance, was to be interpreted now by that unmistakable look of involuntary confidence which she had afterward turned on him under the consciousness of his approach.|$|E
