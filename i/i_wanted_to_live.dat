500|$|Khan married Hameedah Begum (the eldest {{daughter}} of Allama Mashriqi) in 1940. Together, {{they had three}} daughters (Mariam, Amina, and Rasheeda) and a son (Akbar). After Hameedah Begum's death in 1966, he married Shafiq Khan and had one daughter, Ayesha. During his ICS career, Khan worked as collector of revenue, a position that brought him into regular contact with living conditions in rural areas of East Bengal. The Bengal famine of 1943 and subsequent inadequate handling of the situation by the colonial rulers led him to resign from the Indian Civil Service in 1945. He wrote, [...] "I realised that if I did not escape while I was young and vigorous, I will forever remain in the trap, and terminate as a bureaucratic big wig." [...] During this period, he {{was influenced by the}} philosophy of Nietzsche and Mashriqi, and joined the Khaksar Movement. This attachment was brief. He quit the movement and turned to Sufism. According to Khan, [...] "I had a profound personal concern; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> a life free from fear and anxiety, a calm and serene life, without turmoil and conflict.when I followed the advice of old Sufis and sages, and tried to curb my greed, my pride and aggression, fears, anxieties and conflict diminished." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{study of}} a working-class lesbian {{community}} in Buffalo, New York, in the 1940s and 1950s, The Well of Loneliness was the only work of lesbian literature anyone had read or heard of. For many young lesbians in the 1950s, {{it was the only}} source of information about lesbianism. The Wells name recognition made it possible to find when bookstores and libraries did not yet have sections devoted to LGBT literature. As late as 1994, an article in Feminist Review noted that The Well [...] "regularly appears in coming-out stories– and not just those of older lesbians". It has often been mocked: Terry Castle says that [...] "like many bookish lesbians I seem to have spent much of my adult life making jokes about it", and Mary Renault, who read it in 1938, remembered laughing at its [...] "earnest humourlessness" [...] and [...] "impermissible allowance of self-pity". Yet it has also produced powerful emotional responses, both positive and negative. One woman was so angry at the thought of how The Well would affect an [...] "isolated emerging lesbian" [...] that she [...] "wrote a note in the library book, to tell other readers that women loving women can be beautiful". A Holocaust survivor said, [...] "Remembering that book, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> long enough to kiss another woman." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a scientist, Ray {{was fascinated}} by the {{possibility}} of an eruption. In {{the weeks leading up to}} the fateful event, Ray flew to the mountain in the governor's plane, circling the peak and remarking, [...] "I've always said <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> long enough to see one of our volcanoes erupt." [...] The cataclysmic eruption of the mountain, which occurred on May 18, 1980, killed 57 people. The level of devastation caused by the ensuing ash cloud, earthquakes, electrical storms, and flooding was unprecedented and, the following day, Ray invoked her emergency powers to cancel elections, which had been scheduled for May 20.|$|E

60|$|Also I {{was pleased}} with another thing, namely, {{that my mother had}} told me that I should live my life and not die that day by the hand of Frenchmen; and that in my life I should find love, of which to tell truth already I knew a little of a humble sort, for I was a comely youth, and women did not run away from me, or if they did, soon they stopped. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> my life, I wanted to see great adventures and to win great love.

60|$|I {{could not}} get Marie out of my mind; her image was with me by day and by night, {{especially}} by night, which caused me to sleep badly. I became morose, supersensitive, and excitable. I developed a cough, and thought, as did others, that I was going into a decline. I remember that Hans even asked me once if I would not come and peg out the exact place where I should like to be buried, so that I might be sure {{that there would be}} no mistake made when I could no longer speak for myself. On that occasion I kicked Hans, one of the few upon which I have ever touched a native. The truth was that I had not the slightest intention of being buried. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> and marry Marie, not to die and be put in a hole by Hans.

I wanted to tell you about it, Mr. Farrington, because I--I thought you kind of liked me, and I--I liked you.

6000|$|I went to {{the woods}} because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the {{essential}} facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I {{did not wish to}} live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.

What did the people I fought for do for me?... Nothing--so help me God--nothing!... I got a ribbon and a bouquet--a little applause for an hour--and then the sight of me sickened my countrymen. I was broken and used. I was absolutely forgotten.... But my body, my life, my soul meant all to me. My future was ruined, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> I had killed men who never harmed me--I was not fit to die.... I tried to live. So I fought out my battle alone. Alone!... No one understood. No one cared. I came West to keep from dying of consumption in sight of the indifferent mob for whom I had sacrificed myself. I chose to die on my feet away off alone somewhere....

They brought me saddles and harness to sew, and I earned a little, but I was main anxious for Thomas Fletcher. The lust of strong drink was in him, and he had sinful fits of temper, raging like one demented when I told him to cast out the devil. 'I'll cast out thee an' thy preaching into perdition,' he said. Then Minnie must tell me if I was too good for her husband, and only making trouble, {{they did not want}} me there, and I saw that sometimes Tom Fletcher scowled with angry eyes at her after I had spoken to him faithfully. So, because it is an ill thing to cause strife between man and wife, I left my daughter--and I had come half across the world to find her.

I was to feel everything I did not feel, and believe everything I did not believe. I was to feel awe for the bit of parchment in the mezuza over the door; to dread lest a bit of butter should touch a bit of meat; to think it beautiful that men should bind the tephillin on them, and women not,--to adore the wisdom of such laws, however silly they might seem to me. I was to love the long prayers in the ugly synagogue, and the howling, and the gabbling, and the dreadful fasts, and the tiresome feasts, and my father's endless discoursing about our people, which was a thunder without meaning in my ears. I was to care forever about what Israel had been; and I did not care at all. I cared for the wide world, and all that I could represent in it.
