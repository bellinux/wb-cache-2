The organization of cross-country ski competitions aims to make those events accessible both to spectators and television audiences.

5|$|Galba may <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> award Halotus {{the lucrative}} procuratorship {{for any number}} of reasons; during his reign, Galba was known for making often unpopular {{political}} and economical actions, supposedly for what was, at least in Galba's mind, the financial health of the city. Halotus' great rise in status, and his subsequent prosperity, may have been in some way beneficial in Galba's eyes. Less specifically, the move would certainly have had some degree of benefit for Galba in some way, whether indirectly, or directly, economically or financially.|$|E

5|$|Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as {{philosophers}} Antony Flew, {{have responded}} that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist view {{of free will}} (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a compatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible). The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined.|$|E
5|$|Male sovereigns {{up to and}} {{including}} George VI have traditionally worn a crimson cap of maintenance for the opening procession and when seated in the Chair of Estate during {{the first part of the}} service. Female sovereigns wear the George IV State Diadem, also worn by its namesake, George IV. For the Anointing, the sovereign is bareheaded, and remains so until the Crowning. Monarchs are usually crowned with St Edward's Crown but some <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> use other crowns because it weighs 2.23kg (4.9lb).

5|$|Although born in Canada, Stastny is a dual {{citizen of}} Canada and the United States. Both {{he and his}} brother Yan <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> play internationally for the United States. Among the reasons that led him to choose to play for the United States was the {{possibility}} to play in an international competition with his brother, who had chosen to play for the United States before Paul. Paul represented the U.S. {{for the first time in}} the 2004 Viking Cup, where he won a silver medal playing for the junior team. According to Hockey's Future, he was one of the most important American talents in the tournament. Stastny played internationally for the United States national ice hockey team for the first time in the 2007 IIHF World Championship. He played seven games, scored four goals and four assists, had two penalty minutes and finished even in plus/minus. The United States lost in the quarterfinals against Finland. Stastny was named the best American player in the 3–0 win against Germany, when he scored two goals and had one assist. He was chosen as one of the three best United States players at the tournament, together with Lee Stempniak and Toby Petersen.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} sports, some {{competitors}} in cross-country skiing <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> enhance their performance through doping. Anti-doping tests at the 2001 World Nordic skiing championships in Lahti, Finland revealed that Jari Isometsä, Janne Immonen {{and two other}} skiers from Finland's gold-medal relay team, Mika Myllylä and Harri Kirvesniemi, and two female skiers tested positive for hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a blood plasma expander usually used {{to cover up the}} use of erythropoietin (EPO). EPO boosts the oxygen-carrying capability of hemoglobin. In addition, the team head coach left needles and drip bags at a public location near the Helsinki airport. At the Sochi Winter Olympic Games, Austrian cross-country skier Johannes Duerr was ejected from competition after testing positive for the blood booster EPO. In 2007, The International Olympic Committee banned biathletes, Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann, and the cross-country skiers, Martin Tauber, Jürgen Pinter, Johannes Eder, Roland Diethart and Christian Hoffmann, from all future Olympic competition.|$|E

5|$|Historically both {{wide and}} narrow {{interpretations of the}} genus have been proposed. In the nineteenth century genus {{splitting}} was common, favouring the narrow view. Haworth (1831) using a narrow view treated many species as separate genera, as did Salisbury (1866). These authors listed various species in related genera such as Queltia (hybrids), Ajax(=Pseudonarcissus) and Hermione(=Tazettae), sixteen in all in Haworth's classification. In contrast, Herbert (1837) took a very wide view reducing Harworth's sixteen genera to six. Herbert, treating the Amaryllidacea as an 'order' as was common then, considered the narcissi to be a suborder, the Narcisseae, the six genera being Corbularia, Ajax, Ganymedes, Queltia, Narcissus and Hermione and his relatively narrow circumscription of Narcissus having only three species. Later Spach (1846) took an even wider view bringing most of Harworth's genera into the genus Narcissus, but as separate subgenera. By the time that Baker (1875) wrote his monograph all of the genera with one exception were included as Narcissus. The exception was the monotypic group Tapeinanthus which various subsequent authors <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> either exclude (e.g. Cullen 1986) or include (e.g. Webb 1978, 1980). Today it is nearly always included.|$|E
5|$|The {{first wave}} of forced {{conversions}} in the Crown of Aragon happened during the Revolt of the Brotherhoods. Rebellion bearing an anti-Muslim sentiment broke out among the Christian subjects of Valencia in the early 1520s, and those active in it forced Muslims to become Christians in the territories they controlled. Muslims joined the Crown in suppressing the rebellion, playing crucial roles in several battles. After the rebellion was suppressed, the Muslims regarded the conversions forced by the rebels as invalid and returned to their faith. Subsequently, King Charles I (also known as Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire) started an investigation to determine {{the validity of the}} conversions. The commission tasked with this investigation started working in November 1524. Charles ultimately upheld the conversions, putting the forcibly converted subjects under the authority of the Inquisition. Supporters of this decision argued that the Muslims had a choice when confronted by the rebels: they could <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> refuse and die, but did not, indicating that the conversions happened out of free will and must remain in effect.|$|E
5|$|The story draws {{heavily on}} the {{tradition}} of the romance, a fictitious narrative set far away from ordinary life. Romances were typically based around themes such as the supernatural, wandering, exploration and discovery. They were often set in coastal regions, and typically featured exotic, fantastical locations and themes of transgression and redemption, loss and retrieval, exile and reunion. As a result, while The Tempest was originally listed as a comedy in the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays, subsequent editors <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> give it the more specific label of Shakespearean romance. Like the other romances, the play was influenced by the then-new genre of tragicomedy, introduced by John Fletcher {{in the first decade of}} the 17th century and developed in the Beaumont and Fletcher collaborations, as well as by the explosion of development of the courtly masque form by such as Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones at the same time.|$|E
