40|$|Abstract – Downward surface solar {{irradiance}} received at ground, {{is an important}} component of the energy budget of ground surface. Indirect derivations of this parameter are common on the absence of direct measurements with reliable instruments. Our estimation is based on satellites observations. This paper presents development work on a tool for modelling the downward radiation received at ground. At first, this work is devoted to estimate the irradiance under all sky conditions from the <b>geostationary</b> <b>weather</b> <b>satellite</b> Meteosat- 7. The model is based on NREL’s SPECTRAL 2 model for clear skies which takes no account of cloud attenuation of solar radiation. It can be shown to work well for its design purpose, but in maritime climates clear weather days are few and far between. Development work on the original model includes modification of the aerosol model and extended work on the Dedieu (1987) for developing a physically model to derive downward {{solar irradiance}} at the surface of the earth and surface albedo from Meteosat satellite measurements in the wavelength between 0. 40 and 1. 10 µm. The model takes into account Rayleigh and Mie scattering, water vapor and Ozone absorption. No threshold setting is necessary to distinguish between clear and cloudy conditions, there by avoiding the problem of its arbitrary nature and to some extent allowing quicker and easier data processing. On the other hand, a statistical method has been applied assuming a correlation between global horizontal surface irradiance under cloudless sky and a cloud index. The forme...|$|E
40|$|Operational nowcasting {{techniques}} for sea fog over the Yellow Sea rely {{on data from}} weather satellites because ground-based observations are hardly available. While there are several algorithms for detecting low stratus (LST) that are applicable to <b>geostationary</b> <b>weather</b> <b>satellite</b> data, sea fog retrieval is more complicated. These schemes mostly need ancillary data such as Cloud Optical Thickness (COT) and Droplet Effective Radius (DER). To retrieve the necessary parameters for sea fog detection over the Yellow Sea, the Comprehensive Analysis Program for Cloud Optical Measurement (CAPCOM) scheme developed by Kawamoto et al. (2001) was adapted to the Japanese Multifunctional Transport Satellites (MTSAT) system-Japanese Advanced Meteorological Imager (JAMI). COT and DER values were then retrieved for 64 cases over the Yellow Sea (= 85, 000 LST pixels) and compared with the COT and DER products from the MYD 06 /MOD 06, CAPCOM-MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and CloudSat (cloud radar). Results showed that the COT and DER values retrieved from JAMI were satisfactory. The MTSAT- 2 JAMI data delivered better COT values than the MTSAT- 1 R JAMI data, due to the re-calibration of MTSAT- 2 JAMI’s visible (VIS) band in 2011. Similarly, improvements were seen in DER retrieval, even though the VIS re-calibration primarily affects COT retrieval. By comparing the difference in stratus thickness calculated by MTSAT- 1 R and MTSAT- 2, the COT and DER retrieved from MTSAT- 2 JAMI {{can be used in}} ground fog retrieval schemes. These values exhibit less bias, especially in cases involving high cloud top and thin cloud thickness. Both the COT and DER retrievals from MTSAT- 2 JAMI offer potential as reliable parameters for Yellow Sea fog detection...|$|E

(2009) for mapping suspended matter in turbid waters from the SEVIRI sensor on board the METEOSAT <b>geostationary</b> <b>weather</b> <b>satellite</b> platform. Previous methodology is extended to the mapping of turbidity, T, and vertical attenuation of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), K PAR. The spatial resolution of the SEVIRI products is improved from 3  km ×  6. 5  km to 1  km ×  2  km using the broad high resolution visual band. The previous atmospheric correction is further improved and the uncertainties on marine reflectance due to digitization are considered. Based on a two year archive of SEVIRI imagery, available every 15  min, the diurnal variability of T and K PAR is investigated during cloud free periods and validated using half-hourly T and K PAR data obtained from a system of moored buoys (SmartBuoys) in the southern North Sea. Based on numerous match-ups, 80 % of SEVIRI derived T and K PAR are within 53 % and 39 % of SmartBuoy T and K PAR, respectively. Results further show that on cloud free days, the SEVIRI T and K PAR signals are in phase with the SmartBuoy data, with an average difference in {{the timing of the}} maximum T and K PAR of 11  min and 23  min, respectively.

During the early orbit support of GOES- 8 (April 1994), the gyro drift rate biases exhibited a large dependency on gyro temperature. This complicated the calibration and introduced errors into the attitude during delta-V maneuvers. Following GOES- 8, {{a model of the}} DIRA temperature and drift rate bias variation was developed for GOES- 9 (May 1995).

The model also optimizes the yaw reorientation necessary to achieve the correct delta-V pointing attitude. As a result, a higher accuracy was achieved on GOES- 9 leading to more efficient delta-V maneuvers and a propellant savings.
