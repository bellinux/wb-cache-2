50|$|How {{it works}} - Electromagnetic tooth {{clutches}} operate via an <b>electric</b> <b>actuation</b> but transmit torque mechanically. When current {{flows through the}} clutch coil, the coil becomes an electromagnet and produces magnetic lines of flux. This flux is then transferred through the small gap between {{the field and the}} rotor. The rotor portion of the clutch becomes magnetized and sets up a magnetic loop, which attracts the armature teeth to the rotor teeth. In most instances, the rotor is consistently rotating with the input (driver). As soon as the clutch armature and rotor are engaged, lock up is 100%.|$|E

The ability to design a macromolecular response {{to a wide variety of}} external stimuli makes polymer brushes an exciting class of functional materials, and has been made possible by advances in modern controlled polymerization techniques. In this review we discuss the physics of polymer brush response along with a summary of the techniques used in their synthesis.

50|$|The {{electric}} motor in the actuator spins {{together with the}} intake camshaft as the engine runs. To maintain camshaft timing, the actuator motor will operate {{at the same speed}} as the camshaft. To advance the camshaft timing, the actuator motor will rotate slightly faster than the camshaft speed. To retard camshaft timing, the actuator motor will rotate slightly slower than camshaft speed. The speed difference between the actuator motor and camshaft timing is used to operate a mechanism that varies the camshaft timing. The benefit of the <b>electric</b> <b>actuation</b> is enhanced response and accuracy at low engine speeds and at lower temperatures as well as a greater total range of adjustment. The combination of these factors allows more precise control, resulting in an improvement of both fuel economy, engine output and emissions performance.|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis on}} the efficiency of different caliper architectures is described in the paper. The development of an electrically actuated brake caliper is of major interest for designing hybrid and electric vehicles. <b>Electric</b> <b>actuation</b> must be sufficient to generate the large braking torque required to stop the vehicle. Traditional caliper architectures are not suitable for such type of actuation due to the inadequate level of efficiency. The actuation forces required by production passenger vehicles are very large resulting in unacceptable actuation currents and layout issues due to the relevant electric actuator size. The self-energizing mechanism is {{an effective way to}} over-come this limitation and to use the <b>electric</b> <b>actuation</b> on a passenger car brake caliper.

Using quantum chemistry calculations, we show that this approach provides full control over the speed and continuity of motion, thereby combining electrical and mechanical control at the molecular level over a wide range of temperatures. Moreover, chemistry can be used to change all key parameters of the device, enabling a variety of new experiments on molecular motors. Comment: 15 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge in}} electric vehicles with multiple motors {{is how to}} control the individual drivetrains {{in order to achieve}} measurable benefits in terms of vehicle cornering response, compared to conventional stability control systems actuating the friction brakes. This paper presents a direct yaw moment controller based on the combination of feedforward and feedback contributions for continuous yaw rate control. When the estimated sideslip exceeds a pre-defined threshold, a sideslip-based yaw moment contribution is activated. All yaw moment contributions are entirely tunable through model-based approaches, for reduced vehicle testing time. The purpose of the controller is to continuously modify the vehicle understeer characteristic in quasi-static conditions and increase yaw and sideslip damping during transients. Skid-pad, step-steer and sweep steer tests are carried out with a front-wheel-drive fully electric vehicle demonstrator with two independent drivetrains. The experimental test results of the <b>electric</b> motor-based <b>actuation</b> of the direct yaw moment controller are compared with those deriving from the friction brake-based actuation of the same algorithm, which is a major contribution of this paper. The novel results show that continuous direct yaw moment control allows significant "on-demand" changes of the vehicle response in cornering conditions and to enhance active vehicle safety during extreme driving maneuvers...|$|R

The present paper aims at the design and development of a four-fingered dextrous gripper with suitable electrical actuator system for transferring and transmitting flexural motions of the articulated fingers with suitable mechanical structures and tendons. Various hardware elements have been designed, constructed and evaluated for the dextrous hand. Each finger is having distal, proximal and metacarpophalangeal joints having three degrees of freedom so as to open and close with different postures for manipulating the objects with <b>electric</b> tendon <b>actuation</b> system.
