5|$|Most aerobic <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> (such as Pseudomonas, Legionella, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella) are {{resistant}} to clindamycin, as are the facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae. A notable exception is Capnocytophaga canimorsus, for which clindamycin is a first-line drug of choice.|$|E
5|$|The latex {{contains}} sesquiterpene pigments with guaiane skeletons; {{these include}} the compounds given the common names lactaroviolin and sangol. Some of these chemicals are thought to undergo enzymatic conversions when the fruit body becomes injured. Fruit body extracts {{have been shown to}} have some antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria.</b>|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests show}} that fruit bodies have {{antimicrobial}} activity against several strains of drug-resistant bacteria that are pathogenic in humans. Extracts inhibit {{the growth of}} the <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes, and kill the Gram-positive species Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus agalactiae and S.pyogenes. A separate study demonstrated growth inhibition against Proteus vulgaris.|$|E
40|$|A <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacterium</b> {{useful for}} genetically {{engineering}} plants is provided. The <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacterium</b> contains, {{as part of}} genome, an inducible regulatory sequence operatively linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding a levansucrase. Alternatively, the <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacterium</b> comprises a recombinant nucleic acid construct containing an inducible regulatory sequence operatively linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding a levansucrase. Also provided are recombinant nucleic acid constructs comprising an inducible regulatory sequence operatively coupled to a nucleotide sequence encoding a levansucrase and a method for transforming plants using the <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacterium</b> of the present invention...|$|R

5|$|Linezolid has no {{clinically}} {{significant effect on}} most <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Pseudomonas and the Enterobacteriaceae, for instance, are not susceptible. In vitro, it is active against Pasteurella multocida, Fusobacterium, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella, Bordetella, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, and moderately active (having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains of 8mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae. It has also been used to great effect as a second-line treatment for Capnocytophaga infections.|$|E
5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{possess a}} thick cell wall containing {{many layers of}} peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A {{that is responsible for}} much of the toxicity of <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defence against eye infections.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, the FDA {{reported}} {{the results of}} a randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial comparing linezolid to vancomycin in the treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Patients treated with vancomycin could be switched to oxacillin or dicloxacillin if the bacteria that caused their infection was found to be susceptible, and patients in both groups (linezolid and vancomycin) could receive specific treatment against <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> if necessary. The study itself was published in January 2009.|$|E

5|$|Saccharolipids {{describe}} {{compounds in}} which fatty acids are linked {{directly to a}} sugar backbone, forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the LipidA component of the lipopolysaccharides in <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Typical lipidA molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine, which are derivatized {{with as many as}} seven fatty-acyl chains. The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in E. coli is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues.|$|E
5|$|Terphenylquinones are {{chemical}} compounds that are widely distributed among the Basidiomycetes division of fungi. Ascocoryne sarcoides {{has been shown}} to contain a terphenylquinone named ascocorynin—a chemical derivative of the compound benzoquinone. This pigment, when in alkaline solution, turns a dark violet, similar in color to the fruit bodies of the fungus. Ascocorynin has moderate antibiotic activity, and was shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria, including the widely distributed food spoilage organism Bacillus stearothermophilus; however, it has no effect on the growth on <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria,</b> nor does it have any anti-fungal activity.|$|E
5|$|The prepatellar bursa and the {{olecranon}} bursa {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to become infected, or septic. Septic bursitis typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection to be caused by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. It is highly unusual for septic bursitis to be caused by anaerobes, fungi, or <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria.</b> In very rare cases, the infection can be caused by tuberculosis.|$|E

5|$|Azotobacter is a genus of usually motile, oval or spherical {{bacteria}} that form thick-walled cysts and may produce {{large quantities of}} capsular slime. They are aerobic, free-living soil microbes which {{play an important role}} in the nitrogen cycle in nature, binding atmospheric nitrogen, which is inaccessible to plants, and releasing it in the form of ammonium ions into the soil (nitrogen fixation). In addition to being a model organism for studying diazotrophs, it is used by humans for the production of biofertilizers, food additives, and some biopolymers. The first representative of the genus, Azotobacter chroococcum, was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck. Azotobacter species are <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> found in neutral and alkaline soils, in water, and in association with some plants.|$|E

25|$|Secretion is {{one method}} of {{transferring}} substances across the bacterial outer membrane. <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{have very different}} cell wall structures in comparison to Gram-positive bactera. <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> have three layers: The innermost layer is named the inner membrane; the middle layer, named the periplasmic space, is a space containing {{a thin layer of}} peptidoglycan; and the third layer is named the outer membrane, which contains lipopolysaccharides.|$|E

25|$|Lyme {{disease is}} caused by spirochetal {{bacteria}} from the genus Borrelia. Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella, along with an outer membrane similar to other <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Because of their double-membrane envelope, Borrelia bacteria are often mistakenly described as Gram negative despite the considerable differences in their envelope components from <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The Lyme-related Borrelia species are collectively known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, and show {{a great deal of}} genetic diversity.|$|E
