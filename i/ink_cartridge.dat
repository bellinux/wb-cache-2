2500|$|Another {{application}} of CE [...] in forensic is ink analysis where the discrimination of inkjet printing inks {{is becoming more}} necessary due to increasingly frequent counterfeiting of documents printed by inkjet printers. The chemical composition of inks provides very important information in cases of fraudulent documents and counterfeit banknotes. Micellar electrophoretic capillary chromatography [...] (MECC) has been developed and applied {{to the analysis of}} inks which extracted from paper, Due to its high resolving power relative to inks containing several chemically very similar substances, differences between inks from the same manufacturer can also be distinguished. This makes it suitable for evaluating the origin of documents based on the chemical composition of inks. It is worth noting that because of the possible compatibility of the same cartridge with different printer models, the differentiation of inks {{on the basis of their}} MECC electrophoretic profiles is a more reliable method for the determination of the <b>ink</b> <b>cartridge</b> of origin (its producer and cartridge number) rather than the printer model of origin.|$|E

He attended Interlochen Center for the Arts as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school. Page holds a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering from the University of Michigan, with honors and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University. [...] While at the University of Michigan, Page created an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks (literally a line plotter), after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply {{with the use of}} inkjet cartridges—Page reverse-engineered the <b>ink</b> <b>cartridge,</b> and built all of the electronics and mechanics to drive it. Page served {{as the president of the}} Beta Epsilon chapter of the Eta Kappa Nu fraternity, and was a member of the 1993 [...] "Maize & Blue" [...] University of Michigan Solar Car team. As an undergrad at the University of Michigan, he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a PRT System which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger. He also developed a business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time.|$|E

50|$|A click pen {{has several}} parts to it: the frame, a thruster, two cams, a guide pin, a spring, an <b>ink</b> <b>cartridge</b> with ink, a ballpoint {{at the end}} of the cartridge, and other parts that may vary.

When the button end of the pen is pressed, the system moves from one position to the other. The guide pin is typically molded into the frame of the pen.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ink</b> <b>cartridges</b> are {{typically}} priced at $13 to $75 per ounce ($1,664 to $9,600 per gallon) of ink, meaning that refill cartridges sometimes cost a substantial {{fraction of the}} cost of the printer. To save money, many people use compatible <b>ink</b> <b>cartridges</b> from a vendor other than the printer manufacturer. Others use aftermarket inks, refilling their own <b>ink</b> <b>cartridges</b> using a kit that includes bulk ink. The high cost of cartridges has also provided an incentive for counterfeiters to supply cartridges falsely claiming to be made by the original manufacturer. The print cartridge industry lost an estimated $3 billion in 2009 due to this, according to an International Data Corporation estimate.|$|R
