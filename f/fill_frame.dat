This spacecraft will carry high resolution instruments capable of generating large volumes of earth science data at rates up to 150 Mbps. Data will be transmitted in a packet format based upon the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Advanced Orbiting Systems (AOS) recommendations. The Data Systems Technology Division (DSTD) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has developed a set of high performance CCSDS return-link processing systems to support testing and verification of the EOS-AM spacecraft. These CCSDS processing systems use Versa Module Eurocard bus (VMEBus) Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) -based processing modules developed for the EOS ground segment to acquire and handle the high rate EOS data. Functions performed by these systems include frame synchronization, Reed-Solomon error correction, <b>fill</b> <b>frame</b> removal, virtual channel sorting, packet service processing, and data quality accounting. The first of the systems was delivered in October 1994 to support testing of the onboard formatting equipment. The second and third systems, delivered in April 1995, support spacecraft checkout and verification. This paper will describe the function and implementation of these systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{subject is}} steeped with opinion, {{prejudice}} and fact in a recipe similar to politics. Some issues are understood, definable and reflected in market prices. We all {{are aware of}} body weight, <b>fill,</b> <b>frame,</b> and flesh influences on price and value. Unfortunately, these four factors are inadequate for identifying {{as much of the}} profit potential differences between feeder cattle as we would like. As the industry pushes to find sources of profitable cattle, a much broader range of issues is being addressed. The motives and rationales behind these promotions deserve serious scrutiny. We need to distinguish between opinion, prejudice and fact. Ranchers, growers and feedlot operators all need to recognize the factors that improve the total biologic and economic efficiency of producing beef. Then, they need to identify realistic, complimentary management strategies between each segment of beef production. The first step in analyzing the system is to recognize everyone 2 ̆ 7 s primary business objective. Ranchers are trying to generate cash from grass and fodder resources. Feedlots are trying to increase the cash value of grains. Custom feedlots are trying to sell a unique service. Stocker-growers are trying to generate cash from forages and/or may be offering services by upgrading 2 ̆ 2 quality 2 ̆ 2 in feeder cattle. Packers are offering another unique service. Since the primary business objective differs between each segment of the industry, the marginal value of various factors changes. Feed cost/gain has little influence on the value of the packer service. Reproductive efficiency is of no direct concern when feedlots are increasing the value of corn. Even so, we are all highly dependent upon the economic viability of each other and need to respect the needs in each segment of the industry. The purpose here is to outline industry needs that ranchers can influence...|$|E

40|$|Session 1 - 2 Levels of {{participation}} {{and their impact}} on interactional issue framing in a water area planning process Greet François 1, Art Dewulf 2, Tharsi Taillieu 1 1 K. U. Leuven - Research group for Work, Organisational and Personnel Psychology 2 Wageningen University - Public Administration and Policy Group This paper is an analysis of a participatory process to define a water management plan for the area between the Kromme Rijn and the Amsterdam-Rijn canal in The Netherlands. The waterboard has initiated an interactive decision-making process, in order to analyze problems, devise solutions and develop the plan in a concerted way with the stakeholders involved. A sequence of stakeholder meetings took place, structured in different ways and thereby allowing for diverse levels {{of participation}} and interaction. The central research question is how the different levels of participation observed in the stakeholder meetings affect the interactional process of framing the issues in the problem domain. We therefore analysed different stakeholder meetings in the abovementioned participatory process and compared the interaction setting and the interactional framing processes. Based on meeting recordings, transcripts, field notes and documents, we identified levels of participation (information, consultation, active involvement) and we analyzed the ongoing interactional process of framing through discourse analysis. We identified three qualitatively different interactional framing processes which we will refer to as <b>frame</b> selling, <b>frame</b> <b>filling</b> and <b>frame</b> negotiation, which emerged in this sequence {{in the course of the}} participatory process. The information meeting was dominated by frame selling. In the consultation meeting frame selling occurred and <b>frame</b> <b>filling</b> was added. Only in the third meeting, characterized by active involvement, after an episode of frame selling and <b>frame</b> <b>filling,</b> <b>frame</b> negotiation occurred, allowing the issue framing to become more differentiated and with more potential for reframing...|$|R

40|$|Gesture. Our {{approach}} to pen-based gesture recognition is to decompose pen strokes into sequences of basic shapes such as line, arc, arrow, circle, cross [...] . [5] The same gesture shape may mean different things {{depending on the}} surrounding context, hence each gesture component is augmented by gesture contexts indicating spatial relationships between the gesture and nearby objects in the user interface. Handwriting. Our MS-TDNN-based handwriting recognizer [6] is capable of processing writer-independent, continuous (cursive) handwriting at a recognition rate of 94 % on a 20, 000 -word vocabulary and working on the run-on mode. We employ simple heuristics to decide when to invoke handwriting recognition on pen input, e. g., when the gesture recognizer cannot identify the input strokes as basic shapes. 5. 2. Joint Interpretation In order {{to make sense of}} input from all available sources, we need a multimodal interpreter capable of producing an interpretation of user intent (e. g., a command to execute in the application interface) from the output of the modality processors. In our joint interpretation scheme, the user intent is represented by a frame consisting of slots specifying pieces of information such as the action to carry out or the parameters for that action. Recognition output from the modality processors are parsed into partially <b>filled</b> <b>frames</b> that are merged together to produce the combined interpretation as described in [5]. This technique leads to uniform handling of highlevel information from all input sources, which is very important for modularity and extensibility. To add another input modality we need only provide a module to convert low-level recognizer output to a partially <b>filled</b> <b>frame</b> to be merged with others. In addition, context information can be retained across input events by merging with previous interpretation frames. 6.

The load applied to the floors was the gravity load corresponding to the current useful loading, after which the load was applied horizontally up to the maximum bending imposed in the horizontal plane. Instruments were used to steadily check the deformations and rotations induced by the moving side. The maximum response of the floor to horizontal seismic loads was tested and the possibility to consider such elements as significantly rigid elements in the horizontal plane and their computer design were analyzed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} authors {{analyzed}} how changes {{appear in the}} way stakeholders frame and reframe the issues and their stake in a water area planning process. They took on a discursive perspective and focused on {{what happens in the}} interaction between stakeholders. Three aspects of change were observed: the differentiation of issue framing and stake of the process initiator, the internal differentiation of issue framing and stake of one interest party, and changes in the mode of interaction. With regard to the modes of interaction three different processes were distinguished: <b>frame</b> selling, <b>frame</b> <b>filling</b> and <b>frame</b> negotiation. It was concluded that the differentiation of issues and stakes is an important kind of change in decision-making processes and that multidirectional frame negotiation is helpful to achieve an integrated agreement...|$|R
