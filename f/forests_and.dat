40|$|Since {{the last}} few decades, there is an {{increasing}} recognition of the contribution of <b>forest</b> <b>and</b> environmental resources to rural poverty. Using data from two rural villages in Mozambique, this study aimed to assess the contribution of <b>forest</b> <b>and</b> environmental resources to rural poverty incidence, depth and severity on the one hand, and the dependency of rural poor and non-poor households on <b>forest</b> <b>and</b> environmental resources on the other. The three variants of the FGT poverty index, with <b>and</b> without <b>forest</b> <b>and</b> environmental income, and the relative shares of each livelihood activities to the total income accounting {{of the poor and}} the non-poor were estimated. The results indicate that <b>forest</b> <b>and</b> environmental income was the second important livelihood activity to both poor and non-poor households next to crop production – contributing about 22. 46 and 24. 14 percent to the poor and non-poor sample households respectively. With regard to the contribution of <b>forest</b> <b>and</b> environmental resources to rural poverty, dramatic increase in the incidence, depth and severity of poverty were observed when <b>forest</b> <b>and</b> environmental income was excluded from sample households’ total income accounting. These indicate that <b>forest</b> <b>and</b> environmental resources are crucial to the livelihood of the poor and to the reduction in the incidence, depth and severity of poverty. Therefore, any exclusion of <b>forest</b> <b>and</b> environmental resources use while assessing poverty leads to underestimation of rural income and miscalculation of rural poverty incidence, depth and severity which ultimately misguide policy interventions...|$|R
