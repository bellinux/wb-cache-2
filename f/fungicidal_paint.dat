3000|$|Control of this pest is {{extremely}} difficult because of their concealed habit (Dantanarayana and Fernando 1970). Current recommendations for managing this pest include planting of tolerant cultivars. Application of <b>fungicidal</b> <b>paint</b> (Bacor 3 PA) to protect prune cuts from decay and removal of decayed wood at pruning to remove initial colonies (Anonymous 2003). It was reported that chemical and classical biological control methods are not efficient in the field (Vitarana 1988). Therefore {{there is a need}} to explore other potential methods to incorporate present Integrated Pest Management of G. dilatatus. There is an increasing interest in the use of semiochemicals for insect pest management. Semiochemicals of tea stem may affect the behavior of LCLWT and potential use of these extracts to control the test insect has not been investigated extensively. Similar studies have been reported to control other economically important pests in agriculture. Blend of volatile compounds of coconut stems and pheromone of Red Palm Weevil, Rynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) gave efficient control of R. Ferrugenius (Gunawardana and Swarnakanthi 1995). Semiochemicals which emit by the decayed wood of the host plant have been investigated by many scientists and confirmed that the decayed wood of the host plant and wood decay fungi play an important role to attract termites. Pine wood decayed by the fungus, Lenzites [...]...|$|E
