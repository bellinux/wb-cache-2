5|$|The listed items {{consist of}} {{materials}} such as wood over clay or to bronze. Often the articles were decorated {{using a variety of}} artistic techniques like gilding of precious metals, line engraving, maki-e, mother of pearl <b>inlay</b> or lacquer. The objects are housed in Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines or museums.|$|E
5|$|According to the <b>inlay</b> {{which comes}} with the Special Edition, all {{previous}} CD editions of the Primary & Secondary Phases played back slightly fast due to capstan wear on the mastering tape machine, {{with the result that}} the audio was pitch-shifted up by half a semitone. That was corrected for the special editions and has the effect of making the episodes nearly a minute longer.|$|E
40|$|Ten IPS/Empress {{pressed glass}} ceramic <b>inlays</b> were {{cemented}} in box-shaped, non-beveled, Class II, posterior cavities. They were evaluated clinically according to modified US Public Health Service criteria after 1. 5 years in vivo. In addition, quantitative marginal {{analysis was performed}} immediately after placement of the <b>inlays</b> and at the 1. 5 -year recall. Clinical evaluation revealed that the <b>inlays</b> performed well after 1. 5 years; all <b>inlays</b> received scores of Alfa or Beta for all criteria evaluated. Scanning electron microscopic examination indicated that the excellent initial marginal adaptation decreased significantly over 1. 5 year...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most popular}} (1) {{involves}} single <b>inlays</b> on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, double <b>inlays</b> on the 12th, single <b>inlays</b> on the 15th, 17th, 19th, and 21st, and if present, double <b>inlays</b> on the 24th. Advantages of such scheme include its symmetry about the 12th fret and symmetry of every half (0-12 and 12-24) about the 7th and 19th frets. However, playing these frets, for example, on the E string would yield the notes E, G, A, B, C# that barely make a complete musical mode by themselves.|$|R
50|$|Form liner textures were popularized in {{the early}} 1970s with graphic <b>inlays.</b> In 1972, form liner {{manufacturers}} created a fluted form liner with graphic <b>inlays</b> of shrimp boats, a famous crawfish wrapped around an oil bearing, tug boats and race boats.

5|$|Badshahi Mosque was {{commissioned}} by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1671, with construction of the mosque lasting for two years until 1673. The mosque is an important example of Mughal architecture, with an exterior that is decorated with carved red sandstone with marble <b>inlay.</b> It remains {{the largest and most}} recent of the grand imperial mosques of the Mughal-era, and is the second-largest mosque in Pakistan. After the fall of the Mughal Empire, the mosque was used as a garrison by the Sikh Empire and the British Empire, but is now one of Pakistan's most iconic sights.|$|E
5|$|The main edifice at {{the site}} was also built from red sandstone, and is {{decorated}} with white marble <b>inlay.</b> The prayer chamber has a central arched niche with five niches flanking it which are about one third {{the size of the}} central niche. The mosque has three marble domes, the largest of which is located in the centre of the mosque, and which is flanked by two smaller domes.|$|E
5|$|As {{a gateway}} to the west, and Persia in particular, Lahore had a strong {{regional}} style which was heavily influenced by Persian architectural styles. Earlier mosques, such as the Wazir Khan Mosque, were adorned in intricate kashi kari, or Kashan style tile work, from which the Badshahi Mosque would depart. Aurangzeb chose an architectural plan {{similar to that of}} Shah Jehan's choice for the Jama Masjid in Delhi, though built the Badshahi mosque on a much larger scale. Both mosques feature red sandstone with white marble <b>inlay,</b> which is a departure from typical mosque design in Lahore, in which decoration is done by means of intricate tile work.|$|E

In August 2016, he released a final patch for the computer releases of Fez that included performance improvements, {{as a result of a}} unified codebase under an open source software library, and features such as a speedrun mode.|$|E
5|$|The Mysore {{painting}} {{style is}} {{an offshoot of}} the Vijayanagar school of painting, and King Raja Wodeyar (1578–1617 CE) is credited with having been its patron. The distinctive feature of these paintings is the gesso work, to which gold foil is applied. Mysore is known for rosewood <b>inlay</b> work; around 4,000 craftsmen were estimated to be involved in this art in 2002. The city lends its name to the Mysore silk saree, a women's garment made with pure silk and gold zari (thread). Mysore Peta, the traditional indigenous turban worn by the erstwhile rulers of Mysore, is worn by men in some traditional ceremonies. A notable local dessert that traces its history to the kitchen in the Mysore palace is Mysore pak.|$|E
5|$|The large armlet of pierced gold (opus interrasile) showed {{traces of}} {{hematite}} {{on the reverse}} side, which {{probably would have been}} used as a type of jeweller's rouge. This is the earliest known and documented use of this technique on Roman jewellery. Gilt items showed the presence of mercury, indicating the mercury gilding technique. The black <b>inlay</b> on the cast silver tigress shows the niello technique, but with silver sulphide rather than lead sulphide. The settings of stones where garnet and amethyst remain, in the body chain, have vacant places presumed to be where pearls were set, and show elemental sulphur as adhesive or filler.|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{polymeric}} <b>inlays,</b> patterned by nanoimprint lithography, {{are used}} to rapidly mass replicate pillar-like nanostructures by injection moulding. This is difficult to achieve with traditional nickel <b>inlays</b> due to the rapid heat transfer of the metal, which results in premature cooling of the molten polymer and improper filling of nanoscale features. Using hybrid <b>inlays,</b> nanopillars can reliably be stretched by up to 40 % of their designed height by adjusting moulding parameters. Hybrid <b>inlays</b> display longevity of more than 2000 cycles and can rapidly be fabricated to firmly establish injection moulding as an exceptionally useful tool for the high volume prototyping and production of nanopatterned polymeric devices...|$|R

5|$|Kodumanal {{was popular}} for the {{gem-cutting}} industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz {{are located in}} the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, <b>inlay</b> work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.|$|E
5|$|Organic finds {{are rarely}} well {{documented}} with hoards, because most coin and treasure finds are removed hastily by the finder or have previously been disrupted by farm work rather than excavated. The Hoxne organic finds included bone, wood and other plant material, and leather. Small fragments from a decorated ivory pyxis (a cylindrical lidded box) were found, {{along with more}} than 150 tiny shaped pieces of bone <b>inlay</b> or veneer, probably from a wooden box or boxes that have decayed. Minuscule fragments of wood adhering to metal objects were identified as belonging to nine species of timber, all native to Britain: wood traces associated with the iron fittings of the outer chest established that {{it was made of}} oak. Silver locks and hinges were from two small wooden boxes or caskets, one made of decorative cherry wood and one made of yew. Some wheat straw survived from padding between the plain silver bowls, which also bore faint traces of linen cloth. Leather fragments were too degraded for identification.|$|E
5|$|Saddles {{were made}} of wood and were {{designed}} as a standing platform for archers. They were not suited for riding long distances or at high speed. Early saddles of the Nara period were of Chinese style karagura and later modified for local tastes, resulting in Japanese style saddles from the Heian period onward. Artisans and carpenters {{became involved in the}} saddle production as saddles became more elaborate in the Kamakura period, with decorations in mother of pearl <b>inlay,</b> gold leaf and multiple coats of lacquer. Saddles ceased to be primarily utilitarian, instead serving as adornment showing the owner's status in processions. Three Japanese style lacquered wooden saddles and a complete set of a Chinese style ritual saddle, dating to the late Heian and Kamakura periods, have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E

5000|$|A good cue needn't be expensive. These [...] "collector" [...] cues have fine {{workmanship}} and use {{top quality}} materials. They {{are designed with}} ornate <b>inlays</b> in varying types of wood, precious metals and stones, all in a multitude of styles and sometimes displaying works of art. The <b>inlays</b> are stained, translucent, transparent or painted. These cues are also valued because of how well they perform. Competitors of custom cue makers and mass-production manufacturers usually try to make cues look like they are made of expensive materials by using overlays and decals. Although these {{lower the cost of}} the cues, they do not degrade the cues' effectiveness in game play. Another mark of quality is the precision with which <b>inlays</b> are set. High quality <b>inlays</b> fit perfectly with no gaps; they are symmetrical on all sides, as well as cut cleanly so that all edges and points are sharp, not rounded. The use of machines has aided much in the production of high quality <b>inlays</b> and other ornaments.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Inlays</b> and onlays {{are more}} {{expensive}} indirect restoration alternative to direct fillings. They {{are supposed to be}} more durable, but long-term studies did not always detect a significant lower failure rate of ceramic or composite [...] <b>inlays</b> compared to composite direct fillings.|$|R
5|$|Temple {{structures}} were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. Walls and other {{structures were}} built with large blocks of varying shapes. The blocks were laid in courses, usually without mortar. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones. To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated {{from the top}} down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor. Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, <b>inlay,</b> or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments {{with some kind of}} adhesive, possibly natural gum.|$|E
5|$|Lacquerware is {{produced}} in a three-step process: first the base is prepared. Most often the base consists of wood, {{but it can also}} be of paper or leather. Next is the application of lacquer, which hardens while drying, thereby sealing the base. Generally several layers of lacquer are applied. The lacquer is then decorated with a variety of methods. In the maki-e technique, a powdered metal (usually gold or silver) is sprinkled on the lacquer before completely hardened. This technique was developed and popular in the Heian period but continued to be used with refinements into the early modern period. Over the next centuries various other methods that employ precious metals were developed, such as the ikakeji technique originating in the Kamakura period in which a finely ground gold powder was spread in sufficient quantities to mimic solid gold. The use of metallic powders was complemented with other techniques such as polished shell <b>inlay</b> or gold leaf (kirikane). The former was used in the Heian and Kamakura periods and popular motifs included water, rocks, trees or flowers. Starting in the Kamakura period, larger and more solid objects such as toiletry chests were decorated with realistic images. Towards the end of the medieval period (late-16th century), simpler designs were favoured in decorations. Honami Kōetsu who lived around this time is the earliest lacquer artist known by name.|$|E
