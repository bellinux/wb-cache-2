For these two configurations, flow and heat transfer mechanics are significantly different.

Power modules are increasingly used in a variety of applications ranging from aircraft and mass transport systems, to motor control and power conversion in the home. Reliability of the power module is very important in aerospace applications where the highest levels of safety and robustness are required while keeping the volume and mass of the module as low as possible. Certain parts of the power module such as the solder layer beneath the silicon device and the substrate are prone to failure with thermal cycling. The layer of thermal grease between the baseplate of the module and the heatsink significantly increases the thermal resistance between the electronic devices and the coolant fluid. The power module can be constructed so that some of the interfaces within the module which are prone to failure are improved or completely removed from the assembly greatly reducing the thermal resistance from junction to ambient. The research identified cooling methods which are able to cope with the increasingly high heat fluxes produced by power electronic devices. <b>Jet</b> <b>impingement</b> cooling was selected for testing and further development.

Results from experimental tests showed that directly cooling the substrate tile with <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> resulted in the devices being cooled more effectively compared to the commonly used serpentine coldplate and a direct-baseplate cooled <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> system. It was postulated that more efficient cooling can be achieved by targeting the hotspots on the substrate beneath each device with a carefully designed impingement array. A test apparatus was constructed to test a variety of <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> arrays to confirm the hypothesis. A second test apparatus was constructed to characterise the performance of the jet arrays in more detail using a thermal imaging camera to monitor the surface temperature of a single device. An optimal jet configuration was found for the efficient cooling of a single device. The work concluded that an improvement in efficiency and reliability can be gained by constructing power modules with integrated <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> arrays direct-substrate cooling the hotspots beneath the devices.

40|$|Cooling system using <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> {{is already}} {{widely used in}} {{industries}} nowadays. There were various approaches that have been investigated {{in order to produce}} more efficient <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> cooling system. This thesis is study about the effect of the nozzle angle on <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> in order to identify the relationship in heat transfer. Besides, investigation on spacing distance between nozzle’s edge to the impingement surface and Reynolds number at certain angle also identified in this study. Those studies are needed parallel to the current researchers endeavor for future development of cooling system in global industries. The experiment were perform by vary 3 major parameters such as angle of the nozzle (30 ⁰, 45 ⁰, 60 ⁰, and 90 ⁰), distance between nozzle’s edge to the impinge surface (H/d= 2, 4, 6, and 8) and also Reynolds number (Re= 2300, 1960, 930 and 500). The heat source are heated at 100 ⁰C and cooled down by the flow of air from the nozzle. The heat source temperature after cooling are measured and collected. The result discovers about the relationship nozzle angle for <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> cooling system which is heat transfer are more efficient when the angle of nozzle approaching to the normal line as the Nusselt Number are more higher at 90 ⁰ in range 31. 5 w/m 2 K of heat transfer coefficient compare to the lower angles of the nozzle. Furthermore, higher Reynolds number and close range of distance between nozzle’s edges to impingement surface will also gives high Nusselt number which means both also effective cooling effects for the systems...|$|R

This paper presents an assessment of a novel technique that further enhances the heat transfer potential of a single impinging jet. The method entails a geometrical modification to the <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> surface wherein the jet is directed into a cylindrical cavity located coaxially beneath the jet orifice. A numerical study is performed to examine the parametric influence on heat dissipation and flow characteristics of this modified <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> process. The results indicate a very significant increase in heat transfer, which is primarily dependent on cavity depth and jet Reynolds number. cs 201...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA low {{temperature}} <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> based heat sink module {{has been developed}} for potential application in a near-term fusion power plant divertor. The design is composed {{of a number of}} hexagonal CuCrZr sheets bonded together in a stack to form a laminate structure. This method allows the production of complex flow paths using relatively simple manufacturing techniques. The thermo-fluid performance of a baseline design employing cascade <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> has been assessed and compared to a non-cascade case. Experimental validation of the numerical work was carried out on a scaled model using air as the working fluid. Local heat transfer coefficients were obtained on the surface using surface temperature data from thermochromic liquid crystals...|$|R

40|$|The {{use of an}} {{innovative}} <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> cooling system in a power electronics application is investigated using numerical analysis. The <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> system, outlined by Skuriat et al, consists {{of a series of}} cells each containing an array of holes. Cooling fluid is forced through the device, forming an array of <b>impingement</b> <b>jets.</b> The jets are arranged in a manner, which induces a high degree of mixing in the interface boundary layer. This increase in turbulent mixing is intended to induce higher Nusselt numbers and effective heat transfer coefficients. Enhanced cooling efficiency enables the power electronics module to operate at a lower temperature, greatly enhancing long-term reliability. The results obtained through numerical modelling deviates markedly from the experimentally derived data. The disparity is most likely due to the turbulence model selected and further analysis is required, involving evaluation of more advanced turbulence models...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{facility and}} some early results are described from a current research program modeling turbine disk cooling with multiple impinging jets, such as employed on the Space Shuttle Main Engine oxygen turbopump. The study {{is designed to}} obtain detailed local convection heat transfer rates on specially constructed turbine disk models that employ either multiple cooling <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> near the disk outer radius from a jet ring, or alternatively, single entrance coolant supply {{into the center of}} the disk cavity. <b>Jet</b> <b>impingement</b> is an effective scheme for cooling of turbine disks at or near the blade attachment region, but the heat transfer mechanisms and merits relative to other schemes are not well understood. The present study employs two specially constructed full scale plastic model disks, contoured and plane, together with the corresponding stators. Local heat transfer rates are determined by a computer vision system from the response of thin liquid crystal coatings applied to the disk test faces. The present results indicate that multiple <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> directed at the blade attachment region results in higher cooling rates in that region than does the same flow supplied to the disk center, but this conclusion must be regarded as tentative...|$|R
40|$|Liquid <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> cooling {{technique}} {{is critical in}} many industrial processes, such as fuel bundle cooling post-loss-of-coolant-accident in nuclear reactors, heat treatment of metal parts post-hot-processing, etc. The ability of liquid jets to extract high heat flux from metal parts, with temperatures as high as 800 - 1000 °C, at moderate flow rates has made them indispensable in these applications. The complex mechanism of flow boiling heat transfer during <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> cooling is not been well understood. This study presents a systematic methodology for the measurement and estimation of the temporospatial variation of heat transfer on the <b>impingement</b> surface during <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> cooling of extremely hot steel plate. The effect of <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> velocity and subcooling variations from 2. 5 to 10 m/s and 60 to 87 K, respectively, on the temporospatial heat transfer variation on the impingement surface is reported. A gradually growing circular wetted region, with its periphery named as the wetting front, forms soon after the cooling starts but its velocity decreases as it grows in diameter. A local maximum in the surface heat flux closely follows the wetting front, with the local maximum heat flux reducing with distance from the stagnation point. The wetting front velocity and local maximum heat flux increase with both the jet velocity and subcooling. The enhancement in the local film velocity and subcooling result in a strong suppression of boiling activity and, resultantly, high heat transfer rates at plate surface temperatures in much excess of the critical temperature of the coolant is achieved. This observation confirms the industrial practice of using impinging jets for accelerated cooling of hot steel plates...|$|R
