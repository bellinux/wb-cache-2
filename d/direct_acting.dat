2500|$|In {{contrast}} to hepatitis A and B, progression to chronic hepatitis C {{is much more}} common. The ultimate goal of hepatitis C treatment is prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The best {{way to reduce the}} long-term risk of HCC is to achieve sustained virological response (SVR). SVR is defined as an undetectable viral load at 12 weeks after treatment completion and indicates a cure. Currently available treatments include indirect and <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antiviral drugs. The indirect acting antivirals include pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), which in combination have historically been the basis of therapy for HCV. Duration of and response to these treatments varies based on genotype. These agents are poorly tolerated but are still used in some resource-poor areas. In high-resource countries, they have been supplanted by <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antiviral agents, which first appeared in 2011; these agents target proteins responsible for viral replication and include the following three classes: ...|$|E

2500|$|As steamships grew {{steadily}} {{in size and}} tonnage {{through the course of}} the 19th century, the need for low profile, low centre-of-gravity engines correspondingly declined. Freed increasingly from these design constraints, engineers were able to revert to simpler, more efficient and more easily maintained designs. The result was the growing dominance of the so-called [...] "vertical" [...] engine (more correctly known as the vertical inverted <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> engine).|$|E
2500|$|Built in 1866 by Akers Mekaniske Verksted in Christiania in Norway, Ellengowan was {{originally}} named Nøkken. She {{was built for}} Mr D. Hegermann. The vessel was 79 feet (24.08 metres) long, 15 feet (4.57m) wide, had a depth of 8 feet (2.49m) and had a gross register tonnage of 58. She was powered by sail and a vertical <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> steam engine. Steam was supplied by a round [...] "scotch" [...] type boiler.|$|E
2500|$|These {{drugs are}} used in various combinations, {{sometimes}} combined with ribavirin, based on the patient's genotype (delineated as genotypes 1-6). Genotype 1 (GT1), {{which is the most}} prevalent genotype in the United States and around the world, can now be cured with a <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antiviral regimen. First-line therapy for GT1 is a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) for 12 weeks for most patients, including those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Certain patients with early disease need only 8 weeks of treatment while those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who have not responded to prior treatment require 24 weeks. Cost remains a major factor limiting access to these drugs, particularly in low-resource nations; the cost of the 12-week GT1 regimen (SOF/LDV) [...] has been estimated at US$94,500.|$|E
