25|$|Myiasis often {{occurs in}} wild, and {{domestic}} animals. In particular, rabbits, pigs, dogs and sheep can be victims of “blowfly strike” {{because of the}} urine or fecal matter stuck to their fur, fleece, or <b>hind</b> <b>quarters</b> through neglect, poor captivity and living conditions, or ill-health. “Blowfly strike” is a well-recognized and economically damaging problem primarily seen in sheep. “Blowfly strike” is estimated to cost the Australian sheep industry at least $161 million annually. 9 of the 10 cases submitted by the British Columbia Veterinary Medical Association stated that the insects colonizing most animals were the metallic Blue-Green Blow Fly (Lucilia illustris, Meigen) or the Green Bottle Fly (Phaenicia sericata, Meigen). In the one case, the larvae of botfly (Cuterebra jellison, Curran) colonized a pet rabbit. Lucilia illustris and Phaenicia sericata are common and ubiquitous blow fly species that are frequently reported in forensic cases involving human homicide and wildlife crime.|$|E
25|$|Hyenas have {{relatively}} short torsos and are fairly massive and wolf-like in build, but have lower <b>hind</b> <b>quarters,</b> high withers and their backs slope noticeably downward toward their rumps. The forelegs are high, while the hind legs are very short and their necks are thick and short. Their skulls superficially {{resemble those of}} large canids, but are much larger and heavier, with shorter facial portions. Hyenas are digitigrade, with the fore and hind paws having four digits each and sporting bulging pawpads. Like canids, hyenas have short, blunt, non-retractable claws. Their pelage is sparse and coarse with poorly developed or absent underfur. Most species have a rich mane of long hair running from the withers or from the head. With {{the exception of the}} spotted hyena, hyaenids have striped coats, which they likely inherited from their viverrid ancestors. Their ears are large and have simple basal ridges and no marginal bursa. Their vertebral column, including the cervical region are of limited mobility. Hyenas have no baculum. Hyenas have an additional pair of ribs than canids, and their tongues are rough like those of felids and viverrids. Males in most hyena species are larger than females, though the spotted hyena is exceptional, as it is the female of the species that outweighs and dominates the male. Also, unlike other hyenas, the female spotted hyena's external genitalia closely resembles that of the male.|$|E

I am starving," [...] and the ape-man looked down upon the lion beneath him and smiled, a slow quizzical smile, and then he shifted the carcass from his {{shoulder}} to the branch before him and, drawing the long blade that had been his father's, deftly cut off a <b>hind</b> <b>quarter</b> and, wiping the bloody blade upon Bara's smooth coat, he returned it to its scabbard. Numa, with watering jaws, {{looked up at the}} tempting meat and whined again and the ape-man smiled down upon him his slow smile and, raising the <b>hind</b> <b>quarter</b> in his strong brown hands buried his teeth in the tender, juicy flesh.|$|R
50|$|Restructured steak is a {{catch-all}} term {{to describe}} a class of imitation beef steaks made from smaller pieces of beef fused together by a binding agent. Its development started from the 1970s. Restructured steak is sometimes made using cheaper cuts of beef such as the <b>hind</b> <b>quarter</b> or fore quarter of beef.|$|R
50|$|Athenaeus, {{quoting the}} lost {{work of the}} 1st/2nd century BC Greek {{historian}} and geographer Posidonius, says that it was formerly the custom among the Celts for the <b>hind</b> <b>quarter</b> of pork to be claimed by the bravest man, and disputes over who this was would be settled by single combat to the death. Diodorus Siculus also says that the Celts gave the best joints of meat to the most distinguished men.|$|R
500|$|Fur colour varies greatly {{and changes}} with age. Unlike the fur of the striped and brown hyena, {{that of the}} spotted hyena {{consists}} of spots rather than stripes and is much shorter, lacking the well defined spinal mane of the former two species. The base colour generally is a pale greyish-brown or yellowish-grey on which an irregular pattern of roundish spots is superimposed {{on the back and}} <b>hind</b> <b>quarters.</b> The spots, which are of variable distinction, may be reddish, deep brown or almost blackish. The spots vary in size, even on single individuals, but are commonly [...] in diameter. A less distinct spot pattern is present on the legs and belly but not on the throat and chest. A set of five, pale and barely distinct bands replace the spots on the back and sides of the neck. A broad, medial band is present {{on the back of the}} neck, and is lengthened into a forward facing crest. The crest is mostly reddish-brown in colour. The crown and upper part of the face is brownish, save for a white band above both eyes, though the front of the eyes, the area around the rhinarium, the lips and the back portion of the chin are all blackish. The limbs are spotted, though the feet vary in colour, from light brown to blackish. The fur is relatively sparse and consists of two hair types; moderately fine underfur (measuring [...] ) and long, stout bristle hairs (...) [...] European Paleolithic rock art depicting the species indicates that the Eurasian populations retained the spots of their modern-day African counterparts.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the lying down {{behaviour}} of sows was analyzed {{to find out}} whether there are differences in the amount of crushed piglets per litter when sows show varying lying down behaviour. The lying down behaviour of the sows, litter size, number of stillborn piglets and number of dead piglets and cause of death during the weaning period were recorded. The data was collected on seven organic farms in Austria and on two agricultural research stations. It was shown that animals that lie down slowly crush fewer piglets than sows that let their <b>hind</b> <b>quarter</b> drop quickly to the floor...|$|R
2500|$|James Backhouse, a well-travelled Quaker of {{the early}} colonial period, gives the {{following}} account: [...] "At Colongatta, in Shoal Haven...district, which, like that of Illawarra, is much more favorable for the grazing of horned cattle than for sheep. Among the enemies of the latter in these rich, coast lands, is the Wattle Tick, a hard flat insect of a dark colour, about the tenth of an inch in diameter, and nearly circular, in the body; it insinuates itself beneath the skin, and destroys, not only sheep, but sometimes foals and calves. Paralysis of the <b>hind</b> <b>quarters</b> often precedes death in these cases. Sometimes it occasions painful swellings, when forcibly removed from the human body, after having fixed its anchor-like head and appendages in the skin. To prevent this inconvenience, we several times, made them let go their hold, by smearing them over with oil, or with wet tobacco ashes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The rack, {{like other}} {{intermediate}} gaits, is smoother than the trot because the hooves hitting the ground individually rather in pairs minimizes {{the force and}} bounce the horse transmits to the rider. [...] To achieve this gait the horse must be in a [...] "hollow position". This means that, instead of a rounded back as seen in dressage horses and others that work off their <b>hind</b> <b>quarters,</b> the spine is curved somewhat downward. [...] This puts the racking horse {{in the best position}} to rack without breaking into another gait. If the rider sits back or leans slightly back, this will encourage the hollow position. This allows the hind legs to trail and makes the rack easier for the horse. [...] The downside of this is that this position weakens the back and makes the horse less able to carry the weight of the rider without strain.|$|E
2500|$|Sows usually {{produce their}} first litter {{at the age}} of 3–5years, with those living in more {{developed}} areas tending to get pregnant at younger ages. The breeding period usually occurs in the June–July period, though it can extend to August in the species' northern range. The breeding period lasts for 2–3months. Both sexes are promiscuous. Males try to mate with several females, but large, dominant ones may violently claim a female if another mature male comes near. Sows tend to be short-tempered with their mates after copulating. The fertilized eggs undergo delayed development and do not implant in the female's womb until November. The gestation period lasts 235days, and litters are usually born in late January to early February. Litter size is between one and six cubs, typically two or three. At birth, cubs weigh , and measure [...] in length. They are born with fine, gray, down-like hair, and their <b>hind</b> <b>quarters</b> are underdeveloped. They typically open their eyes after 28–40days, and begin walking after 5weeks. Cubs are dependent on their mother's milk for 30weeks, and will reach independence at 16–18months. At the age of six weeks, they attain , by 8weeks they reach [...] and by the age of 6months they weigh [...] They reach sexual maturity {{at the age of}} three years, and attain their full growth at 5years.|$|E
60|$|From {{the lips}} of the ape-man broke a {{rumbling}} growl of warning. Numa answered {{but he did not}} advance. Instead he stood waving his tail gently to and fro, and presently Tarzan squatted upon his kill and cut a generous portion from a <b>hind</b> <b>quarter.</b> Numa eyed him with growing resentment and rage as, between mouthfuls, the ape-man growled out his savage warnings. Now this particular lion had never before come in contact with Tarzan of the Apes and he was much mystified. Here was the appearance and the scent of a man-thing and Numa had tasted of human flesh and learned that though not the most palatable it was certainly by far the easiest to secure, yet there was that in the bestial growls of the strange creature which reminded him of formidable antagonists and gave him pause, while his hunger and the odor of the hot flesh of Bara goaded him almost to madness. Always Tarzan watched him, guessing what was passing in the little brain of the carnivore and well it was that he did watch him, for at last Numa could stand it no longer. His tail shot suddenly erect and at the same instant the wary ape-man, knowing all too well what the signal portended, grasped the remainder of the deer's <b>hind</b> <b>quarter</b> between his teeth and leaped into a nearby tree as Numa charged him with all the speed and a sufficient semblance of the weight of an express train.|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the influence of}} the number of milkings, number of births, and udder quarter in immunoglobulin (Ig) concentration in the colostrum of healthy Holstein cows. It was collected two samples of colostrum by manual milking, getting the first jets to completion of bacteriological examination and immunoglobulin levels by radial immunodiffusion test in agar gel. Positive samples for bacteriological examination were excluded from this investigation. Medians of immunoglobulin's G, A and M in the colostrum collected before the first and second milking were respectively 9, 200 and 6, 400 mg/dL (p= 0. 0029); 400 and 200 mg/dL (p= 0. 0018); 800 and 400 mg/dL (p= 0. 0001). Median immunoglobulin concentration in animals that calved once, twice or three times or in cows that calved 4 to 6 times were 6, 400; 6, 400; 3, 200 and 11, 200 mg/dL IgG; 100, 200, 100 and 800 mg/dL IgA; and 400, 400, 100 and 800 mg/dL IgM, respectively. Concentrations of IgG, IgA and IgM were greater in animals that calved more than 4 times (p< 0. 05). Medians of IgG, IgA and IgM in the right fore <b>quarter</b> (RF), right <b>hind</b> <b>quarter</b> (RH), left fore quarter (LF) and left <b>hind</b> <b>quarter</b> (LH) were, respectively, 7, 800; 6, 400; 7, 800 and 6, 400 mg/dL; 200, 200, 200 and 200 mg/dL; and 400, 400, 400 and 400 mg/dL. Ig concentrations in the colostrum of Holstein cows were influenced by the number of milkings after delivery and number of lactations. These variations may be considered risk factors to passive immunity transfer to newborn calves, predisposing them to diseases and causing economic losses to dairy production...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine {{the relationship between the}} ratio of the bones and valuable meat preparates to the carcass, the age and the sex parameters in Holstein and Swiss Braun race cattle which are widely breaded in our country. The half and quarter carcasses of the cattle that are slaughtered in Istanbul were used as working material. The carcasses were separated into 4 groups as above 3 years of age group (n= 24), under 3 years of age group (n= 46), male group (n= 53) and female group (n= 17). Totally 140 carcasses were evaluated. According to the obtained results, <b>hind</b> <b>quarter</b> weight, fillet, loin, rump, tranche, sirloin, round, flank, shank, brisket, fore loin, sticking, chuck and total bones parameters were significantly different at (p< 0. 001) level between above the 3 years of age and under the 3 years of age group. Between the same groups the sirloin tip parameter was significantly different at p< 0. 01 level.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} if any effect can be registered with an inertial motion sensor unit on lame horses and on horses' back movement, caused by the Equiband™ system. Within a period of six weeks, six mildly lame horses were measured four days. The weeks were divided as followed: two weeks measurements, two weeks as a 'wash out'-period and two weeks measurements again. The horses were led in-hand in walk and trot in a straight line on a hard surface. Five 'exercise' conditions were defined: 1) No Equiband™, 2) With only abdominal band, 3) With both bands on the same time, 4) With only <b>hind</b> <b>quarter</b> band and 5) No Equiband™. Condition 1 was used as the baseline, and differences between condition 1 and the other 4 conditions were calculated. These differences were the results used for the statistical analysis and were named condition 12 - 11, 13 - 11, 14 - 11 and 15 - 11. Eight inertial motion sensors measuring rotational and translational acceleration and orientation were used to determine back movement and movement symmetry as an indicator for lameness. The Equiband™ system was not found to have a statistically significant effect on the lameness of horses, indicated by the movement symmetry. In walk a higher range of motion in dorso-ventral back movement of the thoracic and lumbar spines was visible for the horses wearing both bands or only the <b>hind</b> <b>quarter</b> band than for the same horses wearing only the abdominal band or no Equiband™. In trot the dorso-ventral movement of the back, starting at the lumbar spines, and the medio-lateral movement from the thoracic and lumbar spines in trot showed a significant decrease in the range of motion when the horses were wearing the Equibands™ in comparison with the condition in which the horses were not wearing any Equibands™...|$|R
