Nunn reinforced that agenda during a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School on October 21, 2008, saying, [...] "I’m much more concerned about a terrorist without a return address that cannot be deterred than I am about deliberate war between nuclear powers.

For the 'Killers,' that wasn't the case. They were all about the killing." [...] They are first seen in the 2009 Predator series, where a number interfere in an East African civil war, coming into conflict with both humans and their Hunter counterparts. By the time of Three World War the Killers are assumed to have been wiped out by the Hunters, but some survive and begin attacking human colonies, forcing Noguchi to forge an alliance between humans and the Hunters {{in order to deal with}} them.|$|E
