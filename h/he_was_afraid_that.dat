5|$|On Monday 4 February, William {{bought some}} rope {{at the local}} grocer's shop, and {{spent the rest of}} the day observing cases at the Sheriff Court from the public gallery. He was later {{reported}} to have listened attentively to the proceedings. On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him a newspaper that featured a woman's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look up any news of Jack the Ripper, at which Bury threw down the newspaper with a fright. That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in the morning to find his wife's body on the floor with a rope around her neck. Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> he would be arrested and accused of being Jack the Ripper.|$|E
5|$|In late 1558, Calvin {{became ill}} with a fever. Since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> he might die before {{completing}} the final {{revision of the}} Institutes, {{he forced himself to}} work. The final edition was greatly expanded to the extent that Calvin referred to it as a new work. The expansion from the 21 chapters of the previous edition to 80 was due to the extended treatment of existing material rather than the addition of new topics. Shortly after he recovered, he strained his voice while preaching, which brought on a violent fit of coughing. He burst a blood-vessel in his lungs, and his health steadily declined. He preached his final sermon in St. Pierre on 6February 1564. On 25April, he made his will, in which he left small sums to his family and to the collège. A few days later, the ministers of the church came to visit him, and he bade his final farewell, which was recorded in Discours d'adieu aux ministres. He recounted his life in Geneva, sometimes recalling bitterly some of the hardships he had suffered. Calvin died on 27May 1564 aged 54. At first his body lay in state, but since so many people came to see it, the reformers were afraid that they would be accused of fostering a new saint's cult. On the following day, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Cimetière des Rois. The exact location of the grave is unknown; a stone was added in the 19th century to mark a grave traditionally thought to be Calvin's.|$|E

25|$|Soon after, he {{contracted}} malaria. He sought {{treatment from}} a local doctor instead of army medical staff because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> the illness would give his detractors a further excuse to undermine him. This doctor gave him a large supply of the drug Atabrine, which can produce depression as a side-effect if taken in high dosages. Already depressed by the official response to his Abyssinian command, and sick with malaria, Wingate attempted suicide by stabbing himself in the neck. Only prompt action by another officer saved him.|$|E

25|$|The Mishna and Talmud (Avodah Zara 8a) {{describe}} a pagan festival called Saturna which occurs {{for eight days}} before the winter solstice. It is followed for eight days after the solstice with a festival called Kalenda culminating with the Kalends of January. The Talmud ascribes the origins of this festival to Adam, who saw that the days were getting shorter {{and thought it was}} punishment for his sin. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> the world was returning to the chaos and emptiness that existed before creation. He sat and fasted for eight days. Once he saw that the days were getting longer again he realized that this was the natural cycle of the world, so made eight days of celebration. The Talmud states that this festival was later turned into a pagan festival.|$|E

25|$|Stauning {{remained}} {{prime minister}} {{until his death}} in 1942, as head of a coalition cabinet encompassing all major political parties (the exceptions being the tiny Nazi party, and the Communist Party, which was outlawed in 1941 as discussed). Vilhelm Buhl replaced him briefly, only to be replaced by foreign minister Erik Scavenius, who had been the main link to the Nazi authorities throughout the war. Scavenius was a diplomat, not an elected politician, and had an elitist approach to government. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> emotional public opinion would destabilize his attempts to build a compromise between Danish sovereignty and the realities of German occupation. Scavenius felt strongly that he was Denmark's most ardent defender. After the war there was much recrimination over his stance, particularly from members of the active resistance, who felt that he had hindered the cause of resistance and threatened Denmark's national honour. He felt that these people were vain, seeking to build their own reputations or political careers through emotionalism.|$|E

The battle took almost a week and {{has been described as}} [...] "six of the most terrible days of battle in the whole Revolution". It consisted of house to house fighting, hand-to-hand combat, and no quarter given by either side. General Victoriano Huerta arrived in nearby Cuernavaca with 600 reinforcements, but decided not to come to the relief of Cuautla as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> the capital would revolt in his absence.

The quite distinguished Chief Rabbi of the British Empire at that time, Dr. Nathan Marcus Adler, was a relative. Adler's father had him written a letter of introduction in Hebrew, but nothing could have been farther from the rabbi's desires than to assist Yiddish-language theater. Nathan Marcus Adler viewed Yiddish as a [...] "jargon" [...] that existed at the expense of both liturgical Hebrew and the English necessary for upward mobility, and his Orthodox Judaism [...] "could not endure so much as a blessing given on stage, for such a blessing would be given in vain..."; further, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> the portrayals of Jews on stage would give aid and comfort to their enemies.|$|E

500|$|The book {{begins with}} Knight {{explaining}} {{how he came}} to meet Joseph Gorman, and then he tells Gorman's story which [...] "did not come in clear, precise, chronological order but I had to glean it from rambling and sometimes vague discussion". Gorman says that Albert Victor's mother, Princess Alexandra, introduced Walter Sickert to her son in the hope that Sickert would teach Albert Victor about art. Gorman claims that Albert Victor met one of Sickert's models, Annie Elizabeth Crook, a Catholic shop girl, at Sickert's studio at 15 Cleveland Street, London. They had an affair, he says, and married in a secret ceremony with Sickert and Annie's friend, Mary Jane Kelly, acting as witnesses. Gorman alleges that Albert Victor and Annie's daughter, Alice Margaret Crook, was born on 18April 1885, and that Albert Victor settled Annie and Alice into an apartment in Cleveland Street. In April 1888, Gorman continues, Queen Victoria and the British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury discovered Albert Victor's secret. Gorman accuses Salisbury of ordering a raid on the apartment because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> public knowledge of a potential Catholic heir to the throne would result in a revolution. Gorman claims that Albert Victor was placed in the custody of his family, while Annie was placed in the custody of Sir William Gull, who certified her insane; she spent the next 30 years drifting in and out of institutions before dying in 1920.|$|E

[...] His dissent in Korematsu expresses his belief that bringing those affected by military orders under the protection of the constitution would be a dangerous precedent and that the court should neither execute nor review such orders. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "emergency that justified the classification (in Korematsu) would eventually be forgotten, leaving the constitutionality of the classification as the lesson of the case."

On December 27, 2002, Clonaid's chief executive, Brigitte Boisselier, claimed that a baby clone, named Eve, was born. Media coverage of the claim sparked serious criticism and ethical debate that lasted more than a year. Florida attorney Bernard Siegel tried to appoint a special guardian for Eve and threatened to sue Clonaid, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> the child might be treated like a lab rat. [...] Siegel, who heard the company's actual name was not Clonaid, decided that the Clonaid project was a sham.
