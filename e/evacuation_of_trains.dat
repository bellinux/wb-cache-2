50|$|Compared {{to other}} modes of {{transport}}, rapid transit {{has a good}} safety record, with few accidents. Rail transport is subject to strict safety regulations, with requirements for procedure and maintenance to minimize risk. Head-on collisions are rare due to use of double track, and low operating speeds reduce the occurrence and severity of rear-end collisions and derailments. Fire {{is more of a}} danger underground, such as the King's Cross fire in London in November 1987, which killed 31 people. Systems are generally built to allow <b>evacuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> at many places throughout the system.|$|E
40|$|<b>Evacuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> in tunnels is {{currently}} {{taking place in}} diverse ways. One of the methods implies that passengers leave the train along the railways on elevated walkways. The knowledge {{about the impact of}} elevated walkways on the safety level is today very limited. As more and more elevated walkways are designed in rail tunnels, it is important that studies and evacuation trials are made to investigate how those affect the safety level of the evacuation. This master thesis’ project aims to investigate the relationship between low light conditions, people's behaviour and ability to evacuate a train on an elevated walkway. To investigate this, the core in the work consisted a practical evacuation trial which purpose was to study people’s movement on a raised walkway under different illumination levels: 200 lux, 5 lux and 1 lux. A total of 16 escape trials were performed as controlled evacuations on a simulated elevated walkway with the measures 1. 2 x 20 meters with a level difference down to the ground plane of 1. 24 meters. The result of the evacuation trial showed that the intensity of illumination {{played a significant role in}} both the movement speed, the person flow and the peoples distance to the edge. The peoples flow and speed did generally decrease during the partial trials performed during the weaker light intensities, 5 lux and 1 lux, compared to partial trials performed during 200 lux. A general result regarding the effect of light intensity on the people’s distance to the edge is that during the partial trials performed with the weaker light intensities, 5 lux and 1 lux, more people chose to go further from the edge. The conclusion of these results is that a minimum brightness in tunnels should be 1 lux, but a stronger illumination should be sought to increase the safety of the passengers in case of evacuation. Regarding the learning effect on the trial procedure, it can be seen from the results that the more trials carried out, the closer the edge the people went combined with an increased speed and flow. The people became comfortable in the environment and hesitated less, which generated a source of error in the result. A conclusion of the practical evacuation trial is that by conducting a trial in this type of environment, we were given the opportunity to study the problems as well as the complexity that an evacuation may imply. The experiment further provided valuable information and knowledge about the problems that may arise in an evacuation, both from a technical and behavioural perspective...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, human {{behavior}} in rail tunnel fires is explored. Descriptive knowledge is presented {{related to the}} <b>evacuation</b> <b>of</b> passenger <b>trains,</b> and the subsequent tunnel evacuation to a safe location. More specifically, a theoretical framework that can aid the understanding of {{human behavior}} is identified, and its applicability to rail tunnels is demonstrated. In addition, new empirical data on the flow rate capacity <b>of</b> <b>train</b> exits during <b>evacuation</b> in rail tunnels, {{as well as on}} walking speeds in smoke free and smoke filled rail tunnels, is presented. Finally, a number of technical installations that may facilitate orientation, movement and exit choice in rail tunnels are suggested. The findings are presented in relation to previously conducted empirical studies, and a discussion is also made on how the findings can be used in application and design...|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II, {{the railway}} {{junction}} and the adjacent air base were the target of several raids. On 20 July 1944, the first attack caused major damage on the passenger part of the station. Harm to passengers and damage to rolling stock was averted by the <b>evacuation</b> <b>of</b> four passenger <b>trains.</b> After intensive clearing and repair work train operations were recommenced shortly afterwards. The most devastating air raid was on 20 April 1945.|$|R
40|$|New {{generation}} of supervision systems in industry can achieve operation from display process variables to all automated control where human is just monitoring automaton. In railway specific industry, supervision is organised in switching zones and aims to be centralised in an Integrated Control Centre. Such centres implements integrated and computer based systems that perform train protection, train operation and supervision. Thus railway dispatchers using supervision have their tasks considerably simplified. Although considered today as not safety critical, railway supervision systems {{can contribute to}} safety in some scenarios where an appropriate decision of a supervision operator could notably reduce the severity of accidents. That is in particular the case for residual scenarios (intervention of maintenance teams on the tracks, manual operation <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> not protected by train protection system, coupling / uncoupling, emergency requiring the stop and the <b>evacuation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>train</b> [...] .) only covered by procedure, thus requiring a human intervention by a person supposed correctly informed {{on the state of}} the system, thanks to the data provided by the supervision syste...|$|R
40|$|Including {{in total}} 135 {{participants}} in the ages 19 – 69 years (recruited from the general public), an unannounced full-scale field evacuation experiment was performed in the Stockholm underground metro system on the night between October 17 and 18, 2013. The purpose was {{to collect data on}} the flow rate <b>of</b> people in <b>train</b> exits during the <b>evacuation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>train</b> in a tunnel and on the walking speed of people when moving long distances on an uneven surface in a tunnel, and to study exit choice and behaviour during an evacuation. Consequently, the experiment involved the <b>evacuation</b> <b>of</b> a rail car (a Bombardier C 20 train) in a tunnel as well as the subsequent <b>evacuation</b> <b>of</b> the tunnel itself; the latter meant that the participants either could evacuate to the closest station (~ 400 m) or to an available emergency exit (~ 200 m). Among other things, the experiment demonstrated that the averaged flow rates of people in the train exits varied between 0. 19 p/s and 0. 22 p/s (0. 14 – 0. 16 p/m s when considering the <b>train</b> exit width <b>of</b> 1. 4 m) and that the averaged walking speeds in the tunnel varied between 1. 1 m/s and 1. 2 m/s (no smoke present). Furthermore, all 135 participants found and used the available emergency exit, which had been equipped with a technical system consisting of a loudspeaker that broadcasted a combined alarm signal and a pre-recorded voice message...|$|R
40|$|An {{interview}} {{study was}} performed in order to reveal {{some of the problems}} associated with <b>evacuation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>train</b> inside a tunnel for senior citizens and people with disabilities, and to identify possible technical installations that would aid their <b>evacuation.</b> A total <b>of</b> 19 people took part in the study, in which it was demonstrated that senior citizens and people with disabilities require either a smaller height difference than 1. 4 meter between the train and tunnel floor, or a technical installation, e. g., an emergency ladder, {{if they are to be}} able to exit a train safely during an evacuation inside a tunnel. Almost all participants stated that one or more handles would aid them during an evacuation, and many would like to have a fixed ladder or steps that can be ejected when evacuation is necessary. Due to the fact that more and more senior citizens and people with disabilities will be using the underground transportation system, future research must include this population in both evacuation experiments and design studies aimed at improving conditions for evacuees. The results presented in the present paper can be used as qualitative guidance for these studies...|$|R

50|$|Tonghua, {{being the}} local {{transport}} hub, {{had a large}} refugees flux in 1945. First instance of violence (a Shosankoku incident) was reported 13 August 1945, when the train filled will civilian Japanese refugees was stopped at an elevated track near the tunnel entrance and the Japanese women were gang-raped by the locals after the train security guards were killed. The train was a by-catch to Chinese guerilla intercepting the preceding <b>evacuation</b> <b>train</b> <b>of</b> {{the family of the}} last Chinese Emperor (Puyi), most notably Empress Wanrong. The incident featured children being killed by throwing out of windows, over 100 Japanese women committing suicide by jumping from the cliff, and mob shooting anybody who tried to escape. The rest of passengers were rescued when the battalion of the Imperial Japanese Army, alerted by the single escaped girl, has arrived the next morning. Many of the survivors of the Shosankoku incident would become the inhabitants of the Tonghua refugee camp and will also later be victims of the Tonghua Incident.|$|R
