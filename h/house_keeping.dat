5|$|Stone {{hoped to}} earn {{most of her}} college {{expenses}} through teaching {{in one of the}} institute’s lower departments. But because of its policy against employing first-year students as teachers, the only work Stone could get other than teaching at district schools during the winter break was <b>house</b> <b>keeping</b> chores through the school’s manual labor program. For this she was paid three cents an hour—less than half what male students received for their work in the program. Among measures taken to reduce her expenses, Stone prepared her own meals in her dormitory room. In 1844 Stone was given a position teaching arithmetic in the Ladies Department, but again received reduced pay because of her sex.|$|E

[...] There were several towers aside from the keep; we know their names: Auditor's, Constable', Oxenford and Maiden's, but not their locations. Beautiful gardens were laid out.

2500|$|In the {{following}} year, Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the Boston University School of Oratory. During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home. At Boston University, Bell was [...] "swept up" [...] by the excitement engendered {{by the many}} scientists and inventors residing in the city. He continued his research in sound and endeavored {{to find a way}} to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation. While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding <b>house.</b> <b>Keeping</b> [...] "night owl" [...] hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment. Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover. Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches. Returning to Boston in fall 1873, Bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.|$|E

2500|$|It has {{sometimes}} been argued Japan would have surrendered if simply guaranteed the Emperor {{would be allowed to}} continue as formal head of state. However, Japanese diplomatic messages regarding a possible Soviet mediation—intercepted through Magic, and made available to Allied leaders—have been interpreted by some historians to mean, [...] "the dominant militarists insisted on preservation of the old militaristic order in Japan, the one in which they ruled." [...] On 18 and 20 July 1945, Ambassador Sato cabled to Foreign Minister Togo, strongly advocating that Japan accept an unconditional surrender provided that the U.S. preserved the imperial <b>house</b> (<b>keeping</b> the emperor). On 21 July, in response, Togo rejected the advice, saying that Japan would not accept an unconditional surrender under any circumstance. Togo then said that, [...] "Although it is apparent that there will be more casualties on both sides in case the war is prolonged, we will stand as united against the enemy if the enemy forcibly demands our unconditional surrender." [...] They also faced potential death sentences in trials for Japanese war crimes if they surrendered. | last=Rising | first= Gerry | date= 2001-11-08 | publisher= ArtVoice of Buffalo | accessdate= 2008-03-16 }} This was also what occurred in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and other tribunals.|$|E

[...] The idea for Chinatown is to provide more affordable housing to make it seem less gentrified. There are already a number of projects that have been worked on and are still being built.|$|R

5|$|Traditional Protestant historiography {{tended to}} stress the {{corruption}} and unpopularity of the late Medieval Scottish church, but more recent research has indicated {{the ways in which}} it met the spiritual needs of different social groups. Historians have discerned a decline of monastic life in this period, with many religious <b>houses</b> <b>keeping</b> smaller numbers of monks, and those remaining often abandoning communal living for a more individual and secular lifestyle. The rate of new monastic endowments from the nobility also declined in the fifteenth century. In contrast, the burghs saw the flourishing of mendicant orders of friars in the later fifteenth century, who, unlike the older monastic orders, placed an emphasis on preaching and ministering to the population. The order of Observant Friars were organised as a Scottish province from 1467 and the older Franciscans and the Dominicans were recognised as separate provinces in the 1480s.|$|R
