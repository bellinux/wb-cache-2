5|$|Beddard states <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> it {{contains}} little that is new, intending instead {{to give a}} clear overview of the subject. The main topics covered are camouflage, then called 'protective coloration'; mimicry; and sexual selection. Arguments for and against these aspects of animal coloration are intensively discussed in the book.|$|E
5|$|During his NBA career, Bradley {{used his}} fame {{on the court}} to explore social as well as {{political}} issues, meeting with journalists, government officials, academics, businesspeople, and social activists. He also worked as an assistant to the director of the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C., and as a teacher in the street academies of Harlem. In 1976, he also became an author by publishing Life on the Run. Using a 20-day stretch of time during one season as the main focus of the book, he chronicled his experiences in the NBA and the people he met along the way. He noted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> he had initially signed only a four-year contract, and that he was uncomfortable using his celebrity status to earn extra money endorsing products as other players did.|$|E
5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E

25|$|Farrar also {{posed for}} many of the {{photographs}} in their 1981 Eight Sabbats for Witches, which included material the authors claimed to be from the Alexandrian tradition's Book of Shadows. The Farrars, with the support of Doreen Valiente, argued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> even though the publishing of this material broke their oath of secrecy, it was justified by the need to correct misinformation.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the Book of Mormon {{have argued}} that there are words and phrases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> are anachronistic with archaeological findings. These relate to artifacts, animal, plant, or {{technology}} that critics believe {{did not exist in}} the Americas during the Book of Mormon time period (before 600 BC to about 400 AD). The list below summarizes a few of the anachronistic criticisms in the Book of Mormon, as well as perspectives and rebuttals by Mormon apologists.|$|E
25|$|Another common stylistic {{approach}} in his novels {{is the use}} of mixed genres, whereby elements of each are combined freely and interchangeably. Jack of Shadows and Changeling, for example, revolve around the tensions between the two worlds of magic and technology. Lord of Light, perhaps one of his most famous works, is written in the classic style of a mythic fantasy, while it is established early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> the story itself takes place on a colonized planet.|$|E

50|$|The English {{language}} was changing rapidly in Caxton's {{time and the}} works that he was given to print were {{in a variety of}} styles and dialects. Caxton was a technician rather than a writer, and he often faced dilemmas concerning language standardisation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> he printed. He wrote about this subject <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preface to his Eneydos. His successor Wynkyn de Worde faced similar problems.|$|R
25|$|In 2009, Dustin Diamond {{published}} an inside {{story of the}} show's cast and crew {{from his point of}} view, entitled Behind the Bell. The book paints an unflattering portrait of many of Diamond's colleagues and their alleged backstage behavior. Some of Diamond's claims have been refuted by colleagues and questioned by critics. Diamond also alleges <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> he had sex with 2,000 women, one of them being NBC's Vice President of children's programming, Linda Mancuso, who was 18 years his senior. Diamond later disclaimed responsibility for much of the book's content, blaming his ghostwriter for fabricating salacious stories.|$|E
25|$|In the children's book Cecil's Pride (2016), author Craig Hatkoff and {{his daughters}} sought {{to shed light}} on Cecil's life and how he lived prior to his death. He reached out to those who studied Cecil's pride at Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park and got into contact with Cecil's 'biographer', {{researcher}} Brent Stapelkamp. Stapelkamp had studied Cecil for over 9 years and had accumulated photographs that were used as illustrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> capture the complexities of the pride. The book highlights the relationship of Cecil and an unrelated male named Jericho who becomes co-leader with Cecil and then leader after Cecil's death.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of romance is sometimes sidestepped with plot devices in the spin-off media. In the 2001 BBC Books novel Father Time by Lance Parkin, the Doctor adopts an orphaned Gallifreyan-like alien called Miranda. It is implied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> Miranda {{is actually the}} daughter of the Doctor himself from the far future. Miranda returns in the novel Sometime Never... by Justin Richards, with her own daughter Zezanne. At that novel's end, a time-active being called Soul travels into the past accompanied by Zezanne, the two believing themselves to be the Doctor and Susan, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{authoritative}} {{manner in}} which NKS presents {{a vast number of}} examples and arguments has been criticized as leading the reader to believe that each of these ideas was original to Wolfram; in particular, one of the most substantial new technical results presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>that</b> the rule 110 cellular automaton is Turing complete, was not proven by Wolfram, but by his research assistant, Matthew Cook. However, the notes section {{at the end of his}} book acknowledges many of the discoveries made by these other scientists citing their names together with historical facts, although not in the form of a traditional bibliography section.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the absent footage from the film are the other major attacks by Sauron on various regions of Middle-earth, referenced only briefly in the main text of The Return of the King, and expanded upon in the Appendices; the invasion of Rohan by the Orcs of Moria, the attacks on Lothlórien and the Woodland Realm of Thranduil {{by the forces of}} Dol Guldur, and the attack on Dale and the Lonely Mountain by a force of Easterlings. These events are hinted at in a comment by Legolas (also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book)</b> <b>that</b> the other peoples of Middle Earth will are unlikely to ride to war in Gondor because war has already arrived in their own lands.|$|E
25|$|Lichtman argues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> Trump {{could face}} {{impeachment}} for reasons including: complicity of conspiracy with foreign governments, {{crimes against humanity}} for the U.S. neglecting global warming, and violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the constitution barring the president from taking personal monetary offerings from other governments. He provides the reader with an overview of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and links between Trump associates and Russian officials, asserting such ties {{could be used in}} efforts to impeach President Trump. He uses the Watergate scandal as the backdrop to compare Trump's reactions to criticism with those of Richard Nixon during Nixon's impeachment process. The author discusses assertions of sexual misconduct against Trump, and delves into some of the his legal affairs stemming from them. Lichtman places the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recordings within a larger context of public degradation of women.|$|E

25|$|A book {{attributed}} to Ardashir about {{the bases of}} government is written in an Arabic translation in the book Nahayat-ol Aarab and the warriors (Asawereh), writers (Kottab), Judges (Gozat), invasion (Bo'uth va Thoghur), accepting ambassadors (Fi Godum-el Vofud alayhe men gabl-e Moluk) constructing cities (Bana-ol Modon), his strategy for noble houses (Tadbirohu fi Ahl-e Boyutat-el Sharaf), complaint (Mazalem) and development of lands (Tadbirohu Emarat-al Arzain) are discussed in it. The Persian translation of that book is written in the translation of Nahayat-ol Aarab called Tajarob-ol Omam and also in Ferdowsi's Shahnameh. It is not known whether the book is translated directly from Middle Persian or not. Grinaski believes that an Arabic-writing author had assembled it from different places. In order to prove his opinion, he mentions evidence that shows the influence of Islamic principles in it, for instance the writing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>that</b> one fifth of the war plunder is for the shah. However, since the text is written in Shahnameh, it probably existed in Khwaday-Namag too and some matters aligning with Islamic principles were added {{to it in the}} translation.|$|E
