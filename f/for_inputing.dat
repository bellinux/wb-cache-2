In 1962 the Benesh Institute of Choreology was established. In 1968 some dances of the Australian Aboriginal dancers of Northern Territory were notated {{by a group of}} anthropology students. Joan and Rudolf also wrote Reading Dance: The Birth of Choreology. The Royal Academy of Dance, in conjunction with the University of Surrey, produced software in the 1990s <b>for</b> <b>inputing</b> the notation and printing it out.|$|E
50|$|External {{storage units}} were {{available}} for the 405x series computers. The 4924 was an external version of the internal DC300 tape drive. The 4907 used single or dual Shugart 851R 8 inch floppy drives with 64 kB floppies and the larger, 2-drawer filing cabinet sized, 4909 storage unit used a CDC 96 megabyte hard drive with the first 16 megabytes {{in the form of}} a removable disc-pack. Two sizes of the 4956 graphics tablet offered a slow process <b>for</b> <b>inputing</b> from paper drawings. The 4952 joystick was used for graphics input.|$|E

2500|$|Specificity of {{processing}} describes the increased recall {{value of a}} stimulus when presented in the method with which it was <b>inputed.</b> <b>For</b> example, auditory stimuli (spoken words and sounds) have the highest recall value when spoken, and visual stimuli have the highest recall value when a subject is presented with images. [...] In writing tasks, words are recalled most effectively with semantic cues (asking for words with a particular meaning) if they are encoded semantically (self-generated by the subject as being related to a particular meaning). Words are recalled most effectively with data-driven cues (word completion) if they are read, rather than generated by a subject.|$|R
30|$|The most {{straightforward}} {{school of}} feature extraction {{is to take}} the entire face as a single feature vector, which is called the global approach [12]. In this approach, the entire face is stored in the database. In the feature matching stage, the target face is compared with faces in database using statistical classification functions [9]. Opposed to the global approach, the component based approach focuses on the local facial characteristics such as nose and eyes. It uses graph operators to extract the nose and eyes part and store these local features in the database. When a target face is <b>inputed</b> <b>for</b> recognition, the component based approach first extract the corresponding parts from the target faces and then searching the matched set of parts from the feature database [13]. There are hybrid approaches that combine the features used by the global approaches and the local approaches. With more computational cost, the hybrid approach could achieve better recognition accuracy [14].|$|R

Supervisor's e-mail address: richta@ksi. mff. cuni. cz Abstract: The aim of {{my master}} thesis {{is to create}} a tool for {{dynamical}} administration of entities and modules. Common application consists of modules operating with certain data. The user experience shows the need of changing the data structure or changing and adding the modules. Propose a solution which enables such dynamical administration and demonstrate it on the prototype. This system should generate fields <b>for</b> <b>inputing,</b> editing or deleting new entries automatically, also including control of individual attributes. At the same time the system considers also losing saved data and the possibility of data transformation to the new version of the system. Keywords: entity, maintenance, module, dat...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Converting a {{biochemical}} reaction {{network to}} a set of kinetic rate equations is tedious and error prone. We describe known interface paradigms <b>for</b> <b>inputing</b> models of intracellular regulatory networks: graphical layout (diagrams), wizards, scripting languages, and direct entry of chemical equations. We present the JigCell Model Builder, which allows users to define models as a set of reaction equations using a spreadsheet (an example of direct entry of equations) and outputs model definitions in the Systems Biology Markup Language, Level 2. We present the results of two usability studies. The spreadsheet paradigm demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing the number of errors made by modelers when compared to hand conversion of a wiring diagram to differential equations. A comparison of representatives of the four interface paradigms for a simple model of the cell cycle was conducted which measured time, mouse clicks, and keystrokes to enter the model, and the number of screens needed to view the contents of the model. All four paradigms had similar data entry times. The spreadsheet and scripting language approaches require significantly fewer screens to view the models than do the wizard or graphical layout approaches. Index Terms—Biochemical reaction networks, bioinformatics, modeling, user interface paradigms. ...|$|E
500|$|Digital Dimension {{took charge}} of the visual effects of the film. CG {{supervisor}} Jason Crosby pointed out that their studio was mainly selected for the highway sequence after the crew realized real logs only bounced about an inch off the road when dropped from a logging truck. [...] "They were concerned about how they would make the shot happen, not knowing if CG would work. The timing was great because we had just finished a test shot of our CG logs bouncing on the freeway. We sent a tape to Vancouver and after seeing it the crew was convinced that any of the log shots could be done with CG," [...] Crosby indicated. [...] "It began with R on the log dynamics. Scripts were written to help manage the dynamic simulations with real world numbers for gravity, density, etc. The results were remarkably similar to the original logs shot in Vancouver, a testament to the accuracy of the software and the data we had collected, however the logs still lacked the 'jumping through windshields killer instinct' we were looking for. By tweaking the parameters, we coaxed the logs into a much livelier role." [...] Senior technical director James Coulter added creative 3D tracking on shots with fast pans, motion blur, and filters such as dust, mist, slabs of bark, broken chains, and other debris. Digital artist Edmund Kozin manipulated high resolution photos which were carefully stitched together to achieve realistic texture amongst the 22 CG logs of the film. Hair shaders were also <b>inputed</b> <b>for</b> splintering and frayed wood looks for the logs. Physics such as speed and height of the logging truck, length and width of the logs, type of wood and density of a Douglas-fir were also considered.|$|R
40|$|The Space Management System is an {{continuing}} {{project at the}} Aerospace Corporation. The project started when the Facilities requested that I determine the feasibility of acquiring a Facilities Management software package to manage the existing Aerospace building building space. After several meetings with the Facilities Department, I wrote a requirements document that described the optimal Facilites Management System for Aerospace. I then added to the document, a comparision of the available software packages vs the requirements. The requirements document is included as appendix A. Because none of the software packages met all of the basic requirements, {{it was agreed that}} I would design and implement a Space Management System in-house. The Design Specifications for the system have been included as appendix B. The User's Manual, which describes the features and use of the system, has been included as appendix C. The system is used primarily to display the Personnel information associated with Facilities floor plans. The system also provides the tools <b>for</b> <b>inputing</b> the Facilities floor plans into a graphics data base, modifying the floor plans as changes occur, and generating Celcomp plots of the floor plans with or without the Personnel information...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the first phase of a research project on the application of spatial modelling techniques to the process of planning and executing the construction of a nuclear power plant. A computer modelling technique, based on sets of polyhedra and spatial set operations, was developed and applied to modelling the components of a nuclear power plant. The objectives of the modelling are: To store and retrieve information about the various systems in the facility, to produce drawings of those systems from any angle in differing amounts of detail, to aid in the search for interference among the parts of the plant by identifying those elements that occupy the same space or are too close to each other, to calculate information such as surface area, length, and volume of selected elements of the plant, and to aid in finding the optimum construction sequence by simulating the construction of selected areas of the plant. Computer techniques are described <b>for</b> <b>inputing</b> information by digitizing directly from engineering drawings, for editing the spatial model, for management of the spatial and non-spatial data, and for graphic output from the model. The software is implemented on the University central time-sharing computer system and on a mini-computer system in the Architectural Research Laboratory...|$|E
