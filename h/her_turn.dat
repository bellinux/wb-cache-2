5|$|Ikoma {{became a}} gunnery {{training}} ship in <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> in 1918 and her armament was augmented {{by a pair}} of 8cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft (AA) guns the following year. She was re-rated back to first-class cruiser in 1921 and disarmed in 1922 to fulfill the requirements of the Washington Naval Treaty. The ship was broken up in November 1924.|$|E
5|$|Litras {{then took}} <b>her</b> <b>turn.</b> She earned three spins {{in the second}} {{question}} round, but since she had received passed spins she was required to take them first. She also hit a Whammy on her first spin, which reduced her score to zero. The three remaining spins that Larson had passed her were added to her earned spins, giving her a total of six. Litras picked up $9,385 in cash and prizes in five total spins, but because she managed to hit spaces with extra spins, she only used three.|$|E
5|$|A {{principal}} cast of six actors received star billing in the show's first season. Poehler {{portrayed the}} lead character, Leslie Knope, the naive but well-meaning, eager-to-please {{deputy director of}} the parks and recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. Also among the cast were Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford, a sarcastic parks department employee, and Rashida Jones as Ann Perkins, a nurse who befriends Leslie and tries to help <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> a giant construction pit into a park. Daniels and Schur intended to cast Ansari and Jones (who previously appeared in The Office as Karen Filippelli) from the series' earliest stages of development, but the ultimate Parks and Recreation concept did not coalesce until they learned Poehler would be available to star. After her recruitment, the general concept of the series was established and the script for the pilot episode was written.|$|E

5|$|Superb and Temeraire {{returned}} home {{the following month}} after supporting Allied operations in the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea and were placed into reserve. Later that year, Temeraire was converted into a cadet training ship and continued on that duty until early 1921 when she was paid off. In the meantime Superb relieved Bellerophon as a gunnery training ship in late 1919 and the latter was reduced to reserve. Superb was relieved in <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> {{at the end of}} 1919 and was paid off in early 1920. The ship was used for gunnery trials beginning {{at the end of the}} year and was used as a target ship during 1922 before being sold, the last of the sisters still in existence as Temeraire and Bellerophon had been sold for scrap in late 1921.|$|E
5|$|The crew of Sense and Sensibility {{garnered}} several award {{nominations for}} their work on the drama. At the 14th Shanghai Television Festival, the series was nominated for Magnolia Award for Best Television Film or Miniseries, Alexander won the Best Television Film Director award, while Morahan won Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Film for <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> as Elinor Dashwood.

Cinematographer Sean Bobbitt was also nominated for an Emmy Award in the Cinematography for a Miniseries, Movie or Special category.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of the}} Book of Common Prayer {{became law}} in 1549. King Edward's half-sister, Mary Tudor, de facto had licence to {{continue}} hearing mass in private. So {{soon as he was}} in power, Dudley put pressure on her to stop her from allowing her entire household and flocks of visitors to attend. Mary, who in <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> did not tolerate the Book of Common Prayer in any of her residences, was not prepared to make any concessions. She planned to flee the country but then could not make up her mind in the last minute. Mary denied Edward's personal interest in the issue and entirely blamed John Dudley for her troubles. After a meeting with King and Council, in which she was told that what mattered was not her faith but her disobedience to the law, she sent the Imperial ambassador de Scheyfye to threaten war on England. The English government could not swallow a war threat from an ambassador who had stepped out of his commission, {{but at the same time}} would not risk all-important commercial ties with the Habsburg Netherlands, so an embassy was sent to Brussels and some of Mary's household officers were arrested. On his next visit to the Council, de Scheyfye was informed by the Earl of Warwick that the King of England had as much authority at 14 as he had at 40—Dudley was alluding to Mary's refusal to accept Edward's demands on grounds of his young age. In the end a silent compromise came into effect: Mary continued to hear mass in a more private manner, while augmenting her landed property by exchanges with the Crown.|$|E

Thomas fought on the French side, at the Battle of Bouvines on 27 July 1214.|$|E
25|$|Nefertiti then follows Smenkhkare as coregent for a time, {{using the}} name Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten. Dodson concludes that Nefertiti {{was the mother of}} Tutankhaten, so after Akhenaten dies she {{continues}} as regent/coregent to Tutankhaten. Dodson proposes that in that role, Neferneferuaten helped guide the reformation {{in the early years of}} Tutankhaten and conjectures that <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> around is the result of her 'rapid adjustment to political reality'. To support the Nefertiti-Tutankhamun coregency, he cites jar handles found bearing her cartouche and others bearing those of Tutankhaten found in Northern Sinai.|$|E

Other members of this group include Angeline Quinto, Klarisse de Guzman, and Jonalyn Viray. There were speculations that the individual members of the group tried to outshine each other. Amon stated in an interview that ASAP assigned them songs to sing and that the group worked together for the various song numbers. She further clarified that when it was <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> she would give her all, but during the time the group merged voices they should blend together.|$|E
25|$|Empress Mentewab was crowned co-ruler {{upon the}} {{succession}} of her son (a first for a woman in Ethiopia) in 1730, and held unprecedented power over government during his reign. Her attempt to continue in this role {{following the death of}} her son 1755 led her into conflict with Wubit (Welete Bersabe), his widow, who believed that it was <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> to preside at the court of her own son Iyoas. The conflict between these two queens led to Mentewab summoning her Kwaran relatives and their forces to Gondar to support her. Wubit responded by summoning her own Oromo relatives and their considerable forces from Yejju.|$|E
25|$|Childers {{returned}} to London {{with his wife}} and resumed his position in the House of Commons. His reputation as an influential author gave the couple access to the political establishment, which Molly relished, {{but at the same time}} she set to work to rid Childers of his already faltering imperialism. In <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> Molly developed a strong admiration for Britain, its institutions and, as she then saw it, its willingness to go to war in the interests of smaller nations against the great. Over the next seven years they lived comfortably in their rented flat in Chelsea, supported by Childers's salary—he had received promotion to the position of parliamentary Clerk of Petitions in 1903—his continuing writings and, not least, generous benefactions from Dr Osgood.|$|E

25|$|While often formal, Seymour hides {{a twisted}} desire to save Spira by {{becoming}} Sin and destroying the world. This resulted from his father's treatment {{who had his}} wife and son exiled to the island of Baaj since Seymour was considered an abomination by the Guados. Afterwards, Seymour's mother gave her life in the Baaj Temple to become the fayth of the aeon Anima, believing that by sacrificing herself for Spira's temporary peace against Sin, her son will be accepted by Spira's people. At eighteen years of age, Seymour's exile was revoked and he soon killed Jyscal and took his position. He asks summoner Yuna to marry him, seemingly to further unite Spira, as they both have mixed parentage, being the offspring of a human and another race. When Yuna's guardians learn of Seymour's motives, they stand against him and kill him. Seymour's spirit is able to remain in the living world and become an unsent. Seymour later reveals his plans for Yuna – to have <b>her</b> <b>turn</b> him into the next Sin. His pyreflies are later absorbed by Sin. There, Seymour begins seeking a means to control the creature from within. During this process, he is confronted a final time by Yuna and her guardians, who manage to break their way inside the creature's body. However, he is defeated and is sent to the Farplane by Yuna.|$|E
